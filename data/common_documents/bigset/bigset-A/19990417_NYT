PISTONS DEFLATE KNICKS, 80-71 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ This was so close to being a revival for
Allan Houston. He was about ready to raise his hands and say, Amen,
in the Palace where his demons live. He was almost ready to lead
his teammates out of the eternal problems that have haunted them
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Pistons stuck the voodoo pins into Houston and the
Knicks and their playoff standing. What looked to be a Knick
celebration turned into the kind of dejection that has etched the
face of this team all year. Once again, the Knicks unraveled in the
fourth quarter beneath a flurry of turnovers, defensive blunders
and frazzled shot selection to lose to the Pistons, 80-71, Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With just 10 games left, the Knicks went from potentially tying
the Pistons for the sixth spot in the playoffs to dropping out of
the picture and into ninth place in the Eastern Conference
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't blow our intensity, we blew the game,'' said a
frustrated coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``It's hard to put into words. But
there is a certain amount of pride you have to take in how you
finish games. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks vanished in this game with Houston down the stretch.
After scoring 17 first-half points on 6-for-10 shooting, he
finished with 23 on 9-for-18. Even more devastating was the
3-for-13 effort from the field by Latrell Sprewell, who was coming
off a 5-for-18 performance in a loss to the Wizards on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were part of the Knicks' fourth-quarter debacle in
which they scored just 10 points, had 7 turnovers and shot 5 for
16. After the Knicks had been leading by 9 points with 9 minutes
left, Grant Hill gave the Pistons the lead on a driving layup to
cap a 14-4 run. Over the next two minutes, the Knicks turned the
ball over four times, including once by Houston with one minute
left. Just before that play, Sprewell got sucked inside on the
penetration of Hill. Hill fired the ball out to Jud Buechler, who
was wide open to hit a 3-pointer with 1 minute 5 seconds left in
the game to give the Pistons a 73-69 lead that left the Knicks
deflated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bad play,'' Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make plays down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the injured Patrick Ewing for the second straight night,
Houston knew he had to deliver. Once he slumped, the team slumped
with him, and the Knicks scored just 24 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's not what you do at the beginning of a game but
the end,'' Houston said. ``It would have been better to do it in
the second half. We just stopped attacking. We couldn't even get
our shots up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a 10-point lead late in the third quarter, but it
was shaved to 4 points, 65-61, with 7:25 left in the game. The
Pistons cut the Knicks' lead to 69-68 after a runner by Joe Dumars
with four minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons took the lead when Hill drove by Larry Johnson for a
layup with 2:23 left in the game. On the Knicks' next possession,
Charlie Ward missed a 3-pointer, and the loose ball came to
Johnson, who was stripped by Hill under the basket with 1:55
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson made a steal only to turn the ball over, the
Pistons came up with Buechler's big shot to help decide the game.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, this had seemed like Houston's night of redemption.
Houston finally found some gumption and stood up to the ghosts that
had left him with a mental block against his old team. Until Friday
night, he had been unsettled by a city of people who still feel he
betrayed them by leaving for New York three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine times he had faced the Pistons, Houston had vanished
in their presence and shot just 30 percent from the floor and 26
percent from 3-point range. He had never scored more than 12 points
against Detroit. This time, he was not backing down and scored 17
points on 6-of-10 shooting from the field to give the Knicks a
47-43 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks took that momentum into the locker room and out on
the floor to begin the third quarter. Relying on defensive
pressure, the Knicks held the Pistons to 1 for 8 in the first six
minutes of the third and took a 52-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That lead grew when Houston delivered a bullet pass to an open
Marcus Camby underneath the basket for an easy dunk to give the
Knicks a 57-47 edge with 3:50 left in the third quarter. But
Houston suddenly stepped back as the action went on without him. He
did not score in the third and turned the ball over in a sloppy
three minutes to end the quarter with the Pistons within striking
distance, 61-55.
</P>
<P>
   Houston gave the Knicks a 47-43 lead after scoring 17 points in
the first half. For once, he shrugged off the fans' boos and took
on a look of determination that has been missing this year.
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't last.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   PATRICK EWING missed his second straight game with a sore left
Achilles' tendon. During pre-game warm-ups, Ewing took some jump
shots before deciding he could not play. In March. Ewing missed six
games with the same injury. &QL;

 &HT;    Firefighters lament what went unsaved
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The blazes burned more than 2,400 acres,
yet hundreds of homes went unscathed. But the sooty, sweaty,
dazed-looking firefighters recuperating in the lunch room at St.
Lucie West Middle School Friday couldn't banish from their minds
one painful fact: 48 homes no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very depressing,'' Division of Forestry firefighter Eric
Potter said after eating lunch with a group of his fellow,
gray-faced workers. ``You think about the families in situations
like this, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and others ``only had about two or three hours'' of
sleep Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Worn down by the grind of the heat and toil of blaze-battling
that, for some, stretched on for as long as 23 hours, firefighters
sat together and took little solace in the houses that still stood
or the reprieve they got in the recovery room. Some just sat alone
silently.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County firefighter J. P. Smith said he was ``just
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trained firemen and when you're out there seeing all the
houses go up and there's nothing you can do, you really feel bad
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the middle school were doing as much as they could do
make matters better for the firefighters, who showed up to the
cafeteria in waves after emerging from the charred woods and
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Smith, who wore a white T-shirt dark with ash and soot,
said he'd been taking food and drinks to firefighters for nearly a
day after hearing about the blazes on the radio as he drove home
from work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm not going home, I'm going out to help,' '' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   Publix, Winn-Dixie, Food Lion, and a variety of other businesses
and individuals donated water, soda, pastries, and other
refreshments for the firefighters, said Kathy McGinn, the food and
nutrition services director for the St. Lucie County schools.
</P>
<P>
   One boy brought in a big bag of beef jerky, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went like hotcakes, too,'' McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the cafeteria, Charlotte Bowes had a board set up and
gave free massages to any firefighter who asked. Bowes, who runs a
business called Massage in Minutes, said she does that kind of
thing all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteer,'' she said. ``Whenever I hear it on the (police)
scanner or on TV, I go.''

PROSECUTOR FREES MAN HELD IN DEATH OF ORANGE POLICEWOMAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six days after they charged a man with murdering an Orange,
N.J., policewoman, the authorities let him go Friday night, saying
that he could not have been at the scene of the shooting when it
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Prosecutor Patricia Hurt, who released the man,
Terrance Everett, refused to say if there was another suspect in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt also refused to say where she thought Everett had been
around 8:30 p.m. on April 8, when Officer Joyce Anne Carnegie was
shot. Everett had pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of
murder, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concluded that Everett is not the person who committed
this crime,'' Ms. Hurt said. ``It is my responsibility to see that
justice prevails, and it would be unjust to detain Everett now when
it would have been impossible for him to have been at the scene.''
She also acknowledged that he had passed a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's lawyers have said that he was eating with his family
at a fast-food restaurant 10 blocks from the shooting when Carnegie
was killed. After his release Friday night, Everett, 24, of
neighboring East Orange, was driven away from the Essex County
Courts building in his lawyer's black sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's terse announcement capped a week of baffling and
unsettling developments in the investigation into the death of
Carnegie, who was shot in the head and abdomen when she stopped her
car to question a robbery suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested Everett at the home he shares with his
mother on Saturday, two days after the shooting, and said that he
was the killer. But on Sunday, three more people were arrested as
part of the investigation, and one of them died in the custody of
the Orange police; his family said he was beaten.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Everett, who was being held in lieu of $1 million
bail, appeared in court with bruises on his face that his lawyers
said had been inflicted after his arrest. On Tuesday, television
newscasts reported that Everett had passed a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   As some law enforcement officials quietly opined that the
authorities had the wrong man and Ms. Hurt retreated behind a wall
of no-comments, the chief assistant prosecutor, Patrick Toscano,
resigned abruptly on Wednesday. Toscano had professional
differences with Ms. Hurt over the handling of this and other
cases, a county official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   After his release last night, Everett, who had appeared fearful
and confused at his court appearance on Monday, told News 12 New
Jersey, a cable news station, that he did not know why he had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt said last night that witnesses to the three robberies
Carnegie was investigating and ``someone who allegedly witnessed
the shooting'' all identified Everett, whose mug shot was on file
because he has a police record, as the man they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, why me, of all the baldheaded people with
goatees? That was just hard for me to understand,'' Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Everett's lawyers, Raymond Hamlin, said Friday night that
his client was ``relieved'' and that he planned to meet with him
Saturday to figure out his next move. When asked if he planned to
sue the authorities for false arrest, Hamlin replied, ``That
prospect certainly exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin and Ronald Hunt, Everett's other lawyer, had maintained
from the start that their client had an alibi. The lawyers filed
papers to get both the results of the lie-detector test and
surveillance videos and receipts from a Wendy's restaurant where
Everett said he had eaten at the time of the shooting. The
Star-Ledger of Newark quoted the restaurant's manager Friday as
saying that Everett had been there while the crime was occurring.
The manager also said that he had turned over the receipts and the
security videotape to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Where the investigation into Officer Carnegie's murder goes now
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to various law enforcement officials, Officer
Carnegie, 38, a four-year veteran of the force, she stopped a blue
1986 Honda Accord near an overpass to Interstate 280, about 8:30
p.m. on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was wearing a black leather jacket that fit the
description of one worn by a suspect in two armed street muggings,
which had occurred a few blocks away minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Everett and the man who died in custody, Earl
Faison, the authorities arrested a man named James Coker on drug
charges on Sunday in what they said was part of the investigation
into the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Essex County Sheriff, Armando Fontoura on Friday night refused
to link Coker with the killing and said he had simply been arrested
on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Fontoura maintained that while Everett turned out to have been
unconnected to the murder, the authorities had acted in good faith.
 &UR;  &LR; ``That arrest was a lawful, proper arrest,'' he said. ``It's not
the first time we've arrested the wrong person, and I've been in
law enforcement for 35 years. It's happened before, it'll happen
again.''

WHIDBEY NAVAL AIR STATION EXPERIENCING SHORTAGE OF EA-6B PROWLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Last week a television crew at Whidbey Island Naval
Air Station went out to the aircraft ramp for video of planes
taking off and landing, normally an easy shot, given the traffic at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there weren't any planes. Traffic was light on
Whidbey's increasingly empty flight line, a scene that has become
increasingly common as squadron after squadron deploys for combat
in the Balkans or the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Spreading U.S. forces so thin is a point of concern for national
security experts who warn that the downsized military can no longer
sustain wars on several fronts. The sudden scarcity of Navy EA-6B
Prowlers at Whidbey Island is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy stations all but one of its 15 Prowler
electronic-warfare squadrons at Whidbey, located about 50 miles
north of Seattle. Seven of the squadrons are gone, far more than
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Five of them are in combat, and NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark
has asked for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does, to some significant extent, compromise our ability
to fight two major theater wars, like Desert Storm,'' says Andrew
Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for Strategy and
Budgeting, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   America is running out of the planes, which cost $60 million
apiece. And if something else breaks out on the globe _ say in Iraq
or Korea _ the Prowlers will be among the first to get the call.
The commander of all Navy electronic-warfare units declined a
request for comment on the increasing demand for his planes. But if
Clark gets his way and more Prowlers are sent to the Balkans, there
may not be enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this from a national security standpoint, the
U.S. is supposed to be able to fight two wars and a major
contingency (regional conflict) at once,'' says Richard Bloom, a
national security expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Daytona Beach, Fla. ``Look at us now _ we've got one contingency
going and we're maxed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Prowlers are essential to the nation's air war plans. The planes
with their four crewmen protect other, faster aircraft by jamming
enemy radar with energy pulses and missiles that home in on active
radar sites.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their high cost, there are relatively few Prowlers.
The Navy has about 100, the Marines about 24, usually organized in
squadrons of three to six planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has four squadrons, two now deployed in support
of the Kosovo airstrikes and a third squadron split between Turkey
_ where it is supporting the northern no-fly zone over Iraq _ and
Italy, where it flies in support of the Yugoslavian strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Marine Prowler squadron just returned from a
six-month tour in Japan. The Marine Corps has about seven Prowlers
available for what is known as standoff jamming, which involves
hanging back from the battlefield and covering a large area with
electronic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very embarrassing,'' said Glen Buchan, a senior
defense analyst with the Rand Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., think
tank that often consults with the military. ``It's not like it
slipped through the cracks. People knowledgeable about this have
been screaming for years that this was going to happen. But there's
been a vacuum. While people were messing around, the world passed
us by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force once had its own standoff jamming planes, the
EF-111 Raven, but retired them in the early 1990s. The brunt of
standoff jamming then fell on the Prowlers.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the Air Force deployed 24 of its jamming
aircraft, the F-16CJ, to Italy from Shaw Air Force Base in South
Carolina to help in the Kosovo airstrikes. However the Air Force
plane is a converted fighter, not built from the ground-up as a
jamming aircraft, and doesn't offer the protection a Prowler does.
</P>
<P>
   To provide that better protection, the military has stripped
assets from the Persian Gulf to cover the air war in Yugoslavia.
But that has had its own effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be less aggressive there in getting them to turn on
their radars so we can go and kill them,'' Buchan says of the Iraq
situation. ``It's like we've had to say `Unless you do something
really bad, we're going to be less aggressive about trying to kill
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clark continues to request more long-range Tomahawk
cruise missiles, AWACS planes and Prowlers. To satisfy Clark's
request, the Pentagon may have to take equipment and crews from
other areas, such as the Persian Gulf or the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we can't fight two major wars,'' Buchan says. ``This
is just emblematic of the major problems we have with other assets
as well. We're just spread too thin.''

3 SHOT IN CROWDED BROOKLYN CINEMA; POLICE CITE GANG TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three men were shot and ly wounded in a crowded movie
theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on Friday night as gunfire erupted
apparently over gang rivalries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which occurred around 10 p.m., 15 minutes into an
opening-night screening of the new Eddie Murphy movie ``Life,''
sent hundreds patrons flooding out of the Kenmore Theater onto
Church Avenue outside, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of victims were in surgery at Kings County Hospital Center
on Friday night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who were in the lobby at the time of the shootings said
that they believed they were gang related and that audience members
were shouting out ``Crips'' and ``Bloods'' just before the movie
started.
</P>
<P>
   A senior officer at the scene agreed that gangs seemed to be
tied to the shootings but that beyond that it was difficult to say
what prompted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even sure if the three people shot were on the same
team, so to speak, because the theater was so dark,'' the officer
said. The officer said the investigation was hampered by the fact
that most of the witnesses ran out.

COWBOYS FACE DIFFICULT DECISION ON FIRST-ROUND PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A somber mood hung over the Cowboys' Valley
Ranch training complex on the eve of the 1999 NFL draft in the wake
of the news that star defensive tackle Leon Lett violated the NFL's
substance-abuse policy and faces an indefinite ban from the league.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who is not commenting on
the Lett issue because of league confidentiality rules, huddled
behind closed doors for most of the day with other team officials
outlining plans for today's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also worked on a contract with 6-foot-3, 250-pound
free-agent linebacker Quentin Coryatt. The two sides were close to
a deal last night and could have it done before the draft begins,
Coryatt's agent, Steve Zucker, said.
</P>
<P>
   However, topping the team's list of concerns was the decision
regarding the 22nd pick _ one of eight selections the Cowboys have
in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are focusing on Louisiana Tech receiver Troy Edwards
(5-9, 190 pounds) and Louisiana State defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland (6-foot, 299), and will have a team representative with
both players during today's draft. If neither is available, then
Saginaw Valley State defensive end Lamar King (6-3, 299) is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland appears to be at the top of the Cowboys' wish list.
According to a league source, the Cowboys have been making a hard
push to find a way to get McFarland, who is considered the best
defensive tackle in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that McFarland might be there when the Cowboys
pick at No. 22. A draft-day trade, however, also is a possibility.
Jones, who has made a deal in the first round in four of the past
five drafts, has made it clear to teams around the league that the
Cowboys are willing to listen to trade offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make a deliberate effort to let other teams know that
want to talk and to be sure to pick up the phone if they've got a
trade in mind, and we will do the same,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are also high on the speedy Edwards, who led NCAA
Division I in receptions last season and is also considered to be
the best runner with the ball among all draft prospects, including
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Drafting Edwards might indicate that Cowboys officials quietly
believe that Lett's situation might not be as bad as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Lett is enrolled in stage three of the NFL's substance-abuse
program and has been suspended twice previously _ the last being
for the final three games of the 1996 season and the first 13 games
of 1997. As a part of the program, Lett is tested up to 10 times
per month.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello, citing league rules, declined to
comment on Lett's recovery program. However, he said that when a
player flunks a drug test while enrolled in stage three of the
program that he is subject to a indefinite suspension of at least a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys consultant Calvin Hill, who oversees the team's
behavioral department, disputed Aiello's statement. He said the
league's drug program doesn't call for a definitive ban when a
player slips up a second time while enrolled in stage three.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the first time a player is put in stage three, a
yearlong suspension is mandatory. But he said the second time, the
suspension is indefinite.
</P>
<P>
   Precedent was set in 1997 when former Cowboys cornerback Clayton
Holmes, who signed with the Miami Dolphins after a yearlong
suspension, flunked a second test while enrolled in stage three.
Holmes' suspension was six games.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the ban is determined by NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Lett was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Times'' reported in Friday's editions that Lett
is appealing his failed test and that it is currently under review
by Tagliabue. Lett's agent, Jim Steiner, said: ``There is no appeal
going on.'
</P>
<P>
   If Lett is suspended, his salary _ $2 million for the 1999
season _ will not count against the salary cap during his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Lett was the Cowboys' best defensive lineman last season when he
recorded 51 tackles, four sacks, 20 quarterback pressures and a
team-high seven tackles for losses. His presence was considered a
big reason the Cowboys' run defense improved from 24th in the
league when he missed 13 games in 1997 to 12th in 1998.

WIFE OF '60s SINGER FACES FINE, JAIL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ The wife of '60s teen idol Frankie Valli was
found guilty Friday of slapping the owner of a tony rural
restaurant during a brawl that erupted after crooner Frankie Avalon
complained about high menu prices.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Valli, a 39-year-old mother of three, faces a possible
$1,000 fine and as much as six months in jail for her conviction on
misdemeanor battery. Randy and Frankie Valli, along with Avalon and
his wife, Kay, had testified that restaurateur Sandra ``Alex''
Sofsky was the aggressor in the Oct. 7 fracas, but jurors
apparently rejected their story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury was able to hear all the evidence and they came to
the right decision,'' Deputy District Attorney John Lonergan said
after the hearing. ``In a lot of trials, they try to demonize the
victim. But we had numerous witnesses _ eight witnesses _ to offer
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant and numerous other witnesses perjured themselves
on the stand. They have nobody to blame but themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valli's lawyer, Louis ``Chuck'' Samonsky, called the verdict
``the most outrageous I have ever seen'' in 26 years as a lawyer,
including nearly nine as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught (Sofsky) in unambiguous lie after lie,'' he said. ``I
don't think this evidence supports the verdict in any way, shape or
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors slipped out of the Ventura County courthouse without
commenting on their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Herbert Curtis rejected Samonsky's request
to throw out the verdict. He set sentencing for May 28, when he
also will hear Samonsky's motion for a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Valli, of Calabasas, was not present for the verdict and learned
of the verdict from Samonsky's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started to cry,'' Samonsky said. ``She was not able to
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan would not say whether he would seek a jail sentence for
Valli.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to look at what happened in the trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that problems started when Frankie Avalon
complained about prices at the Secret Garden, where entrees average
about $30 and are served on Limoges china.
</P>
<P>
   Sofsky said that Randy Valli became loud and abusive and slapped
her across the face before storming out with the rest of her party.
</P>
<P>
   But Valli repeatedly denied slapping Sofsky and said she merely
pushed the restaurateur after Sofsky pulled her chair away from the
table in an attempt to make the foursome leave.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is married to Frankie Valli, known for hit songs
such as ``Big Girls Don't Cry'' and ``Walk Like a Man.'' Avalon
gained fame starring in the 1965 movie ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' and
for his hit single ``Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Samonsky said he doubted that Randy Valli would have been
prosecuted had she not been married to a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is all about the celebrity status of the people
involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lonergan said his office investigates all battery complaints
and prosecutes those it can prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county does battery cases all the time,'' he said. ``It
had nothing to do with celebrity. We don't look at somebody's name,
whether it's Valli or Smith.''

EXPOS TOP METS, 6-4 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter is still looking for his first victory. He
was undermined Friday night by a fluke hop on a little grounder
that left Robin Ventura staring at the third-base line with a dazed
expression on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' Ventura said of rookie Michael Barrett's
single. A little dazed is how Leiter had to be feeling, too. Even
though he allowed just four hits against the Montreal Expos through
seven innings at Shea Stadium, they all came in the fourth and led
to four runs.
</P>
<P>
   After Leiter allowed two more runs in the eighth on Barrett's
two-out, two-run single, Montreal was up by five runs on its way to
a 6-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a little more distraught and a little more concerned if
I felt I had no clue,'' said a mystified Leiter (0-2). ``But my
stuff is as good as it's ever been in my career. I'm just not
making that big pitch to get out of an inning. But I feel too good
to get depressed about it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the Mets' second in a row after five straight
victories and left them at 7-4. The loss also marked the first time
that Ventura went hitless as a Met after opening the season with
hits in the first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, meanwhile, was simply outpitched by Dustin Hermanson
(2-0). Or was it that simple, after all? Through seven innings,
both pitchers had allowed just four hits, but the Mets trailed by
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Leiter _ whose earned run average is 5.95 _ allowed six
runs on six hits in seven and two-thirds innings. Perhaps Leiter,
who walked three and struck out eight, would have been better off
if the tarps had never come off the soggy field. And so might have
Rickey Henderson, who singled as a pinch-hitter in the eighth
before asking to be removed with a tight right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knotted up,'' said Henderson, who has had well-publicized
troubles with his hamstring before. ``I don't think it's bad at
all. It might just be strained.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he would be able to start in left field this
afternoon, Henderson just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the 40-year-old outfielder said. ``I've got to
wake up in the morning and see how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter looked out his window Friday morning he could not
have been too pleased. ``Guess who's pitching,'' John Franco said
facetiously before the game. ``The Rain Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter just grimaced. Early last season, every time it was
Leiter's turn to pitch, it also seemed to be raining.
</P>
<P>
   But Leiter also enjoyed his finest season in the majors last
year, winning 17 games against only six losses with a 2.47 earned
run average, tied for third-lowest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   And considering that Leiter, who signed a four-year, $32 million
deal with the Mets in the off season, was winless in his first two
starts this season after a rough spring (0-4, 5.84 ERA), perhaps a
little rain was a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way things looked as Leiter breezed through the
Expos' lineup through three and a third hitless innings after rain
delayed the start by 1 hour 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But then Leiter's struggles inexplicably began with the Mets
ahead, 1-0. With one out in the fourth, Rondell White drilled
Leiter's first pitch just inside the foul pole in left. The home
run was not only White's second of the season, it was also his
second off Leiter this season. And it tied the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero followed by drawing a five-pitch walk. Then,
Barrett pushed a little grounder up the third-base line. The ball
took a strange hop off the chalk line and to the right of the base.
Ventura, who had sidled over to where the ball would have been
traveled over the bag, could only look at the spot where it had
taken the bad bounce in disbelief. Guerrero raced to third, Barrett
had a gift single, and there was still only one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it hit,'' Ventura later said. ``If there was
a hole, I could understand. But there was nothing there. It just
took a chop 10 feet the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Chris Widger, who lined a single to center to score
Guerrero. Wilton Guerrero, Vladimir's brother, followed with a
two-run triple the other way to right field. And now it was 4-1,
Montreal. And not even Todd Pratt's two-run homer in the bottom of
the ninth could rescue the Mets before Ugueth Urbina came on to
record the save.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mets finally recalled catcher VANCE WILSON from Class AAA
Norfolk and optioned outfielder TERRENCE LONG to the Tides.
</P>
<P>
   _ MIKE PIAZZA (knee) is expected to come off the disabled list a
week from Sunday when the Mets are in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE McILVAINE, the former Mets general manager, was arrested
this week in Hutchinson Island, Fla., where he maintains a
residence, and charged with public lewdness for allegedly
sunbathing nude on a public beach. McIlvaine is currently a scout
for the Minnesota Twins. &QL;

FRANCHITTI CLAIMS PROVISIONAL POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Dario Franchitti didn't exactly learn his
early lessons on maneuvering through a street circuit by driving on
the race tracks in his home country of Scotland. Instead, the
26-year-old Scotsman learned by driving to the race track in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make your own street circuits in Scotland,'' Franchitti
said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti on Friday mastered the latest CART FedEx Championship
street course in provisional qualifying for Sunday's 25th running
of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. His top effort of 61.185
seconds at an average speed of 106.244 miles per hour on the newly
configured 11-turn, 1.842-mile circuit was good enough to hold off
Target/Chip Ganassi Racing rookie Juan Montoya (61.956 at 105.985
mph), defending Long Beach pole sitter Bryan Herta (62.189 at
105.588 mph), Tony Kanaan (62.332 at 105.346 mph) and Max Papis
(62.363 at 105.293 mph) for the provisional pole.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti has won five consecutive front-row starts dating back
to late last season in CART events held on temporary street
circuits. Included in that string are pole positions at Toronto,
Vancouver and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to like driving (on the streets) between the walls,''
Franchitti said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Franchitti wasn't always between the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the wall on my quick lap,'' Franchitti said. ``But I
didn't realize until somebody told me. (Afterward) I was asked
where I hit the wall and I said `I don't know.' I think maybe I
brushed it coming off the hairpin (Turn 11).''
</P>
<P>
   In the Friday morning practice session, Franchitti wasn't overly
impressive posting the 10th quickest time of the 90-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just took it easy and worked on the car,''
Franchitti said. ``We were working on the setup, trying to get that
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers will be back on the streets again today in two
groups to participate in final qualifying for the 80-lap race
Sunday. The first group, which consists of the quickest drivers
from Friday, begins at 12:45 p.m. and the second group is scheduled
to start at 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the guy sitting on the pole Sunday will be in the
quickest car during one of the two sessions today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it rained (on Saturday) which was to my benefit,''
said Shell Team Rahal driver Herta, who won the 1998 Long Beach
pole position by turning the quickest lap in a dry provisional pole
session on Friday and holding the lead when the competitors
couldn't improve on his time in a rainy final qualifying run.
``Hopefully it will be dry today.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the teams have had a day of experience on the
newly-configured track. There were plenty of times during Friday's
sessions that the drivers looked lost on the new section.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Scott Pruett, who has been running on the streets of
Long Beach since racing karts in the early 1980s, made contact with
Turn 1 and spun the car leaving the following turn before stalling
in the middle of the track. The other cars entering Turn 2 had to
come to a near-halt before slipping past Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the final 10 minutes of the first session were
called off as Pruett's car, which suffered damage to the right
front wheel and a broken suspension, was towed back to the pits.
</P>
<P>
   In the second session, Mauricio Gugelmin clipped the wall at
Turn 2 and slid into a tire barrier, causing a short delay. Richie
Hearn banged the wall at Turn 4, damaging his right front tire and
suspension, and had to be towed from the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new part of the track is really tight,'' said Paul Tracy,
who qualified 10th for Team Kool Green. ``Everybody's going to have
to be careful because if a car gets sideways in there, you're
looking at a red flag.''

HATCHER-LESS STARS TO TEST METTLE AGAINST COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Stars' playoff depth will be tested today.
</P>
<P>
   And what a test it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into likely one of the most physical games of the season
_ a 3 p.m. battle against the Phoenix Coyotes at America West Arena
_ the Stars will rely heavily on youngsters such as Brad Lukowich,
Petr Buzek, Blake Sloan and Jon Sim, and role players Brent
Severyn, Brian Skrudland, Tony Hrkac and Doug Lidster.
</P>
<P>
   The massive changes are a result of injuries, rest for some
players and the suspension of Stars captain Derian Hatcher, who is
being held out of today's game pending an announcement of a
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Stars general manager Bob Gainey met with NHL
director of operations Colin Campbell yesterday in New York. No
decision had been made on Hatcher's fate, but Campbell is expected
to make one today.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Gainey could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension also has a hand in making the challenge so
daunting. Hatcher was disciplined for a hit on Wednesday that broke
the jaw of the Coyotes' Jeremy Roenick, ending his season. The
Coyotes might seek some vengeance today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what will happen,'' Hatcher said before
leaving for New York. ``It could be a rough game or both sides
could say we've had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes winger Rick Tocchet was coy about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need is for Keith Tkachuk to get in three
fights and break his thumb,'' Tocchet said. ``What we want is for
when Dallas gets on their plane, that they're sore. You have to
play a miserable game within the rules, and fighting is within the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are dressing a tough lineup. While Hatcher and Richard
Matvichuk (groin injury) are out, Severyn, Craig Ludwig and Brian
Skrudland don't mind getting physical. But they said they aren't
predicting a war, only reacting to what happens on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ever predict what's going to happen in any game,''
said Severyn, the team's designated enforcer. ``In my role, you
have to be ready every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig added: ``We're not a team that gets a lot of penalty
minutes, we're a team that frustrates other teams and tries to draw
them into penalties. At the same time, we're not going to back
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was matter-of-fact about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a game ... and we're going to show up and play,'' he
said. ``Stuff like this is generally taken care of by the players
on the ice, not by the coaches or the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix fans are already whipped into a frenzy about the game
and the chance for revenge against Hatcher, the way Stars fans were
hoping for revenge against Roenick, who had knocked Mike Modano out
of a game on March 23 with a blindsided hit.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick underwent 5 1/2 hours of surgery on Thursday and will
have his jaw wired shut for four to six weeks. His wife told the
``Arizona Republic'' she would push for the 29-year-old center to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is taking care of his own players as best he can,
sitting out the top scoring line of Modano (34 goals), Brett Hull
(32) and Jere Lehtinen (20) as part of his plan started Sunday to
rest players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've had planned for a while,'' Hitchcock
said. ``We have back-to-back games getting ready for the playoffs
and we don't need all of our players playing both games.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a one-game tryout for several players trying to
earn ice time in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   While defensemen Matvichuk (groin) and Sergei Zubov (bruised
wrist) are expected to be ready to play when the playoffs begin on
Wednesday or Thursday against the Edmonton Oilers, the Stars still
need defensive depth. Lukowich, 22, has proved himself a worthy
replacement in 12 games with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look out of place at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's
really come in and looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzek could play a few games until Matvichuk and Zubov are
healthy, but Lidster also has proven a consistent defenseman and
hasn't been prone to mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, the top three lines are pretty much set, which means
veterans Skrudland, Hrkac, Severyn and Dave Reid will compete with
youngsters Sim and Sloan for playing time in the playoffs. In the
past, Hitchcock has used those playing best at playoff time and
will give no favors to veterans. Last season, Hitchcock played Juha
Lind and Jamie Wright instead of Reid in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who doesn't care how long you've played or how much
you make, he's concerned about who can help him win a game,''
Skrudland said of Hitchcock. ``Each one of us has to prove to him
what we can do.''

TEEN-AGER IS SHOT TO DEATH OVER JACKET, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lamar Harris died Wednesday night with five dollars
in his pocket, still wearing the stock-car racing jacket that led
to his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar, who was 16, had just walked a friend home to a building
on East 173rd Street in the Bronx when he was fatally shot in the
back by a robber who wanted the red and blue jacket, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar's mother, who had just returned from burying her grandson
at the time of the shooting, arrived at the scene moments after her
son's heart had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him as I ran to the corner _ saw him on the ground and
the blood,'' his mother, Thelma Jackson, said Friday from her
apartment on Morris Avenue, just blocks from where her son was
killed. ``I just kept asking why.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who saw the shooting, she said, told her that the
assailant wanted Lamar's jacket. ``I should have never bought it
for him,'' she added. ``But I didn't know someone could be so cruel
as to shoot someone down for a jacket. If they had just asked, he
probably would have given it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was one of two incidents just 12 hours apart in
which people lost their lives at the hands of robbers. In
Manhattan, homicide detectives were busy in Morningside Heights on
Friday investigating the slaying of Jacqueline Frezza, 34, who was
shot to death Thursday morning on Broadway by a young man trying to
steal a bag of clothes that she was carrying to the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Both deaths shocked those living in the neighborhoods where they
occurred, places described by residents as pockets of civility and
family life, largely spared the violence that sometimes swarmed
nearby. Friday, friends and neighbors tried to make sense of the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside 221 E. 173rd St., Lamar's body has been replaced by a
makeshift shrine of candles and flowers, his name scribbled across
an old piece of cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   On the stretch of Broadway near La Salle Street where Ms. Frezza
was shot, two roses, one red and one yellow, were attached by crime
scene tape to the fence surrounding the General Grant Houses, one
of four city housing projects where surveillance cameras have been
installed to deter crime.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cameras captured the image of a suspect as he rode
his bicycle away from the scene of Ms. Frezza's killing. On light
posts Friday, officers put up wanted posters displaying two frames
from the videotape, although police officials said Friday that they
had few strong leads in either slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At Morningside Gardens, a co-op on Broadway and 123rd Street
where Ms. Frezza, a freelance marketing executive, and her sister
both lived, relatives declined to speak to reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the door remained open at Lamar's fifth-floor apartment in
the Mount Eden section of the Bronx, where friends arrived by the
dozens Friday to pay their respects and relatives recalled a
promising child's life.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar and his twin brother, Lamont, were well known in their
neighborhood for dressing alike and displaying the same sense of
kindness as they walked the streets. Both were active in Friendship
Community Church in the Bronx, and were often seen ferrying
groceries to elderly neighbors who could not get outside. Relatives
said the teen-agers once spent weeks helping a woman in their
building after she had eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Like country doctors, they would make house calls, running
errands and helping her with her medications and eye drops.
</P>
<P>
   From about the age of 4, when he saw a fire truck go screaming
by, Lamar had dreamed of being a firefighter and wanted to save
those around him, his mother said, holding back tears and speaking
of regret that she had ever agreed to buy her sons the $200 race
car jackets they so desired.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont was emblazoned across the back of Lamar's cotton jacket,
while Lamont's advertised Good-wrench. Many neighborhood youths
were envious of the stylish jackets, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother added that there had been similar trouble over
Lamar's clothing a few years before; he had been robbed at gunpoint
of his jacket and sneakers outside school. ``He came home
barefoot,'' she said. ``But he didn't fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of his killing, Lamar went to visit his friend
while his mother and other relatives attended the funeral of her
4-year-old grandson, Charles Hunter Beck, who recently died of an
aneurysm. The burial was in an Elizabeth, N.J., cemetery that
already held one of Lamar's older brothers, John, 27, who died of
cancer three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough time all around,'' said Ms. Jackson,
recalling the telephone call that came to her home just after 11
p.m. Wednesday and the sound of the scared boy on the other end,
telling her that Lamar had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, neighbors told her that her son had been shot
in the back after an argument over his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson said Lamar's friend told her he had heard a sudden
noise just after Lamar left. When the friend went downstairs, he
saw some youths in a car and Lamar on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he was,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``I just couldn't take it,
because I knew right away that he was dead.''

3 SHOT IN CROWDED BROOKLYN CINEMA; POLICE CITE GANG TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (expands with additional details)   (bl)  
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three men were shot and wounded in a crowded movie
theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on Friday night by a man who then
fled the moviehouse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said that the gunfire erupted after a dispute
over seating, but a senior officer at the scene said that the
shootings appeared to be gang related.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which occurred around 10 p.m., 15 minutes into an
opening-night screening of the new Eddie Murphy movie ``Life,''
sent hundreds patrons flooding out of the Kenmore Quad Theater onto
Church Avenue outside, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of victims were in surgery at Kings County Hospital Center
on Friday night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One man, 19, was in critical condition after being shot in the
back. Another, also 19, who was shot three times in the chest, was
in serious condition, and a third 19-year-old was stable with a
wound in the back, said Jerry Varson, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who were in the lobby at the time of the shootings said
they believed the gunfire was gang related and that audience
members were shouting out ``Crips'' and ``Bloods'' just before the
movie started.
</P>
<P>
   A senior officer at the scene agreed that gangs seemed to be
tied to the shootings but that beyond that it was difficult to say
what prompted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even sure if the three people shot were on the same
team, so to speak, because the theater was so dark,'' the officer
said. The officer said the investigation was hampered by the fact
that most of the witnesses ran out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men who was in the lobby said that he heard four or
five shots coming from inside the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like all at once _ pap pap pap pap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, ``it was just like a stampede. Whenever
somebody pulls out a gun, all you can do is run.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the screening of ``Life,'' a prison comedy starring
Murphy and Martin Lawrence, was canceled, the other three movies
being screened at the Kenmore, an old brick theater on a commercial
strip just west of Flatbush Avenue, continued without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Several peope who had watched the movie ``The Matrix'' emerged
afterward into the surreal real-life scene of a lobby criss-crossed
with yellow crime-scene tape and crawling with uniformed officers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Linda Stewart, 23, said she overheard some men who came late
into ``The Matrix'' talking about bullets, but thought nothing of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard these guys saying there were mad shots going on, but I
thought it was in the movie,'' she said.

PHOENIX'S KIDD, ROOKIE HAUNT MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jason Kidd continues to torment the Mavericks. Last
night his vendetta against his former team was joined by another
former Mavericks player.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Pat Garrity, who was drafted by the Mavericks on the
first round last summer and traded to Phoenix on draft day, haunted
Dallas with a 20-point effort as the Suns scorched the Mavericks,
92-85, before 18,623 at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing their modest two-game winning streak snapped, the
Mavericks (13-26) will play host to Portland at 7 tonight at
Reunion Arena. This will be the third game in three days for
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With Kidd and Garrity executing, the Suns rolled to a 75-66 lead
after the third period. Kidd scored 24 points and dished out 12
assists, and Garrity scored nine of his points in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Kidd and Garrity overshadowed a phenomenal
display by Mavericks rookie Dirk Nowitzki. The 7-footer scored a
career-high 29 points on 10-of-16 shooting, and also picked off
eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Without Nowitzki, who grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds against
San Antonio on Tuesday, the Mavericks would have been hopelessly
behind by halftime. That's because Michael Finley, who had averaged
29.5 points the previous two games, was held to just six points on
3-of-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Center Shawn Bradley did not play because Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson did not like the matchup
situation, even though the 7-foot-6 six-year veteran could have
given the Suns all sorts of matchup problems with his overwhelming
height advantage. It's the first game Bradley has missed this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix played without center Luc Longley, who has a
hyperextended left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, 9-1 against the Mavericks, flipped in an alley oop pass
from Rex Chapman, and scored again inside for an 81-66 Suns cushion
early in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's driving yo-yo layup over Nash lifted the Suns ahead,
43-36, late in the second period. But the Mavericks scrambled back
and eventually knotted the score at 43-all after baskets by Hubert
Davis and Robert Pack (17 points, seven assists), sandwiched around
a three-point field goal by Nowitzki.
</P>
<P>
   But with Kidd assisting on a pair of baskets, the Suns nudged
ahead, 50-45, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki had gotten the Mavericks off to a good start. The
7-footer banged in a 3-point field goal, then posted up Clifford
Robinson for his sixth and seventh points and a 12-9 Mavericks
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent's two free throws made it 14-9 Mavericks. Pack's
driving layup and subsequent free throw gave Dallas a 25-24 lead
after the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But the first quarter belonged to Nowitzki and Trent. Each
player scored nine points in the period. Trent grabbed five
rebounds and Nowitzki had three rebounds and drew an offensive foul
from Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mavericks couldn't keep up the pace.

DEAL FOR WASHED-UP QB WILL PROVE STEAL OF DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Strictly from a playing standpoint, the
Seahawks have already butchered Saturday's college draft by
squandering a second-round pick on an overweight, washed-up
quarterback who hasn't managed a game spiral in almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, given the Seahawks' draft history with quarterbacks,
he's typical.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the latest Seahawk deal the NFL's worst use of draft
picks on an old quarterback. Fans of the Green Bay Packers recall a
draft under then-coach Dan Devine in which five high picks were
sent away for imminently decrepit veteran QB John Hadl. The
transaction is known bitterly among the ice-fishing houses of
Wisconsin as the Lawrence Welk trade: ``A one, a two, a
one-two-three.''
</P>
<P>
   So giving up a No. 2 for Mike Holmgren won't be cause for
editors of sports-history books to call for massive rewrites.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holmgren looks at it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a steal.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the Seahawks coach/general manager's amused view this
week of the deal that brought him to Seattle. And because he is the
coach and general manager as well as the second-round draft choice,
there is almost no one in local football authority to challenge the
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   A steal? He might have a point. In the most memorable recent
episode of a team surrendering draft picks in order to pirate a
coach under contract, the New York Jets, to get Bill Parcells, had
to give to New England third- and fourth-round picks in 1997, a
second-rounder last year and a first-rounder in Saturday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Holmgren is a steal. Either that, or he's about a
quarter of the coach that Parcells figures to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I talked to Ron (Wolf, Packer GM) about getting that
pick back,'' said Holmgren. No deal, however: The Packers figure to
have sent away way too much to Seattle already.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual transaction came about because of the Seahawks'
indirect dalliance with Holmgren two years ago at the Super Bowl,
when his Packers beat Parcells' Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   While the fractious relationship between Parcells and Patriots
owner Bob Kraft became a media sideshow, Seahawks president Bob
Whitsitt was sniffing hard around Holmgren to see whether he might
fill the long-vacant GM job in Seattle. But since he was under
contract to Green Bay, formal contact would have been tampering, an
act in the NFL of semi-high treason.
</P>
<P>
   Since Holmgren wanted to be coach as well as GM, nothing
transpired _ except for formalizing Holmgren's desire to be
double-titled, something that would never happen in Green Bay as
long as the well-regarded Wolf stayed in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers agreed to an addendum to his contract that said he
would have a 21-day window after the 1998 season to pursue a
coach/GM job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd never say no to me pursuing such a job,'' he
said. ``But they needed compensation. If I did interview and take
another job, we had to sign the (second-round) pick over.''
</P>
<P>
   The compensation is believed to be the first of its kind for a
big-time coaching vacancy in Seattle, which normally has been a
place for retreads, the unemployed and the disengaged.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about the compensation is that the
Seahawks can afford it, and it has nothing to do with owner Paul
Allen's billions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many seasons, the Seahawks do not enter
the draft screamingly desperate for something. This week's
free-agent signing of veteran Sean Dawkins eliminated the most
glaring need: a quality pass-catcher also big enough to block in
Holmgren's West Coast offense.
</P>
<P>
   No team that has finished 8-8 for about half a decade can say
with a straight face that it needs nothing from a draft, but the
fact is that most needs are relatively patchable from current
resources. In other words, the Seahawks don't need to trade a bunch
of future picks to move up to select a studhoss, such as they did
for Curt Warner, Cortez Kennedy, Shawn Springs and Walter Jones.
</P>
<P>
   With little damage, they can even trade down in the draft in
exchange for more picks, including the second-rounder gone to Green
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they can expend a draft choice on an assistant paperwork
shuffler. During a media chat Wednesday, Holmgren hinted that the
dual roles sometimes leave his eyebrows stuck in the up position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being as efficient with my time as I will be,'' he
admitted. ``I'll get there, but it's a load.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's work is compounded by his newness with holdover
Seahawks personnel, as well as the installation of changes from his
predecessor, Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Under Erickson, Holmgren said, the week prior to the draft was a
light one because much of the work had been done. Under Holmgren,
it's known as a ``power week'' when most of the decision-making for
Saturday will be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing it differently than last year,'' he said. ``I've
told all the people who were here last year, `Don't fight me, meet
me halfway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's cramming three months into one week, because I've
been doing other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he's saving some time on the second-round pick. He's
scouted the pick since childhood, likes the talent and figures no
other team has a shot.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ NATO pilots claimed one of their
most successful nights in the air campaign against Yugoslavia,
destroying several tanks and artillery sites and damaging a large
air base Thursday night. The warplanes also gathered new
photographic evidence to back up reports of mass killings of Kosovo
refugees. By Philip Shenon. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ The confusion about whether NATO
accidentally bombed civilian refugees in Kosovo reflects both the
novelty of the first real air war the alliance has ever fought and
the determination of its U.S. military commander to control
everything NATO says about airstrikes even while he runs the war.
By Craig R. Whitney. WITH MAP.

<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Brazda) _ The flow of ethnic Albanians fleeing
Kosovo into Macedonia surged again with more than 6,000 refugees
pouring out of the Serbian province, including families that had
been forced by Serbian forces to turn back more than a week ago and
had gone into hiding. By David Rohde. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes) _ There is growing concern here in the
Kukes area, where there are 100,000 refugees, that the city will be

   KOSOVO-SCENE (Urosevac) _ Evidence of `ethnic cleansing' is

   KOSOVO-VOICES (White Plains, N.Y.) _ For all the wrenching
scenes of Kosovo refugees and burning buildings, of starched

clips of exploding targets, the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia
was beginning to fade to a remote concern for many people. Now, the

attacks on the Serbs, a portent of widening U.S. involvement, has
once again brought the war into sharp focus. By Susan Sachs.

of people.' By Joel Brinkley.

SMILE RETURNS TO SCARRED FACE OF BURNED BOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With red scars and burns still marking his pale
face, 10-year-old Denis Nefedova stood close to his mother Friday _
and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The simple smile was reason enough to celebrate for this Russian
boy: He hasn't been able to smile for more than a year, since
flames engulfed him during a horrible household accident, scarring
his face and hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better and better everyday,'' the little boy said,
speaking softly through an interpreter and peeking out from beneath
the brim of his blue Anaheim Angels cap.
</P>
<P>
   After two surgeries on his face at the Grossman Burn Center at
Sherman Oaks Hospital, Denis said on Friday that he's ready for
some fun and knows exactly where he wants to go: ``Universal
Studios,'' he said, showing off two new English words he's
mastered.
</P>
<P>
   Denis also plans to join other patients from the Sherman Oaks
center on a white-water rafting excursion in May.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors still must operate on the left side of his face,
which Denis said doesn't feel like his own flesh. ``My right cheek
is now softer, like my own,'' he said, smiling again.
</P>
<P>
   Denis was alone at his family home on Sakhalin Island, just
north of Japan, last year when a candle he lighted toppled and
ignited fumes from fuel being stored in the apartment. After two
months of surgeries near his home, Denis underwent advanced
treatment in Moscow, which he described Friday as painful.
</P>
<P>
   Russian doctors were unable to perform the reconstructive
surgeries with much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had surgeries in Russia, it was more painful after the
surgery,'' his interpreter Mila Chennetsky explained. ``But after
the surgeries here, he says he feels better. He has some hope
now.''
</P>
<P>
   In what is expected to be a yearlong series of procedures at the
Grossman Burn Center, surgeons will focus on Denis' cheek, nose and
eyes next month.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in treating Denis' wounds properly will work against
their odds of totally restoring his boyish good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wounds heal best if they're treated right away,'' said Dr.
Peter Grossman, a surgeon who will be working on Denis' hands, and
the son of A. Richard Grossman, the lead surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the process goes on without treatment, scar tissue replaces
healthy tissue,'' he said. ``It starts to pull and contract and
does not have the normal elasticity.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the elder Grossman cut away a flap of coarse, thick
scar tissue from Denis' right cheek and covered it with cadaver
skin to protect the wound. The slice of flesh was about the size of
a piece of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Grossman grafted a thick layer of skin from
the inside of the boy's thigh to his right cheek, and then attached
a thinner layer of skin from another spot on his leg to the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Operations on his badly mangled hands will follow and may
include tendon grafting to improve his flexibility, said Peter
Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the boy's plight came to the attention of Dr.
Michael Pomo of North Hollywood, who was volunteering on Sakhalin
Island. After being contacted by Pomo, A. Richard Grossman, the
burn center's founder, Grossman's son and other surgeons agreed to
donate their services to defray costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we would not really be talking about where he is
because it's so early in the healing process,'' Peter Grossman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Denis wanted to thank everyone for their generosity,
Grossman said. He wanted to stand next to his mother, Janna, and
smile again.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL) When Denis is not in the hospital, he and his mother stay
at a nearby home for aging and retired Russian women. The
Children's Burn Foundation is looking for more suitable
accommodations for the two, preferably with local Russian-speaking
families and schooling for Denis. To offer assistance, call (818)
907-2822. (END ITAL) &QL;

NATO CLAIMS `ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS' FOR BOMBINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (changes `policy' to `police' in 3rd graf; inserts `with' in 13th

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO pilots claimed one of their most successful
nights in the air campaign against Yugoslavia, destroying several
tanks and artillery sites and damaging a large air base on Thursday
night. The warplanes also gathered new photographic evidence to
back up reports of mass killings of Kosovo refugees, NATO and
Clinton administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said relatively clear skies over the Balkans from Thursday
night to Friday morning made it possible for the planes to attack
targets that included an SA-6 surface-to-air missile site near
Belgrade, an ammunition plant, the headquarters of several Serbian
army and policy units and a military airfield in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported that a total of 57 targets were hit
Thursday and Friday, suggesting that NATO planes were far more
successful than earlier in the campaign, when as few as 12 targets
were hit each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we had some notable successes,'' NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``In fact, it was one of the best nights thus far in
our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that life is becoming increasingly unpleasant for
Serb forces inside Kosovo,'' he added at a news conference at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Pentagon announced that Kosovar rebels had
seized a Yugoslav army lieutenant in Kosovo and that he was in
American custody as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials acknowledged that despite success in the air,
they had received reports of new atrocities by Serb forces against
Kosovo Albanians uprooted from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic was another step
closer to what appears to be his ultimate goal in Kosovo, the
forced depopulation of the province of what had been its Albanian
majority. Thousands of refugees poured across the borders into
Albania and Montenegro Friday, putting the total number of refugees
reported along Kosovo's borders at more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trickle of refugees that had been going into Albania and
Macedonia has now become a flow,'' said State Department spokesman
James Rubin. ``This is something that greatly troubles us. There
may be up to 50,000 people who are backed up at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the renewed flood of refugees was explained in part
by reports of a new round of terror by Serbian forces. ``We have
developed new evidence, independently corroborated by refugee
interviews, about mass killings in west-central Kosovo,'' he said.
``This new information about mass killings is another example of
the fact that President Milosevic's policies are aimed toward
killing civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rubin would not describe the evidence in detail, other
administration officials said that photographs taken by American
spy satellites showed rows of freshly dug mass graves west of
Pristina, the provincial capital, and that refugee accounts from
the region suggested that Serbian forces had executed hundreds of
people there in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton rerouted Air Force One Friday on a Democratic
Party fund-raising tour to stop at Selfridge Air National Guard
Base, Mich., to meet 50 volunteer reservists who were scheduled to
leave Friday night for Europe to support the NATO effort.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Clinton also met privately with the family of Staff
Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., one of the
three American servicemen whom Serb forces took prisoner last
month.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Friday in metropolitan Detroit, a region where the
president noted that 40,000 Albanian-Americans lived, Clinton said
the United States should help rebuild the Balkans, much as it had
helped rebuild Western Europe with the Marshall Plan after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do for southeastern Europe, including the Balkans,
what was done for Central Europe after the Cold War and for the
battleground nations of Europe after World War II,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday night, at a Democratic fund-raiser in Weston,
Mass., the president said, ``We do not want our children to live in
a 21st century world where very smart people filled with very
narrow hatreds can access technology, weaponry, missile technology,
and torment the world because they're growing smaller in spirit
when they should be growing larger in vision, especially in the
heart of Europe, which is so critical to our security.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said that air strikes were being
conducted around the clock and that they were planning for the
heavy bombing of Yugoslav targets Friday night and early Saturday
morning, in an effort to beat the forecast of heavy clouds for the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Tanjung news agency in Yugoslavia reported that
the main Kosovo airport outside Pristina, Slatino, was hit Friday
night for the fifth time, along with mountaintop radio transmitters
northeast and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   An wave of NATO attacks before dawn Friday focused on a military
airfield and airport just outside Podgorica, capital of Montenegro,
the smaller republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Western Montenegro government has accused Belgrade of
trying to draw NATO attacks against Serb targets in Montenegran
territory.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Friday that several Yugoslav naval vessels
docked in Montenegro ports had fired on NATO aircraft but that NATO
planes had not fired back so far.
</P>
<P>
   Also reported hit by NATO planes was the largest oil refinery in
Serbia and a bridge over the Danube southeast of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the costs of the American part of the operation, the
White House is generally expected to ask Congress early next week
for $5.9 billion in emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which covers projected spending through the fiscal
year that ends on Sept. 30, includes $5.5 billion for the Pentagon
and $500 million for the State Department, a senior administration
official said. Of that, $650 million to $700 million is focused on
relief aid.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the request was enough ``to sustain the
current forces through the rest of the year.'' That force, the
official said, includes the 48 Apache attack helicopters en route
to Albania, the 300 additional aircraft that Gen. Wesley Clark, the
NATO commander, has requested and the costs of calling as many as
33,000 reservists to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The first Apache helicopters are now expected to reach Tirana,
Albania, this weekend. The full fleet is not expected to be ready
for combat for several weeks, the Pentagon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Administration official said the appropriation request would not
cover the cost of ground forces, including 4,000 troops that the
United States has promised to a peacekeeping force that would work
in Kosovo under a negotiated settlement.

VINTNER'S FORAY INTO FINE WINES WINS FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anthony Dias Blue, wine &AMP; spirits editor for Bon
Appetit Magazine, singled out a bottle of chardonnay at a recent
tasting at the Century Plaza hotel as one of the top three being
made in California.
</P>
<P>
   That a vintage California winery makes a top-flight chardonnay
wasn't a surprise. The genie in the bottle is that it comes from a
winery more noted for its huge production volume and labor battles
with the late Cesar Chavez than its quality.
</P>
<P>
   Blue was praising Gallo of Sonoma Estate Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   What's this? A bottle of Gallo with a cork, a double-digit price
and medals attesting to its quality?
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't what they were 20 years ago,'' Blue said,
succinctly summing up the progress being made at the venerable
winery. And as proof, his magazine has named Gallo of Sonoma the
winery of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it was a stretch to blend the words ``Gallo'' and
``fine wine'' into the same sentence. Hearty burgundy, which for
many baby boomers was one of first reds they took to the dinner
table, tasted OK but it came in a jug with a screw top, neither of
which are the characteristics of a quality vintage.
</P>
<P>
   So when a new generation of Gallos took over operations of the
family's fine wine operations earlier this decade, they were
determined to produce wines from the company's Sonoma County
facility that would rank among the state's best.
</P>
<P>
   Today those bottlings are adorned with a simple ``Gallo of
Sonoma'' label and in some cases price tags that at first blush
appear to have been grafted from a bottle of vintage French
Bordeaux. One retailer in the San Fernando Valley is selling the
1992 estate cabernet sauvignon for $55. That's per bottle, not a
case.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the wines rank among the best in the world,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   The upscaling of the jug wine producer seems complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great wine grapes are fragile things,'' said Gina Gallo, who
is making the wines at the Dry Creek Valley vineyard with the help
of Marcello Monticello, a veteran Gallo vintner and friend of her
grandfather Julio. ``The basics of wine making are simple, but we
are not making simple wines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallo of Sonoma label debuted in 1993; the winery produces
eight brands with the Estate designation to mark its
top-of-the-line. Those with the Gallo of Sonoma label _ merlot,
zinfandel, cabernet and chardonnay _ are priced in the $9 to $10
dollar range. Other brands also include Turning Leaf Sonoma Reserve
varietal and Rancho Zabaco zinfandel and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Wines from this facility account for about 10 percent of the
production at Gallo, the world's biggest producer. The company
makes one of every four bottles sold in America.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Gallo grew up around wine and decided to make it a career
while in high school. She worked a variety of jobs at the privately
held company and received her wine-making training at the
University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The family ate together nightly at 7 o'clock, and oftentimes
knowledge was consumed along with a glass of one of the family's
wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was brought up, (wine) was a part of the dinner
table. And a lot of things can be learned around the dinner
table,'' Gallo said on a recent visit to Los Angeles. ``And I
really appreciate and learned the value of work ethic by seeing the
hours my grandfather put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lessons seem to be paying off, and critics, at least, are
taking notice.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gallo of Sonoma was named winery of the year at the
San Francisco International Wine Competition. The 1995 Estate
Chardonnay won best in the world at the International Wine &AMP;
Spirits Competition in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, in its weekly wine column, raved about
Gallo of Sonoma's 1992 and 1994 cabernets late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have started off on very solid footing, and they've
gotten great ratings ... in blind tastings. The production to date
has been by and large outstanding,'' said Marvin R. Shanken, editor
and publisher of The Wine Spectator, considered by many enthusiasts
as the industry bible.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts also note that creating a new brand identity
at the world's biggest producer comes as the market is shifting.
Wine sales in the U.S. have generally been trending up for more
than two decades. Sales, including imports, totaled $3.3 billion in
1975 but had reached $17 billion last year, according to figures
compiled by the Wine Institute, a San Francisco-based trade group.
</P>
<P>
   And while last year saw a drop in shipments of California's
popular-priced jug wines, sales of upscale premium varietal wines
boomed, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, sales of California wines priced above $7 a bottle
jumped 14 percent last year on an annual basis, and this segment
has grown threefold in the last seven years. The category accounts
for only 19 percent of the state's production, but 44 percent of
revenues, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a supermarket you will see that the premium
wines are getting the shelf space. The jug wines are down below at
your feet,'' said Cyril Penn, editor of The Wine Business Insider,
an industry newsletter published by New World Wine Communications
Inc. in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   This is the segment that Gallo is now courting. And while there
are about 800 California wineries doing the same sort of thing,
there seems to be potential market share for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen that they need to expand just from the jug wines,
and so far they seem to be doing a good job of it,'' said Marc
Wright, publisher of The Wine Investor in Hollywood, a newsletter
geared toward wine industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Making good wine is one thing. Selling it is a different matter.
And the new generation of Gallos knows it will take some work to
overcome the jug wine past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the baggage. But evidently people have an open mind and
are judging the product on its own merits. There is quality in the
bottle, and it's selling very well,'' said Shanken of The Wine
Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Gina Gallo has recently started appearing in a
series of television ads promoting the company's line to Generation
X.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gallo name will remain part of the company's fine wine
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family name helps,'' she said. ``It's important.
That's my heritage, and that's who we are.''

BROWN SUFFERS DEFEAT, BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Without question, Kevin Brown will remember his
return to San Diego. And he'll remember it for all the wrong
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The awesome fielding that backed Darren Dreifort the day before
seemingly stayed in Arizona while the rest of the Los Angeles
Dodgers' game ventured back to California.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave up three runs in 61/3 innings while Padres
right-hander Andy Ashby baffled the Dodgers in a 3-0 win Friday at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a pretty night for Brown, who spurned a six-year, $60
million contract offer from the Padres in favor of Los Angeles'
$105 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who helped the Padres to the World Series a year ago, was
booed lustily when he took the mound, when he batted twice and,
especially, when he was taken out of the game with one out in the
bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear them, but it's no different than playing at Atlanta
or in Houston in the playoffs,'' Brown said. ``That's their
prerogative. I can't do anything about that. I play for the
Dodgers. I don't think they're real popular down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans were so revved up in hopes Brown would collapse that a
few even made a paper mache pinata of Brown and repeatedly hit it
with a stick in the stands behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the reaction would be, but I didn't think
it would be like that,'' Padres left fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``He
made a decision good for him and good for his family, so I can't
fault him. That's why I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   What began as a nice duel turned in favor of Ashby in the fourth
inning. Though the Padres didn't score, it was the first of four
straight innings in which the lead runner reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (1-1) worked out of the fourth, but the Padres chipped
away with singles runs in the next three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Magadan singled to lead off the fifth , moved to third on
Chris Gomez's single and scored on Quilvio Veras' sacrifice fly to
center field. It gave the Padres a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who had three hits, doubled to lead off the sixth inning
and scored two batters later on John Vander Wal's single to give
the Padres a 2-0 lead. But Brown dodged further trouble when he
struck out Ashby with the bases loaded to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Veras lined a single to left to set up the third
Padres' run. He was erased on Reggie Sanders' grounder, but the
inning was extended when second baseman Eric Young misplayed a
potential inning-ending double play grounder. Wally Joyner followed
with a double to score Sanders to put the Padres ahead 3-0 and
chase Brown from the game. Brown struck out nine and allowed two
earned runs on 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (2-1) allowed five hits _ the Dodgers didn't get two in an
inning _ and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Ashby. He was outstanding,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``That's the best I've seen him pitch. We have some
pretty good hitters and he pretty much had his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sunday's rainout with Colorado was rescheduled as part of
a day-night doubleheader July 22. A 7:10 p.m. start will be added
to the already scheduled 1:10 p.m. game.... Second baseman Young,
who left the Dodgers' game Thursday with tightness in his right
calf, started against the Padres.

RODMAN WASN'T LAKERS' ONLY PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Let's hope Jerry Buss learned his lesson.
Whatever that lesson might be.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hire power forwards who sob at good-news press
conferences? Don't hire players whose idea of unselfishness is
sitting out the final minutes of tight games to give the rookies
some floor time? Don't hire 38-year-old men who have the fashion
sense to color-coordinate high heels and wedding dresses but lack
the foresight to wear socks and sneakers to basketball practice?
</P>
<P>
   Buss, the Los Angeles Lakers' owner who wanted Dennis Rodman,
won't make those mistakes again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the opportunity is likely to come up again anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The failed experiment with Shoeless Dennis was a
once-in-a-lifetime thing, a freak occurrence in more ways than one.
And now, rather than stew in their disappointment or allow the
Rodman ``distraction'' to remain an excuse, the Lakers have to
forget about him and get on with solving bigger problems in the
three short weeks before the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So tie those laces in double knots, guys, and strap on your
thinking caps.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Rodman signing, undone in the seconds it took to
phone the league office, this season's other Lakers personnel moves
have caused damage that won't be easy to repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``With him (Rodman) or without him, we were going to have to
correct a lot of things on the basketball court,'' coach Kurt
Rambis said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Said forward/guard Kobe Bryant of the Lakers' position, fifth in
the Western Conference: ``I don't think we can pin the blame on one
guy (Rodman).... It's everybody's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, the coach and the management.
</P>
<P>
   The season began _ late, because of the lockout _ amid
well-founded Lakers optimism. They had nine of last year's dozen
playoff players and they had the same veteran X's-and-O's coach,
both advantages going into a concentrated schedule in which
practice time would be scarce.
</P>
<P>
   They had a young, deep roster that the front office expected to
grow together into a perennial contender.
</P>
<P>
   And they shared _ or said they shared _ a commitment to the
belief that defense wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   The season opened Feb. 5. Within 18 days they had changed
coaches, firing Del Harris and promoting the untested Rambis, and
within 33 they had shaken up the roster, trading their best
defender and their front-court depth to acquire Glen Rice from
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers now feel they'll need every minute of their
newfound peace and quiet to put the pieces together, no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman told a TV interviewer he's being made a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. If the Lakers wanted to distract us from the real causes
of their 25-15 record, which is six games behind last year's pace,
they'd keep him on the team. Without him, it's easy to see what
else is missing:
</P>
<P>
   _Defense. They're allowing 95.6 points a game, fifth worst in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play defense. That has to be (priority) No. 1,'' Bryant said,
making it sound like Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Eddie Jones, their leader in steals for four straight
seasons, for Rice, a shooter who missed training while recovering
from an injury, has hurt more than expected. They can only hope to
make up for that with improved defensive teamwork as the new lineup
gets acquainted.
</P>
<P>
   _Depth. At only one position can the Lakers be considered as
deep in talent as they were in '98. That's small forward, where
Rick Fox and Robert Horry back up Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Both center and power forward are shallower without Elden
Campbell, traded to Charlotte with Jones. Shooting guard finds
Bryant, who's better at small forward, without a set backup, after
Bryant backed up Jones last year. And point guard has an undefined
rotation of Derek Fisher, Derek Harper and Tyronn Lue instead of
Fisher and '98 All-Star Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we could advance to the (championship) level
we needed to with the team we had,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak
said of the trade _ and, significantly, he insists the deal would
have been made even if Rodman hadn't been signed first.
</P>
<P>
   _Leadership. Rambis, the interim, rookie head coach, is doing as
well as can be expected and is only going to get better. It was
good to hear Kupchak say Friday that he and executive vice
president Jerry West like Rambis' chances of keeping the job for
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the wrong time to break in a new coach, forcing him
to deal with the trade and Rodman's misbehavior during a hurried-up
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   If they'd kept Harris, in retrospect, the guess here is that the
Lakers wouldn't lead the Western Conference, but they'd be closer
than they are.
</P>
<P>
   First place, and the playoff home-court advantage that comes
with it, is out of reach with 10 games left in the season. But
there's time for the Lakers to get in stride.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that they all have their running shoes on. The
bad news is they have a long way to go.

LUCAS, FOX BEGIN PREPPING `PHANTOM' ALLOCATION LIST
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Attention ``Star Wars'' campers _ the final
decision on which movie theaters will screen ``Star Wars Episode 1:
Phantom Menace'' should come in about two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A top 20th Century Fox executive said Friday that contracts will
be signed between the studio and theater operators after trade
screenings take place around May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to see the film before they can sign the contract,''
said Tom Sherak, chairman of Fox Domestic Film Group. ``There are
no deals yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak's comments came after Daily Variety reported Fox and
``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas had begun making
``allocations,'' industry jargon for a distributor issuing a ``wish
list'' of theaters allowed to book the film.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, citing unnamed industry sources, said local
allocations included Mann's Chinese and the Mann Village _ both of
which saw fans start camping out last week _ along with Loews
Cineplex Century Plaza Cinemas in Century City, the Mann Criterion
6 in Santa Monica and the General Cinemas Galleria 16 in Redondo
Beach. But Sherak said no names would be released until after
contracts are signed.
</P>
<P>
   The trade paper also reported that AMC had been passed over in
several key competitive Southern California zones, including
Century City, Santa Monica, Pasadena, Orange and Ontario, but AMC
spokeswoman Brenda Nolte asserted the chain remains in the running.
``The final booking decisions will not be made until after the
screenings,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex spokesman Marc Pascucci said the Century Plaza
theater had been allocated the movie but added no decision had yet
been reached on the Universal City 18.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lucas have told exhibitors they will only select
theaters with the best presentation capabilities for ``Phantom
Menace'' and have indicated that the prequel will be booked at
about 2,000 theaters and on about 4,000 screens _ less than one in
eight of the more than 34,000 auditoriums in U.S. theaters.
Proposed terms reportedly include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A minimum run of eight weeks on the largest screen in a
multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   _ Total trailer time before movies will be limited to eight
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ No on-screen advertising prior to the film for the first two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Lucas proposed earlier this month that ``Phantom
Menace'' ticket sales be restricted to same-day sales for the first
two weeks in order to limit scalping. But Fox recently indicated it
was discussing with exhibitors some kind of advance sale so fans
won't have to camp out before the movie opens in order to see it.

DODGERS DEAL MLICKI AND ROJAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers swapped the insurance of
having a sixth starting pitcher for flexibility in the bullpen in a
salary-dumping trade of pitchers Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to the
Detroit Tigers for three minor-league pitchers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Robinson Checo, 27, joined the Dodgers from
Detroit's Triple-A affiliate. General manager Kevin Malone said the
Dodgers also strengthened their farm system by acquiring
right-handed pitcher Apostol Garcia, 22, and left-hander Richard
Roberts, 22, in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was made possible because the Dodgers activated
right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna from the disabled list before
Friday's game with the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Salary) was part of the equation, but it wasn't an important
piece of the puzzle,'' Malone said. ``We added two power arms
(Checo and Osuna) and made the club better. It helps the Dodgers
now and we put prospects into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the players were listed on Baseball America's
top-10-prospects list in the Tigers' farm system, but Malone said
Dodger scouts graded each of the players in the top 11 of Detroit's
minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   Having not seen either Checo or Osuna in game action, Johnson
said it'll take time for their roles to be defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Mlicki) could have gone every other day, I don't make this
deal. But he can't,'' Johnson said. ``If (Osuna) he throws that 95
mph gas, that big slurve and the great change, I'll find a spot for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki was 7-3 with a 4.05 ERA as a starter after being acquired
by the Dodgers in a June trade with the Mets, but he was expendable
after the Dodgers signed Kevin Brown in the off season. Through the
Dodgers' first 10 games this season, Mlicki (0-1) pitched twice and
had a 4.91 ERA. Mlicki will start for the Tigers on Sunday against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   As a sixth starter, Mlicki, 30, was an insurance policy for the
Dodgers. He was the Dodgers' long reliever and emergency starter.
Malone said Checo, 1-3 with a 5.57 ERA in seven major-league
appearances, could fill that void. If not, the Dodgers might have
to dip into the minor leagues for a Jamie Arnold, Jeff Kubenka or
Mike Judd.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were in the process of converting Checo from a
reliever to a starter. Malone said Checo, once evaluated with the
Dodgers, could be sent to Triple-A Albuquerque to build arm
strength so he could be a long reliever. Checo didn't allow a run
in two minor-league outings this season.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the deal was the Dodgers' agreement to absorb
most of Rojas' $4.5 million contract. Malone wouldn't comment on
it, but sources said the Dodgers will pay approximately $3.7
million of the deal. The Dodgers already pay $1 million of Bobby
Bonilla's contract. He was traded to the Mets for Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who will be a free agent after the season, will earn
$2.25 million this season. The Tigers will pay all of that. The
Dodgers cut their payroll from nearly $84 million to $81 million.
Add in the luxury tax _ only players on the organization's 40-man
roster count _ and the Dodgers cut nearly $5 million from their
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mlicki, for us, was the key because the last two years he
established himself as a dependable starter,'' Tigers general
manager Randy Smith said. ``We'll probably try to use (Rojas) two
innings at a time. He was a kind of a last-minute add to the deal.
We wouldn't have made the deal without the cash consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone spoke with Smith last Friday and again Monday regarding a
deal. Talks intensified Thursday and the deal was concluded later
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Having already lost starters Seth Greisinger and Bryce Florie to
injury, the Tigers were in the market for starting pitching.
However, the Dodgers wouldn't make the deal unless the Tigers
agreed to take Rojas, 32, who Smith said would be the Tigers'
fourth right-hander in the bullpen. Rojas' career has plummeted
since he signed a free-agent deal with the Chicago Cubs before the
1997 season. He had a 12.60 ERA in five games with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather stay here, but because they needed room for Osuna,
they needed to do something,'' Rojas said. ``I don't know the
American League, but the new league is probably going to help me
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a converted shortstop, is in his third season as a
pitcher. He is 12-10 with a 4.47 ERA in 70 appearances. He will
report to Double-A San Antonio. Roberts is 5-9 with a 3.46 ERA in
two seasons of minor-league ball and will pitch at Single-A Vero
Beach.

IT'S HOW GRETZKY SAW THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a reason Wayne Gretzky has collected
assists for the past 20 years as easily as most NHL players collect
bruises or broken teeth. Gretzky's breadth of view has been the
nearest thing to God's on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   In street clothes he looks as unassuming as the kid hunched over
his desk in the back row of Algebra class. But put a few pounds of
padding on him and place a hockey stick in his hands and he becomes
a real-life Will Hunting.
</P>
<P>
   NHL rinks have been his blackboard, his genius patently evident
in the way he goes to a spot and the puck just naturally follows,
as if there's some magnetic force at work. His success was never
predicated on his speed, but on his computer-like reads.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers' veteran center sees the game a few frames
ahead of everybody else, his prescience reducing a coach's
intricate Xs and Os to tic-tac-toe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Gretzky showed us that in the game of life, just as in
the game he has played without peer for 35 years, his vision is so
telescopic the rest of us might as well be looking through the
wrong end of the binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Number 99 announced that he will retire in '99, after the
Rangers' regular-season finale Sunday against Pittsburgh, his
timing impeccable to the end.
</P>
<P>
   To see Gretzky, 38, play in person was a profound experience,
the modern-day equivalent of being at the Sistine Chapel with
Michelangelo or inside the Globe Theatre with William Shakespeare.
To have that kind of genius in our midst is such a rare and
wondrous thing, we hardly could be blamed for begging Gretzky to
come back for just one more year, to thrill us one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, teammates, political dignitaries, hockey emissaries,
his wife. There seemingly wasn't anyone, great or small, who didn't
try the last few days to get Gretzky to double back on his decision
the same way he sometimes would when he was controlling the puck
and not his future.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Canada's head of state, was among
those who tried to talk Gretzky out of retiring. To be sure, the
argument for playing another year or two was a sound one.
</P>
<P>
   His skills, like the blades on his skates, can still cut quite a
figure. Gretzky tied for the NHL assists lead in 1997-98 and he
earned MVP honors at this year's All-Star Game. He leads the
Rangers this season with 52 assists and 61 points in 69 games,
which is middling only by his own mind-boggling standards.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to see him back next season because Gretzky on his
worst day is better than 99 percent of NHL players on their best.
</P>
<P>
   Only Gretzky, with his peripheral vision, saw the bigger picture
that the rest of us, in our myopia, missed. Leave it to the guy a
teammate once described as having a rear-view mirror in the back of
his head to see what was gaining on him fast.
</P>
<P>
   It was youth, not as represented by Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne
and Jaromir Jagr but as personified by his three offspring.
Paulina, Ty and Trevor are growing up _ too quickly, as kids are
wont to do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983-84 Gretzky collected at least one point in 51 straight
games, but more recently he couldn't count on making it to two
school events in a row. When he stood before reporters Friday and
said of his family, ``there are new adventures ahead of us,'' he
was referring to the mundane events that make parenting so
priceless.
</P>
<P>
   His firstborn Paulina is 10, the same age her father was when he
scored 378 goals in one unforgettable season while playing against
kids three and four years older. She has her own interests and so
do Ty, 8, and Trevor, 6. The boys are playing hockey, rising early
for practices the same way their dad once did, motivated by the
same passion for the game that drove their father to the end.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference is Gretzky has not been able to be there for
them in every way, as his father Walter was for him. Gretzky's dad
didn't have a lot of money to lavish on his children but that was
immaterial. He showered them with something even more valuable: his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   It was Walter who laced up Wayne's first pair of skates almost
as soon as his son could walk. And it was Walter who flooded the
backyard in the winter and put Wayne through myriad drills and
drummed into his head to ``skate to where the puck is going to be,
not where it has been'' and kept the young boy's head from getting
too big when success came fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   It is in no small part because of Walter that Gretzky grew up to
be a giant and a gentleman, ``the consummate ambassador'' for the
NHL, in the words of commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's unfailingly politeness, his willingness to give
everybody and his editor a minute of his time over the years, has
set him apart as much as his play. But unlike his talent, his time
is limited. Gretzky's children have paid the biggest price for his
superstardom, their own activities superceded by their father's
games.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Gretzky told a poignant story of how Paulina wept
inconsolably when the NHL schedule precluded him from attending a
father-daughter event at her school.
</P>
<P>
   So worry not how Gretzky will fill his idle days. ``I think that
I've got a tremendous family,'' he said. ``That'll give me a lot of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   No one carried a greater burden night-in and night-out than
Gretzky, yet he never failed to see the contributions made by
others to his success. He took a few moments Friday to acknowledge
some of those people, from his childhood coaches to NHL trainers,
equipment managers and public relations directors.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who in 1993 led the Los Angeles Kings to their only
Stanley Cup Finals appearance, has meant as much to the NHL as
Michael Jordan did to the NBA. Only he's too humble to publicly
admit it. How else to explain Gretzky, at his own farewell
conference, bemoaning that Jordan ``left too early. I have kids who
idolize him. I wish he was still playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Gretzky, of course. But we won't rue
his retirement. We trust he has a few more memorable assists in
him. He was right to call his retirement ``a celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Paulina, Ty and Trevor Gretzky won something on Friday
that is more precious than the Stanley Cup. The prize they'll now
be able to show off is their dad.

FRANCHITTI CLAIMS PROVISIONAL POLE
</HEADLINE>
 BEACH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Dario Franchitti didn't exactly learn his
early lessons on maneuvering through a street circuit by driving on
the race tracks in his home country of Scotland. Instead, the
26-year-old Scotsman learned by driving to the race track in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make your own street circuits in Scotland,'' Franchitti
said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti on Friday mastered the latest CART FedEx Championship
street course in provisional qualifying for Sunday's 25th running
of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. His top effort of 61.185
seconds at an average speed of 106.244 miles per hour on the newly
configured 11-turn, 1.842-mile circuit was good enough to hold off
Target/Chip Ganassi Racing rookie Juan Montoya (61.956 at 105.985
mph), defending Long Beach pole sitter Bryan Herta (62.189 at
105.588 mph), Tony Kanaan (62.332 at 105.346 mph) and Max Papis
(62.363 at 105.293 mph) for the provisional pole.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti has won five consecutive front-row starts dating back
to late last season in CART events held on temporary street
circuits. Included in that string are pole positions at Toronto,
Vancouver and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to like driving (on the streets) between the walls,''
Franchitti said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Franchitti wasn't always between the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the wall on my quick lap,'' Franchitti said. ``But I
didn't realize until somebody told me. (Afterward) I was asked
where I hit the wall and I said `I don't know.' I think maybe I
brushed it coming off the hairpin (Turn 11).''
</P>
<P>
   In the Friday morning practice session, Franchitti wasn't overly
impressive posting the 10th quickest time of the 90-minute session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just took it easy and worked on the car,''
Franchitti said. ``We were working on the setup, trying to get that
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers will be back on the streets again today in two
groups to participate in final qualifying for the 80-lap race
Sunday. The first group, which consists of the quickest drivers
from Friday, begins at 12:45 p.m. and the second group is scheduled
to start at 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the guy sitting on the pole Sunday will be in the
quickest car during one of the two sessions today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it rained (on Saturday) which was to my benefit,''
said Shell Team Rahal driver Herta, who won the 1998 Long Beach
pole position by turning the quickest lap in a dry provisional pole
session on Friday and holding the lead when the competitors
couldn't improve on his time in a rainy final qualifying run.
``Hopefully it will be dry today.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the teams have had a day of experience on the newly
configured track. There were plenty of times during Friday's
sessions that the drivers looked lost on the new section.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Scott Pruett, who has been running on the streets of
Long Beach since racing karts in the early 1980s, made contact with
Turn 1 and spun the car leaving the following turn before stalling
in the middle of the track. The other cars entering Turn 2 had to
come to a near-halt before slipping past Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the final 10 minutes of the first session were
called off as Pruett's car, which suffered damage to the right
front wheel and a broken suspension, was towed back to the pits.
</P>
<P>
   In the second session, Mauricio Gugelmin clipped the wall at
Turn 2 and slid into a tire barrier, causing a short delay. Richie
Hearn banged the wall at Turn 4, damaging his right front tire and
suspension, and had to be towed from the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new part of the track is really tight,'' said Paul Tracy,
who qualified 10th for Team Kool Green. ``Everybody's going to have
to be careful because if a car gets sideways in there, you're
looking at a red flag.''

CHANDLER POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN GUNBATTLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANDLER, Ariz. _ A Chandler police SWAT team officer storming
an apartment complex to arrest suspects in a jewelry heist was
fatally wounded Friday before fellow officers killed one of the
suspects with return fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Jim Snedigar is Chandler's first to be killed in the
line of duty. He also is the second Valley officer shot to death in
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Police took two other men into custody a short time after the 3
p.m. shootout at a gated apartment complex where the robbery
suspects had fled after a 2-mile car chase from Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing officers fanned out and, upon finding a broken arcadia
door at one of the units, called in the Chandler SWAT team as
residents were individually telephoned and ordered to stay inside.
The officers tossed stun grenades into the apartment and were
starting in when they were met by gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar, who was wearing body armor, fell just inside the
apartment, police said. Authorities had no identity on the dead
suspect, who also wore a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   A former Army paratrooper, Snedigar was a member of the bicycle
squad who volunteered for SWAT detail on occasion, a co-worker
said.
</P>
<P>
   He left behind a wife and two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hard-charger, he didn't like to sit on his behind,''
said Chandler Officer Eddie Cuthbertson, 30, a five-year veteran.
``I remember he used to tell me, `What are you sitting down for?
There's criminals out there. Let's go put them in jail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His death is ``like someone just ripped your heart out of you,''
Cuthbertson said.
</P>
<P>
   A shaken Police Chief Bobby Joe Harris told reporters Friday
afternoon, ``The officers are not doing well. They're emotionally
upset, as I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go through this, but we will make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting struck hard at the rank and file of law enforcement
Valley-wide, many of whom are still recovering from a series of
shootings of police officers that occurred last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just unbelievable,'' said Terry Sills, president of
the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association. ``I'm numb. What in the
world is going on?'' &QL; 
Sills said he got the news Friday as he was preparing to tell a
Phoenix police squad about efforts to have a park named for Officer
Marc Atkinson, who was ambushed and shot to death March 26. He
broke the news of the Chandler officer's death to the Phoenix cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about some sad faces,'' Sills said. ``I mean, is this
open season on us right now? I know I'm just stunned. It was just
silence. My gosh, `Not again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's incident began at 11:50 a.m. when Tempe police received
a 911 call from Crescent Jewelers, 1310 W. Elliot Road. The caller
hung up, but police went to the scene and discovered that an armed
robbery had been committed, said Officer Pat McDonnell, a Chandler
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Two robbers had gone inside the store, while the third had
stayed behind in the getaway car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe officers pursued a stolen black Ford Mustang described by
witnesses as the robbers' vehicle to the Sierra Palms Apartments, a
gated complex on 54th Street just north of Ray Road in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler police said the suspects were able to drive into the
complex because of a broken security gate.
</P>
<P>
   There, the men tried to kick down the door of one of the
residents, who called 911, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police alerted administrators of nearby Kyrene de Las Manitas
Elementary School to keep children in the classrooms until the
situation was under control.
</P>
<P>
   The children who live on the western side of Interstate 10 were
able to get onto buses and get home safely, but those who live on
the eastern side of the freeway were kept in their classrooms after
the last bell rang, said Mary Padilla, assistant to the
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police alerted the management of Sierra Palms, which
called tenants individually to instruct them to stay inside.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Parker said he had just hung up with his mother when he
got the call. He looked out the window and saw officers who
motioned him to stay back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned to look at the TV,'' he said. ``We heard Boom! Boom!
Boom! on the door. It scared the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other residents peeked anyway and caught glimpses of officers
approaching the apartment unit where the shooting later broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty scary. We've just been trying to stay behind
walls,'' said Sonsee Shively, who was inside her home with her
2{-year-old daughter Payton. The police ``were aiming their guns
into the unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shively said after the shooting she saw four officers take out a
man who had a nylon stocking mask over his head, with a hole that
exposed the man's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary knowing that we were so close,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours following the shooting, a somber McDonnell,
blinking back tears, announced in a media briefing, ``The officer
has been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment complex remained cordoned off as investigators
piece together the details that led up to the deadly outcome. Chief
Harris was joined at different times by Tempe Police Chief Ron
Burns, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley and Sheriff Joe Arpaio,
whose department was called in after the shooting to serve as
backup to Tempe's SWAT unit.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar's death hit the Chandler Police Department hardest of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Officer John Shearer, who works in the Professional
</P>
<P>
   Standards Unit, said his colleagues used to remark about how
fortunate the department had been not to lose one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk became more muted when motorcycle Officer Jed Gunter
was seriously injured in December, struck by a driver who was later
determined to be legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, people will discuss that we've been lucky for so
long,'' Shearer said. ``I guess before, there was talk (that) we're
due.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gunter's incident, two other Chandler motorcycle officers
have been injured, and on March 17, officers serving a warrant on a
suspected drug house shot dead a man who pointed a gun at one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gone years, all through the mid-'90s, where we had good
luck,'' Shearer said. But ``When it rains, it pours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Summers, a retired Chandler police captain, recalled Friday
that Snedigar spent a day riding around in a motorhome, delivering
presents to children during the holidays as part of KNIX radio
personality W. Steven Martin's annual Christmas toy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a gentleman, always thoughtful and
considerate,'' Summers said. ``He's pretty quiet, but he had a
really good dry sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he was hired, Snedigar's hearing declined, Summers
said. But Summers, who wears hearing aids, assured him he could
continue his career if he also wore hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   Snedigar went on to have a distinguished career, Summers said.
His daily assignment was with the Neighborhood Response Team. Said
Police Chief Harris, ``He is one of the best we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities labored into the night to clear the scene. They
evacuated scores of apartment residents by bus so officers could
conduct a door-to-door search and ensure there are no outstanding
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation Army officials provided food, water and diapers to
accommodate the displaced residents. &QL;

EXPERIENCE CREATES HEAVY FAVORITES

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Experience over youth.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday's qualifying round were any indication, the PPG-Dayton
Indy Lights Championship in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach
could have a different outcome than last month's Indy Lights
Championship in Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The top eight qualifiers on Friday each have raced at least a
season in Indy Lights. At Homestead, the series' first event of the
season, Mexico's Mario Dominguez won and New Zealand's Scott Dixon
finished third. Both are rookies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dixon finished the highest of six rookies in the
qualifier, but ended up ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Felipe Giaffone, Monte Carlo's Philipp Peter and
England's Guy Smith finished in the top three. Giaffone's best lap
was 68.721 seconds at an average speed of 95.552. Peter's best lap
was 69.081 at 95.024, and Smith's was 69.189 at 94.905.
</P>
<P>
   Add that the next five qualifiers are Indy Lights' veterans, and
it would seem experience helps in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say why (the rookies lagged in the qualifier),''
Peter said. ``Maybe they're getting a little slow.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, the qualifier is not necessarily a sign of what
to expect in Sunday's race. If it is, then Brazil could continue
its dominance in the Indy Lights portion of the Toyota Grand Prix
as the past two winners Helio Castro-Neves and Cristiano da Matta
were from Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifier, however, simply is for drivers to make
adjustments and get used to the track. There is another Indy Lights
qualifier, the final one, this morning at 11:15 a.m. in which the
race positions will be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of this qualifier was Long Beach's revamped track,
which has been extended from 1.57 miles and seven turns to 1.824
miles and 11 turns to accommodate the new Aquarium of the Pacific.
The top three finishers agreed that the turns added spice to the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped track could have helped Giaffone, who had trouble
the first day of the Toyota Grand Prix last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be first (on Friday) is a big improvement, but for sure the
track will be faster (today),'' Giaffone said. ``So we must improve
the car again if we want to stay at the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Constant improvements and adjustments are being done to the cars
of the 19 Indy Lights racers. David Pook, a Long Beach native and
son of the Grand Prix's founder Chris Pook, is doing the same
thing. Pook finished 15th with a best lap of 70.772 at 92.377. He
wasn't disappointed with his finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make as many positive changes as possible,
instead of pounding down the fastest lap time,'' Pook said. ``...
Our best days are ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   This 30-minute qualifier had just two interruptions. In the
first interruption, Bakersfield's Casey Mears hit the tire barriers
in turn four a new turn.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with eight minutes left, Santa Monica's Cory Witherill hit
the wall in turn seven.
</P>
<P>
   The session resumed with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   A practice session in the morning preceded the qualifier. A
five-minute stoppage highlighted the session when Chris Menninga
hit the tire barriers in turn six. Pook also skimmed a wall, but it
didn't seem to affect him.

LED BY BURRELL, THE NEW-LOOK NETS BLOW AWAY SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ By their own admission, the New Jersey Nets are hard
to figure out. Without explanation, they lose convincingly to two
of the worst teams in the league and Friday night play nearly
flawless basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Coach Don Casey's call to play with pride, the
Nets beat the SuperSonics badly on the backboards, smothered them
defensively, executed with precision in the halfcourt, and ran
effectively in transition to rout Seattle by 121-91 before a
sold-out crowd of 17,072 at Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, in which the Nets led comfortably from the second
quarter on and matched the highest point total in the league this
season, ended the disappointing West Coast road trip on a high. The
121 points were the most this season in a regulation game and were
the product of a well-balanced attack that placed all five starters
and the sixth man in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   That sixth man was Kerry Kittles, whose poor play cost him his
starting job before the game. Casey, who had taken to sitting
Kittles during the critical stretches of games, moved Scott Burrell
into the first unit as a small forward and slid Kendall Gill over
to shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles, who signed a six-year, $52 million deal on March 13,
claimed not to be disappointed and said the reduced role would
relax him. He was right. Playing his most efficient game in weeks,
Kittles made 7 of 10 shots in scoring 15 points, and keyed the
game-turning run by scoring 11 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected blowout could be attributed to Seattle's fatigue
because the Sonics were playing their third straight game and had
edged Sacramento in overtime Thursday night. But the Sonics (19-20)
are fighting desperately for a Western Conference playoff spot, so
they should have been hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Nets who played as if there was a position
in the post-season on the line. Burrell, playing his best game of
the season, and Stephon Marbury led New Jersey with 18 points
apiece, while Gill and Keith Van Horn added 15. Jamie Feick scored
14.
</P>
<P>
   The shuffling of the lineup paid off immediately as Burrell
played some of his best basketball of the season in the first
quarter. With the Nets trailing by 3 points, he scored 8 straight,
including 6 on consecutive 3-pointers. The Sonics regained the lead
briefly, but when Kittles replaced Gill with 4 minutes 7 seconds
left in the quarter, the Nets took off.
</P>
<P>
   After missing his first shot _ a 3-pointer from the left wing _
Kittles scored on a driving four-footer over two defenders, then
slapped away a defensive rebound from an unsuspecting Sonics player
and finished with a layup. Marbury, who played a tremendous floor
game in recording eight assists in the first half, followed with
two free throws to give the Nets 34 first-quarter points, their
most this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles continued to play the slick game that made him one of
the league's brightest young stars and scored 5 more points as the
Nets completed a 15-0 run to take a 16-point lead two minutes into
the second quarter. When Kittles hit a stylish reverse layup in
transition to put the Nets ahead by 41-25, the home team was loudly
booed by its fans.
</P>
<P>
   While Kittles did his thing on the perimeter, Feick dominated
inside the paint. Feick _ who was hustling to outplay Olden
Polynice and the beleaguered four-time All-Star Vin Baker _ matched
his season high for points with 12 in the first half. He also
grabbed seven rebounds to lead the Nets to a 30-21 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles, Burrell and Feick, who combined for 36 first-half
points, were so potent that the Nets took a 54-43 lead into the
locker room despite little production from their leading scorers,
Marbury and Van Horn. Though he distributed the ball superbly,
Marbury hit only 2 of 11 shots in scoring 7 points, and Van Horn
was unusually inactive with just 4 points.

WED.)  
  
 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When you stand at the site of a massacre, two things happen.
First, you wonder about the depths of the human spirit. And then
you ask yourself how many lies can be told about it.
</P>
<P>
   The highway of death between Prizren and Djakovica _ on which
the Serbs say NATO slaughtered 74 Kosovo Albanian refugees in a
series of bombing raids _ is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after I slipped on a dead man's torso near an old
Turkish bridge, less than a day after I stood by the body of a
young and beautiful girl _ her eyes gently staring at me between
half-closed lids, the bottom half of her head bathed in blood _ I
watched James Shea, NATO's spokesman, trying to explain why NATO
still didn't know what had happened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All those torn and mangled bodies I had just seen _ the old man
ripped in half and blasted into a tree at Gradis, the smoldering
skeleton with one bloody, still flesh-adhering foot over the back
of a trailer at Terezick Most, the dead, naked man slouched over
the steering wheel of a burned tractor _ all, apparently, were a
mystery to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps The Independent can help clear up this unhappy state
of affairs with some evidence _ damning perhaps, certainly
important _ from the scene. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 225) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But first a pause, to reflect on atrocities. The Serbs are
``ethnically cleansing'' Kosovo. It is a war crime. If NATO
massacred the 74 Albanians, the Serbs have killed many more.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, I saw four buses in Kosovo packed with terrified
Albanian women and children and old men, black curtains at the
windows of the buses in an attempt to hide their presence.
</P>
<P>
   And at a square in the otherwise deserted town of Pozeranje,
near Urosevac, I passed at least 200 pathetic Kosovo Albanians,
exhausted, frightened, carrying plastic bags of clothes and
battered holdalls, the old women in scarves, the young women
clutching children to their bosoms, the old men wearing black
berets. All were standing tightly together for protection, like
animals.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting for another bus, I suppose _ and, not for the
first time these past three weeks, I thought of other scenes, in
Eastern Europe just over half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Pozeranje, I was seeing these poor people _ for a few seconds
only, from a vehicle window _ at the very moment of their
dispossession, on the very day of their ``cleansing,'' within hours
of their arrival among the flotsam of humanity along the Serbian
border 12 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wickedness I saw, the very moment of evil. When I drove
through Pozeranje again Thursday, it was empty save for four horses
running loose on the main road.
</P>
<P>
   So why dwell on the 74 dead Kosovo Albanians whose remains have
been left in such indignity along the Prizren-Djakovica road?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Serbs wanted us to see them? Because NATO was
already embarrassed by the Serb claims of their slaughter? Because
it ``evens the balance'' _ it does not _ between Serbia and its
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   No, I suspect that the road of death and its terrible corpses is
a challenge not to NATO's propaganda but to its morality.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, we are repeatedly told, represents ``us,'' the good moral,
decent people who oppose lies and murder. So NATO has a case to
answer _ for all our sakes. And the evidence lies on that awful
road with its eviscerated people and its bomb craters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; ARTICLE RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO ``thinks'' it bombed a tractor on a road north of
Djakovica. Indeed, NATO's military spokesman would say Thursday
only that is was ``possibly'' a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea _ or ``Jamie'' as he enjoins us to call him _ says he is
still trying to find out what happened to the 74 refugees. NATO
needs more time, he tells us, to assess what it bombed and did not
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Well perhaps I can help Jamie to speed up his enquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four air-strike locations, I have visited the first three
_ at Velika Krusa, Gradis and Terzick Most _ and they run
consecutively from east to west along the Prizren-Djakovica road.
</P>
<P>
   At the third, I came across four bomb craters. I saw _ and in
some cases collected _ a number of bomb and missile parts. At
Gradis, I came across part of a missile circuit board, its
congealed wiring attached to a plate which contains a
manufacturer's code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Independent carried some of this. But NATO will need
the fullest possible information to trace this piece of ordnance
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The full code (the brackets are empty on the original) reads as
follows: SCHEM 872110 ( ) 96214ASSY8721122 -MSN 63341 (remaining
figures obscured by detonation damage).
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take NATO armaments experts more than a few hours
to find out where that code came from _ indeed what aircraft
carried and fired that missile. Its pilot _ if it was a NATO bomb _
will then be able to explain why he fired it.
</P>
<P>
   At Velika Krusa, I found the fusing of an aerial bomb next to a
smashed trailer containing the belongings of 35 Albanian refugees,
four of whom _ all women - were killed in this air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I also have in my possession what may be a swivel system to an
aerial bomb. It is one-inch square, very damaged (Xs stand for the
illegible parts) _ but carries the code: ``X6214 - 837XNY.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, I found a large bomb part, green in color but with
stencilled color code in English, whose full code reads: WING
ASSEMBLY 96214ASSY 78-201872 872128 DATE OF MFG 3/78.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar bomb part contained the numbers: 96214ASSY
887760-4.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, too, part of what appeared to be a detonator
contained a section of manufacturer's name: - TER Co Inc 13250.
</P>
<P>
   Again, NATO intelligence authorities should be able to work out
some of those codings within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of a bomb had the single word ``BENDIX'' stamped
on the metal. Other bomb and missile fragments contained moving fin
assembly parts. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shrapnel was so sharp it that it cut the hands of
those who touched it. The corpses showed what happened when the
bomb parts shredded them alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bodies lying in a field at Terezicki Most _ that of a
man in his 40s _ had the top of his head cut cleanly off, along
with his brain and eyes so that his face had turned into an actor's
mask.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman in a purple pullover and brightly flowered
skirt, with her eyes open and a pale waxen face, had had her neck
cut open. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM; ARTICLE RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, maybe NATO will find that these bomb and missile assembly
parts belonged to weapons sold to other governments. Perhaps they
will be able to claim that a Balkan nation was given the aerial
bomb whose wing assembly number is recorded above.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe NATO will say that the Yugoslav air force _
of which not a single aircraft has been seen in the air since the
start of the NATO bombardment _ carried out this massacre of
Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 600 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yugoslav army officers at the bomb sites made no
attempt to prevent photographers taking pictures of the larger
pieces (though they showed no interest in the codings and seemed
unable to understand my interest). And I saw one photographer drag
a piece of bomb several meters and turn it over for a better
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But given the time available and the chaos on the road _ NATO
air raids were going on within a mile of us as we examined the bomb
sites _ it is impossible to believe that the Serbs had time to
construct these terrible scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, there was evidence of strafing as well as aerial
bombing. Huge troughs had been cut into the earth, each two feet in
length, separated by up to 10 feet and unevenly separated as if a
drunken monster had lurched through the field and on to the road.
</P>
<P>
   These appeared identical to the cannon fire marks I found at the
scene of American A-10 ``Tankbuster'' strikes in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no burned-out tanks on the Prizren-Djakovica
road; only tractors and trailers and an old milk-yellow van turned
inside out by the explosion which destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along miles of the same road were other tractors, some scorched,
most abandoned, apparently in panic, at the side of the road. The
few Kosovo Albanians we found spoke of thousands on the road that
day _ April 14 _ and it appears that they were moving in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have said they came from the border, were moved to
Djakovica and then told by Serb forces to move to Prizren. Most say
they had no Serb escorts. I saw those awful buses with the black
curtains moving in both directions near Prizren on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' is not a precise art. Nor is fear.
Undoubtedly some of the Kosovo Albanians on the road were terrified
of the aircraft which bombed them in four separate locations. The
fourth attack took place at Meja on the other side of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't difficult for me to imagine the terror on that road.
While we were picking our way through the corpses of Terezicki
Most, NATO planes dropped bombs less than a mile away _ cluster
bombs from the sound of them _ and a series of massive explosions
changed the air pressure around us.

<P>
   We watched the skies. From time to time, we could hear _ but not
see _ NATO jets power-diving. Columns of dark smoke billowed over
the bright green fields.
</P>
<P>
   But we found no military wreckage. Not a smashed rifle, not a
piece of armor. There was a lot of glass on parts of the road _ not
a commodity to find in large amounts on military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The only victims of these air strikes appeared to be civilians.
At Terezicki Most, I counted 13 corpses and other body parts. A
missile had rammed a tractor, setting fire to its trailer and
incinerating all inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prizren hospital mortuary, six corpses lay on the
concrete floor. There was a woman, breasts exposed, on the right, a
delicate child close to her with a bloodied face.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper with the number ``1'' written on it had been
pinned to the shroud half covering an unknown man. We had names for
the rest: Fikrija Sulja, Imer Celja, Ferat Bajrami, Persad Sanfjli
and Nerdgivare Zecin. &QL;

<P>
   Along the road, there were clothes and rags and broken cups and
saucers beside the bomb sites and photograph albums and family
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up photographs of a pretty young Kosovo Albanian woman
with a lace blouse and curls and long black earrings, of a smiling
four-year old boy in a T-shirt standing on a sofa behind a vase of
sunflowers, of the boy's parents and two other brothers on the same
sofa, of two old women in Muslim scarves and of a blood group
certificate _ Rhesus positive _ for a woman named Rama Resmije,
dated March 16, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Did she live or die? Were the little boy and his parents and
brothers torn apart in the air strikes on Wednesday? And what of
the pretty woman in the earrings?
</P>
<P>
   If they survived, they deserve to know why their family and
friends died. If they were killed, we deserve to know why.
</P>
<P>
   That these people were massacred in air strikes I do not doubt.
I fear very much that they were slaughtered by NATO. If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   Was this some terrible error about which NATO _ after its attack
on a passenger train last week _ fears to tell us? Or did some NATO
pilots (and this massacre needed three or four planes) make an
error and agree to cover it up?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ most awful of all _ did a NATO pilot do something terrible,
inexplicable, two days ago and then lie about it?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, I suspect, can tell us. And those of us who walked among
the innocent dead on the road from Prizren to Djakovica this week
are waiting to hear Jamie tell the truth. &QL;

BROWN SUFFERS DEFEAT, BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Andy Ashby pitched a five-hit shutout. He dominated
the Los Angeles Dodgers, was never even tested and looked like a
$100 million pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people noticed. They were too busy trying to make
Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown feel like the most hated man south of
Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since signing his lucrative offseason deal,
Brown returned to the place he ruled less than a year ago. He is no
longer welcomed here.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres beat the Dodgers 3-0 Friday at Qualcomm
Stadium, but to most of the 48,943 in attendance a win against the
Dodgers was secondary. This was about beating Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the reaction would be, but I didn't think
it would be like that,'' Padres left fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``He
made a decision good for him and good for his family, so I can't
fault him. That's why I was surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown heard hearty boos when he took the mound in the bottom of
the first inning, when he batted twice and, especially, when he was
taken out of the game with one out in the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were so revved up in hopes Brown would collapse that a
few even made a papier-mache pinata of the right-hander. They
paraded it around the stadium, stopped behind home plate and beat
it repeatedly with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear them, but it's no different than playing at Atlanta
or in Houston in the playoffs,'' Brown said. ``That's their
prerogative. I can't do anything about that. I play for the
Dodgers. I don't think they're real popular down here.''
</P>
<P>
   True, they don't like the Dodgers down here, but Brown is even
less popular.
</P>
<P>
   When he was taken out of the game with one out in the sixth
inning, `Midnight Train to Georgia,'' a song by Gladys Knight and
the Pips, serenaded Brown as he walked to the dugout. He's from
Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed three runs (two earned) on 10 hits and struck out
nine in 61/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had to throw a shutout to give us a chance and I
didn't do that,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   For four innings, Brown (1-1) did that, but he also allowed the
leadoff batter to reach base in four straight innings. In three of
those innings _ the fifth, sixth and seventh _ the Padres pushed
across a run.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 1-0 lead on a sacrifice fly by Quilvio Veras.
John Vander Wal had an RBI single and Wally Joyner doubled in the
Padres' final run, which knocked Brown out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do a very good job of getting the first guy out,''
Brown said. ``I battled for a while, but eventually it came back to
haunt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ashby (2-1) breezed. The Dodgers didn't get more than
one hit in any inning and had two runners on base only once. Ashby,
who struck out eight, retired 12 of the last 14 Dodgers he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Ashby, he was outstanding,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``That's the best I've seen him pitch. We have some
pretty good hitters and he pretty much had his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Sunday's rainout with Colorado was rescheduled as part of
a day-night doubleheader July 22. A 7:10 p.m. start will be added
to the already-scheduled 1:10 p.m. game.... Second baseman Eric
Young, who left the Dodgers game Thursday with tightness in his
right calf, started against the Padres.

WED.)  
  
 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When you stand at the site of a massacre, two things happen.
First, you wonder about the depths of the human spirit. And then
you ask yourself how many lies can be told about it.
</P>
<P>
   The highway of death between Prizren and Djakovica _ on which
the Serbs say NATO slaughtered 74 Kosovo Albanian refugees in a
series of bombing raids _ is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after I slipped on a dead man's torso near an old
Turkish bridge, less than a day after I stood by the body of a
young and beautiful girl _ her eyes gently staring at me between
half-closed lids, the bottom half of her head bathed in blood _ I
watched James Shea, NATO's spokesman, trying to explain why NATO
still didn't know what had happened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All those torn and mangled bodies I had just seen _ the old man
ripped in half and blasted into a tree at Gradis, the smoldering
skeleton with one bloody, still flesh-adhering foot over the back
of a trailer at Terezick Most, the dead, naked man slouched over
the steering wheel of a burned tractor _ all, apparently, were a
mystery to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps The Independent can help clear up this unhappy state
of affairs with some evidence _ damning perhaps, certainly
important _ from the scene. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 225) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But first a pause, to reflect on atrocities. The Serbs are
``ethnically cleansing'' Kosovo. It is a war crime. If NATO
massacred the 74 Albanians, the Serbs have killed many more.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, I saw four buses in Kosovo packed with terrified
Albanian women and children and old men, black curtains at the
windows of the buses in an attempt to hide their presence.
</P>
<P>
   And at a square in the otherwise deserted town of Pozeranje,
near Urosevac, I passed at least 200 pathetic Kosovo Albanians,
exhausted, frightened, carrying plastic bags of clothes and
battered holdalls, the old women in scarves, the young women
clutching children to their bosoms, the old men wearing black
berets. All were standing tightly together for protection, like
animals.
</P>
<P>
   They were waiting for another bus, I suppose _ and, not for the
first time these past three weeks, I thought of other scenes, in
Eastern Europe just over half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   At Pozeranje, I was seeing these poor people _ for a few seconds
only, from a vehicle window _ at the very moment of their
dispossession, on the very day of their ``cleansing,'' within hours
of their arrival among the flotsam of humanity along the Serbian
border 12 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wickedness I saw, the very moment of evil. When I drove
through Pozeranje again Thursday, it was empty save for four horses
running loose on the main road.
</P>
<P>
   So why dwell on the 74 dead Kosovo Albanians whose remains have
been left in such indignity along the Prizren-Djakovica road?
</P>
<P>
   Because the Serbs wanted us to see them? Because NATO was
already embarrassed by the Serb claims of their slaughter? Because
it ``evens the balance'' _ it does not _ between Serbia and its
enemies?
</P>
<P>
   No, I suspect that the road of death and its terrible corpses is
a challenge not to NATO's propaganda but to its morality.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, we are repeatedly told, represents ``us,'' the good moral,
decent people who oppose lies and murder. So NATO has a case to
answer _ for all our sakes. And the evidence lies on that awful
road with its eviscerated people and its bomb craters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM; ARTICLE RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO ``thinks'' it bombed a tractor on a road north of
Djakovica. Indeed, NATO's military spokesman would say Thursday
only that is was ``possibly'' a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea _ or ``Jamie'' as he enjoins us to call him _ says he is
still trying to find out what happened to the 74 refugees. NATO
needs more time, he tells us, to assess what it bombed and did not
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Well perhaps I can help Jamie to speed up his enquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four air-strike locations, I have visited the first three
_ at Velika Krusa, Gradis and Terzick Most _ and they run
consecutively from east to west along the Prizren-Djakovica road.
</P>
<P>
   At the third, I came across four bomb craters. I saw _ and in
some cases collected _ a number of bomb and missile parts. At
Gradis, I came across part of a missile circuit board, its
congealed wiring attached to a plate which contains a
manufacturer's code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Independent carried some of this. But NATO will need
the fullest possible information to trace this piece of ordnance
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The full code (the brackets are empty on the original) reads as
follows: SCHEM 872110 ( ) 96214ASSY8721122 -MSN 63341 (remaining
figures obscured by detonation damage).
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take NATO armaments experts more than a few hours
to find out where that code came from _ indeed what aircraft
carried and fired that missile. Its pilot _ if it was a NATO bomb _
will then be able to explain why he fired it.
</P>
<P>
   At Velika Krusa, I found the fusing of an aerial bomb next to a
smashed trailer containing the belongings of 35 Albanian refugees,
four of whom _ all women - were killed in this air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I also have in my possession what may be a swivel system to an
aerial bomb. It is one-inch square, very damaged (Xs stand for the
illegible parts) _ but carries the code: ``X6214 - 837XNY.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, I found a large bomb part, green in color but with
stencilled color code in English, whose full code reads: WING
ASSEMBLY 96214ASSY 78-201872 872128 DATE OF MFG 3/78.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar bomb part contained the numbers: 96214ASSY
887760-4.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, too, part of what appeared to be a detonator
contained a section of manufacturer's name: - TER Co Inc 13250.
</P>
<P>
   Again, NATO intelligence authorities should be able to work out
some of those codings within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of a bomb had the single word ``BENDIX'' stamped
on the metal. Other bomb and missile fragments contained moving fin
assembly parts. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shrapnel was so sharp it that it cut the hands of
those who touched it. The corpses showed what happened when the
bomb parts shredded them alive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bodies lying in a field at Terezicki Most _ that of a
man in his 40s _ had the top of his head cut cleanly off, along
with his brain and eyes so that his face had turned into an actor's
mask.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman in a purple pullover and brightly flowered
skirt, with her eyes open and a pale waxen face, had had her neck
cut open. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM; ARTICLE RESUMES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, maybe NATO will find that these bomb and missile assembly
parts belonged to weapons sold to other governments. Perhaps they
will be able to claim that a Balkan nation was given the aerial
bomb whose wing assembly number is recorded above.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe NATO will say that the Yugoslav air force _
of which not a single aircraft has been seen in the air since the
start of the NATO bombardment _ carried out this massacre of
Albanian refugees. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 600 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yugoslav army officers at the bomb sites made no
attempt to prevent photographers taking pictures of the larger
pieces (though they showed no interest in the codings and seemed
unable to understand my interest). And I saw one photographer drag
a piece of bomb several meters and turn it over for a better
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   But given the time available and the chaos on the road _ NATO
air raids were going on within a mile of us as we examined the bomb
sites _ it is impossible to believe that the Serbs had time to
construct these terrible scenes.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, there was evidence of strafing as well as aerial
bombing. Huge troughs had been cut into the earth, each two feet in
length, separated by up to 10 feet and unevenly separated as if a
drunken monster had lurched through the field and on to the road.
</P>
<P>
   These appeared identical to the cannon fire marks I found at the
scene of American A-10 ``Tankbuster'' strikes in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no burned-out tanks on the Prizren-Djakovica
road; only tractors and trailers and an old milk-yellow van turned
inside out by the explosion which destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Along miles of the same road were other tractors, some scorched,
most abandoned, apparently in panic, at the side of the road. The
few Kosovo Albanians we found spoke of thousands on the road that
day _ April 14 _ and it appears that they were moving in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors have said they came from the border, were moved to
Djakovica and then told by Serb forces to move to Prizren. Most say
they had no Serb escorts. I saw those awful buses with the black
curtains moving in both directions near Prizren on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnic cleansing'' is not a precise art. Nor is fear.
Undoubtedly some of the Kosovo Albanians on the road were terrified
of the aircraft which bombed them in four separate locations. The
fourth attack took place at Meja on the other side of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't difficult for me to imagine the terror on that road.
While we were picking our way through the corpses of Terezicki
Most, NATO planes dropped bombs less than a mile away _ cluster
bombs from the sound of them _ and a series of massive explosions
changed the air pressure around us.
</P>
<P>
   We watched the skies. From time to time, we could hear _ but not
see _ NATO jets power-diving. Columns of dark smoke billowed over
the bright green fields.
</P>
<P>
   But we found no military wreckage. Not a smashed rifle, not a
piece of armor. There was a lot of glass on parts of the road _ not
a commodity to find in large amounts on military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The only victims of these air strikes appeared to be civilians.
At Terezicki Most, I counted 13 corpses and other body parts. A
missile had rammed a tractor, setting fire to its trailer and
incinerating all inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the Prizren hospital mortuary, six corpses lay on the
concrete floor. There was a woman, breasts exposed, on the right, a
delicate child close to her with a bloodied face.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of paper with the number ``1'' written on it had been
pinned to the shroud half covering an unknown man. We had names for
the rest: Fikrija Sulja, Imer Celja, Ferat Bajrami, Persad Sanfjli
and Nerdgivare Zecin. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. ARTICLE CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Along the road, there were clothes and rags and broken cups and
saucers beside the bomb sites and photograph albums and family
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up photographs of a pretty young Kosovo Albanian woman
with a lace blouse and curls and long black earrings, of a smiling
four-year old boy in a T-shirt standing on a sofa behind a vase of
sunflowers, of the boy's parents and two other brothers on the same

the Serbs say NATO slaughtered 74 Kosovo Albanian refugees in a
series of bombing raids _ is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after I slipped on a dead man's torso near an old
Turkish bridge, less than a day after I stood by the body of a
young and beautiful girl _ her eyes gently staring at me between
half-closed lids, the bottom half of her head bathed in blood _ I
watched James Shea, NATO's spokesman, trying to explain why NATO
still didn't know what had happened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All those torn and mangled bodies I had just seen _ the old man
ripped in half and blasted into a tree at Gradis, the smoldering
skeleton with one bloody, still flesh-adhering foot over the back
of a trailer at Terezick Most, the dead, naked man slouched over
the steering wheel of a burned tractor _ all, apparently, were a
mystery to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps The Independent can help clear up this unhappy state
of affairs with some evidence _ damning perhaps, certainly
important _ from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   NATO ``thinks'' it bombed a tractor on a road north of
Djakovica. Indeed, NATO's military spokesman would say Thursday
only that is was ``possibly'' a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Shea _ or ``Jamie'' as he enjoins us to call him _ says he is
still trying to find out what happened to the 74 refugees. NATO
needs more time, he tells us, to assess what it bombed and did not
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Well perhaps I can help Jamie to speed up his enquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four air-strike locations, I have visited the first three
_ at Velika Krusa, Gradis and Terzick Most _ and they run
consecutively from east to west along the Prizren-Djakovica road.
</P>
<P>
   At the third, I came across four bomb craters. I saw _ and in
some cases collected _ a number of bomb and missile parts. At
Gradis, I came across part of a missile circuit board, its
congealed wiring attached to a plate which contains a
manufacturer's code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Independent carried some of this. But NATO will need
the fullest possible information to trace this piece of ordnance
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The full code (the brackets are empty on the original) reads as
follows: SCHEM 872110 ( ) 96214ASSY8721122 -MSN 63341 (remaining
figures obscured by detonation damage).
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take NATO armaments experts more than a few hours
to find out where that code came from _ indeed what aircraft
carried and fired that missile. Its pilot _ if it was a NATO bomb _
will then be able to explain why he fired it.
</P>
<P>
   At Velika Krusa, I found the fusing of an aerial bomb next to a
smashed trailer containing the belongings of 35 Albanian refugees,
four of whom _ all women - were killed in this air strike.
</P>
<P>
   I also have in my possession what may be a swivel system to an
aerial bomb. It is one-inch square, very damaged (Xs stand for the
illegible parts) _ but carries the code: ``X6214 - 837XNY.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, I found a large bomb part, green in color but with
stencilled color code in English, whose full code reads: WING
ASSEMBLY 96214ASSY 78-201872 872128 DATE OF MFG 3/78.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar bomb part contained the numbers: 96214ASSY
887760-4.
</P>
<P>
   At Gradis, too, part of what appeared to be a detonator
contained a section of manufacturer's name: - TER Co Inc 13250.
</P>
<P>
   Again, NATO intelligence authorities should be able to work out
some of those codings within a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of a bomb had the single word ``BENDIX'' stamped
on the metal. Other bomb and missile fragments contained moving fin
assembly parts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, maybe NATO will find that these bomb and missile assembly
parts belonged to weapons sold to other governments. Perhaps they
will be able to claim that a Balkan nation was given the aerial
bomb whose wing assembly number is recorded above.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe NATO will say that the Yugoslav air force _
of which not a single aircraft has been seen in the air since the
start of the NATO bombardment _ carried out this massacre of
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road, there were clothes and rags and broken cups and
saucers beside the bomb sites and photograph albums and family
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up photographs of a pretty young Kosovo Albanian woman
with a lace blouse and curls and long black earrings, of a smiling
four-year old boy in a T-shirt standing on a sofa behind a vase of
sunflowers, of the boy's parents and two other brothers on the same
sofa, of two old women in Muslim scarves and of a blood group
certificate _ Rhesus positive _ for a woman named Rama Resmije,
dated March 16, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Did she live or die? Were the little boy and his parents and
brothers torn apart in the air strikes on Wednesday? And what of
the pretty woman in the earrings?
</P>
<P>
   If they survived, they deserve to know why their family and
friends died. If they were killed, we deserve to know why.
</P>
<P>
   That these people were massacred in air strikes I do not doubt.
I fear very much that they were slaughtered by NATO. If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   Was this some terrible error about which NATO _ after its attack
on a passenger train last week _ fears to tell us? Or did some NATO
pilots (and this massacre needed three or four planes) make an
error and agree to cover it up?
</P>
<P>
   Or _ most awful of all _ did a NATO pilot do something terrible,
inexplicable, two days ago and then lie about it?
</P>
<P>
   NATO, I suspect, can tell us. And those of us who walked among
the innocent dead on the road from Prizren to Djakovica this week
are waiting to hear Jamie tell the truth. &QL;

KINGS SHUT OUT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Earlier in the year, Ray Ferraro was talking
about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But as his 15th season reaches its conclusion, Ferraro isn't
talking about it anymore. He wants to keep playing, and he wants to
play for the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro scored 17 seconds Friday night's game against the San
Jose Sharks, and with Stephane Fiset stopping 32 shots, it was the
only goal the Kings would need as they recorded a 2-0 victory
before a crowd of 17,483 at the San Jose Arena. Fiset's shutout was
his third this season and the 15th of his career. Rob Blake scored
the game's other goal, on a power play four minutes after Ferraro's
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, Ferraro had scored twice, including
the overtime winner, in a 4-3 victory over the Mighty Ducks at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to show you can play,'' said Ferraro, 34, who
acknowledged a week ago that he has decided to continue his career.
``I want (Kings management) to know I'm still hungry, I still have
desire. Obviously, a few goals don't hurt, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the third in a row for the Kings (32-44-5), who
conclude the season Sunday afternoon at the Forum against St.
Louis. The victory enabled the Mighty Ducks to clinch sixth place
in the Western Conference, setting up a first-round playoff date
with the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (31-33-17) had hoped to overtake the Ducks by beating
the Kings on Friday and the Ducks tonight in San Jose, but instead
will settle for seventh place and a daunting first-round series
with powerful Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ferraro, he acknowledged Kings management already may
have reached a decision on his future. General Manager Dave Taylor
is deferring personnel decisions until after the season. Ferraro's
contract expires with the conclusion of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd imagine they already know what they want to do,'' he said.
``I'd imagine I'll find out next week whether they want me or not.
I sure as heck hope they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro's goals Thursday snapped a 24-game goal-scoring drought.
He has 13 goals this season, and less than a week from now, he'll
be in Bristol, Conn., serving as a studio analyst on ESPN playoff
telecasts. But he said no full-time television offer could sway him
from returning to the ice for at least another season, if not with
the Kings then elsewhere in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to play,'' he said. ``Hopefully, they feel the
same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky tribute: The Kings will delay the start of Sunday's game
to show the telecast of the Wayne Gretzky retirement ceremony on
the video scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Galley update: Defenseman Garry Galley said the next two or
three weeks will determine whether or not he will need surgery to
repair a torn abdominal muscle that has sidelined him for the last
two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Galley, who turned 36 Friday, said he thinks the tear dates to
two years ago when he was with the Buffalo Sabres. He was able to
rehabilitate the original injury without surgery and is hoping to
do the same thing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Galley said. ``It would have been nice
to finish the year, even though it was bothering me.''
</P>
<P>
   Galley said if he needs surgery, recovery time will be 6 to 8
weeks, meaning he'll be ready for the start of training camp in
September.
</P>
<P>
   In other injury news, rookie defenseman Jan Nemecek suffered a
bruised knee Thursday night against the Mighty Ducks and did not
play against the Sharks.

TEMPERS FLARE IN M'S LOSS

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They held Friday night's Mariners-Angels game
at the wrong Disney theme park. A more fitting setting would have
been Frontier Land, not Edison Field, because that wasn't a
ballgame as much as a wild West showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The principal gunslingers were Mariners left-hander Jamie Moyer
and Angels hitters Troy Glaus, Andy Sheets and Todd Greene, with
both managers and third-base coaches, and even fans, getting
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won, 9-5, sending the M's to their fourth defeat in a
row after being swept at home by the Texas Rangers. They did it
when a pitcher's duel morphed into insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of crazy things happening,'' said Greene, the
Angels' DH whose seventh-inning grand slam drove Moyer from the
game. ``Any time you're playing division games, those games are
important. These games against Seattle count just the same as the
ones at the end of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer and Angels right-hander Tim Belcher were tied, 2-2,
heading to the bottom of the sixth. Moyer, who struck out the side
in the fifth, got one out, then allowed a double off the top of the
left-center field wall to Angels rookie Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   Greene followed with a fly out, and Charlie O'Brien grounded to
the hole between third and short. Giomar Guevara went to his right
for a nice stop, but rushed his throw, bouncing it three times and
pulling David Segui off first, allowing the slow-footed O'Brien to
reach on a single. That scored Glaus, giving Anaheim a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The light-hitting shortstop Sheets, an ex-Mariner, followed with
a homer to center field off a 1-2 change-up that Moyer called a
``horrible pitch.'' That put the Angels ahead, 5-2, and, coming as
it did after the O'Brien hit, accentuated the loss of shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, who is out three to five more weeks with torn knee
cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only miss Alex in the field, but we miss him at the
plate,'' said Moyer, who did not need to mention that Seattle had
only five hits. ``It's not one-sided. I know they're out there
doing their best, you can't fault them for that. We're all human
beings. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 39,635 thought it knew what Moyer was doing. He hit
Orlando Palmeiro, coming inside with a fastball on the Angels
lead-off hitter, who had been taking Moyer the other way and, Moyer
said, needed to be moved off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that precipitated a seventh-inning shouting match
between M's third base coach Steve Smith and Anaheim third base
coach Larry Bowa is unknown; neither participant nor manager was
commenting. Whatever the cause, the blow-up _ which occured with
Seattle batting and Smith in the field _ was just the first of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, after allowing a pair of one-out
singles, Moyer hit Glaus on the hip. Glaus motioned toward Moyer,
players rose to the top step in both dugouts, and home plate umpire
Mike Reilly warned both benches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to throw at someone to load the bases,
No. 1,'' Moyer said. ``No. 2, who am I going to intimidate? No. 3,
we're still in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As Angels manager Terry Collins argued the warning, Mariners
manager Lou Piniella emerged from Seattle's dugout, irate at a fan,
who said he had called Piniella an ``idiot'' for leaving Moyer in
the game. Piniella had to be restrained by security officials as he
berated the fan, who was escorted from his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy there doesn't even belong in a ballpark,'' Piniella
said. ``He belongs in a mental hospital. He was just yelling the
whole time, threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   The fan had laughed last. The next batter Moyer faced was
Greene, who hit his first career grand slam off a high change-up
and gave the Angels a 9-2 lead. Moyer left to boos, tipping his cap
on his way off the field. The fan, who remained in the park in a
different seating area, was later cheered by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows the idiocy of some people,'' Moyer said. ``They
perceive what they see and they're entitled to their opinion, but
when it gets to the point where they're screaming and hollering at
people _ I'd be interested to see 25,000 people go up to the
workplace of those fans and hoot and holler at them and see how
they crumble under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (1-2) allowed nine runs on 12 hits over 61/3 innings,
running his earned-run average to 10.42. Belcher, gave up two runs
in seven inning and won his first game for the Angels. Seattle had
shown interest in Belcher before backing out, and the right-hander
got $10.2 million over two years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players Seattle signed instead, outfielder John
Mabry, was a bright spot Friday night, throwing out two runners and
hitting a three-run homer in the ninth.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A day after winning what Sonics coach Paul Westphal
deemed the ``biggest game,'' there was no escaping the trend that
has followed his team.
</P>
<P>
   Things immediately got worse for the Sonics, who fell flat
Friday night at KeyArena during a disturbing 121-91 loss to the New
Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, who jumped around frantically after Thursday's
emotional overtime victory in Sacramento, wasn't even around for
the end of this one. He was excused with 6:43 left in the fourth
quarter after receiving back-to-back technical fouls for arguing a
call.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's ejection was the only fire the Sonics showed on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (19-20) tied their worst defeat this season _ Utah
pummeled them 110-80 on Feb. 20. Defensively, the Sonics gave up
the most points in an NBA regular-season game this season.
</P>
<P>
   The ramification of the loss was just as brutal.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns beat the Dallas Mavericks Friday night which,
combined with the Sonics' loss, dropped Seattle to the eighth seed
in the Western Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are now half a game behind the Suns, whom the Sonics
face Sunday at America West Arena. Phoenix has already beaten the
Sonics twice, clinching the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State moved ahead of Sacramento and is now just two games
behind the Sonics for the last playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the schedule caught got us,'' Westphal said, ``but I'm
not quitting on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it would just be simple to say that New Jersey (11-28)
caught the Sonics at a most opportune time.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the Sonics playing their third game in three days,
but they were also coming off a victory. These days that spells
trouble for the Sonics, who have been in a win-one-day,
lose-the-next whirlwind the past nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sonics won back-to-back games was March 14-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can do is try to get as much rest as
possible,'' said Hersey Hawkins, who scored 21 points on 9-of-16
shooting. ``That's the remedy when you have three games in three
nights. I could see that we were tired. The rotations weren't as
crisp, and getting back on defense wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics appeared drained and unable to keep up with the Nets'
younger, fresher legs from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Sonics' 40-percent shooting was mystifying considering
their opponent. The Nets gave up 120 points to Denver on Wednesday
night, and 109 points to the Los Angeles Clippers the night before.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which is 4-17 on the road, could be considered the
most disappointing team in the league. But the Nets have also been
one of the more handicapped _ New Jersey players have missed a
total of 119 games because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were even without their leader and best rebounder,
Jayson Williams, who is out for the season with a broken right leg.
Nonetheless, the Sonics were the ones crippled most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense gave up open jumper after jumper, and could not
contain the Nets' dribble penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Fans booed the team's effort for the second time this season at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans didn't like it. We didn't either,'' Westphal said.
``I don't want to make anything sound like excuses but the reality
is we know we can play better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are banged up, guys are tired and we have some older
players.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the team's youngest contributors is hurting the most
among the starters. Vin Baker was limited again by his sore right
knee. He played just 28 minutes and finished with just two points
and one rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton's 29 points and 11 assists led the Sonics. Without
Baker, though, the team was weakened inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting,'' Baker said. ``I'm too thick-headed sometimes
about playing. But I'm hurting my team more than I'm helping.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the Sonics would have done much better with
a healthy Baker. New Jersey had things going its way that much.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 54-43 at halftime, the Nets opened a 21-point lead in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared in the fourth when Sonics center Olden Polynice
was called for a flagrant foul while trying to block Jamie Feick's
shot. Just seconds later, Sonics rookie Rashard Lewis drew a foul
guarding Kendall Gill.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Westphal blew up at the officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the sequence, New Jersey shot eight straight free
throws. The Nets went ahead 104-78 with 5:11 left in the game.
Their biggest lead was 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing good about a loss like this is that it's easy
to bounce back,'' Hawkins said. ``Not to say that I like our
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we're better than what we're showing. It just
would have been much tougher if it had been a close game.''

ANGELS' GREENE SLAMS MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Lou Piniella and Jamie Moyer gave Friday
night's Angels-Mariners game the spark it needed and Todd Greene
responded by setting off the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Pennant fever in April? The atmosphere certainly coaxed that
sentiment into a matchup that had practically everything you'd find
in a similar meeting in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's first career grand slam highlighted a wild four-run
seventh inning as the Angels did the talking with their bats in a
9-5 victory in front of an enthusiastic 39,635 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher sparkled on the mound for the Angels, coming through
with the kind of performance the team expected from him after
signing the right-hander to a $10 million contract in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (1-1) went seven innings, striking out four, allowing
two earned runs and limiting the Mariners to four hits while
throwing 96 pitches and getting stronger as the game progressed. He
retired 16 of the final 19 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was outstanding tonight,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``He threw the ball great, he moved it around, he changed
speeds. It really was impressive and that's the Tim Belcher we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's performance, along with the Angels continued torrid
hitting, were accompanied by several episodes of bravado from
Seattle's coaching staff and by its pitcher, Moyer, who plunked two
Angels in two innings as the game began to get out of hand, drawing
the ire of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, the Mariners' manager, had to be restrained by a
security guard in the bottom of the seventh after a fan near the
dugout continued a tirade directed at him following Moyer's second
hit batsman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mariners third-base coach Steve Smith got into a
shouting match with Angels coach Larry Bowa, briefly interrupting
the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy does not belong in a ballpark,'' Piniella said of the
fan, who was momentarily ejected from his seat before being moved
to one farther away from the Seattle dugout. ``He belongs in a
mental hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene followed the Piniella incident with a line-drive shot to
left-center, making it 9-2 and sending the crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of stuff that went on in that inning,'' said
Greene, who has three homers this season. ``That helped seal the
game. As it turned out, it was a pretty big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, Seattle's John Mabry blasted a
three-run homer off Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   An inning earlier, the Angels began to break the game open.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus got things going with his major-league-leading 10th
double of the season _ his second of the game _ with one out. He
finished 3 for 3 on the night.
</P>
<P>
   After a sacrifice fly to left by Greene, which moved Glaus to
third, Charlie O'Brien came up with a key infield single to short,
his first hit in 13 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was backhanded in the hole on a dive by Seattle's
Giomar Guevara, but his throw to first took three bounces before
reaching David Segui, pulling him off the bag and allowing the
slow-footed O'Brien to reach safely and Glaus to score for a 3-2
lead. No.9 hitter Andy Sheets followed with his first homer of the
season to dead center, giving the Angels a 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win at this level, you gotta do it throughout the
lineup,'' Collins said. ``Different guys are doing it right now and
that's nice.
</P>
<P>
   And the way Belcher was pitching, the cushion Sheets provided
made it all the easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helps,'' Belcher said of the run support. ``We've been
pounding out a lot of runs and that's nice to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it appeared Belcher might be headed to an early exit,
much as he did against Texas in his last start when he lasted only
3-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell smacked the first pitch of the game for a hard single
to right, and in the second inning Belcher walked Mabry before Russ
Davis drilled his fourth homer of the year to tie it at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Belcher began to find his groove and the Mariners
never threatened against him.

</P>
<P>
   NATO-ANTIWAR-REVIEW (Brussels) _ NATO's 50th anniversary summit
meeting may be the first war council of the Cold War's
anti-warriors. Leaders who had reputations as draft-dodgers or
anti-missile demonstrators will gather and vow to continue doing
things many of them vowed in the 1960s never to do. But then,
Kosovo is a liberal's kind of war. Bombs away in the service of a
fight against inhumanity. By Craig R. Whitney. (`i' categeory)
</P>
<P>
   DISABILITY-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Supreme Court will
tackle one of the most critical questions arising from the
Americans With Disabilities Act: What is the legal threshold for
being considered disabled? The issue is whether people whose
conditions can be medically corrected so they can function normally
_ insulin for diabetes, or eyeglasses for impaired vision _ are
still entitled to sue for discrimination. By Leslie Kaufman. (`a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPT-OF-COURT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Contempt of court findings
have a varied and even noble history in the annals of American law.
President Clinton's contempt citation in the Jones case seemed
oddly out of synch with other famous examples. Ronald Goldfarb,
author of `The Contempt Power' notes that many of the great legal
struggles of the century _ in civil rights, anti-war protests,
McCarthyism and the labor movement _ were triggered by contempt
citations. By Benjamin Weiser.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-MISLEAD-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon's
missile-defense spinmeisters spun out of control after a test of
the Army's experimental Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system,
which has cost taxpayers $3.9 billion. They claimed that the it
achieved 16 of 17 objectives _ even though it failed to shatter the
target. A better count is 2 of 4 main goals, eliminating 14 of the
claimed successes, officials now say sheepishly. By William J.
Broad.
</P>
<P>
   MIND-HEALTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mind over matter: Modern medicine
has until recently not seen mental and physical health as
inextricably entwined. Now a growing number studies appearing in
mainstream medical journals demonstrate the impact of psychology on
physiology, such as alleviating arthritis by having a patient write
about their distresses. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-PROPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at how American
politicians and protesters increasingly rely on political props (or
visuals, in spin-doctor lingo) to dramatize complex policies, razz
adversaries or snag a few seconds on the evening news. By David
Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   WHITEHOUSE-MEMOIRS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political memoirs
often reflect sharply different memories. Case in point: George
Stephanopoulos' `All Too Human: A Political Education' vs. Dick
Morris' `Behind the Oval Office: Getting Re-Elected Against All
Odds.' The books often convey utterly dissimilar points of view,
reflecting the cutthroat infighting that prevailed when their
authors were advisers to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SAFEWAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ The NATO campaign against
Serbia has been designed to minimize casualties _ Baby Boomer
warfare. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were born too late to
experience World War II, and they have grown up in an age
mesmerized by technology. They are impressed by their ability to
kill from afar, with almost no risk of retaliation against those
firing the weapons. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   SOVEREIGNTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The erosion of national
sovereignty over the past decade is reflected in U.N. support for
the campaign against Yugoslavia, the creation of international
tribunals to try crimes against humanity in Yugoslavia and Rwanda,
in Spain's effort to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet from Britain to try him for crimes against humanity, and
in the impending trial of two Libyans before a Scottish court in
the Netherlands over the bombinh of an American jetliner over
Lockerbie. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-REVIEW (Kuala Lumpur) _ Malaysia as a parable of
globalization: the downfall of former Deputy Prime Minister Ibrahim
Anwar shows how outside economic forces can sunder the political
culture of even a well-governed country. Before the Asian crisis
devastated Malaysia's economy, Anwar and Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed Mahathir rarely disagreed. Now, they are locked in a
bitter feud. The economic crisis unfolded into a political crisis,
with changes in regimes throughout the region. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-WALK-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Some scholars here argue that
from ancient times until perhaps 150 years ago, in a sign of
reduced social regimentation, Japanese were taught to walk in a
special style called the namba, in which the right arm and leg
swing forward at the same time, and then the left arm and leg swing
forward. Try it: these days it seems counter-intuitive. Almost
everybody in the world now walks the opposite way, with the right
leg and left arm moving forward at the same time, and vice-versa.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ David Sanger examines the
Clinton administyration's foreign policy record.

still entitled to sue for discrimination. By Leslie Kaufman. (`a'

   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   CONTEMPT-OF-COURT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Contempt of court findings
have a varied and even noble history in the annals of American law.
President Clinton's contempt citation in the Jones case seemed
oddly out of synch with other famous examples. Ronald Goldfarb,
author of `The Contempt Power' notes that many of the great legal
struggles of the century _ in civil rights, anti-war protests,
McCarthyism and the labor movement _ were triggered by contempt
citations. By Benjamin Weiser.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-MISLEAD-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon's
missile-defense spinmeisters spun out of control after a test of
the Army's experimental Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system,
which has cost taxpayers $3.9 billion. They claimed that the it
achieved 16 of 17 objectives _ even though it failed to shatter the
target. A better count is 2 of 4 main goals, eliminating 14 of the
claimed successes, officials now say sheepishly. By William J.
Broad.
</P>
<P>
   MIND-HEALTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mind over matter: Modern medicine
has until recently not seen mental and physical health as
inextricably entwined. Now a growing number studies appearing in
mainstream medical journals demonstrate the impact of psychology on
physiology, such as alleviating arthritis by having a patient write
about their distresses. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-PROPS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at how American
politicians and protesters increasingly rely on political props (or
visuals, in spin-doctor lingo) to dramatize complex policies, razz
adversaries or snag a few seconds on the evening news. By David
Wallis.
</P>
<P>
   WHITEHOUSE-MEMOIRS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political memoirs
often reflect sharply different memories. Case in point: George
Stephanopoulos' `All Too Human: A Political Education' vs. Dick
Morris' `Behind the Oval Office: Getting Re-Elected Against All
Odds.' The books often convey utterly dissimilar points of view,
reflecting the cutthroat infighting that prevailed when their
authors were advisers to Clinton.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SAFEWAR-REVIEW (Washington) _ The NATO campaign against
Serbia has been designed to minimize casualties _ Baby Boomer
warfare. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were born too late to
experience World War II, and they have grown up in an age
mesmerized by technology. They are impressed by their ability to
kill from afar, with almost no risk of retaliation against those
firing the weapons. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   SOVEREIGNTY-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The erosion of national
sovereignty over the past decade is reflected in U.N. support for
the campaign against Yugoslavia, the creation of international
tribunals to try crimes against humanity in Yugoslavia and Rwanda,
in Spain's effort to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet from Britain to try him for crimes against humanity, and
in the impending trial of two Libyans before a Scottish court in
the Netherlands over the bombinh of an American jetliner over
Lockerbie. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-REVIEW (Kuala Lumpur) _ Malaysia as a parable of
globalization: the downfall of former Deputy Prime Minister Ibrahim
Anwar shows how outside economic forces can sunder the political
culture of even a well-governed country. Before the Asian crisis
devastated Malaysia's economy, Anwar and Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed Mahathir rarely disagreed. Now, they are locked in a
bitter feud. The economic crisis unfolded into a political crisis,
with changes in regimes throughout the region. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-WALK-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Some scholars here argue that
from ancient times until perhaps 150 years ago, in a sign of
reduced social regimentation, Japanese were taught to walk in a
special style called the namba, in which the right arm and leg
swing forward at the same time, and then the left arm and leg swing
forward. Try it: these days it seems counter-intuitive. Almost
everybody in the world now walks the opposite way, with the right
leg and left arm moving forward at the same time, and vice-versa.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Think of NATO's 50th anniversary summit
meeting as the first war council of the Cold War's anti-warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who had reputations for avoiding the draft or
demonstrating against nuclear missiles will gather at the end of
this week in a building named for Ronald Reagan and vow to continue
doing things many of them vowed in the 1960s never to do.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Kosovo is a liberal's kind of war. Bombs away in the
fight against inhumanity, say President Clinton, Prime Minister
Tony Blair of Britain, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their stated goal is to force one of the world's last Communist
dictators to stop terrible outrages against the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo, the worst crimes against humanity in Europe
since Hitler, and let the refugees return under international
protection.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war aim acceptable to all but dyed-in-the-wool
pacifists. But the political landscape of this war is also more
complicated than that. Not all Cold War doves were pacifists by any
means, and Kosovo has revealed shifts in the geopolitical strategic
ground on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In France, political followers of Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who
kicked NATO headquarters out of France in 1966 because he thought
the alliance was an instrument of American domination, are now
letting the American Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
have all the Mirage-2000 and Super Etendard warplanes he asks for.
The French hate the actions of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, as much as the Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Social Democrats and Green Party pacifists, who
earned their left-wing credentials opposing the deployment of
American nuclear missiles to Europe in the 1980s, are now sending
Luftwaffe Tornado fighter-bombers to the Balkans. It is democratic
Germany's first combat action abroad, and it was unthinkable only a
few years ago in a country still struggling with the legacy of its
actions in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema, who protested Italy's
support for the Persian Gulf War in 1991, has made the entire
country into one giant aircraft carrier for the daily blitz across
the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   And in America, President Clinton is being challenged to be even
more hawkish by an unlikely coalition. It is made up of
conservative Republicans who thought American political leaders
stabbed the military in the back during the Vietnam War, and many
liberal Democrats who opposed that war altogether. Together, in the
name of the refugees, they are asking a former draft avoider to do
what Lyndon Johnson tried 35 years ago: Send in ground troops to do
what air power alone can't do, and win the war.
</P>
<P>
   All these ironies have rich and complex overtones.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may be wary of being pushed down the slippery
slope of a ground war in Kosovo partly because some of the loudest
advocates of a stronger policy are the same political opponents who
tried to bring him down with impeachment earlier this year _ and
because he is aware of how destructive the Vietnam War proved to be
for Johnson's domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the loudest advocates of staying out
of Kosovo are conservative Republican Cold War hawks like Pat
Buchanan. In the Washington Post last week, he wrote that ``America
must retrench and rearm,'' and not go ``marching into the Big
Muddy,'' a phrase last heard on the lips of Pete Seeger in the days
when anti-Vietnam demonstrators tried to levitate the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have opposed the Kosovo involvement from the start
include former Vice President Dan Quayle. On the other hand,
Elizabeth Dole visited refugee Albanians in Macedonia last week,
declaring, ``This is genocide'' and ``This is a war we must win.'`
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials expect Clinton to tread carefully through the
ground-force minefield at the three-day summit, which opens on
Friday in Washington. And many of his European partners will be
doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who voted against German defense
budgets in the early 1980s because of the American missile plans,
is now called ``the war chancellor'' by his Social Democratic
Party's left wing.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also put forward a detailed peace plan worked out by
another erstwhile peace movement activist, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, to bring Russia and the United Nations into the search for
a diplomatic settlement. The plan would suspend NATO bombing, 24
hours at a time, if Milosevic starts withdrawing forces from Kosovo
and lets the refugees go back.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also got his European Union partners to offer to put
Kosovo under European protection in an eventual settlement, showing
that for all their solidarity, the European allies believe NATO
alone cannot impose a lasting solution in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's new generation of leaders are bombing Kosovo more
for moral reasons than for the classic Realpolitik aim of
preserving NATO's credibility in an unstable environment. Allied
leaders may endorse such a broad aim at their meeting, but their
greatest concern in Kosovo is bringing an end to the ordeal of the
refugees.

 BRUSSELS: the refugees . 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the modern world, it seems, democracies go to war only for
moral war aims, but morality, like truth, can easily become the
first casualty. Incidents like the NATO bombing of a bridge last
week that accidentally killed Serb civilians on a train, or like
the mistakenly dropped bomb that killed Albanian refugees traveling
in a a convoy of vehicles, can test public support for the bombing,
and Clark is acutely aware of the danger. He has repeatedly
stressed that the allies are not trying to make war on civilians,
Serbs or Albanians. But innocent victims of the bombing are
inevitable the longer and more intense the air campaign becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Such jingoism as the allies muster depends mainly on having a
diabolic adversary. France's Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, is
as hard as Clark on ``Milosevic,'' who doesn't even rate a ``Mr.''
from the French leader any more. ``The spirit of Munich,
isolationism and compromising have never brought anything but
misfortune,'' Chirac told the French last week in his third
television address on Kosovo, sounding for all the world like
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The French Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, like Chirac
a military veteran, pacified left-wing critics of the bombing,
including some within his own government, by saying that France was
not just slavishly following the American lead on Kosovo but
prosecuting the war in its own national and European interest.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vehement of the allies are the British. Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, whose left-wing pacifist activities in the
1980s made American officials worry when Prime Minister Tony Blair
named him to the post, has become one of Albright's closest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   And Blair sounds positively Churchillian, in vehemence if not in
eloquence: ``There is not going to be a halt to the NATO action
until the demands that we have set out, which are entirely
reasonable, humane, civilized demands, are met in full,'' he said
last week. ``And the determination of the whole of not just Europe
but, I think, of the vast majority of people in the international
community to see this thing through is absolute.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are two things that all these European left-centrists
agree on. One is that sending ground troops into Kosovo, even in a
peacekeeping force, is not going to happen unless the United
Nations gives the alliance an explicit mandate to do so. That means
Russian acquiescence to an operation that probably would not be
feasible until a lot more bombing has taken its toll on the Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present circumstances, the potential loss of life among
our service men and women, to say nothing of civilians, would be
considerable,'' Blair told Parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
   And the other is that Europe cannot forever go on depending on
the United States to deal with recurrent European crises like
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton will probably be confronted in Washington with strong
calls by the allies, led by France and Britain, for the creation of
a strong and independent European defense pillar within the
alliance. Blair and Chirac agreed last year that Europe should have
an autonomous defense capability to ensure the stability of its own
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sea change for Britain, which in the past has seemed
to the French to be a NATO sycophant.
</P>
<P>
   Life is full of surprises these days, even in the alliance. ``I
never dreamed I would be spending my 51st birthday at a NATO
foreign ministers' conference,'' Fischer mused last Monday. But
there he was, and who ever would have thought it?

peacekeeping force, is not going to happen unless the United
Nations gives the alliance an explicit mandate to do so. That means
Russian acquiescence to an operation that probably would not be
feasible until a lot more bombing has taken its toll on the Serb
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present circumstances, the potential loss of life among
our service men and women, to say nothing of civilians, would be
considerable,'' Blair told Parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
   And the other is that Europe cannot forever go on depending on
the United States to deal with recurrent European crises like
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton will probably be confronted in Washington with strong
calls by the allies, led by France and Britain, for the creation of
a strong and independent European defense pillar within the
alliance. Blair and Chirac agreed last year that Europe should have
an autonomous defense capability to ensure the stability of its own
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sea change for Britain, which in the past has seemed
to the French to be a NATO sycophant.
</P>
<P>
   Life is full of surprises these days, even in the alliance. ``I
never dreamed I would be spending my 51st birthday at a NATO
foreign ministers' conference,'' Fischer mused last Monday. But
there he was, and who ever would have thought it?

   In 1994 Vaughn L. Murphy applied for a position as a truck
mechanic with United Parcel Service in Topeka, Kan. Because the job
included driving the vehicles he serviced, Murphy was required by
federal law to pass a government physical. He did, and he started
working for UPS. He was by all accounts an able engine doctor but
he was soon asked by the company to take another blood-pressure
test. This time, despite medication, Murphy's blood pressure
slightly exceeded the limits _ making him, in theory, a risk for
stroke or heart attack on the road. The company gave him a pink
slip.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy sued. His charge? That UPS had violated his rights under
the Americans With Disabilities Act. Later this month, his case and
two others _ one involving a truck driver with vision in one eye
and another involving two pilots who wear eyeglasses _ will be
heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Disability experts believe the court is tackling one of the most
critical questions that has arisen under the 1990 statute: What is
the legal threshold for being considered disabled?
</P>
<P>
   The issue before the court is whether people whose conditions
can be medically corrected so they can function normally _
diabetics on insulin, for example _ are still entitled to sue for
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The impending ruling could potentially reshape the workplace.
Unlike other civil rights laws, which mandate equal treatment, the
Americans With Disabilities Act requires businesses to make
``reasonable accommodations'' for disabled employees. So far, the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which monitors compliance
with civil rights laws, has chosen to interpret that standard
generously.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from recent commission guidelines include reassigning
an employee suffering from stress or depression to a new boss and
offering a different job to a worker who becomes too disabled to
perform his own job, even if the disabled worker is not the
best-qualified person for that post. If UPS were forced to
recognize Murphy as disabled, it might have to adjust duties in the
mechanics pool, giving others responsibility for driving trucks
while Murphy works in the grease pit or giving him time off during
periods when his blood-pressure rises above the federal limit.
</P>
<P>
   The thought that the court might extend the law to cover a huge
new segment of the population has some employers envisioning a
flood of very-expensive lawsuits from disgruntled employees with
minor impairments seeking special treatment. ``If having a
disability is the gate through which everyone must enter to get
into the promised land of reasonable accommodation, the width of
the gate is pretty important,'' said Christopher Bell, a former
associate legal counsel for disability cases at the EEOC and a
partner at Jackson Lewis, a New York-based law firm that represents
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, more Americans appear willing to be identified as
disabled. The Social Security disability program, for example,
which was created to give an income to workers who are too
handicapped to do their jobs, has more than tripled its outlays
since its inception in 1975. The number of students who have been
classified as ``learning disabled'' has skyrocketed as more parents
have discovered the accompanying advantages _ more one-on-one time
with teachers, more time to complete exams and sometimes even
taxpayer-financed private tutors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and a spectrum of groups representing
everyone from diabetics to the HIV positive have submitted
supporting briefs to the Supreme Court arguing that the law was
specifically intended to address correctable disabilities. After
all, they say, it is the people with the most surmountable
handicaps who are most likely to seek mainstream jobs. They
maintain that it is absurd for employers to claim that a job
applicant is too disabled to take a job and yet not disabled enough
to sue for discrimination. As Murphy's lawyers wrote in their brief
to the court, ``The ADA does not permit UPS to have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   For, these advocates say, employers are benefiting from the
courts' overly narrow interpretation of disability. John Parry,
head of the Mental and Physical Disability Law Commission of the
American Bar Association, says about 92 percent of the complaints
that currently make it to court under the act are decided on behalf
of employers, many simply on the grounds that the employee does not
qualify for protection. ``This is really about making the obstacles
to justice less onerous,'' Parry said, referring to the three cases
before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Employers like UPS argue that for especially risky jobs they
have the right to set high physical standards, even ones that
average non-handicapped people might not meet. Norman Black, a
spokesman for UPS, said: ``We don't see this as a case about
disability at all. This is a question about safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the workers in the three cases point out that
their clients previously held jobs nearly identical to the ones
they were denied and had solid service records. That suggests, the
lawyers say, that the companies being sued may be insisting on
physical standards beyond what is really required to do the work
well.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates are even willing to go one step further and
sacrifice a degree of safety for greater accommodation. ``We live
in a society with a lot of risks every day,'' said Chai Feldblum, a
professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center who helped
draft the disabilities act in 1991. ``If it only marginally
increases the probability of harm'' to hire a disabled person, she
said, ``then an employer should not be allowed to discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the original debate over the disabilities act,
it is hardly clear that Congress intended to pass a civil rights
law for the nearsighted and the hypertense. The legislation's vague
standard for disability is whether a condition ``substantially
limits life activities.''
</P>
<P>
   When the act was passed in 1990, Congress considered some 43
million Americans to be disabled _ a number based on numerous
surveys, none of which was definitive. It is certainly greater than
the 5 million or so Americans who are deaf, blind or paraplegic,
prompting advocates of a more expansive definition to claim that
Congress meant to err on the side of generous interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, 43 million falls well short of the more than
1 in 3 Americans who wear eyeglasses or contact lenses or the 50
million who have hypertension. United Airlines, which is being sued
by two nearsighted women who were not accepted for jobs as pilots,
wrote in its brief to the court, ``At the very least, the ADA
should be read to exclude individuals with widely shared and easily
correctable impairments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in the only significant decision it has ever
made on the disabilities act, set a broad precedent for what is
meant by limiting a life activity. In Bragdon vs. Abbott in 1998,
the justices found that an asymptomatic HIV-positive woman who had
been denied care by her dentist could be considered disabled under
the act. The justices reasoned that because she felt constrained
from becoming a mother by her fear of passing on the disease to her
child (her reproductive system was perfectly healthy), she was
substantially limited in the life activity of procreation and
therefore could seek damages.
</P>
<P>
   If the court decides that poor eyesight or hypertension are
equally limiting, millions more Americans might wake up this spring
to find themselves on the rolls of the disabled.

<P>
   In the climactic scene of ``... And Justice for All,'' Al
Pacino, playing an idealistic young lawyer named Arthur Kirkland,
has to defend a distinguished judge accused of raping and battering
a young girl. Learning that his influential client is guilty and
has manipulated the system to get off, Pacino turns on him in the
courtroom, calling him ``a slime'' and declaring, ``If he's allowed
to go free, then something really wrong is going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the presiding judge responds, `` Kirkland, you're out
of order!''
</P>
<P>
   Pacino, pointing at the judge and others, famously retorts:
``You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out
of order!''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos, which ends with bailiffs dragging Pacino out of the
courtroom, is not typical of the American judicial process. But it
is a cinematic reminder that contempt of court has a rich tradition
in American law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week brought a notable anomaly in this tradition of public
defiance over principle, a judge's contempt citation against
President Clinton for giving ``false, misleading and evasive
answers'' in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald L. Goldfarb, author of ``The Contempt Power'' (Columbia
University, 1963), said that most of the great legal struggles of
the century _ over civil rights, anti-war protests, McCarthyism,
the labor movement _ grew from contempt citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contempt is really the crucible within which the great issues
of the times have been thrashed out,'' Goldfarb said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer William M. Kunstler was cited for contempt by
Judge Julius J. Hoffman in the 1969 trial of the Chicago 7
political dissidents, and sentenced to four years and 13 days for
his tactics, but this was hardly a stain on his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore the Chicago contempt as a badge of honor because in
those cases he was standing up to tyranny,'' said Ronald L. Kuby,
his longtime partner and protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was speaking truth to power, as opposed to Clinton, who was
speaking lies to the powerless,'' Kuby said.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases are seen as acts of civil disobedience, efforts to
convey a political message, said Stephen Gillers, professor of
legal ethics at New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's act as a defendant was different, he said. ``He didn't
do something notoriously, publicly. He did it secretly and was
discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   In the practice of law today, most lawyers see resisting a court
order as something that should be reserved for only the most
extraordinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law
School, said, ``The only circumstance in which I can imagine
thinking it to be a badge of honor would be a case in which the
judicial order clearly violates fundamental human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s defiance of a
court order prohibiting a civil rights march in Birmingham in 1963,
which landed him in jail. Although it was clear that the statute
being enforced was invalid, the Supreme Court affirmed the
conviction, Tribe said, ``essentially saying that you can't take
the law in your own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts trace the contempt power back to English common law and
the notion that the king could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic notion was that the courts acted for the king,''
Goldfarb said, ``and someone in the presence of the court was in
the presence of the alter ego of the king, and was therefore worthy
of summary punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In trials with political overtones, the contempt power
illustrates the adversarial tension between judicial authority and
its challengers, but its main purpose in the American system is to
maintain the orderly administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright cited the president for civil
contempt, a tool that is generally used by judges to compel, say, a
reluctant witness to testify in a court proceeding, by threatening
jail if he continues to refuse. Or it can be used to force a
company or union to obey a court order, or face a large daily fine.
</P>
<P>
   Judges may also file a criminal contempt charge to punish a
violation that has already occurred. Some commentators last week
suggested that Clinton would have been more appropriately charged
with criminal contempt, since the Jones case is over.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, both forms are used, as in the case of Susan
McDougal, who served 18 months in jail for civil contempt after she
refused to cooperate with investigators for Kenneth Starr and
refused to answer questions put to her before a grand jury. Then,
last May, after finishing her jail sentence, she was charged with
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. Last week, a jury in
Arkansas acquitted her of the obstruction charge, while failing to
reach a verdict on the contempt charges, leading the judge to
declare a mistrial on those counts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal saw her resistance as a principled stand against
politically motivated pressure from Starr. Some lawyers said this
week that had Clinton wanted to take a more principled stand, he
could have refused to answer questions in his Jones deposition,
rather than offer misleading answers.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the case may simply show that lawyers and defendants like
Clinton are capable of what Tribe calls ``garden variety and not
terribly noble forms of defiance in which they are trying to get
away with something.''

School, said, ``The only circumstance in which I can imagine
thinking it to be a badge of honor would be a case in which the
judicial order clearly violates fundamental human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s defiance of a
court order prohibiting a civil rights march in Birmingham in 1963,
which landed him in jail. Although it was clear that the statute
being enforced was invalid, the Supreme Court affirmed the
conviction, Tribe said, ``essentially saying that you can't take
the law in your own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts trace the contempt power back to English common law and
the notion that the king could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic notion was that the courts acted for the king,''
Goldfarb said, ``and someone in the presence of the court was in
the presence of the alter ego of the king, and was therefore worthy
of summary punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In trials with political overtones, the contempt power
illustrates the adversarial tension between judicial authority and
its challengers, but its main purpose in the American system is to
maintain the orderly administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright cited the president for civil
contempt, a tool that is generally used by judges to compel, say, a
reluctant witness to testify in a court proceeding, by threatening
jail if he continues to refuse. Or it can be used to force a
company or union to obey a court order, or face a large daily fine.
</P>
<P>
   Judges may also file a criminal contempt charge to punish a
violation that has already occurred. Some commentators last week
suggested that Clinton would have been more appropriately charged
with criminal contempt, since the Jones case is over.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, both forms are used, as in the case of Susan
McDougal, who served 18 months in jail for civil contempt after she
refused to cooperate with investigators for Kenneth Starr and
refused to answer questions put to her before a grand jury. Then,
last May, after finishing her jail sentence, she was charged with
criminal contempt and obstruction of justice. Last week, a jury in
Arkansas acquitted her of the obstruction charge, while failing to
reach a verdict on the contempt charges, leading the judge to
declare a mistrial on those counts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal saw her resistance as a principled stand against
politically motivated pressure from Starr. Some lawyers said this
week that had Clinton wanted to take a more principled stand, he
could have refused to answer questions in his Jones deposition,
rather than offer misleading answers.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the case may simply show that lawyers and defendants like
Clinton are capable of what Tribe calls ``garden variety and not
terribly noble forms of defiance in which they are trying to get
away with something.''

   The Pentagon's missile defense enthusiasts have a long history
of exaggerating claims going back to the Reagan administration's
``Star Wars'' plan to zap incoming warheads. But the spinmeisters
spun out of control last month when they claimed that the
military's latest attempt to blast an attacking missile out of the
sky had achieved 16 of 17 objectives _ even though it failed to
shatter the target.
</P>
<P>
   A better count is two of four main goals, eliminating 14 of the
claimed successes, officials now say sheepishly. ``There was some
confusion,'' said Pam Rogers, a Army spokeswoman in Huntsville,
Ala., where the missile-defense program is based.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the new test of the Army's experimental Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense system, which has cost taxpayers $3.9
billion since the early 1990s, was hailed as having done everything
right on March 29 at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico _
everything but hitting the incoming missile, sort of like a batter
with a great swing who can't connect.
</P>
<P>
   After the test, reporters were incorrectly told that 16 of 17
objectives had been achieved, Ms. Rogers said. The error was based,
she added, on a hasty analysis of a videotape of the attempted
interception.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after the misinformation sailed into the media
ozone, officials disclosed in response to a reporter's questions
that only two of the four main goals had actually been met:
</P>
<P>
   _ To demonstrate the system's ``closed-loop operation of all the
various components'' (translation: to see if gizmos worked properly
as the test began).
</P>
<P>
   _ To demonstrate the ability of the system's radar to track the
target (something radar has been doing for more than a half
century).
</P>
<P>
   The failures?
</P>
<P>
   _ To demonstrate the infrared seeker meant to zero in on heat
emanating from a mock warhead (which the Pentagon is still
analyzing and hoping to move into the more-or-less successful
column).
</P>
<P>
   _ To demonstrate ``a body-to-body, high endo-atmospheric
intercept of a unitary target'' (translation: to hit a mock warhead
at the fringes of space and smash it to bits), the experiment's
main goal, which proved frustratingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   The test results were further muddied because radio signals from
the would-be warhead killer were lost mysteriously one minute into
the interceptor's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles of the Air Force, director of the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, told reporters
immediately after the test that this data loss meant, ``We are not
able, to date, at this particular moment, to characterize and
specifically determine the cause of why we managed to miss the
particular intercept.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while admitting to the flip-flop and scrambling to clarify
the picture, the Pentagon's public-relations whizzes were still
excitedly upbeat, happy to call the failed test a big success if
its details are examined closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a zillion different ways to split up these
objectives,'' said Jennifer Canaff, a Pentagon spokeswoman. ``And
some of the successes occurred on the seeker side.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she added, the 16 of 17 goals of the original
misstatement actually understate the feat. ``It's a higher number,
but I'm not at liberty to say what it is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Bill Wheelehan, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon,
later provided four pages of ``preliminary data'' on the perceived
successes. Marked carefully at the top and bottom of each page was
``unclassified,'' meaning it was originally written for internal
military use.
</P>
<P>
   The sheets said nothing about two of four main objectives but
instead listed 27 successes out of a possible 31, including the
``time synch pulse'' of the automated launch sequence and ``nominal
booster separation.'' Stretching further to accentuate the
positive, the successes included ``nominal software performance
until telemetry loss.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Pentagon finally made public its analysis of the
overall trouble, tracing it to the failure of one of 10 thrusters
designed to help steer the interceptor.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world _ where performance tends to have financial
consequences _ the prime contractor, the Lockheed Martin Corp., was
fined $15 million for the latest failure.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the test, Lt. Gen. Paul L. Kern of the Army told
reporters that despite the problems he was confident the program
would soon make its first interception. It has been trying to do so
for more than three years, failing six times so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by the test,'' he said. ``We are much closer
to achieving success than we have been for quite some time.''

   TOKYO _ Almost any reference book on Japanese history includes
the dates of the most obscure shogun or emperor. But then there are
the more basic historical puzzles, such as _ how did the Japanese
walk?
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars here argue that from ancient times until perhaps
150 years ago, virtually all Japanese learned to walk in a special
style called the namba, in which the right arm and leg swing
forward at the same time, and then the left arm and leg swing
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Try it: these days it seems counter-intuitive. Almost everybody
in the world now walks the opposite way, with the right leg and
left arm moving forward at the same time, and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Japan, if these scholars are right, the namba at one time
was almost universal. In fact people often did not swing their arms
much at all, but at a minimum their right shoulder moved with the
right leg and left shoulder with the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Japanese were deliberately educated in how they
should walk,'' said Masaichi Nomura, a leading cultural
anthropologist at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka. ``They
were shown by their parents how to walk in the home, in a tatami
room. But now in modern Japan, there's no walking education at all.
People walk any way they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   If Nomura and other scholars who have written about the namba
are correct and it was common in olden times, then the training of
young people in a particular walking style underscores the
regimentation of life in ancient Japan. Conversely, the decline of
the walk reflects the way society has opened up in the 19th and
20th centuries to a greater pluralism of ideas, values and even
ways of walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research on namba walking _ in scholarly works
written only in Japanese _ has attracted little attention abroad or
even here in Japan. Most scholars who have studied the issue appear
to agree with Nomura, but because there is little discussion about
the theories, it is difficult to know how credible the idea of the
namba is. There is some evidence, but it seems skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient histories do not address the subject, and there is
little evidence that Chinese or other visitors saw anything
different about how the Japanese walked. So scholars have conducted
research in part by studying old paintings or woodblock prints.
Sure enough, the pictures seem to show most Japanese moving their
right shoulders or arms forward with their right legs, or left
shoulders and arms with the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have noted that more ritualized kinds of movement _ in
noh opera, kabuki theater, folk dancing or kendo _ usually involve
the right leg moving with the right arm, or the left leg with the
left arm. Namba itself is a kabuki term referring to this kind of
synchronism between arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Past efforts by some Japanese to emphasize their uniqueness have
fallen into disfavor. People now laugh at the government's old
suggestions that the Japanese could not eat much foreign beef
because of the special nature of Japanese intestines, or that they
could not import foreign skis because of the unique nature of
Japanese snow. Perhaps to avoid falling into the uniqueness trap,
the scholars say that the namba was not exclusively Japanese and
that there is some evidence that at times Mongols and Turks and
other peoples also walked in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the scholars argue, a bit of the namba has survived
in the way the Japanese walk: they say that many Japanese bend
their knees slightly and swing their arms less when walking than
Westerners do, and that the Japanese are more likely to step flatly
or forward on their toes, while Americans and Europeans step on to
their heels first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the theory very interesting and original,'' said Ryugo
Matsui, a cultural anthropologist at Surugadai University near
Tokyo. ``I personally feel that even now, some Japanese walk with
little swing of their hands, different from Westerners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Japanese apparently taught not only their children to
walk in this way but also their horses. For traditional events like
yabusame, or archery from horseback, horses were trained to walk
first with their right legs and then with their left legs _ an
equine version of the namba. The trainers used poles to keep the
right legs moving together and the left legs together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses were trained to run this way in order to prevent
wild up-and-down movements, which would make archery from horseback
very difficult,'' said Shigekatsu Motoyoshi, president of the
Japanese Society of Equine Science. Pacers in American harness
racing are also trained to run in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that teaching kids (let alone horses) to walk
with their arms and legs in synchronism is the ultimate example of
Japanese protocol and conformity. But Nomura says that the opposite
is true of Japan today.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners generally have the same walking style, Nomura said,
while the Japanese display much greater variation: some swinging
their arms, others keeping their arms at their sides; some stepping
onto their toes, other onto their heels, some stepping high and
others shuffling. The namba lives in some Japanese, he said, but
its greatest legacy is what might be called Japan's pede-diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Japanese walk in a very individualist style,'' he
said. ``Westerners tend to walk all in the same way, while there's
much greater variety, much greater variation, among Japanese
walkers.''

while the Japanese display much greater variation: some swinging
their arms, others keeping their arms at their sides; some stepping
onto their toes, other onto their heels, some stepping high and
others shuffling. The namba lives in some Japanese, he said, but
its greatest legacy is what might be called Japan's pede-diversity.

<P>
   ``Today's Japanese walk in a very individualist style,'' he
said. ``Westerners tend to walk all in the same way, while there's
much greater variety, much greater variation, among Japanese
walkers.''

   Medical science, focused on curing the ills of the body, has
often treated the mind like an annoying younger brother: a presence
to be ignored whenever possible, humored when unavoidable and used
as a scapegoat when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   What modern medicine, until recently, has not done, in any
systematic fashion, is to view mental and physical process as
inextricably entwined. Though most paid homage to the importance of
treating the ``whole patient,'' medical scientists by and large
have remained faithful to Descartes' conception of mind-body
dualism, dutifully dividing the psychiatric from the physical. They
accepted that patients often respond emotionally to physical
disease. But doctors have largely disdained the possibility that
emotional state _ be it anxiety, anger or optimism _ might itself
alter the course of a physical illness, or that treating
psychological distress might improve physical health.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, it has become increasingly clear that to take
a strictly Cartesian view is problematic. For one thing, such a
view does not make room for the growing number of studies appearing
in mainstream medical journals that demonstrate the impact of
psychology on physiology. Most recently, researchers reported last
week in the Journal of the American Medical Association that
writing about traumatic experiences measurably improved the health
of some patients with chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Of 70 patients in the study who spent 20 minutes on each of
three consecutive days writing about ``the most stressful
experience they had ever undergone,'' 47.1 percent showed
significant improvement on objective measures of disease severity
four months later, compared to 24.3 percent who improved in a
control group. The findings will have to be replicated by other
researchers, and many questions were left unanswered: How could a
simple writing exercise have such a substantial impact on patients'
health four months later? What factors make it more likely that an
individual patient will benefit from such a treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is difficult not to conclude, as Dr. David Spiegel,
associate chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
Stanford University, did in an editorial accompanying the study,
that ``the authors have provided evidence that medical treatment is
more effective when standard pharmacological intervention is
combined with the management of emotional distress.'' In this study
and others, he noted, ``it is not simply mind over matter, but it
is clear that mind matters.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 article in the British journal Lancet Spiegel and his
colleagues reported longer survival rates for breast cancer
survivors who took part in support groups emphasizing emotional
expression and active coping skills. Other researchers have
reported comparable findings for melanoma and lymphoma patients,
though three studies failed to find that psychosocial support
lengthened survival for cancer patients. A 1988 study by a team led
by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn found that meditation, a stress-reduction
technique, increased rates of improvement in psoriasis patients who
were also receiving standard medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Equally intriguing are studies that tackle the mind-body
equation by finding links between severe stress and illnesses. A
large study published last year found that people who suffered
abuse in childhood, had a parent who was alcoholic, an addict or a
battered woman, or endured other stressful situations, were two to
four times more likely to suffer serious illnesses like heart
disease, emphysema, and stroke than other adults. The frequency of
disorders, the researchers reported, increased with the number of
``adverse childhood experiences'' a person had been exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have found that veterans with post-traumatic
stress disorder also were more likely to suffer from a variety of
severe maladies, including heart disease and diseases of the
respiratory, digestive and musculoskeletal system than were
veterans without the stress disorder. An artificial division
between conditions that belong to ``psychiatry'' and those that
belong to ``medicine'' is ``nonsense,'' said Dr. Matthew Friedman,
executive director of the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, ``because stress is something that happens to the brain.
It's not something in the ether that happens to the mind. Stress is
very real. It has lots of medical effects. It also has
psychological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuroscientists, who are slowly unraveling the complex
interrelationship of genetics, chemistry and cellular function in
the brain, seem considerably more comfortable jettisoning the
dualism of Descartes than many clinicians in routine medical
specialities. With the help of new tools, including PET and MRI
scanning, gene knockouts and other technologies, they are revealing
the brain as much more plastic than was once thought. Brain
chemistry and structure, studies have shown, may be altered by
``psychological'' experiences, including learning and stress.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a much more integrated view of human functioning.
``We now realize that the brain is a lot more involved in governing
many different functions in the body,'' says Dr. Bruce McEwen,
director of the laboratory of endocrinology at Rockefeller
University and an expert on stress. ``Appetite, sleep, food intake,
emotions, health-promoting and self-destructive behaviors _ all
these things are both controlled by and in turn influence the
brain.''

   McEwen's work offers clues to how stressful experience might
eventually translate into physical illness, and how treatments that
reduce stress might prove beneficial to health. Just as blood
pressure and heart rate adjust when a person moves from a lying to
a standing position, the body's approach to stress is
``allostatic.'' That is, it strives to preserve stability through
change, making adjustments in regulatory systems _ heart rate,
hormone levels, metabolism, immune system _ in response to both the
external and internal environment.
</P>
<P>
   How strong and how long-lasting a person's response to stress is
depends on a variety of factors, including genetics, overall health
and how the person perceives the stress. And stress can be helpful
as well as harmful: Acute stress can enhance immune responses. But
McEwen and his colleagues have demonstrated that if stress
accumulates over weeks or months, the body's stress system can
become stuck in a partially ``on'' mode, causing damage and
disrupting normal responses. Prolonged stress, the work of McEwen
and other researchers has shown, can permanently damage nerve cells
in an area of the brain called the hippocampus, lead to
abnormalities in glucose metabolism and immune function, and are
associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists are discovering such strong evidence of
reciprocity between body and mind, why is there still resistance?
The answer has as much to do with sociology and politics as it does
with knowledge. While the public seems to have softened its
dualistic view _ Americans made 629 million visits to alternative
medicine practitioners in 1997, more visits than to all primary
care physicians _ many doctors remain distrustful of treatments
that purport to achieve physical results through psychological
means.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, caution is appropriate. False hope does no one
good, and exaggeration and distortion of the benefits of
alternative therapies are common: There is virtually no evidence
that mental state can cause serious disease _ that ``repressed''
people are more likely to get cancer, for instance. Nor is there
any science to support the assertion that psychological techniques
can cure, as opposed to modifying a person's response to, illness.
``If someone tells you that you can cure your cancer by imaging it
in your head, don't believe them,'' Spiegel said, ``but if they
tell you that it might help you cope with the disease once you've
got it, and that it might have some effect on disease course, as
well as quality of life, that might well be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Dr. Joshua Smyth, lead author of last week's asthma
and rheumatoid arthritis study, cautioned that, ``The worst
possible thing would be if people heard about this study and
concluded that if they keep a journal their asthma will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some adjustments to Descartes' wall seem inevitable. And
the refusal to accept any influence of mind on body appears, at
this juncture, more the product of stubbornness than sense. For the
diehard reductionist, said Dr. David Hufford, professor of
humanities and behavioral science at Penn State College of
medicine, ``anything more ideational or symbolic is seen as coarse,
crude, naive and ultimately mistaken _ even if it gets some
practical effects.''

   WASHINGTON _ I flew on a B-52 raid once. The enormous plane took
off from Guam, refueled over the Philippines, dropped its bombs on
North Vietnam through a dense overcast, turned around, refueled
again and landed safely back on Guam. In 16 or 18 hours, we sighted
no enemy. All we saw was sky and clouds, and the whole mission felt
antiseptic and unreal compared with the nasty, muddy, often lethal
reality that the foot soldiers faced.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo, if war is the right word, is a lot like that.
</P>
<P>
   This is a war in which one side _ the United States and its NATO
allies _ has set out as a matter of policy to hold itself
harm-free. So far it has worked, though a pilot could be killed or
captured at any moment. One American pilot was shot down, but he
escaped. Three hapless American soldiers wandered too close to the
border and fell into enemy hands; they were roughed up a bit, but
as far as Washington knows, they are in reasonably good shape.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, more than 200 American servicemen are killed
in accidents of one kind or another, which is roughly four a week.
In almost four weeks of war in Kosovo, not a single American has
died. No body bags have been unloaded at Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, and no Americans have been dragged through the streets of
an enemy capital, as in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness. But meanwhile, substantial numbers of Serbians
have died, including a fair number of civilians. An unknown number
of ethnic Albanian refugees _ the very ``innocent civilians'' that
President Clinton said the operation was designed to help _ were
killed Wednesday by allied bombs. Inevitably, military forces are
intermixed with the civil population. No bomb, no missile and no
pilot is smart enough to avoid hitting both on occasion. No
electronic system can eliminate human fallibility.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that the attacks should stop. The point is
that baby boomer warfare does not work. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair
were born too late to experience World War II, however indirectly,
and they have grown up in an age mesmerized by technology.
Impressed by their ability to kill from afar, with almost no risk
of retaliation against those firing the weapons, Clinton has
launched cruise missiles at Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and Serbia in
the last six months alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited actions beget limited results,'' said Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, a Navy pilot in Vietnam who is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not only ruled out using ground troops; he has told
the world (including Slobodan Milosevic) that he has done so, which
is rather like a pitcher announcing that he intends to throw
nothing but curve balls. Until recently, NATO has used mostly
fast-flying (and, in the case of the refugee column, high-flying)
jet aircraft, making accidents more likely. This is not the kind of
work for which high-performance planes are ideally suited.
</P>
<P>
   The slower-flying A-10 Warthogs that were designed for close-in
ground-support and tactical bombing have only recently come into
action, and Apache helicopters have not been used yet. They might
have been able to avoid the mistakes that killed most of the
civilians. But they would also have been more vulnerable to ground
fire.
</P>
<P>
   No president wants to expose his forces to heedless casualties.
No general, either, not even George S. Patton, who assured Third
Army troops on the eve of D-Day that only 2 percent of them would
die in a major battle, because they would never be committed to
Verdun-style trench warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But minimizing one's own casualties while slugging
it out with an enemy on the ground, trying to maximize his losses
in pursuit of a clearly attainable if costly objective, represents
one kind of morality. It is another thing altogether to expose
innocents to death to preserve a strategy of self-protection that
may never work and will take a lot longer to work, if it ever does,
than one that exposes some of our troops to danger.
</P>
<P>
   Again, when hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced into
the woods without food, water or shelter, NATO briefly considered
low- or high-altitude air drops. The idea was abandoned as too
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian officials at NATO headquarters acknowledged that they
were skittish about losing cargo planes, too, given the
capabilities of Serbian air defenses that remain intact. And Maj.
Gen. Charles Wald, the vice director of strategic planning at the
Pentagon, added that ``airdrops are very, very dangerous, and there
is no indication at all that Milosevic would allow us to fly
airdrops in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   If allied troops were involved, instead of refugees, the
airdrops would never have been questioned. During the Battle of the
Bulge in World War II, American pilots flew through murderous flak
to drop supplies and ammunition to the beleaguered garrison at
Bastogne. French pilots did much the same thing during the siege of
Dienbienphu in the first Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   The essential nature of combat is the fear that you may die
before you can kill your enemy. Isn't that what gives scale and
meaning to an essentially savage act? And doesn't removing the
element of sacrifice through push-button warfare somehow corrupt
even the most nobly motivated war?

   Thank goodness. But meanwhile, substantial numbers of Serbians
have died, including a fair number of civilians. An unknown number
of ethnic Albanian refugees _ the very ``innocent civilians'' that
President Clinton said the operation was designed to help _ were
killed Wednesday by allied bombs. Inevitably, military forces are
intermixed with the civil population. No bomb, no missile and no
pilot is smart enough to avoid hitting both on occasion. No
electronic system can eliminate human fallibility.
</P>
<P>
   The point here is not that the attacks should stop. The point is
that baby boomer warfare does not work. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair
were born too late to experience World War II, however indirectly,
and they have grown up in an age mesmerized by technology.
Impressed by their ability to kill from afar, with almost no risk
of retaliation against those firing the weapons, Clinton has
launched cruise missiles at Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and Serbia in
the last six months alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited actions beget limited results,'' said Sen. John McCain
of Arizona, a Navy pilot in Vietnam who is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not only ruled out using ground troops; he has told
the world (including Slobodan Milosevic) that he has done so, which
is rather like a pitcher announcing that he intends to throw
nothing but curve balls. Until recently, NATO has used mostly
fast-flying (and, in the case of the refugee column, high-flying)
jet aircraft, making accidents more likely. This is not the kind of
work for which high-performance planes are ideally suited.
</P>
<P>
   The slower-flying A-10 Warthogs that were designed for close-in
ground-support and tactical bombing have only recently come into
action, and Apache helicopters have not been used yet. They might
have been able to avoid the mistakes that killed most of the
civilians. But they would also have been more vulnerable to ground
fire.
</P>
<P>
   No president wants to expose his forces to heedless casualties.
No general, either, not even George S. Patton, who assured Third
Army troops on the eve of D-Day that only 2 percent of them would
die in a major battle, because they would never be committed to
Verdun-style trench warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But minimizing one's own casualties while slugging
it out with an enemy on the ground, trying to maximize his losses
in pursuit of a clearly attainable if costly objective, represents
one kind of morality. It is another thing altogether to expose
innocents to death to preserve a strategy of self-protection that
may never work and will take a lot longer to work, if it ever does,
than one that exposes some of our troops to danger.
</P>
<P>
   Again, when hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced into
the woods without food, water or shelter, NATO briefly considered
low- or high-altitude air drops. The idea was abandoned as too
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian officials at NATO headquarters acknowledged that they
were skittish about losing cargo planes, too, given the
capabilities of Serbian air defenses that remain intact. And Maj.
Gen. Charles Wald, the vice director of strategic planning at the
Pentagon, added that ``airdrops are very, very dangerous, and there
is no indication at all that Milosevic would allow us to fly
airdrops in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   If allied troops were involved, instead of refugees, the
airdrops would never have been questioned. During the Battle of the
Bulge in World War II, American pilots flew through murderous flak
to drop supplies and ammunition to the beleaguered garrison at
Bastogne. French pilots did much the same thing during the siege of
Dienbienphu in the first Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   The essential nature of combat is the fear that you may die
before you can kill your enemy. Isn't that what gives scale and
meaning to an essentially savage act? And doesn't removing the
element of sacrifice through push-button warfare somehow corrupt
even the most nobly motivated war?
</P>

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ His children were weeping, and his wife
looked shell-shocked. But as the guards led him away to serve a
six-year prison sentence last week, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim, seemed to be prepping himself for the next
round of a boxing match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold fast to the struggle,'' Anwar said in a fiery statement
just after he was found guilty of corruption. ``Love Malaysia. And
if we do love Malaysia, then the fight against injustice must be
invigorated.''
</P>
<P>
   While Anwar, 51, vows he will lead a campaign to unseat
Malaysia's strong-willed leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
it is not clear he can be much of an insurgent from behind bars. If
Malaysia recovers from the ravages of the Asian economic crisis,
the 73-year-old Mahathir seems likely to survive the most serious
threat to his 18-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the downfall of Anwar shows how outside economic forces
can sunder the political culture of even a well-governed country.
Before the Asian crisis devastated Malaysia's economy, Anwar and
Mahathir rarely disagreed. Now, the two men are locked in a feud so
bitter that Anwar likens his former mentor to Hitler, while
Mahathir accuses his protege of being a sodomist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis unfolded into a political crisis, with
changes in regimes throughout the region,'' said K.S. Jomo, a
political economist at the University of Malaya. ``That scared
Mahathir, and it emboldened Anwar.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, believes her husband had
become too much of a threat to Mahathir. ``It was a foregone
conclusion that he was going to be found guilty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, Mahathir and Anwar were inseparable, united in
a drive to turn this former British colony into Exhibit A of the
Asian miracle. With foreign money pouring in, Malaysia became a
wonderland of development. American companies built factories to
take advantage of the cheap work force, and the living standard
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir and Anwar flexed their muscles in different ways. The
prime minister built the world's tallest skyscrapers in Kuala
Lumpur, while Anwar cultivated an image as a new-style Asian
leader. In his book, ``The Asian Renaissance,'' he tried to square
Asian values with Western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Malaysia got caught in the riptide of globalism,
and the strain drove both men to extreme positions. Mahathir argued
that Malaysia should shield itself against the predations of
foreign currency speculators by erecting barriers around its
markets. Anwar favored the International Monetary Fund's castor-oil
remedy of open markets and high interest rates. He said the prime
minister was just trying to protect his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Mahathir seemed to be on the ropes, he lashed back _
imposing controls on Malaysia's currency markets and sacking his
deputy. Three weeks later, Anwar was arrested and charged with
corruption and sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to cast the feud between Mahathir and Anwar in
Manichean terms. Anwar's trial had all the appearances of a
railroading. And Dr. Mahathir has won few friends outside Malaysia
with his inflammatory remarks about the influence of the financier
George Soros and Jewish currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in The New York Times on Thursday, written from
prison, Anwar accused Mahathir of being ``a has-been leader who had
descended to cruelty in desperate bid to cling to power.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a portrayal is simplistic. Political analysts here said
Mahathir mixes populist, anti-Western rhetoric with a sophisticated
understanding of the global economy. Even critics credit him for
fashioning a harmonious country out of a combustible mixture of
Malays, ethnic Chinese and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Anwar is no helpless victim. Analysts describe him as
a skilled and even ruthless politician who did not hesitate to hand
out his share of plum government contracts to solidify his power
base. Anwar has honed his image overseas, through a network of
Western-style spin doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Anwar's downfall is yet more evidence that global
capitalism can be a powerful destabilizing force. It set off
poisonous animosities in two leaders who shared a common vision of
Malaysia's future. And the resulting power struggle left this
once-peaceful and prosperous country sadly diminished.

   Last week in Washington, the Titanic was involved in another
disaster. Just before advocates for senior citizens planned to
hoist on stage a 24-foot cabin cruiser bearing the slogan
``Medicare Vouchers Are a Titanic Mistake,'' the Capitol Police
sunk their efforts. Judging the symbolic Titanic too heavy for the
stage, authorities banished it to the side, thereby depriving Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and other speakers of a camera-friendly backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment,'' lamented the rally's
organizer, Patrick Burns, director of communication at the National
Council for Senior Citizens. ``Most people would rather have their
teeth pulled than read a story about Medicare, so we have to
present a story: If you are well-to-do, the voucher becomes a
subsidy that you can use to buy yourself into a lifeboat. If you
are a poor, working-class stiff with a fixed income like most
seniors, you're in steerage.''
</P>
<P>
   American politicians and protesters increasingly rely on
political props (or visuals, in spin-doctor lingo) to dramatize
complex policies, razz adversaries or snag a few seconds on the
evening news. Ross Perot-style charts and candlelight vigils no
longer make the cut when network news shows must compete for
viewers with niche cable channels and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is not a news medium _ it's an entertainment
medium,'' noted Michael Deaver, President Reagan's legendary
prop-master. ``People have become increasingly sophisticated about
what they will or will not stop on.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaver, famous for promoting the presidential practice of
saluting citizen heroes _ human props _ at State of the Union
Addresses, recalled a rare Reagan speech at a B-1 bomber factory,
rare because Deaver avoided military backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a perception that Reagan was more likely to get us
into a war,'' he said. ``In '84, they convinced me that 40,000 jobs
in California depended on the B-1 bomber. That was the only event
we did that was military in nature. But we draped the plane with a
sign that read: `Prepared for Peace.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Rep. Jim Nussle of Iowa didn't need high-priced
military hardware to draw attention to colleagues who bounced House
checks; he placed a paper bag over his head to symbolize his shame.
``It was the most impactful speech I've ever given,'' recalled
Nussle. ``I've spoken about a number of other important topics like
rural health care and agriculture. Boy, no one has ever heard
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before CNN, leaders understood the power of the prop. King
Solomon grasped a baby to show his even-handedness. And in American
history, the tradition goes back to pre-Revolutionary times, when
patriots held mock funerals for Lady Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   William Henry Harrison was one of the first politicians to play
with props, drinking hard cider from a wooden barrel and posing in
front of log cabins at campaign rallies during the 1840
presidential contest, now known as the Log Cabin campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harrison was very old, so the Democrats considered him a
pretty weak candidate,'' said Sean Wilentz, a professor of history
at Princeton. ``One guy in a Baltimore newspaper wrote that they
ought to pension off granny Harrison so he can go back to his log
cabin and drink cider. The Whigs picked up on that and said `Aha!
Harrison is a man of the people!' and turned the log cabin and
cider into popular symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   But like faulty grenades, props can explode in a candidate's
face. In 1988, Michael Dukakis, who looked more like a driving
instructor than a gunnery sergeant, climbed atop a tank and crushed
his chances at victory. TV news played the clip of the tank ride
over and over, reinforcing the faux pas. Four years later, George
Bush stumbled badly. To combat the notion he lacked the common
touch, he shopped at a Wal-Mart, only to betray astonishment at the
invention of the checkout scanner. Both candidates flouted the
Deaver rule of prop management: ``Don't use anything that's
inconsistent with the candidate or what's being said, or the
history and character of the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, politicians seem to have learned little from these
legendary goofs. Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana fired a shotgun in his
yard at a head-shaped object (believed to be a pumpkin) to
determine whether Vincent Foster was murdered. And last month,
Senator Dianne Feinstein Dukakis-ized herself, brandishing a
menacing-looking assault weapon at a press conference to highlight
her support for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The sideshow atmosphere in Washington rankles Rich Noyes of the
Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``The dangerous thing for
society would be when we start to pay more attention to the
politicians with the good props than the politicians with the good
arguments,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   With elections approaching, voters can expect to see more props
repeated endlessly thanks to the eight-second picture-bite. At the
least, one politician has gotten the message about the importance
of staying on message when it comes to props. In 1996, Lamar
Alexander wore his trademark red-and-black plaid shirt constantly,
often looking un-presidential. This time he plans to keep his
wardrobe as conservative as his politics. ``My main goal,''
Alexander announced, ``will be to get the voters to pay more
attention to my beliefs and message and not to any prop I might
bring along.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment heartens Wilentz. ``Props don't add to the
dignity of American politics,'' said Wilentz, ``but then again,
American politics have rarely been known for dignity.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In their new book ``Preventative Defense,'' former
Defense Secretary William Perry and a former Pentagon colleague,
Ashton Carter, argue that 10 years into the post-Cold War,
Washington forgets that some nations matter a lot more than others.
</P>
<P>
   There is a short ``A list'' of nations that could some day pose
a threat to ``the survival or way of life of Americans'' _ a Russia
that goes the way of Weimar Germany, or a China that becomes a
hostile superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a well-stocked ``B list'' of ``imminent threats to
U.S. interests,'' including the fractious Persian Gulf states and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   And finally comes the ``C list,'' which the authors say is
composed of ``the Kosovos, Bosnias, Somalias, Rwandas and Haitis''
_ all urgent, but places where American interests are usually hard
to define.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it sounds reasonable and orderly. But the C list looms
vivid on live TV, making it all-consuming for Washington while far
less dramatic A list problems are put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   And that appears to be exactly what happened over the last 10
days as China's savvy prime minister, Zhu Rongji, drove up to the
White House ready to resolve one of the most complex issues in
Sino-American relations _ a huge trade deal that is really about
China's influence in the world and America's influence on China.
Problem was, he arrived at a moment when a president who has
pressed ``engagement'' with China was elsewhere engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a weeklong White House fumble that left the
Chinese angry, the president embarrassed, the business community
enraged and Congress confused. In the end, Zhu left the United
States with a hastily telephoned assurance from Clinton that China
would get into the World Trade Organization this year, with
American blessing, if China kept its promises and gave a bit more.
But the whole messy handling of China's premier reformer left some
administration officials wondering whether this White House can
bomb Belgrade and negotiate with Beijing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic case of distraction,'' one White House
official conceded late last week, trying to explain why the White
House had to issue three separate joint statements with Zhu in five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, the man bringing market reforms to China even as millions
wander the countryside unemployed, decided earlier this year that
China was either going to get globalized fast or get lost in the
race. ``Either we look like Singapore or we look like Russia,'' one
of his aides commented recently. ``And that's not a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   So Zhu offered market-opening concessions in agriculture,
telecommunications, banking, insurance and other industries that go
far beyond what most American officials thought possible. And the
morning of his arrival here, Clinton made the strongest case yet
for ushering China into the World Trade Organization, arguing it
would not only mean billions for American firms, but that it would
bring the rule of law to China. And, breaking new ground, he argued
that an economically weak China was far more dangerous to America
than a strong China.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, though, Clinton walked away from the deal, at least
for the time being. China had not given enough, his aides argued.
He was worried, his advisers say, that the Democratic left, backed
by the unions, would kill off any deal once they allied with
conservatives saying there should be no deal with a China that
steals nuclear secrets and represses dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical middle that you need to support a deal like this
is shrinking,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley, explaining
why the White House needed what he called ``a bulletproof deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trade, nothing's bulletproof. American textile makers
will never like a deal that lets China expand its presence in the
American market. Nor will steel makers, or steel unions. Many in
Congress argue that China has no intention of fulfilling its
market-opening promises. But the vast majority of big businesses
say that if Clinton doesn't sign soon, the huge gains made in many
areas will be eaten away as soon as Zhu returns to Beijing and
faces bureaucrats screaming: ``You gave away what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this such a critical moment,'' said Edward
S. Steinfeld, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who has studied China's state-owned enterprises. ``This
agreement puts tremendous pressure on China to change its
industrial structure, and to some degree its politics. It will be
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the question is, how can you say that you want a
market-based China, enmeshed in a global legal system, and walk
away from this?''

   KOSOVO (Coded `i')
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DECISIONS (Undated) _ January 19th is already seen as a
pivotal day in the Clinton presidency. But it may turn out to be so
less for the Senate impeachment hearings and State of the Union
address than for the moves toward war over Kosovo. The Times
reconstructs the decisions by the Clinton administration that led
to NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. Written by Elaine
Sciolino and Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Developments. By Craig R.
Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Politics makes strange bedfellows. Then
there is Russian politics, which seemed this week hellbent on the
downright weird: a menage a trois of Russia, Belarus and
Yugoslavia, bedding a wobbly democracy, a Soviet-style dictatorship
and an international pariah three borders removed from either of
them in death-do-we-part union. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL (Paris) _ Responding to complaints from the U.N.
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the United States and Britain
have pledged to provide more information to prosecutors that may
enable them to indict the top Yugoslav civilian and military
leadership. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Skopje, Macedonia) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army
is proving stubbornly resistant despite the Serbian forces' massive
offensive. For example, although wounded on March 24, their
31-year-old commander, who goes by the name of Axhaika, continued
leading his troops for another 10 days before heading out for
treatment. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-OPINION (Washington) _ The war for public opinion in the
Balkans, waged through a taut control over information and an
assiduously managed dissemination of it, entered a new, more
intense phase this week. Reports that NATO had inadvertently bombed
civilians led Yugoslav authorities to suddenly whisk reporters on a
selective tour of ambiguous carnage and NATO officials to give
newly painstaking explanations about how airstrikes were conducted.
By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INTERNATIONAL (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi) _ The Hindu nationalist-led
government that turned India into a declared nuclear power
collapsed Saturday. It lost a vote of confidence by a margin of 269
to 270, the narrowest parliamentary defeat for a government in
independent India's 51 year history. The opposition, now led by
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of an assassinated prime
minister, will now try to cobble together a new government. By
Celia Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-HEALTH-CARE (London) _ The waiting list for treatment
through Britain's National Health Service appears to be growing
precipitously, even as the Labor government says the wait is
shrinking. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-POLITICS (Pinarbasi, Turkey) _ After a campaign that has
been distinctly short on enthusiasm, few Turks expect the elections
Sunday to lift the political paralysis into which their country has
fallen. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-STREET-MARKETS (Beijing) _ The demolition of hundreds of
street markets this spring is officially described as part of a
``beautification'' program as Beijing prepares for celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on
Oct. 1. But it is also part of a master plan to cut the number of
rural migrants living and working in the city. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL-ROOMS (Undated) _ Private rooms in hospitals were once
only for those affluent patients willing to pay as much as $300 a
day extra, but now a growing number of hospitals are eliminating
shared rooms and offering all patients their own rooms, often at no
extra charge. The shift is largely a byproduct of the revolution
wrought by managed care. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-TEEN-SURVIVORS (New York) _ Because of medical advances,
many children born with HIV are thriving into their teens and
beyond. And as these children grow, the normally turbulent issues
of youth _ like dating and independence _ are colliding with their
chronic terminal illness in ways that their families never
envisioned when the children were babies. By Lynda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-WOMEN (Undated) _ Sarah A. Gavit, 37, is leading an
invasion of Mars. Built under her direction are two craft now
speeding toward a December rendezvous with the red planet to help
see if it harbors life. Her top aides are also women; they are all
pioneers pushing back frontiers of inquiry, technology and gender.
By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-WASTE-FIGHT (Skull Valley Goshute Reservation, Utah) _
The tiny Skull Valley Band of the Goshute tribe has signed a
50-year lease with eight electric companies to use 840 of the
reservation's 18,000 acres to store more than half the nation's
nuclear waste. But Governor Michael O. Leavitt, who grew up
downwind of atmospheric nuclear tests, says he will do whatever it
takes to stop the plan. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING-UPSIDE-DOWN (Denver) _ United and other airlines are
starting to train their pilots on what to do when a jumbo jet rolls
nearly upside down, even though that is such a rare event that the
lesson may seem pointlessly exotic. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   UNEARTHED-BORDELLO (Washington) _ Archeologists have happened
upon the historically tantalizing story of Mary Ann Hall, a
determined 20-something who built and managed one of this city's
finest 19th-century bordellos. Her three-story brick house
flourished for four decades just down from Capitol Hill _ a
monument, in its way, to capital power and sex but also to a level
of discretion that seems rare in modern Washington. By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-BUDGET (Washington) _ Congress tells itself year after
year to craft a budget carefully and stick to it when spending the
tax money Americans send in. Last year, it failed miserably, but
this year could be worse, many members say. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   PARKS-POLLUTION (Washington) _ As part of regulations that could

Earth Day, states will be asked to assess the haze problems in

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the century's last session of the Commission
on Human Rights, Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations
unveiled a doctrine with profound implications for international
relations in the new millennium. The airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
he said on April 7, showed that the world would no longer permit
nations intent on committing genocide to ``hide'' behind the U.N.
charter, which has traditionally safeguarded national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of human rights, he said, must ``take precedence
over concerns of state sovereignty.'' ``As long as I am
secretary-general,'' said Annan, the United Nations ``will always
place human beings at the center of everything we do.'' This was
not the secretary general acting alone. He was, he acknowledged,
only embracing an ``evolving'' international norm. He also
acknowledged that using force to protect human rights poses
``fundamental challenges'' to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an erosion of sovereignty when it conflicts with human
rights standards is reflected in many events of the last decade:
the creation of international tribunals to try individuals accused
of crimes against humanity in Yugoslavia and Rwanda; Spain's effort
to extradite the former Chilean leader, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, from
Britain for trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and the
impending trial of two Libyans before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands over charges that they bombed an American jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, analysts agree, Annan's own stance is a
reaction to his own searing experience as the head of peacekeeping
in Rwanda, when more than half a million people were slaughtered as
the Security Council withdrew U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that Annan has merely blessed a ``given'' of the
political climate today: the growing importance of human rights to
the United Nations and many of its 185 members. This was most
evident in the Security Council's overwhelming rejection two weeks
ago of a resolution condemning NATO's airstrikes as illegal on
grounds that the Security Council had not authorized them. Only
Namibia joined Russia and China, the co-sponsors of the motion, in
arguing that Serbia's treatment of its Albanian minority was
essentially an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's doctrine, predictably, has won praise from the
burgeoning human rights community. But others argue that though
well-intentioned, it is naive, dangerous and likely to increase
tensions and paralysis within the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one close adviser to Annan worries that intervening
to save white Europeans (albeit Muslims) in Kosovo, after having
ignored even worse massacres in Rwanda and elsewhere, leaves the
United Nations open to charges of selective morality and double
standards. Others argue that in a world with some 40 million
refugees and displaced people, Annan's stance risks stretching U.N.
resources to unbearable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert S. Okun, a former American diplomat and U.N. adviser on
narcotics, warns that going to war to protect people is also
perilous. ``The use of force,'' he warns, ``is a very blunt
instrument on behalf of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others worry that respect for sovereignty has often been a
barrier to the expansion of internal conflicts, and has served as a
rallying point for collective action against aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and articles last year, Annan addressed some of
these worries even as he signaled his growing anxiety about the
violations of rights occurring in Kosovo. Nation-states are not
going to disappear, he wrote in the journal ``Humanitarian
Intervention.'' Respect for the ``fundamental sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and political independence of states'' will
remain a ``cornerstone of the international system.'' Nevertheless,
he said last summer in Rome, the principle of sovereignty cannot
provide ``excuses for the inexcusable.'' The U.N. charter, he
reminded people in England last June, ``was issued in the name of
`the peoples,' not the governments, of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even China, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human
Rights Watch, has not uniformly blocked humanitarian intervention
by the United Nations. For instance, it did not object to the
creation of ``no-fly zones'' in Iraq to protect the Kurdish
minority in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south against
Saddam Hussein's furious repression. The grosser the oppression
(or, more to the point, the less directly it resembled China's own
actions in Tibet) the greater Beijing's willingness to tolerate
humanitarian intervention. ``So even for China the door is not
completely shut,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as well, a link between the idea of stopping
atrocities and preserving the general peace, another key goal for
the United Nations. Roth argues that failure to respond to brutal
internal repression often emboldens a would-be aggressors. ``Our
failure to punish Iraq for its brutal repression of, and use of
chemical use of chemical weapons against, the Kurds in 1988 led
Saddam to conclude he could get away with invading Kuwait,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort to force, of course, need not be the first or
preferred means of intervention. Patiently applied, targeted
economic sanctions against Libya eventually prompted Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, to surrender the two men charged with
bringing down Pan Am 103 over Scotland. On the other hand, almost a
decade of harsh sanctions against Iraq have failed to persuade
Saddam Hussein to disclose information about his quest for
unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military intervention in Kosovo reflects to some extent
the lessons of Iraq,'' said one senior diplomat, ``and of Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for humanitarian intervention in Kosovo was persuasive
for both Europe and the United States for different reasons, one
senior diplomat asserted. America, an ``idea'' nation whose
national identity derives more from a ``value-driven agenda'' than
from traditional bonding notions of blood, religion or soil, has
long been an aggressive promoter of human rights. Also at stake for
America is NATO's very purpose and effectiveness as an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And for Europe, the question of appearing indifferent to
repression and brutality was especially evocative. Even Germany,
which since World War II has resisted the use of force to solve
political problems, did not want to end the century by appearing
cold toward an echo of the atrocities it caused 60 years ago.
Paraphrasing Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany, the
diplomat said the decision for Germany was between ``no more wars''
and ``no more Auschwitzes.'' It, like the rest of NATO, chose to go
to war this time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At the century's last session of the Commission
on Human Rights, Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations
unveiled a doctrine with profound implications for international
relations in the new millennium. The airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
he said on April 7, showed that the world would no longer permit
nations intent on committing genocide to ``hide'' behind the U.N.
charter, which has traditionally safeguarded national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of human rights, he said, must ``take precedence
over concerns of state sovereignty.'' ``As long as I am
secretary-general,'' said Annan, the United Nations ``will always
place human beings at the center of everything we do.'' This was
not the secretary general acting alone. He was, he acknowledged,
only embracing an ``evolving'' international norm. He also
acknowledged that using force to protect human rights poses
``fundamental challenges'' to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an erosion of sovereignty when it conflicts with human
rights standards is reflected in many events of the last decade:
the creation of international tribunals to try individuals accused
of crimes against humanity in Yugoslavia and Rwanda; Spain's effort
to extradite the former Chilean leader, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, from
Britain for trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and the
impending trial of two Libyans before a Scottish court in the
Netherlands over charges that they bombed an American jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, analysts agree, Annan's own stance is a
reaction to his own searing experience as the head of peacekeeping
in Rwanda, when more than half a million people were slaughtered as
the Security Council withdrew U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that Annan has merely blessed a ``given'' of the
political climate today: the growing importance of human rights to
the United Nations and many of its 185 members. This was most
evident in the Security Council's overwhelming rejection two weeks
ago of a resolution condemning NATO's airstrikes as illegal on
grounds that the Security Council had not authorized them. Only
Namibia joined Russia and China, the co-sponsors of the motion, in
arguing that Serbia's treatment of its Albanian minority was
essentially an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's doctrine, predictably, has won praise from the
burgeoning human rights community. But others argue that though
well-intentioned, it is naive, dangerous and likely to increase
tensions and paralysis within the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one close adviser to Annan worries that intervening
to save white Europeans (albeit Muslims) in Kosovo, after having
ignored even worse massacres in Rwanda and elsewhere, leaves the
United Nations open to charges of selective morality and double
standards. Others argue that in a world with some 40 million
refugees and displaced people, Annan's stance risks stretching U.N.
resources to unbearable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert S. Okun, a former American diplomat and U.N. adviser on
narcotics, warns that going to war to protect people is also
perilous. ``The use of force,'' he warns, ``is a very blunt
instrument on behalf of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others worry that respect for sovereignty has often been a
barrier to the expansion of internal conflicts, and has served as a
rallying point for collective action against aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches and articles last year, Annan addressed some of
these worries even as he signaled his growing anxiety about the
violations of rights occurring in Kosovo. Nation-states are not
going to disappear, he wrote in the journal ``Humanitarian
Intervention.'' Respect for the ``fundamental sovereignty,
territorial integrity, and political independence of states'' will
remain a ``cornerstone of the international system.'' Nevertheless,
he said last summer in Rome, the principle of sovereignty cannot
provide ``excuses for the inexcusable.'' The U.N. charter, he
reminded people in England last June, ``was issued in the name of
`the peoples,' not the governments, of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even China, said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human
Rights Watch, has not uniformly blocked humanitarian intervention
by the United Nations. For instance, it did not object to the
creation of ``no-fly zones'' in Iraq to protect the Kurdish
minority in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south against
Saddam Hussein's furious repression. The grosser the oppression
(or, more to the point, the less directly it resembled China's own
actions in Tibet) the greater Beijing's willingness to tolerate
humanitarian intervention. ``So even for China the door is not
completely shut,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as well, a link between the idea of stopping
atrocities and preserving the general peace, another key goal for
the United Nations. Roth argues that failure to respond to brutal
internal repression often emboldens a would-be aggressors. ``Our
failure to punish Iraq for its brutal repression of, and use of
chemical use of chemical weapons against, the Kurds in 1988 led
Saddam to conclude he could get away with invading Kuwait,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort to force, of course, need not be the first or
preferred means of intervention. Patiently applied, targeted
economic sanctions against Libya eventually prompted Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, to surrender the two men charged with
bringing down Pan Am 103 over Scotland. On the other hand, almost a
decade of harsh sanctions against Iraq have failed to persuade
Saddam Hussein to disclose information about his quest for
unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military intervention in Kosovo reflects to some extent
the lessons of Iraq,'' said one senior diplomat, ``and of Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for humanitarian intervention in Kosovo was persuasive
for both Europe and the United States for different reasons, one
senior diplomat asserted. America, an ``idea'' nation whose
national identity derives more from a ``value-driven agenda'' than
from traditional bonding notions of blood, religion or soil, has
long been an aggressive promoter of human rights. Also at stake for
America is NATO's very purpose and effectiveness as an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And for Europe, the question of appearing indifferent to
repression and brutality was especially evocative. Even Germany,
which since World War II has resisted the use of force to solve
political problems, did not want to end the century by appearing
cold toward an echo of the atrocities it caused 60 years ago.
Paraphrasing Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany, the
diplomat said the decision for Germany was between ``no more wars''
and ``no more Auschwitzes.'' It, like the rest of NATO, chose to go
to war this time.

   A Loss for Starr in the McDougal Case ...
</P>
<P>
   The once-sprawling investigation by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater prosecutor, wound down and its Arkansas phase appeared
to end on a note of defeat when an Arkansas jury acquitted Susan
McDougal of obstruction of justice. The jury deadlocked on the two
remaining counts of criminal contempt, and the judge declared a
mistrial on those charges. The case stemmed from Ms. McDougal's
refusal to testify about President and Mrs. Clinton's financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ... And Some Questions From the Senate
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Starr defended his prosecutorial tactics and
judgment in the investigation of the Lewinsky matter and reacted
indignantly when senators referred to him as a legal zealot. During
more than three hours before the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, which is considering changes in the independent counsel
law, Starr insisted he had followed Justice Department rules.
</P>
<P>
   And when Starr announced that he opposed reauthorizing the
statute that had created his multipronged inquiry, Democrats
expressed incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher Rules Planned for Sport Utility Vehicles
</P>
<P>
   Large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks may not be
allowed to go on emitting several times as much pollution as cars.
The Clinton administration is in the final stages of drafting rules
that would tighten emissions standards for cars, minivans, small
sport utility vehicles and small pickups by 2007 and would require
large sport utility vehicles and pickups to meet the new, more
stringent standards by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   To help automakers do this, the administration will also require
oil companies to sell much cleaner gasoline. All of this could mean
cleaner air but slightly more expensive gas and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   For Campaign Finance, Another Push
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance overhaul hit an unyielding gauntlet of
Republican opposition last year and promised to be met by the same
obstacles this time around, but that did not stop House Democrats
from taking up the cause once again. They launched a petition drive
to force Republican leaders in the House to allow, in the next few
months, a vote on an overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to get the ball rolling earlier, so that it might
gather enough velocity to break through barriers of resistance. But
its momentum was stalling and its fate uncertain by the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian Gets 10 to 25 in Assisted Suicide Case
</P>
<P>
   Saying the law does not bluff, a Michigan judge meted out a
10-to-25-year sentence to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who had dared the
courts to jail him for giving a lethal injection to a terminally
ill man. The death of Thomas Youk, who suffered from amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, was broadcast on a
television program last fall. The man's widow and brother issued
emotional courtroom appeals on behalf of Kevorkian. But the judge,
Jessica Cooper, said Kevorkian had no right to take the law into
his own hands. ``Consider yourself stopped,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle Tries Again
</P>
<P>
   Announcing his candidacy for the Republican presidential
nomination, former Vice President Dan Quayle declared, ``I will
lead the fight for our values _ and our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, returning to electoral politics nearly seven years after
he and President Bush were defeated, touched on his proposal for a
tax cut and recalled his foreign policy experience. But his
overriding message was that after ``a dishonest decade'' of the
Clinton-Gore administration, he would restore values to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   A Medicaid Gap
</P>
<P>
   A side effect of the 47 percent drop in welfare rolls has been
an increase in the number of low-income people who have lost their
Medicaid and have no other health insurance. Almost everyone who
leaves welfare for work is entitled to keep Medicaid, but studies
show that some states have improperly discouraged people from
seeking it.
</P>
<P>
   Another Solar System
</P>
<P>
   We are not alone _ we as in the solar system. Astronomers had
long assumed that some star out there had the requisite planets in
regular orbit, but now it's official. Our solar fellow, spotted by
two different teams, is called Upsilon Andromedae and is 44
light-years away. In the words of one scientist, ``This is exciting
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   World's Richest Babysitter
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gabrieli, a Boston venture capitalist, discovered that his
live-in babysitter was a multi-millionaire like him. The
babysitter, a 54-year-old Chilean immigrant named Maria J. Grasso,
told Gabrieli's wife, Hilary, who then told him, that she had won
the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the largest lottery prize ever
won by one person in the United States. ``I'm a very down-to-earth
person,'' Mrs. Grasso said at a news conference, with the Gabrielis
beaming nearby. ``I work hard in my entire life. I'm one of six
children, and so I always try to be low, down-key, and I'm going to
continue that way.'' Mrs. Grasso chose a lump sum payment of $104
million _ $70,244,814 after taxes.

   KOSOVO (Coded `i')
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DECISIONS (Undated) _ January 19th is already seen as a
pivotal day in the Clinton presidency. But it may turn out to be so
less for the Senate impeachment hearings and State of the Union
address than for the moves toward war over Kosovo. The Times
reconstructs the decisions by the Clinton administration that led
to NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. Written by Elaine
Sciolino and Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Tirana, Albania) _ Top American military
officers flew here Saturday in an apparent effort to lay the basis
for deploying more American forces _ possibly including ground
troops _ in NATO's effort to stop Serbs from driving ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's trip was
so suddenly arranged that U.S. press officers had no inkling of it
until queried by CNN producers. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Developments. By Craig R.
Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Politics makes strange bedfellows. Then
there is Russian politics, which seemed this week hellbent on the
downright weird: a menage a trois of Russia, Belarus and
Yugoslavia, bedding a wobbly democracy, a Soviet-style dictatorship
and an international pariah three borders removed from either of
them in death-do-we-part union. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL (Paris) _ Responding to complaints from the U.N.
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the United States and Britain
have pledged to provide more information to prosecutors that may
enable them to indict the top Yugoslav civilian and military
leadership. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Skopje, Macedonia) _ The Kosovo Liberation Army
is proving stubbornly resistant despite the Serbian forces' massive
offensive. For example, although wounded on March 24, their
31-year-old commander, who goes by the name of Axhaika, continued
leading his troops for another 10 days before heading out for
treatment. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-OPINION (Washington) _ The war for public opinion in the
Balkans, waged through a taut control over information and an
assiduously managed dissemination of it, entered a new, more
intense phase this week. Reports that NATO had inadvertently bombed
civilians led Yugoslav authorities to suddenly whisk reporters on a
selective tour of ambiguous carnage and NATO officials to give
newly painstaking explanations about how airstrikes were conducted.
By Frank Bruni.
</P>

   OTHER INTERNATIONAL (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi) _ The Hindu nationalist-led
government that turned India into a declared nuclear power
collapsed Saturday. It lost a vote of confidence by a margin of 269
to 270, the narrowest parliamentary defeat for a government in
independent India's 51 year history. The opposition, now led by
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of an assassinated prime
minister, will now try to cobble together a new government. By
Celia Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-HEALTH-CARE (London) _ The waiting list for treatment
through Britain's National Health Service appears to be growing
precipitously, even as the Labor government says the wait is
shrinking. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-POLITICS (Pinarbasi, Turkey) _ After a campaign that has
been distinctly short on enthusiasm, few Turks expect the elections
Sunday to lift the political paralysis into which their country has
fallen. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-STREET-MARKETS (Beijing) _ The demolition of hundreds of
street markets this spring is officially described as part of a
``beautification'' program as Beijing prepares for celebration of
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on
Oct. 1. But it is also part of a master plan to cut the number of
rural migrants living and working in the city. By Erik Eckholm.

<P>
   NATIONAL (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   HOSPITAL-ROOMS (Undated) _ Private rooms in hospitals were once
only for those affluent patients willing to pay as much as $300 a
day extra, but now a growing number of hospitals are eliminating
shared rooms and offering all patients their own rooms, often at no
extra charge. The shift is largely a byproduct of the revolution
wrought by managed care. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-TEEN-SURVIVORS (New York) _ Because of medical advances,
many children born with HIV are thriving into their teens and
beyond. And as these children grow, the normally turbulent issues
of youth _ like dating and independence _ are colliding with their
chronic terminal illness in ways that their families never
envisioned when the children were babies. By Lynda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-WOMEN (Undated) _ Sarah A. Gavit, 37, is leading an
invasion of Mars. Built under her direction are two craft now
speeding toward a December rendezvous with the red planet to help
see if it harbors life. Her top aides are also women; they are all
pioneers pushing back frontiers of inquiry, technology and gender.
By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-WASTE-FIGHT (Skull Valley Goshute Reservation, Utah) _
The tiny Skull Valley Band of the Goshute tribe has signed a
50-year lease with eight electric companies to use 840 of the
reservation's 18,000 acres to store more than half the nation's
nuclear waste. But Governor Michael O. Leavitt, who grew up
downwind of atmospheric nuclear tests, says he will do whatever it
takes to stop the plan. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   FLYING-UPSIDE-DOWN (Denver) _ United and other airlines are
starting to train their pilots on what to do when a jumbo jet rolls
nearly upside down, even though that is such a rare event that the
lesson may seem pointlessly exotic. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   UNEARTHED-BORDELLO (Washington) _ Archeologists have happened
upon the historically tantalizing story of Mary Ann Hall, a
determined 20-something who built and managed one of this city's
finest 19th-century bordellos. Her three-story brick house
flourished for four decades just down from Capitol Hill _ a
monument, in its way, to capital power and sex but also to a level
of discretion that seems rare in modern Washington. By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-BUDGET (Washington) _ Congress tells itself year after
year to craft a budget carefully and stick to it when spending the
tax money Americans send in. Last year, it failed miserably, but
this year could be worse, many members say. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   PARKS-POLLUTION (Washington) _ As part of regulations that could
be announced by President Clinton as early as Thursday, which is

   Political memoirs are like the film ``Rashomon,'' in which an
experience is transmogrified by sharply different memories. Case in
point: George Stephanopoulos' ``All Too Human: A Political
Education'' (Little, Brown) versus Dick Morris' ``Behind the Oval
Office: Getting Re-Elected Against All Odds'' (Renaissance). The
books often convey utterly dissimilar points of view, reflecting
the cutthroat infighting that prevailed when their authors were
advisers to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, they maintain a mutual non-admiration society
regarding their respective works. Stephanopolous called ``Behind
the Oval Office'' ``more than 300 pages of the rooster taking
credit for the dawn,'' while Morris wrote that ``All Too Human'' is
``the most gripping tale of a man's successful battle against his
conscience since Albert Speer's cliffhanger, `Inside the Third
Reich.'''
</P>
<P>
   No, Morris and Stephanopoulos didn't have a lot in common. Here
are contrasting excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before serving in the White House, both underwent background
checks. Questioned by Webster Hubbell, the Clinton aide,
Stephanopoulos had a tough time sounding like anything other than
the ex-altar boy he once was:  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After racking my brain ... I even told Webb about the night
before I left for college, when I went out egging cars with my high
school buddies one last time.
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Morris _ later to endure the disclosure of his
affair with a prostitute _ already had a piquant resume:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I had a lot to hide. I had fathered a daughter by a woman to
whom I was not married and I knew that were I to become well known,
the story could eventually leak out.
</P>
<P>
   Early in my tenure with Clinton, Erskine Bowles (the chief of
staff) approached me and asked that I tell him anything ``the
president needs to know'' about my past. Determined not to mislead
the president, I told him about my daughter, and said that I paid
$4,000 a month for child support.
 &UR; When Morris and Stephanopoulos first met over dinner at a
Washington restaurant in May 1995, Morris thought Stephanopoulos
wasn't that bad of a guy:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over his whiskey and my cognac, the conversation loosened, and I
felt a warmth toward him that continues still ... His intensity
matched mine, and our skills were complementary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Yet the feeling wasn't mutual. Stephanopoulos on Morris at the same
dinner:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was a small sausage of a man encased in a green suit with
wide lapels, a wide floral tie, and a wide-collared shirt. His
blow-dried pompadour and shiny leather briefcase gave him the look
of a B-movie mob lawyer, circa 1975 _ the kind of guy who gets
brained with a baseball bat for double-crossing his boss. But his
outfit was offset by the flush of power on his pasty face ...
</P>
<P>
   I noticed at once that Dick was missing a gene: He literally had
no shame.
 &UR; After the Democrats' disastrous 1994 loss of Congress, Morris, ever
the poll-oriented guru, groped for a way for President Clinton to
retake the political stage:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I blurted out the strategy I proposed in a single word:
triangulate. I found myself shaping my fingers into a triangle,
with my thumbs joined at the base and my forefingers raised to meet
a point at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triangulate, create a third position, not just in between the
old positions of the two parties but above them as well.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   I saw triangulation as a way to change, not abandon, the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But for Stephanopoulos, triangulation was an abdication of
principles:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dick explained his theory in elaborate terms, but it boiled down
to a relatively simple proposition: Steal the popular-sounding
parts of the Republican platform, sign them into law, and you'll
win. The fact that it would anger Democrats was not a drawback, but
a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris was self-effacing about his role in foreign policy:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day I asked Clinton what role he wanted me to play in
foreign policy. His instructions were strict, and I followed them
closely: ``Never talk to me about foreign policy in the presence of
a third person. Always do it one-on-one with me.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   I began to consult outside experts and to channel their advice
directly to the president ... From my role as a conduit, I learned
how Clinton gradually put his own stap on foreign policy, making it
 &UR; his  &LR; policy ...
 &UR; But Stephanopoulos credits his nemesis with considerably more
influence:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bad enough that he was wreaking havoc with domestic policy. On
national security matters, ad hoc decisions could be dangerous, and
his involvement would open the president up to attack for turning
to an amoral pollster on matters of war and peace. In May, after
Morris tried to end run the NSC (National Security Council) and
rewrite U.S. policy on terrorism and trade with Japan, Tony Lake
(the national security adviser) had gone to Clinton and secured his
commitment that Morris would be walled off from the national
security policy-making process. But by July, Dick was on a power
jag. He was building his campaign empire, and he had the run of the
government ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris and Stephanopoulos even disagree about Clinton's ability to
handle criticism. According to Morris:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to be challenged, Subordinates who give way
unnerve him.
</P>
<P>
   If in the first five minutes after you meet Clinton, you don't
mention something he's done wrong, you've lost him. He's bored by
what he's doing right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yet Stephanopoulos' old boss didn't appreciate negative reviews of
his Marlon Brando imitation on ``Larry King Live'':  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As the president cheerfully removed his makeup with a Handi
Wipe, he asked me how it had gone. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You avoided any  &UR; big &LR;  mistakes, but, umh ... you know ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You may get a little too much attention on this Brando thing.
It was a  &UR; good &LR;  Brando, probably too good. The morning shows won't
be able to resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton screwed up his face as if I'd just served him sour milk
and turned away in search of a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Self-serving though the memoirs may be, neither author claims
infallibility. Morris got flak in 1995 for suggesting that
according to his polls, a camping vacation for the president would
play well with swing voters:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was not happy. This was carrying things too far. ``Can I
golf?'' he asked in a question dripping with sarcasm. ``Maybe if I
wear a baseball cap?'' he bargained ...
</P>
<P>
   He began to pose hypotheticals. ``What if I hike, set up my
campsite, and go fishing but I don't catch anything? Will that be
OK?''
</P>
<P>
   I deserved the ribbing. This advice was the ultimate in carrying
polling to a mindless extreme.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stephanopoulos found himself ``a wreck'' in 1993 when the
president's TelePrompter, which was supposed to unspool a major
health care address, instead showed the last State of the Union
address:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This screwup might not have been my fault, but it was my
responsibility. ``This is the worst thing that's ever happened,'' I
muttered. ``I dunno,'' replied Mike Feldman, the vice president's
aide, ``the Holocaust was pretty bad.''

   SOC-VECSEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ The best hour to call is 2 or 3 in
the morning, New York time. That is when his brothers return home
from the air-raid shelters in Belgrade. ``It's six hours time
difference,'' MetroStars Coach Bora Milutinovic said. ``They spend
the night there.'' When he is on the soccer field, he tries to put
the fighting out of his mind. If people ask, he deflects it in
fragments of four languages, but when his fear and anger come out,
they are as clear as a scream. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   LIPSYTE-COLUMN (Undated) _ In his opening statement at a Brown
University symposium on ethics and sports, Andrew Edgar, director
of the Center for Applied Ethics at the University of Wales,
promised his listeners that they would find out just ``how
difficult and irreconcilable the problems are.'' Over two days, an
impressive roster of panelists seemed to agree only that politics,
power, race, gender, class, disability and sexual preference were
the prisms through which sports could be understood. By Robert
Lipsyte.

attorney of Travis County, Texas, and several of his top aides that
their minds were closed, that they would do anything in their power
to keep a teen-ager named Lacresha Murray in prison, that they had
so much invested in the case, and had reaped so much positive
publicity from her arrest and conviction, that they were incapable
of admitting they might have been wrong. The case no longer was
about justice but about public officials saving face.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting was in Austin in early December. Lacresha was some
60 miles away in the Giddings State Home and School, where she was
serving a sentence of 25 years for the beating death in 1996 of a
2{-year-old girl named Jayla Belton. I had written in a series of
columns that Lacresha, just 11 years old when Jayla died, had been
the victim of a colossal miscarriage of justice. There was no
legitimate evidence against her, no witnesses, no forensic
evidence, not so much as a drop of blood or a speck of body fluid
of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of such evidence was an indication that someone
else, somewhere else had inflicted the fatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   All the prosecution had was a statement taken from Lacresha
after a lengthy police interrogation in which she repeatedly
insisted she had done nothing to harm Jayla. An officer told her,
``We are going to stay here until you tell us the truth.''
Isolated, and without the help of a lawyer, Lacresha eventually
came up with a fantastic scenario that even prosecutors said would
not have accounted for the injuries that killed Jayla.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in December the district attorney, Ronnie Earle,
told me that Lacresha's statement was ``basically a lie.'' But he
insisted that it pointed to her guilt. His office used it to get a
conviction against her not once, but twice. (The first conviction
was thrown out by a judge who said, ``I had a question as to
whether justice was done.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last week the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Lacresha's
second conviction. The court's three judges ruled unanimously that
her statement had been obtained illegally. Under Texas law a child
who is alone in the custody of the police must be taken before a
magistrate to ensure that the child's rights are protected and that
the child understands the proceedings that are taking place and the
penalties that might ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The level of Lacresha's understanding of what was going on can
be gauged from a tape of her interrogation. A statement _ in
effect, a confession _ had been typed up and handed to Lacresha by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that word?'' she asked. ``Home-a-seed?''
</P>
<P>
   When she was told the word was ``homicide,'' she asked, ``What's
that?''
</P>
<P>
   No one answered.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors tried to explain away their failure
to follow the law and get a magistrate to look out for Lacresha's
interests by insisting she was not in custody when she was
interrogated. The appeals court would have none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not free to leave,'' wrote Justice Lee Yeakel in his
28-page opinion. He described Lacresha as ``isolated and alone''
during the interrogation, adding that ``at a minimum, we cannot say
that appellant's statements were not the product of fright or
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning prosecutors tried to portray Lacresha as a
monster, a maniacal juvenile who inflicted a savage beating on a
2-year-old. They referred to her in private as ``La Creature.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries to Jayla were compared to those that might occur in
an auto wreck. But investigators could never come up with any of
the forensic evidence that usually accompanies such a frenzied
attack _ the blood, the soiled clothing, the bits and pieces of
human tissue, the fiber evidence. All they had was the statement
that resulted from an unconscionable police interrogation of an
11-year-old. And now an appeals court has said they can't even use
that.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what will happen next. Last week's ruling can be
appealed. Or Lacresha could be tried a third time. Her lawyers are
trying to arrange her release. But for the time being, she remains
locked up at Giddings, a victim of prosecutorial zealots more
interested in saving face than seeking justice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I sense the hidden hand of Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   It is just too delicious, too dripping with irony, not to be an
idea that Harold and Hillary concocted one night with a full moon,
laughing maniacally and munching on Ickes' favorite canape, Ritz
crackers and peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Surely they cooked up this ``First Hostess'' how-to book in a
deeply Machiavellian moment as a strategy for the New York Senate
campaign, a way to outpace the workaholic mayor with swing-voting
soccer moms upstate and life-style-obsessed yuppies in Manhattan. I
hope so. Otherwise, it is plain weird.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster announced that Hillary Clinton _ she who
bridled at the term first lady, she who bristled at the thought of
staying home and baking cookies, she who preached two for the price
of one, she who brazenly reverted to Rodham once the coast was
clear, she who insisted on being in the West Wing with the boys,
she who went boldly where no president's wife had gone before and
hijacked vast precincts of social and legal policy _ will produce a
book on the joys of entertaining and decorating.
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Invitation to the White House,'' the Simon &AMP; Schuster
press release gushes: ``Mrs. Clinton will discuss the challenges
and pleasures of being the First Hostess; how she has showcased the
best of American design, cuisine and culture; how changes in the
type of food and style of service have been initiated; and how she
has increased the number and diversity of people who enjoy the
hospitality of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   It was better when Mrs. Clinton was channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt. Eleanor was a more natural soulmate for her than Martha
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers are not at all troubled by the fact that the
esthetic and cultural standards of the Clinton White House have
been abysmally low. Kaki Hockersmith, the Little Rock decorator who
redid the White House in High Hot Springs, will help with the book.
</P>
<P>
   It's insulting that Mrs. Clinton is using her waning days in
power to chirp about matching the color of the roses to the rim of
the china.
</P>
<P>
   After the anguished year of Monica, you'd think the Clintons
would spend quiet time on true things.
</P>
<P>
   A book nattering about how delightful that Clinton hearth is _
when we know how strained it is _ brings to mind old British
movies, where characters make insipid, incessant small talk to
cover up something awful going on.
</P>
<P>
   When guests go to the White House now, they are not marveling at
what Simon &AMP; Schuster calls its warmth, elegance and innovation.
They are checking to see whether Hillary can muster an adoring look
for her husband, or whether she attempts to avoid him as they work
the room.
</P>
<P>
   The book will include more than 30 recipes. But we know that her
life's interest is not Gingered Pheasant Consomme and Blue Cheese
Fritters. Her most dog-eared recipes are Bill in a Stew, Seared
Husband, Grilled Staffers and Glazed USA.
</P>
<P>
   She is creating a Potemkin hearth, where she is the comfy, bring
the prez his socks-and-slippers first lady, rather than an
emotionally battered wife and celebrity victim doing a
county-by-county analysis of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   This first lady is not chic, like Jackie Kennedy. She is not
anti-chic, like Barbara Bush. She just doesn't live in that
universe. She lives in a bleaker universe without wallpaper or
table placement, where she is, as her staffers say, a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   When she stoops to playing wifey, inviting gossip columnists for
lunch, writing a book about Buddy and Socks, posing for a Vogue
glamour cover the same month her husband was impeached, heralding a
book on the cozy hearth after she failed to come home from North
Africa when the president began stumbling through a war, it comes
across as counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps remaking and remaking herself. There was a time when
if you asked about Hillary's style, her best friend, Susan
Thomases, would bite your head off. Hillary was supposed to be
spine, while Bill was no spine. She was supposed to be the
conscience for his agile, flexible, fallible self. Now, like her
husband, she tries to be all things to all people, but it just
makes her seem unformed. It is unsettling, and unentertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Hillary Clinton is that we don't know her
placement.

<P>
   PINARBASI, Turkey _ Like a visiting celebrity, Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem drew a crowd of a couple of hundred people before the
local police station this week when he stopped in this cow town in
central Anatolia to appeal for votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the applause was perfunctory in a campaign that has been
short on enthusiasm, as few Turks expect the elections Sunday to
lift the political paralysis into which their country has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   One Istanbul newspaper captured the public mood with a
front-page headline that asked: ``Why Are We Holding These
Elections?''
</P>
<P>
   Cem pledged that if re-elected he and his mentor, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, would work together for more jobs, better education
and health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the capture of the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah
Ocalan, Ecevit appears to be running strong. But even if his party
finishes first, it will almost certainly take less than 25 percent
of the vote. That would force it to assemble a coalition with one
or more other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The next government, then, whether or not Ecevit heads it, will
probably have no ideological cohesion and will find it difficult or
impossible to come up with strong measures to confront Turkey's
central problems, particularly the Kurdish insurrection in the
east. Most voters are acutely aware of those frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has been politically adrift since the last election in
1995. That election produced an Islamic-led government that so
upset secularist military commanders that they forced it from
office after one year. The government that was installed in its
place also proved unable to survive, and after it collapsed in
November, Ecevit took over as a caretaker to lead the country to
early elections.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign has been distinguished by its silence on
pressing issues. There has been little debate about ways to expand
democracy and increase respect for human rights, and even less
about how religious and secular impulses in Turkish society can be
harmonized. Most remarkable of all, the Kurdish war that has been
tearing at the national fabric for a decade and a half has barely
been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a problem has dragged on for 15 years in a country,'' the
commentator Mumtaz Soysal wrote in a newspaper column this week,
``if that country has lost more than 30,000 dead and tens of
thousands of wounded due to that problem, if hundreds of thousands
of people have been forced to migrate from the eastern part of the
country to the west, leaving behind deserted towns and villages and
settling in overcrowded cities, if people are still carrying out
suicide attacks and trying to kill public officials, one would
expect this problem to be a main topic in an election campaign. Is
it not utterly incomprehensible that a country can go to elections
without addressing its most urgent problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have ruled out any discussion of new
approaches to the Kurdish issue, and even the mere suggestion that
they reconsider their rejection of Kurdish nationalism can bring a
prison sentence. Urging a greater role for religion in public life
is also taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology has all but lost its meaning in Turkish politics. Two
parties, including the one headed by Ecevit, call themselves
center-left, and two others say they are center-right. But to the
extent that they offer programs at all, they are barely
distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, the election revolves largely around
the personalities of the half-dozen bosses who run the country's
main political parties like private fiefs. All are veterans of
years or decades in politics, and none has succeeded in rousing
much public enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting result of Sunday's voting will be
the strength of the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, whose religious
appeal puts it outside the popular consensus and makes it anathema
to the ruling establishment. The Virtue party governs the country's
two biggest cities, Istanbul and Ankara, and has won a reputation
for honesty and efficiency that has broadened its appeal beyond
Turkey's limited circle of rigorous Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Virtue's top leaders are facing prosecution on
accusations of making subversive public statements, and in
response, the party has begun urging repeal of laws that limit free
expression. This presents the odd spectacle of a party running on a
platform of increased democracy while fending off accusations from
enemies that it harbors a secret plan to impose fundamentalist rule
and destroy democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtue party and Ecevit's Democratic Left party are widely
believed to be competing for first place in Sunday's voting. But
even if Virtue finishes first, it is uncertain whether it will be
given a chance to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Virtue because it is so different from the other
parties,'' Necmettin Dincer, a 60-year-old dairy farmer, said as he
sat in a general store in Pinarbasi. ``It gives voice to our desire
for democracy, for a country where people are not sent to jail for
poems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month one Virtue leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former
mayor of Istanbul, was jailed after reciting a poem that was judged
to be an incitement to religious rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   One other party is defying the political consensus in Turkey. It
is People's Democracy, which asserts that it speaks for the
country's Kurdish minority. Prosecutors failed in efforts to close
down the party before the election on the ground that it maintains
``organic links'' with Kurdish guerrillas. But the police have
banned and broken up its rallies, and this week journalists were
forbidden to travel to the southeastern provinces where it is
based.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish law requires that parties take 10 percent of the vote
nationwide in order to win seats in Parliament, and People's
Democracy is not expected to reach that level. If it runs strongly
in the southeast, though, it will solidify its claim that it speaks
for many Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Voting is mandatory for the 38 million eligible Turks, and those
who do not wish to risk a fine will be able to choose from among 21
competing parties. Many will do so reluctantly, among them an
accountant in Pinarbasi, Burmanettin Karakol.
</P>
<P>
   Although his office faces the town square where Cem, the foreign
minister, spoke on Thursday, Karakol did not bother to listen to
what he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy hasn't taken root here,'' he said over tea. ``We
have a country where courts close political parties and where
people aren't allowed to speak their minds. Instead of discussing
our problems in Parliament, we fight them out in the mountains. So
can you wonder why most people find this election boring?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enough of ``Monica's Story.'' Archaeologists
digging in the Mall have happened upon the historically tantalizing
story of Mary Ann Hall, a determined woman who built and managed
one of this city's finest 19th-century bordellos.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story brick house of the entrepreneurial Ms. Hall
flourished for four decades just down from Capitol Hill _ a
monument, in its way, to capital power and sex, but also to a level
of discretion that seems rare in modern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was obviously a successful, independent woman and she
clearly maintained connections throughout her life,'' Donna
Seifert, an archaeologist who unearthed the dregs of Ms. Hall's
brothel _ champagne bottles and gilt dinnerware shards _ said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a grassy stretch of the Mall where the Smithsonian
Institution's new National Museum of the American Indian is to be
built beginning in September, immediately east of the Air and Space
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we never found her little black book,'' said
Elizabeth Barthold O'Brien, an archaeology historian, who also
worked on the dig three years ago and co-wrote an archaeological
report with Ms. Seifert that amounts to a new chapter in the
underlife of historic Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without impeaching a soul in retrospect, Ms. O'Brien and Ms.
Seifert documented through city and court records Ms. Hall's place
in Washington life and the way she profited elegantly near the
Capitol in an era when lawmakers lived more of the bachelor's life
and the lobbying arts included what historians say were the
services of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moralizing era, as ever in Washington, but Ms. Hall and
her employees never came close to entry on the police blotter, even
as hundreds of streetwalkers and prostitutes in shoddier houses
were written up routinely as nuisances, despite the legality of
prostitution. Rather, Ms. O'Brien found Ms. Hall listed on city
records as an upstanding taxpayer as her property value compounded
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The doughty madam stood out as the rare woman who became wealthy
across the go-go years of the Civil War. Far from any whiff of
Brothelgate, she succeeded scandal-free at a time before houses of
prostitution were banned here in 1914 in a wave of civic
righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Hall was the antithesis of all the moralizing warnings of
her day,'' Ms. O'Brien said. ``She lived a long life, made a lot of
money, and left a gorgeous grave.'' Her towering stone memorial in
the once-rural Congressional Cemetery, a mile southeast of the
Capitol, and just down from a phalanx of smaller stones of departed
lawmakers, depicts a beautiful young woman wistfully pondering
life's passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pored over tons of documents, but Mary Hall remains a
mystery,'' said Ms. O'Brien, speaking of such unanswered questions
as how the young woman found the money and pluck for her
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The two researchers tracked a good deal of lost information but
found no photograph of Ms. Hall. She maintained a classic ``parlor
house,'' their report concludes, a sanctuary where ``men of wealth
and distinction'' were wined, dined and sexually served by women
``noted for their youth, beauty and social refinement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Ms. Hall rented her property to a women's health
clinic in her retirement years, about 10 years before she died.
This was when prominent Washington women had begun crusading openly
in behalf of their ``fallen sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respectable women bravely introduced Washingtonians to the
novel concept that some women turned to prostitution by necessity
rather than choice,'' the archaeology report notes of days when
cities were largely devoid of economic opportunities for single
women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall's death in 1886 at the age of 71 brought on a court
fight by siblings over her fortune and an obituary in The
Washington Evening Star that praised her civic integrity and ``a
heart ever open to appeals of distress.'' Finding the old
litigation record, Ms. O'Brien discovered the contents of Ms.
Hall's top-of-the-line brothel, from expensive Brussels carpets to
suites of red-plush furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her memory will be kept green by many who knew her sterling
worth,'' the obituary concluded. But her memory, as with the dust
of her myriad clients, was well faded until the researchers dug
into the history of the proposed construction site, as required by
federal preservation laws. Their report was entered into the
archives without fanfare in this city of endless homage and
ceremony for the more idealized aspects of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists found no mention of Mary Ann Hall in history
books. But they uncovered bureaucratic records of her bordello in a
day when ``prostitute'' was an accepted occupation in the federal
census.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall's house at 349 Maryland Ave., with 18 ``inmates'' and
fine food and furnishings, was rated at the top of the list of 450
brothels cataloged by the federal provost marshal's office in 1862,
when the city teemed with transient men, encamped soldiers and an
estimated 5,000 prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Her house stood out in what was then the city's tenderloin,
dubbed ``Louse Alley,'' a canal-laced warren adjacent to the
sprawling ``Hooker's Division'' neighborhood _ a popular word-play
on Gen. Joseph Hooker, whose Union troops bivouacked on the future
Mall and patronized local prostitutes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In undertaking the assignment to research the construction site
for John Milner Associates, historic research specialists, Ms.
Seifert and Ms. O'Brien delved into a time when sex and politics
seemed to have been a far less public sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, what's going on here?'' Ms. Seifert related when
Ms. Hall's old garbage dig yielded masses of corks, bottles and
broken plates of long-ago revels, giving her the first clue to the
human endeavors that had taken place there. By coincidence, she had
previously researched the underpinnings of the new Ronald Reagan
Building to the west, near the White House, and there, too, found a
brothel's remains.
</P>
<P>
   A muckraking book from 1883, ``Mysteries and Miseries of
America's Great Cities,'' told of the finest prostitutes being
employed by corporate lobbyists to influence legislation. ``The
type of house she ran, as well as its proximity to the Capitol,
would certainly have made it a possibility,'' the archaeological
report carefully concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hall managed an ``upper-10'' establishment _ a 19th-century
New York term for the very best in private trysting places. Ms.
O'Brien diligently searched criminal court records for any charges
against Ms. Hall, but all she found was mention of an angry
defendant demanding to know why the authorities never troubled Ms.
Hall's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some evidence that women came and left with
Congress,'' Ms. Seifert said, suggesting a certain seasonal aspect
to the life of democracy. ``It was just treated as part of the way
things were,'' she said of the fact of prostitution and the
corollary notion of the time ``that men couldn't really be expected
to control their sexual appetites.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scandal-weary eyes of modern Washington, there may be
particular relief in the fact that the researchers uncovered no
profiteering kiss-and-tell narratives about this buried part of
Washington's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Ann Hall's brothel was a large and prosperous household
that offered material comforts to its inmates and guests and made
Hall a wealthy woman,'' the researchers concluded with all the
sensibility of the departed madam.

A WAR IN WHICH EACH SIDE CREATES ITS OWN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Until last week, the clampdown had been fairly
thorough, the details relatively scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities kept most reporters out of Kosovo and away
from the physical evidence that might confirm the extent of
Yugoslavia's campaign to drive ethnic Albanians from their homes,
while American and NATO officials provided only the barest
information about airstrikes, which were almost invariably
portrayed as successful.
</P>
<P>
   Then came reports on Monday that NATO had inadvertently bombed a
train carrying civilians in Yugoslavia, and, several days later,
that a NATO pilot had hit trucks carrying displaced persons in
Kosovo. And the war for public opinion, waged through a taut
control over information and an assiduously managed dissemination
of it, entered a new, more intense phase.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Yugoslav authorities were whisking reporters on a
selective tour of carnage and NATO officials were giving newly
painstaking explanations of how airstrikes were conducted.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials even let reporters attending a news conference on
Thursday hear the voice of a pilot, which crackled from an
audiotape in an intimate, earnest assertion of how easy it was to
make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever since this conflict in the Balkans began, it was
clear last week that the battle between Belgrade and Washington
involved more than aircraft and artillery, F-16 jets and M-84
tanks. It involved diction, images and feuding versions of reality.
</P>
<P>
   That is almost always true of military engagements, but there
was a difference this time, as there was for the initial stretch of
the war in the Persian Gulf. The absence of American troops in the
combat zone _ and of American reporters with them _ meant there was
little opportunity to sift through competing and often
contradictory accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a situation where you don't have any access to make a
determination about truth,'' noted Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a media
analyst who has been carefully examining the pictures and words
from the Balkans. ``The ability for each side to create its own
reality is almost unlimited.''
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts and news executives said that to this point in
the conflict, accounts from NATO and American officials seem more
trustworthy and candid _ but often no more complete _ than those
from Yugoslav sources, which have said several times, for instance,
that NATO jets have been shot down, though they have produced
evidence of only one such episode.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO and American officials have been alternately reticent
or voluble, depending on where their interests lay. Clinton
administration officials have been deliberate in their language,
using words like genocide combined with blurry photographs
suggestive of mass graves to conjure up the Holocaust, even when
they were not explicitly invoking it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Americans are getting a view of what is going on in
the Balkans that, accurate or not, is stage-managed and subjective.
Because American officials have more direct lines of communication
to American reporters and citizens, their efforts have greater
effect and are more easily scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   During the first weeks of airstrikes, news media analysts noted,
NATO and American military officials did such a concerted,
convincing job of describing the efficacy of an ``ordnance'' (a k a
bomb or missile) in avoiding ``collateral damage'' (a k a civilian
deaths) that they had to spend recent days elaborately explaining
something that they then described as all but inevitable: the death
of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created an expectation that war is a low-cost
endeavor, and it's not at all,'' noted Ed Fouhy, a former network
news executive. ``War is a very dirty, bloody business.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that American officials have no stomach for
descriptions of violence. When it comes to the brutal actions of
Yugoslav forces in Kosovo under the control of the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, the terms that officials employ are
duly evocative, designed to build support among many Americans for
the military actions in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Attributing the vast array of horrors in the Balkans to the
whims and will of Milosevic, administration officials have
presented Americans with an identifiable portrait of malevolence
much easier to demonize than amorphous ranks of anonymous Yugoslav
soldiers. Early last week, when Milosevic's visage appeared on the
cover of ``Newsweek,'' it was framed by raging hell fires and
identified as ``The Face of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts noted that there was ample factual justification
for such a description, but that American officials were in other
instances letting their outrage get out ahead of provable
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, refugee reports that Yugoslav soldiers were using
rape as part of their campaign of forced expulsion from Kosovo went
from an assertion to an assumption of a systematic pattern in the
span of a day.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, was
at least pointing out that ``it takes time to confirm these
reports'' while condemning the rapes ``in the strongest possible
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, President Clinton was alluding to the crimes in
question as a given.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot simply watch as hundreds of thousands of people are
brutalized, murdered, raped, forced from their homes, their family
histories erased, all in the name of ethnic pride and purity,'' he
told a gathering of newspaper editors in San Francisco.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later in the speech, he said that if the possibility of
unintended civilian deaths prevented military action in Kosovo,
``then we're saying it's okay with us if Milosevic displaces over a
million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon thousands of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   News media analysts and news executives noted that while that
may eventually be proved accurate, some of the presumptions about
Iraqi atrocities during the Persian Gulf War were later challenged,
as were Pentagon boasts about the efficacy of ``smart bombs'' and
Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must always be skeptical about official military
information,'' noted Marvin Kalb, a longtime correspondent for CBS
News who now heads the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics
and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Television news executives said they were trying to signal such
skepticism in their reports, or at least make clear how, where and
from whom they were getting the information and images they
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've often taken some pains with our reporting from Belgrade
to point out that our report had to go through a censorship
process,'' said Bill Wheatley, executive vice president of NBC
News.
</P>
<P>
   But, he noted, ``To a considerable degree, we're dependent on
information from the Serbs and from NATO. The Serbs have shared
very little information about their military activities, and the
NATO people have shared more, but it's been limited, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communications at
the University of Pennsylvania, said that in light of that, the
audience should be wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be very careful about asking, what do we really
know?'' she said. ``What is our firsthand experience of it? The
answer at this point is, we can't know.''

 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Every patient in Britain knows about the notorious
National Health Service waiting list, which tells how many people
are waiting for hospital treatment for anything from varicose vein
removal to hip replacement surgery. Never a short list, it
currently boasts 1.12 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting has always been part and parcel of the British health
service, a price patients pay for free medical treatment. But there
is another list, one that the government, which has vowed to
improve health care, does not officially acknowledge and that
patients are just learning about. This is the waiting list to get
on the waiting list _ and it appears to be growing precipitously,
even as the Labor government proudly announces that the official
list itself is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   How does this work?
</P>
<P>
   Take Tony Nelson, a 54-year-old resident of the tiny village of
Irby-in-the-Marsh in Lincolnshire. Several months ago, he presented
himself at his general practitioner's office seeking help for a
chronic problem: rheumatoid arthritis that has hurt his hands, his
legs and especially his back. As a self-employed heating contractor
whose disability means he can work only part of a week, Nelson
needs a back operation to allow him to work full-time again.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson got some unwelcome news. Not only would he have to
wait for treatment, the doctor said, but he would have to wait for
another doctor to confirm he needed treatment, for a total of about
two and a half years. The first wait, of 18 months, would be for an
appointment with a spinal specialist. The second wait, of about a
year, would be for the operation itself.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, until he saw the specialist, the doctor said, Nelson
could not get on the official waiting list. He would not even be
allowed the pleasure of being a government statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an obvious trick if you want to reduce the number on
the waiting list,'' said Ann Widdecombe, the Tory shadow health
secretary. (The Tories say there was a waiting list for the waiting
list when they were in office, too, but that it was much shorter _
247,500 people in March 1997 compared with 468,000 at the end of
1998.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is that until you get in to see the
consultant, no one has made a judgment about the urgency of the
case,'' Miss Widdecombe said. ``It's literally playing politics
with people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as successive governments have struggled to
keep health spending down and avoid raising taxes the waiting list
has become a potent political issue. That is why Tony Blair's Labor
government said in the fall of 1997, only months after assuming
office, that it would devote a large portion of the extra $880
million it allocated to the Health Services $67 billion annual
budget toward getting the numbers under control.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising underground waiting list raises doubts about the
usefulness of the Labor government's effort, which set specific
targets for hospitals and the health care authorities that control
them to reduce the waiting list. Among other things, the program
provided for an ``action team'' that travels the country and helps
hospitals shorten their lists, and awards money to hospitals that
meet their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Britain's health secretary, Frank Dobson, proudly
announced that the effort was paying off. Between April 1998 and
the end of this February, he said, the number of Britons waiting
for treatment fell by 189,310, to 1.12 million _ the lowest since
February 1996. Moreover, he said, no one on the list now has been
waiting for more than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These record results have come about because the 1 million
staff of the NHS have made massive efforts, with massive dedication
and skill, to deliver what everyone in the country wants: fewer
people on the National Health Service waiting lists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the 468,000 people waiting to wait? ``The Tory
figures are not incorrect,'' a Department of Health spokesman said
in an interview. ``But traffic throughout the Health Service has
increased, so that more people are seeing doctors in the first
place. That increases the wait for outpatient appointments.''
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the country, the wait for appointments with
neurologists, orthopedic surgeons and ophthalmologists can stretch
to well past a year, thus delaying a patient's diagnosis and
ultimate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors say they suspect that this is directly due to the
government's waiting-list initiative, which has led hospitals to
use all sorts of stratagems to meet the government-imposed targets.
</P>
<P>
   Such tricks include giving priority to minor operations that can
be more easily disposed of, while making more serious cases wait;
canceling treatment or transferring patients to different
specialists so that they have to start their wait all over again,
but are statistically treated as if they have just begun waiting,
and spending huge amounts of money to have waiting-list patients
treated in private hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Because the figures can be so easily manipulated, many medical
experts say, the waiting list is a poor gauge of the overall health
of the system. ``What we're concerned about is overall waiting
time,'' said a spokeswoman for the British Medical Association, a
doctors' group.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors on the front lines agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to spend money doing relatively trivial
operations instead of doing procedures that really affect people's
lives, then I think it's immoral,'' said Stephen Swindells, a
consultant anesthesiologist at St. James' Hospital in Leeds. ``If
you talk to elderly patients who are in pain and waiting for a hip
or knee replacement, they see a wait of 18 months as quite
devastating. If they're only going to live for five more years,
that's a huge portion of their life wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   The waiting list is the system's way of rationing care, said Dr.
David Cartwright, who is the general practitioner for Nelson, the
heating contractor with rheumatoid arthritis. ``The government
can't have it both ways,'' he said. ``They can't say, on the one
hand, that we have no rationing, and on the other hand keep
everybody at bay by making them wait two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nelson waits, wishing that he had taken out private
health insurance years ago instead of depending on the National
Health Service. He is tired of being patient. He is tired of being
in pain and he is tired of being among the uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I said to one of my customers, `There's an 80-week waiting
list before I can see you,' there are two things he could think:
either this guy's grossly overworked, or he doesn't want the job,''
Nelson said. ``Either way, it isn't right.''

SPENDING BILL FEARED LIKELY TO REPEAT 1998 FIASCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress tells itself year after year to craft a
budget carefully and stick to it when spending the tax money
Americans send in. Last year it failed miserably, but this year
could be worse, many members say.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants a repeat of October's fiasco _ a last-minute bill,
4,000 pages long, lashed together in secret, larded with $21
billion of extra ``emergency'' money and approved without anyone
actually having read more than a handful of pages.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows precisely how to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know there's a disaster coming,'' says a senior House
Republican staff member. ``They just want it to be magically
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, put it plainly: ``We are in never-never
land.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the lay of that land: The Republican Congress, meeting
its deadline for the second time in a quarter-century, gave final
approval to a $1.75 trillion budget plan on Thursday. (Think of a
dollar as a second. One million seconds is less than 12 days; 1.75
trillion seconds is about 57,000 years.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $1.75 trillion goes to mandatory programs like
Medicare, Social Security and interest on the debt. That leaves
about $537 billion. The Pentagon will take more than half of that.
</P>
<P>
   What remains is roughly $246 billion in the Republican budget
plan to run the government _ about $37 billion less than this year.
Expressed as a percentage of the U.S. economy, this spending is at
its lowest in 37 years. It works out to about $2.50 a day for every
American.
</P>
<P>
   This frugality was enacted into law in the landmark
balanced-budget agreement reached between President Clinton and
Republicans in 1997. Together they created spending caps to
restrict the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to stay within the caps,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert
said on Thursday. ``That was a promise we made to the American
people.'' The president and his party also pledged to keep the
caps.
</P>
<P>
   That promise will be hard to keep. There has been a good deal of
dissembling about this. Obey said he had seen fellow members of
Congress ``tell the president the caps should be raised, and then
go out of the White House, look at the cameras and say the caps
have to be kept.''
</P>
<P>
   The caps require cuts in spending, and thus a consensus on what
to cut. None exists now. No consensus, no spending bill; no bill,
no way out of another ugly debacle, some members say.
</P>
<P>
   If such a spectacle occurs again, it could cost Republicans
control of the House next year, said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.,
who heads the appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, a conservative, said the greatest challenge to
consensus comes from the right. ``Some of our own people, who
dislike one percent of the bill, will vote against it all'' on
principle, he said. ``If we have members of our own party who are
willing to stop the machine for some minor issue, the Democrats
will win. It's up to us, if we want to maintain a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   With the memory of last year's spending disaster still fresh,
``there's hardly a member of Congress that doesn't realize the caps
will be lifted,'' Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., who heads the
appropriations subcommittee for federal labor, health and education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   His appropriations committee colleague, Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.,
agrees: ``The question is not if, but when.''
</P>
<P>
   But the extra money has to come from somewhere, and there is no
agreement on where that might be. Republican leaders have pledged
to cut taxes sharply and spend billions more on the Pentagon. This
lacks a certain ``political reality,'' said Jim Dyer, staff
director of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans who want to spend billions more on the
military than even their own budget writers propose may have a
golden opportunity on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants a $6 billion supplement to this year's
budget to pay for U.S. involvement in NATO's war in Kosovo, and
some Republicans want to add as much as $14 billion more _ not for
the war but for the national arsenal. The money could come from
``offsets'' _ in plain English, cuts _ in domestic programs from
food stamps to federal medical research.
</P>
<P>
   But ``there's no way we can find offsets for the Kosovo bill,''
Callahan said. ``It's got to come out of the surplus.'' But most,
if not all, of this year's surplus is supposed to be devoted to
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of conundrums faced under the caps.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer said Congress ``can gimmick and trick'' its way around the
caps, which he called ``basically numbers picked out of the air.''
Or, he said, ``we can use or abuse the emergency declarations. And
there are taxes and fees we can impose.'' Or Republicans and
Democrats can fall off the wagon and drink deeply from the surplus,
which next year will come exclusively from excess Social Security
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is politically palatable. And Republicans do not
want another government shutdown, which they think also cost them
political capital.
</P>
<P>
   But ``without some decisions from the leadership, and without a
new deal between Congress and the White House on tax cuts and
spending caps, we are heading for the same disaster as last year,''
a senior Republican staff member said.

AS BEIJING PRETTIES UP FOR A PARTY, IT PRESSES MIGRANTS TO LEAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ ``How can they get rid of us?'' said a disbelieving
Yang Zhuju, sitting with her shoe-repair equipment in the ruins of
the Dragon Temple street market. ``What we do benefits the everyday
life of Beijing residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yang, 36, moved here a decade ago from a village in southern
China. Along with scores of other vendors, virtually all of them
migrants, she sat along this street in western Beijing next to a
pile of concrete rubble the other day _ all that remained of the
stall she had built for her shoe-repair business, which she had
been forced to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   She and the other vendors were hoping to catch a few final
customers before city workers came to erase the last traces of this
formerly bustling market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dragon Temple market, like hundreds of others around the
city that have suffered similar fates, consisted of about a
quarter-mile of permanent stalls offering goods and services like
produce, watch and shoe repair, toys and compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition of such street markets this spring is officially
described as part of a ``beautification'' program as Beijing
prepares for celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But even more, official pronouncements have made clear, it is
also part of a master plan to cut the number of rural migrants
living and working in the city _ even those, like the vendors at
the Dragon Temple market, who bought annual licenses to do business
here and paid rent to the local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are getting so tough in Beijing now,'' said Ge You,
another displaced vendor at Dragon Temple, who had sold fruits and
vegetables. ``You are not allowed to run your business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ge, 45, is responding to his troubles just the way the city
hopes: seven years after he moved here with his wife and daughter
from a poor farming county in Henan Province, he is giving up. The
family is moving back to their village despite an utter lack of
prospects there.
</P>
<P>
   But experience and economic logic suggest that many other
migrants will find ways to stay on and that newcomers, visible any
day huddled around Beijing train stations, will continue to stream
in.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s internal migration was all but impossible
since work, housing and food rations were all tied to a strict
system of residence permits. Then, as social controls loosened and
the economy diversified, the government began to allow cities to
issue temporary permits for workers, spawning a vast ``floating
population'' of rural-to-urban migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Along with street markets, Beijing has also vowed to destroy
much of the unlicensed, add-on housing that is visible in back
streets and rented to migrants. At the same time, it is building
some new apartment blocks that will provide for ``centralized
administration'' of a small share of the remaining migrants and
``improve their living conditions,'' as a recent news article put
it.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also putting tight new restrictions on the jobs that
migrants can hold. Their continued employment in cleaning and
sanitation jobs will be just fine, but government offices and
companies, still the majority of employers here, will be strictly
limited in the number of migrants they can hire. Migrants will be
barred from working in about 200 occupations, including entire
sectors such as telecommunications and pager services.
</P>
<P>
   The new policies amount to a heavy three-pronged attack on the
rural people, believed to number more than 3 million, who live in
Beijing working as vendors, street sweepers, dish washers,
construction workers, building guards, maids or any other kind of
menial laborer. Beijing officials say the population of permanent
legal residents is 12.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to official estimates, 1.8 million migrants are
legally registered to work, some of them here with families, some
single. At least half a million people more are believed to be here
illegally, working as they dodge the occasional police sweep.
Regardless of legal status, some come for a few years to save up
money while others hope to stay for good even if they can never get
the schooling, housing and other rights of a permanent resident.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the current campaign, officials say, is to reduce
the number of legal migrant workers to 1.5 million as well as to
drive out many of the illegal visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newspaper article, the substandard housing that many
rent is described as ``dirty and disorderly'' and ``an
environmental menace and a threat to public safety.'' Migrants are
constantly blamed for the city's rising crime rate, though no
reliable figures have been published.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Beijing and other large Chinese
cities have tried to restrict migrants and if the city achieves any
success it may only reflect the economic slowdown. By definition,
the migrants come because they can make more money than back home,
where most were unneeded hands on overcrowded farms. They find work
in the city because there is a demand for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as skilled construction workers, make good money
here. But the vast majority work in jobs that no Beijing resident
will take, for wages _ perhaps $40 to $80 a month, sometimes with a
dorm room but no other benefits _ that most city residents
accustomed to the ``iron rice bowl'' security of state employment
would sneer at.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a growing share of state employees laid off, political
leaders preach about the need for residents to change their
attitudes and to take positions as maids or guards or laborers. One
of the implicit motives in expelling migrants is to open up more
low-end jobs for permanent residents. But the migrants are
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please ask the government if Beijing residents are willing to
ride those bicycle carts that transport most of their fruits and
vegetables,'' said Ge, the former produce vendor. ``Beijing people
don't want to do the work, but they want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yang, the shoe repairer, said she would try to find another
location where she could work unmolested, but if that did not work
out, she might have to consider leaving Beijing for her home in
Zhejiang Province. She refused to say what work her husband was
doing in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's fair or unfair,'' Ms. Yang said of the demolition
campaign, ``there's nowhere for us to go to complain.''

   INDIA-POLITICS (New Delhi) _ The Hindu nationalist-led

<P>
   Private rooms in hospitals were once for only those affluent
patients willing to pay as much as $300 a day extra for some peace
from the chatter, beeping machines and groans coming from the next
bed. Now a growing number of hospitals are eliminating shared rooms
and offering all patients _ Medicare and Medicaid, rich and
indigent _ their own rooms, often at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward private rooms is largely a byproduct of the
revolution wrought by managed care. Most hospitals are under
pressure to compete for patients. Insurers used to pay hospitals
based on a semiprivate room rate. Now they typically pay the same
flat amount no matter what the type of room.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also a factor, as hospitals need more space for
increasingly sophisticated life-support devices. Indeed, many
hospitals want to build rooms that can be easily converted to
intensive care units, which health planners project as a growth
area over the 30-year life of a typical hospital building.
</P>
<P>
   So while building private rooms is more expensive than shared
rooms, many hospitals say the extra cost is worth it to fill a
higher percentage of beds and to prepare for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody is building hospitals with private rooms
only,'' said C. Thomas Smith, president of VHA Inc., a national
purchasing and consulting network of 1,850 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Big university hospitals have recently completed buildings with
only private rooms in Chicago and Little Rock, Ark. Construction
will start this summer for an all-private medical center in Los
Angeles. Other current projects include a new Florida center of the
Cleveland Clinic, a county hospital near San Bernardino, Calif.,
and a new regional center for the South Jersey Hospital System in
Bridgeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At 315 square feet, many rooms in the new medical center at the
University of California at Los Angeles will be almost as big as
some Manhattan apartments. In the new building at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the rooms will be 225 square feet,
with separate sinks for patients and nurses and a vanity in the
hotel-style private bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The new private rooms have a number of health care advantages,
hospital executives say. They help protect patients from infections
in the hospital. They also encourage family members to stay with
the patient and become more engaged in the patient's care. In the
end, that helps because managed care has in many cases shortened
hospital stays and patients need all the help they can get, in the
hospital and at home.
</P>
<P>
   An independent study found that patients recovered faster in a
cooperative care unit at New York University Hospital, where family
members stay with them in 40 private rooms, than patients in
traditional units.
</P>
<P>
   Faye LeDoux, an architectural project director for Ellerbe
Becket, a Minneapolis-based firm, added, ``If you are in a room
with a person who requires a lot of care and a lot of noisy
equipment, it can be very stressful for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Waln, recovering from hip surgery after a painful fall,
enthused over the all-private attractions of Bernardino County's
new Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, Calif. They
include ``my own bathroom, my own TV.'' Teasing, she told a nurse,
``This is going to lead to malingering.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Waln, 64, was transferred to Arrowhead on its opening day,
March 30, from a 1940s building with a radically different
ambience. Her old room had six beds and a television that attracted
``20 or 30 people who came in every day'' to watch soap operas. She
remembers opening her eyes there, still woozy from anesthesia. ``I
thought I was in a garage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives say the economics of private rooms makes
sense in many parts of the country. Medicare, which typically
covers half of a hospital's budget, pays a flat sum that varies
with the diagnosis. Some managed care plans also pay this way;
others negotiate a daily rate for each patient, and some pay a
monthly fee for each plan member that is supposed to cover expenses
for those who require care.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the private rooms do not add directly to costs for
insurance companies and employer health plans. Instead of billing
the patient, many hospitals now absorb the relatively minor costs
of the larger, private room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a hospital can do it, great,'' said Ben Zelman, a vice
president of Medical Mutual of Ohio, a big insurance company based
in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   As they pursue patients, many hospitals have eliminated extra
charges for private rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always reluctant to charge a differential rate for a
private room,'' said Gary Mecklenburg, chief executive of
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. ``It would not be
positive public relations, when somebody is already paying a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A scattering of hospitals around the country have had
all-private facilities for a number of years. Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles has long had all-private rooms at no extra
charge. In Cleveland, the University Hospitals system opened Lerner
Tower, a 210-bed, all-private unit for adult patients, five years
ago. More than 90 percent of the beds are usually occupied, which
helps generate above-average profit levels for the system. On
average, only 61 percent of available beds are occupied in
Cleveland hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, where space is short and building costs are high,
the newer hospitals have not gone the all-private route, though
many have luxury accommodations for those who can afford it. ``The
economics are prohibitive in New York, compared to other places,''
said Kenneh Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans for a new children's tower at Presbyterian
Hospital, for example, include both semiprivate and private rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost the average hospital in New York City $25,000 more
a bed to convert to private rooms, said Robert Larsen, a principal
in the architectural firm Larsen, Shein, Ginsberg &AMP; Associates.
That would mean $750,000 more for a standard 30-bed floor.
</P>
<P>
   But in most places, in the accelerating race to draw on a
shrinking pool of generally sicker patients, it can be easier to
fill private rooms than to scramble to match up people by gender
and compatible ailments.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are building ``as many private rooms as real estate
and financial conditions will allow,'' said Larry Neiterman, global
director of health care for the Deloitte Consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   George Mann, a professor of architecture at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said: ``The trend is toward a model more like a hotel.
At the Holiday Inn or the Marriott, you don't get a stranger as a
roommate when you check in.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside, he said, is that the patient in a single room
``can be pretty isolated and far away, if something happens and you
can't reach that emergency cord.'' The new hospitals rely on
electronic patient-monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Frederick, a principal with Perkins &AMP; Will, an
architectural firm in Chicago, said, ``It is often cheaper to build
new buildings with the correct support space for medical technology
and the correct floor plan than to convert an older building.''
</P>
<P>
   Planners at Northwestern Memorial said that converting a 1940s
structure would have cost more than erecting the new building. In
some of the old areas, it was just not feasible to install 1990s
technology, said Meredith Zelewsky, a spokeswoman for Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1 Northwestern Memorial will open the $580 million
center, with 400 private rooms and 92 more for intensive care
patients. The big teaching hospital will shut an older facility
with 680 beds, 200 of which were often empty.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are equipped with fiber optic wiring so that nurses
and doctors can plug into a patient's medical records or digitally
stored X-ray images. Specially programmed air systems screen out
harmful bacteria to protect rooms with cancer or AIDS patients who
have weak immune systems. The systems also screen air coming from
rooms with patients who have contagious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some health care experts see the move toward private
rooms as driving up overall health care costs, which are now rising
6 percent a year after several years of slow growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately the private rooms do drive up the cost of health
care,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton
University. ``But it is amazing how cheap the costs per square foot
are compared to the costs of supplies and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital buildings cost $120 to $250 a square foot around the
country, except in California, where earthquake protection raises
the cost, and in New York, where building costs are especially
high.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on building and equipment is typically spread over a
number of years and represents only about 7 percent of a hospital's
annual operating expenditures, with most of that for the equipment,
said William Cleverly, who heads the Center for Healthcare Industry
Performance Studies in Columbus, Ohio. Buildings with all private
rooms, he said, may raise total operating costs, including labor,
supplies and capital spending, by five-tenths of 1 percent at most.
</P>
<P>
   Making the rooms at the new UCLA medical center all private
accounted for tens of millions of dollars of the $600 million total
cost, said Dr. Michael Karpf, director of the medical center, which
is part of a new $1.3 billion research and teaching complex.
</P>
<P>
   But the private rooms will allow more treatment to be done in
the rooms, as ``the tendency of patients being sicker and sicker''
continues, he said. Most of the 525 private rooms are being
designed to convert easily to intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that as technology is improved and miniaturized,
patients will get more done in their own rooms,'' Karpf said. Among
other things, they may have a dialysis machine, multiple
intravenous drips and an aortic balloon to assist the heart.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the extra cost will be ``well worth it,'' he said.
``If the new building was antiquated 20 years after it was built,
it would have wasted a lot of money.''

to provide more information to prosecutors that may enable them to
indict the top Yugoslav civilian and military leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Clinton administration's chief human rights
official traveled to The Hague to talk about the immediate needs of
tribunal investigators, including information gathered by American
intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussed ways for the United States to improve the
timely delivery of information about events in Kosovo to the office
of the prosecutor,'' Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh, the
chief American human rights official, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials have said that even as Western political
leaders were promising to provide detailed evidence to the court,
the tribunal found itself hampered by a lack of information about
the Yugoslav high command that only government agencies can supply,
like orders issued to commit atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, such orders can be best documented through
classified intelligence, like electronic surveillance, that
governments have either been reluctant to share or have hesitated
to allow to be presented in open court because of their fear of
exposing intelligence-gathering methods.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been gathering such classified evidence to
indict President Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav high command.
The British government on Friday also reinforced its commitment to
the tribunal by naming a ``Kosovo war crimes coordinator,''
responsible for sharing information with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Among Western foreign ministers, British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook has been the most outspoken in linking the crimes in Kosovo to
trials in The Hague. In announcing the new war crimes post in
London, Cook said: ``The message this appointment sends to
Milosevic is this. We know who you are. We know what your troops
are doing. There will be no hiding place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook has also been unusually direct in addressing Milosevic on
television. During a recent broadcast, he taunted Milosevic to go
ahead and tell the Serbian people, who are deprived of many goods,
about the villas the president keeps in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Other European political leaders have hardened their language
about the Yugoslav leader as hopes for a political settlement in
Kosovo have faded. A few days ago, French President Jacques Chirac
referred to Milosevic for the first time as ``the dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the leading NATO countries, France until recently was the
least cooperative with the tribunal, which was set up by the United
Nations in 1993. On several occasions, France refused to let its
military officers testify in The Hague, apparently to protect
classified information.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribunal has pressed Paris, and Gen. Philippe Morillon
of France, the former commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, is now
expected to testify soon.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, though, tribunal officials have been saying
that they cannot work effectively unless they get more cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is one thing for politicians to say who is in
command and who is responsible for war crimes in Kosovo, as
American and NATO spokesmen have done recently, but it is another
thing to demonstrate that in court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors need to provide the evidence to establish
responsibility. To indict a political or military leader for
``command responsibility,'' prosecutors must show what orders were
issued, or failing that, they need to demonstrate that a commander
knew of crimes committed by people under his responsibility and
failed to stop them or punish them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The office of the prosecutor says that it has gathered enough
evidence of war crimes in Kosovo to indict lower-level police and
army officers. But the prosecutors want more detailed information
about orders given within the Yugoslav command, which, if
available, is likely to be classified intelligence. Even when the
tribunal was given such intelligence in the past in connection with
crimes during the war in Bosnia and Croatia, prosecutors say they
have not been allowed to use that as evidence in the courtroom
because governments do not want their intelligence-gathering
methods exposed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kosovo, prosecutors put together a team of
investigators a year ago, as the Yugoslav police were stepping up
their repression against ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees now keep pouring out of Kosovo with accounts of mass
killings and abuse, investigators for the tribunal working in the
region are obviously overwhelmed, tribunal officials say. They are
assisted by dozens of specialists from the Organization for
Cooperation and Security in Europe and by other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Koh, of the State Department, said in The Hague on Friday that
the American government was providing a grant to the Coalition for
International Justice of the American Bar Association to document
cases of humanitarian law violations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that the list of war crimes they have already
compiled is very long. ``Proving ethnic cleansing and massacres is
not very difficult,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   But given the magnitude of the violence in Kosovo, the tribunal
will not be able to investigate events village by village. The main
targets of their investigations are people in positions of
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing lessons from their slow progress in investigating war
crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, where they sifted through many events
on the ground, they changed strategy in their work on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, prosecutors have focused on top government
officials in Yugoslavia and the most senior commanders in the
military and the police.

THE UNLIKELY UNION OF RUSSIA, BELARUS AND YUGOSLAVIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Politics makes strange bedfellows. Then there is
Russian politics, which seemed this week hellbent on the downright
weird: a menage a trois of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, bedding
a wobbly democracy, a Soviet-style dictatorship and an
international pariah three borders removed from either of them in
death-do-we-part union.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic first
proposed it, Russia's lower house of Parliament voted Friday by 293
to 54, with one abstention, for just such a marriage of nations.
Belarus' eccentric strongman, President Aleksandr Lukashenko, was
in Belgrade on Wednesday, making arrangements with Milosevic for
the linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Communists were jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is busy leading a new world order,'' Gennadi
Seleznyov, the Communist Speaker of Parliament's lower house, told
the news radio station Echo Moskvy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a leader regarding this idea of a new world
order. Therefore, let those of us who do not belong to NATO put our
heads together and state what kind of world order we see.''
</P>
<P>
   That the union is in fact highly unlikely to take place soon, if
ever, was almost irrelevant. Whatever the talk of world order and
thumbing Washington's eye, the drumbeat here for marriage with
Yugoslavia is far more a matter of domestic politics, not foreign.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the despair and helplessness that seem to
drive much of Russian politics these days _ despair over Russia's
plight and the West's comparative supremacy; anger over the
helplessness to do much about it _ talking up a union with Belarus
and Yugoslavia begins to look like very good strategy indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like demonstrations near the U.S. Embassy, which reflect
not the desire of the majority of Russians to get into a
confrontation with the West, but some remnants of some imperial
feelings,'' said Andrei Smirnov, a political writer for the Russian
daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the majority of the population, the visibility of
confrontation flatters them.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Communists and supernationalists who are the major
backers of union, the notion is that flattery will get them
somewhere in the parliamentary campaigns that are just beginning to
crank up across Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will choose all 450 members of Russia's politically
dominant lower house in elections this December. Already the idea
of reasserting lost Russian glory has become both the subtext of
parliamentary politics and a main theme of the house's effort to
impeach President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections in Belarus are canceled, courtesy of a new
Constitution that Lukashenko pushed through in a referendum widely
condemned as rigged. But from the start, he has based his regime on
the proposition that Soviet power should be rebuilt to counter
Western influence. In the last year, as Belarus' state-planned
economy has run aground, he has used the West more and more as a
foil for the country's troubles, and promoted reunification of the
old Soviet empire as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread popular support for the idea of unification
with Belarus _ and a formal announcement of plans for economic and
semipolitical union this winter _ the idea so far has gone almost
nowhere. In part, that is because Russia is too preoccupied with
its own problems to be able to absorb the 10 million residents of
Belarus, who are in even worse economic straits.
</P>
<P>
   In part, it may be that neither Yeltsin's camp nor Russia's
Communists and nationalists want Lukashenko, a charismatic and
cunning politician, as a rival in future elections.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, a union with Yugoslavia seems equally appealing to
many Russians. One poll of 3,108 Russians, taken last week by the
Moscow-based Center for International Sociological Research, showed
that 71 percent of respondents supported a
Russia-Belarus-Yugoslavia pact and that more than three-quarters
would consummate it now rather than later, after the NATO campaign
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   For Yeltsin, who wants to avoid a military or political
entanglement in the Yugoslav crisis, such support has been a
problem. The president initially said he would favor a union of the
three nations after the Communist speaker, Seleznyov, met with him
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, his aides have backed away from the idea,
calling it premature and even wrongheaded because of the danger
that it would drag Russia into a European war.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov, the poltical writer, suggests that Yeltsin's opponents
will seize on his foot-dragging in the coming parliamentary
elections and the presidential campaign that will follow to attack
the president's supporters and any successor he may endorse.
</P>
<P>
   That said, support for a three-nation union is hardly unanimous.
Some analysts point out that the idea has serious implications that
Yeltsin has raised obliquely and that Communists and nationalists
have yet to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unmentioned, but clearly on everyone's minds, are race
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and nationalists have promoted the merger as a
``pan-Slavic union''; the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church,
Alexy II, endorsed it as a ``great miracle'' and a ``guarantee of
our common spiritual triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 20 million Muslims, almost a seventh of the nation's
population, may see things differently. Already, leaders of some
predominantly Muslim regions in southern Russia have warned that
the union threatens to further split Russia's already fractious
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such initiatives have very dangerous implications since they
propel the non-Slavic part of the Russian population to adequate
measures and steps,'' Farid Abdullovich Asadullin, the Moscow
adviser to the Mufti, the Muslims' spiritual leader in Russia, said
in an interview on Friday. ``I think this initiative won't find
support either in the Cabinet of ministers nor from our
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the prospect, however remote, that a union with
Yugoslavia would bring with it a mutual defense agreement, the
stationing of Russian troops and a direct confrontation with a
nuclear-armed NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Russian politicians underscored that prospect last
week. ``The worst thing Russia can do is respond to insanity with
insanity,'' Grigory Yavlinsky, the liberal leader of the Yabloko
political faction in the lower house, said in a statement on
Friday. ``For the first time in history, it opens the possibility
for actual military confrontation between the leading nuclear
powers.''

 NATO COMMANDER CONFERS ON POSSIBLE USE OF GROUND TROOPS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Top American military officers flew here
Saturday in an apparent effort to lay the basis for deploying more
American forces _ possibly including ground troops _ in NATO's
effort to stop Serbs from driving ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, arrived at
midafternoon and immediately drove from the once decrepit airport,
now swarming with helicopters and relief supplies, to meetings with
Albanian government officials.
</P>
<P>
   His trip was arranged so suddenly that U.S. Air Force press
officers at the airport had no inkling of it until queried by
journalists in the late morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's second in command, Lt. Gen. Dan Coffee, the deputy
commander in Europe, was here Friday on a mission to assess the
resources available in this desperately impoverished country, which
has taken in more than 300,000 Kosovo refugees. He also examined
the local military situation. There has been sporadic shelling
across the border from Kosovo into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   While military officials were tight-lipped as usual about their
plans, it is possible that the visit could foreshadow some change
in NATO tactics of relying on bombing alone, which while inflicting
considerable damage on the Yugoslav infrastucture, does not appear
to have broken the Serbs' spirits or interfered with their brutal
effort to clear Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a wave of about 13,000 new refugees crossed the Albanian
border at Kukes during the night. Relief workers here and in
Macedonia were bracing for a further influx of traumatized people.
Many of the new refugees, relief workers say, are people who have
been hiding in the woods and mountains for weeks. They are
suffering from exposure, hunger and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   A large group appears to have been driven from the area around
Mitrovica in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimates that another 100,000 refugees may be trying to
cross Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of a key vote in Congress on a special appropriation
measure to finance the military campaign and the relief effort, a
congressional delegation flew in to visit the swarming refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Standing slightly apart from the senators and representatives
dispensing interviews, Maj. Gen. Randy West of the Marines quietly
eyed the scene, taking a longer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to gather my own intel,'' West said, referring to
intelligence information he might need in the event that Marines
are sent here in large numbers. West is the commander of the 2nd
Marine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   One Marine expeditionary unit from the 6th Fleet is already in
the area, and another is on the way, West said. But, he added, he
wanted to be ready for the possibility that larger numbers of
Marines might be called on.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine expeditionary unit is a strike force roughly the size
of a regiment, which is based on a ship, with its own attached
helicopters, Harrier jump jets and other close-in support aircraft
and some small amphibious armored vehicles. It numbers
approximately 2,000 to 2,400 troops and is commanded by a colonel.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kurdish refugee crisis in southern Turkey after the
Gulf War of 1991, Marines, who can be quickly deployed from their
ships, were used to provide relief and to protect Kurdish refugees
seeking to return to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Marines could also be used to provide perimeter security for the
long awaited _ and so far unseen _ Apache attack helicopters that
Clark says are coming to the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, the major strength of the Marines is as a quick mobile
strike force, capable of attacking enemy positions in helicopter
assault or opening a beachhead for more heavily equipped
conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Marine expeditionary units, known in military terms
by their acronym of MEU (pronounced mew), that do six-month
rotations with the 6th Fleet _ the 24 MEU and the 22 MEU _ are also
qualified for special operations, meaning that they are trained in
unconventional small-unit tactics like fighting terrorists or
rescuing hostages.
</P>
<P>
   A captured Serbian officer was turned over by members of the
Kosovo Liberation Army to NATO officials at the airport Saturday.
NATO spokesmen in Brussels issued a statement saying that the
captured Serb was being well-treated and had access to religious
counseling.

 SPORTS COLUMN: No. 99 ALWAYS GAVE 100 PERCENT  
(jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There isn't much to write or say that would improve upon the
tribute paid to Wayne Gretzky by Mike Lalor, who brought his sons
to the retirement news conference Friday and said: ``Guys, history.
Once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   This, from a fellow hockey player, a ``defensive defenseman,'' a
recently retired 12-year veteran of the National Hockey League.
Lalor just happened to be in from Boston, visiting a former
teammate, the Rangers' Todd Harvey. He didn't wear a suit, like
Gretzky's teammates, who solemnly marched in like a bunch of
grieving relatives. Lalor dressed up for the occasion with
11-year-old Jordan in the seat next to him, 8-year-old Mac plopped
on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, both with cropped blond hair, didn't fall asleep, as
did Gretzky's young son. They weren't as rapt as their father was
either, and the older boy said his favorite players were the
Russians, Sergei Fedorov and Pavel Bure. That wasn't the point. It
was about what was important to Dad, and what he wanted to share.
</P>
<P>
   Lalor, out of southern Ontario, played on a 1986 Stanley Cup
champion in Montreal, a year Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers took a
breather from winning it all. Gretzky was his country's hero, his
generation's standard, a father's teaching model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're out on the ice and you're trying to show the
kids something, you always use Wayne as your example,'' Lalor said.
``It was the way he conducted himself, on or off the ice. You heard
him. He never put himself above his teammates or the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No one shatters nearly every offensive record without ego, and
plenty of it. Gretzky just always managed to keep his in
perspective, control it as he did his stick. He allowed himself to
presume Hall of Fame induction on Friday afternoon, acknowledged
that he'd made a great deal of money for himself and a few others,
too. But when he got around to thanking ``people behind the scenes
who made it easy for me to get on the ice and just play hockey,''
he certainly did not mean his agent.
</P>
<P>
   For all the invective hurled at the Rangers for not providing
Gretzky with enough winning resources, he was afforded the
opportunity to play three years in the news media capital and prove
that you don't have to make the last shot to go out on top.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, admitted
that Gretzky was pained by losing, and sounded more sincere than
politically correct when he said it made the Rangers' slide that
much worse for him. ``I think everyone could detect how hard it was
for him,'' Checketts said. ``It was personally difficult for me to
take. It was a legend, and he wasn't going to get what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky played on, without apparent bitterness, or complaint.
Checketts recalled a late-season game against the Islanders last
year, the Rangers long out of playoff hope, when he went to his
general manager, Neil Smith, and the coach, John Muckler, to
suggest shutting the battered icon down. Gretzky wouldn't hear of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point?'' Checketts asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't help it,'' Gretzky said. ``It's the way I
was taught.''
</P>
<P>
   I sure hope people don't get into the habit of holding up
Michael Jordan whenever a great athlete is faced with an age-old
dilemma, of choosing the right time to quit. Obviously, Gretzky
doesn't. Twice during his news conference, he said he wished Jordan
hadn't retired because his kids loved watching him play. So did
mine, and especially for the sake of the 9-year-old in the house
who thought the man infallible, I found myself hoping Jordan would
pass the championship trophy on like a torch, send a message around
the world that he played to win, but the greater experience was
having played.
</P>
<P>
   As extraordinary an experience as it was watching Jordan hit the
championship shot last June in Utah _ even if we only wondered at
the time if it might be his last _ I can't say it is any more
memorable than watching Martina Navratilova lose her last match at
Wimbledon, the 1994 final against Conchita Martinez. On the way out
of the world's most famous tennis stadium, Navratilova bent down
and plucked a souvenir blade of grass. No one could ever convince
me this wasn't a true champion's proper exit.
</P>
<P>
   Boxers are a different category, of course. Muhammad Ali
suffered serious damage by hanging on, though history hadn't seemed
to hold it against him. The body of work ultimately speaks for
itself, no matter what the body looks like in the last scene. More
power to Willie Mays that he squeezed out an extra season or two
when he was a shadow of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every great athlete has to determine when the right time is
and there is something special about every great athlete's
retirement,'' said the Rangers' goalie, Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   There will be such moments Sunday afternoon, when Gretzky plays
his last game at the Garden against Pittsburgh. Mike Lalor is
taking the boys, but he hoped they were listening Friday when
Gretzky was asked if he would bother with Saturday's practice, now
that the definitive word was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last one,'' he said. ``I've got to be out there with
everyone else.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Help from `Baywatch' a lifesaver for Austin
 &HT;    By Andy Alford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With more than a billion viewers worldwide,
stars of the ``Baywatch'' television series may be unfamiliar only
to the Barton Springs salamanders. But on May 1, even the
salamanders will get get an eyeful.
</P>
<P>
   The show, known for its slow-motion shots of muscled men and
buxom beauties jogging to the rescue of imperiled surfers on the
California coast, also promotes water safety.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Salano, who plays the character Manny Gutierrez on
``Baywatch,'' and Kimm Collinsworth, a six-year extra and a former
student in the Round Rock school district, will visit Barton
Springs Pool to help the city recruit 650 lifeguards for its 47
public swimming holes.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, like other urban areas nationwide, has had difficulty
recruiting enough seasonal workers to keep all of its pools open
for the length of the swimming season, which runs from March to
September this year. The usual prospects, high school and college
students, have been taking advantage of the Austin area's low
unemployment rate by finding higher paying summer jobs. The city
currently has about 250 lifeguards on its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have such celebrity support for our recruiting
efforts,'' said Phil Halbrook, a spokesman for the city's Parks and
Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council in March voted to raise the pay rate for
lifeguards, and Parks and Recreation teamed up with Austin
Triathletes, Run-Tex and Capital Fitness to invite the ``Baywatch''
stars. The television series is paying for their visit

 &HT;    Book incorporates peace, positivity of Dalai Lama
 &HT;    By Judy Tarjanyi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Westerners in search of peace of mind
and soul have long turned to the religions and holy men of the East
for the kind of spiritual guidance that they perceive as absent
from their own religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hardly surprising that many would warm to a book on
happiness by one of the most popular religious figures of the East:
His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Phoenix psychiatrist Howard Cutler had in
mind when he proposed the idea for such a book in 1991. Although
the Dalai Lama has written eight other books, most of them on
Buddhism, ``The Art of Happiness'' (Riverhead, $22.95), which he
co-wrote with Cutler, is the first geared to a general Western
audience and it is getting an enthusiastic reception, rising on the
best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler agrees that a big part of the book's appeal is the Dalai
Lama himself. ``He is a wonderful illustration of how a person can
put these principles into practice in daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama's magnetism is more than star power, though,
Cutler said. ``I do think it has to do more with his personal
characteristics and qualities. When people meet him, they are
generally struck by his warmth, sincerity, genuineness, and basic
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Tibetan Buddhist leader, who has been exiled from
his homeland since 1959, declared during a 1991 visit to the
University of Findlay in Ohio that he bears no anger toward the
Chinese who occupied his country and committed atrocities against
his people.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``I see sufficient reason to develop
compassion,'' a quality he described as having ``good heart,''
which also happens to be the title of his 1996 book offering a
Buddhist perspective on the teachings of Jesus Christ. Cutler says,
``He does have that `good heart,'''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler first met the Dalai Lama in 1982 in Dharamsala, India,
``and I think it's really genuine. Like everybody else, sure, he
gets irritated, frustrated, but he doesn't turn it into intense
feelings of anger. If you see him, you can just sense he's really
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What better person then, Cutler thought, to tell Americans and
other Westerners how to find happiness? Cutler said that he was so
impressed over time by the Dalai Lama's serenity and sense of
fulfillment that he determined to identify what it was that enabled
the Tibetan Buddhist leader to achieve such a state. In the book,
he wanted to name and convey a set of practices that could be
applied to the lives of non-Buddhists in search of happiness,
strength, and the absence of fear.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, who is Jewish, said he approached the book more from a
secular, psychological perspective than a religious one. ``I
purposely didn't talk about Buddhist doctrine, beliefs, even
Western traditions. There's a distinction between spirituality as
religion and spiritual values like kindness, forgiveness,
tolerance. The Dalai Lama has written so many books on Buddhism ...
I wanted more something for daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is subtitled ``A Handbook for Living,'' is
divided into sections on the purpose of life, human warmth and
compassion, transforming suffering, overcoming obstacles, and
living a spiritual life. In it, Cutler invites the reader into
private conversations he had with the Dalai Lama in Arizona and
India, asking such questions as ``Is happiness a reasonable goal
for most of us?'' and ``Do you ever get lonely?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers, which also incorporate material from a series of
public talks the Dalai lama gave in Tucson in 1993, often were
surprising. For instance, Cutler was completely unprepared for the
Dalai Lama's simple ``No'' answer to his question on loneliness.
``I never expected to confront anyone who never felt lonely,''
Cutler writes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama explained that because he looks at human beings
from a positive angle, his attitude immediately creates a feeling
of affinity and connectedness with and to them, evaporating any
sense of loneliness a single, celibate male in exile might
otherwise feel.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler also was shocked when the Dalai Lama responded ``I don't
know'' and shrugged his shoulders when asked to assess the case
history of a patient who persisted in self-destructive behavior.
Seeing his questioner's surprise, the Dalai Lama said, ``Sometimes
it's very difficult to explain why people do the things they do ...
You'll often find that there are no simple explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in every instance, the Buddhist leader gave the
45-year-old psychiatrist plenty to ponder and develop. Much of the
Dalai Lama's advice, Cutler said, boiled down to overcoming
negative states of mind such as anger, hatred and greed and
cultivating positive states like kindness and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama believes the underlying basic human nature is
gentle and kind, and that violence and aggression are superficial
characteristics that arise in response to various kinds of
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he was especially challenged by the Dalai Lama's
belief that the purpose of life is to seek happiness. ``I found
that difficult because of my medical and psychiatric training. By
training a psychiatrist is meant to help a person become healthier
and happier. It's never stated that the purpose is to find
happiness. There's more of an emphasis on mental disorders and
negative states of mind and less emphasis on positive steps to
take.'' Cutler said before he left his psychiatric practice in 1993
to write the book, his encounters with the Dalai Lama had an impact
on his approach to patients. ``At the time I was practicing I had a
pretty orthodox, conventional psychiatric practice. But what I
found was how, as I implemented some of his principles, not so much
educating or instructing the patient in techniques for training the
mind or talking about Buddhist principles, but more from my own
side ... it changed the tone of the psychotherapy session so it was
more open and relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler said he used the Dalai Lama's emphasis on developing
compassion and his techniques for establishing empathy, reminding
himself that he and his patients had a common human bond.
</P>
<P>
   If he does return to practice, Cutler said, he may work some of
the Dalai Lama's practices and techniques for dealing with anger,
antagonists, and enemies into therapy, depending on the patient and
his or her needs. He would do this, he said, without talking
specifically about Buddhism as a religion.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he'll be writing another book for Riverhead,
publisher of ``The Art of Happiness.'' He will divide proceeds from
the first book with a trust for the Tibetan exile community.

   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes hit fixed targets
and military units on the ground in Kosovo overnight despite bad
weather that hampered operations, officials at alliance
headquarters said today. All NATO aircraft flying night raids over
Yugoslavia Friday and early today returned to base safely, an
alliance officer said. Daylight operations were continuing Saturday
morning. NATO's supreme commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark
traveled to the Balkans early today for talks with government

a final push to clear Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population. In
neighboring Macedonia, where at least 5,000 refugees crossed over
Friday, officials were bracing for an enormous influx in coming
days. Ron Redmont, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said more than 100,000 refugees were believed bound for
Macedonia after being driven from their homes in Kosovo.

   NATO-SUMMIT _ WASHINGTON _ More than 40 heads of state from

anniversary of NATO. But the mood of celebration is being undercut
by the difficult situation in Yugoslavia. NATO spent a half-century
preparing for the great war that never came. Now it's being tested
by a symptom of its own success. It was the Cold War defeat of the
old Soviet model, after all, that set in motion the collapse of
Yugoslavia. The job of picking up the pieces has fallen to NATO, in
the first combat mission in the history of the alliance, and very
possibly its last. (Deans, Cox News Service).

patients out of state-run institutions if they can do better in a

U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case when 26 states, led by
Florida, petitioned the high court to overrule a ruling against
Georgia by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Since
then, however, disability advocacy groups have stormed state
attorneys general offices (with protestors being arrested in some
states) and successfully persuaded 18 of these 26 states to tell
the Supreme Court they've changed their minds. The lawsuit, filed
by two Atlanta-area women who resided at the Georgia Regional

thinning hair. More than 1,400 people attended his funeral, where
he was eulogized as a professional who demonstrated how to live and
die with dignity. But what happened to Hood after his death robbed
him of all the dignity he stood for, his family says. The funeral
home allegedly botched Hood's embalming. The funeral home, owned by
industry giant Service Corporation International of Houston, denies
responsibility. Hood's family complained to the Texas Funeral
Service Commission, a state agency whose future is up in the air
because of turmoil that has erupted since it began investigating
the embalming practices of SCI. Lawmakers may abolish the agency,
which has been beset with funeral industry conflicts of interest, a
backlog of complaints and investigations, and allegations of
political pressure to drop the nearly $450,000 in fines it has
proposed against SCI. But Hood's family worries that Texas may lose

<P>
   On Jan. 19, President Clinton's top aides met in the Situation
Room in the White House basement to hear a fateful new plan for an
autonomous Kosovo from Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state.
NATO, she urged, should use the threat of airstrikes on Yugoslavia
to force a peace agreement to be monitored by the alliance's ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who had other matters on his mind, was not there.
His lawyers were starting their arguments on the Senate floor
against his removal from office. That night he delivered his State
of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five thousand miles away, in Belgrade, Gen. Wesley Clark,
the NATO commander, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military council, were sitting with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia. They came brandishing a plastic portfolio of color
photographs documenting a massacre of Albanians three days earlier
by Milosevic's security forces in the Kosovo town of Racak. One
picture showed a dead child holding a pacifier.
</P>
<P>
   They also came with threats of NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   This was far from their first encounter with the Serbian leader,
but this time, they recalled, they found a newly hardened man with
a bunker mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a massacre,'' Milosevic shouted. ``This was
staged. These people are terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clark warned him that NATO would ``start telling me to move
aircraft,'' Milosevic appeared nonplused by the prospect of
bombings. He called the general a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 19 is already seen as a pivotal day in the Clinton
presidency. But it may turn out to be so less for the Senate
impeachment hearings and State of the Union address than for the
moves toward war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo would have presented a daunting foreign policy challenge
even to a president whose powers of persuasion and moral authority
had not been damaged by a year of sex scandal and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the president's decisions on Kosovo would
have been any different if he had not been distracted by his own
political and legal problems. But it is clear that his troubles
gave him less maneuvering room to make his decisions, and that
diplomacy that came to rely heavily on maximum threats reduced the
wiggle room even further.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp criticism and questioning of his motives arose each time
he did take military action, as with the strikes in December
against Iraq when the House was poised to vote on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton is facing mounting criticism for not having acted
earlier or more decisively on Kosovo. His critics say that had he
done so, Milosevic would not have been able to move troops and
equipment into Kosovo and carry out the massive ``ethnic
cleansing'' of the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the president viewed the situation, there was only ``a bunch
of bad options'' confronting him, he said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the NATO allies hoped, even assumed, that they were
dealing with the Milosevic who negotiated the Bosnian peace at
Dayton, Ohio, the man who lied and manipulated and ranted in
all-night, Scotch-laden negotiations and then cut a deal in the
morning when he saw that it was in his interest. Instead they were
dealing with the Milosevic of Belgrade, who was willing to employ
mass murder to assure his continued dominance of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   CIA Director George Tenet predicted in congressional testimony
in February that there would be a major spring offensive by the
Serbs in Kosovo and massive refugee flows. But intelligence
assessments presented to Clinton about how Milosevic would respond
to NATO threats of military force were cloudy. These reports
included speculation that the Yugoslav leader would back down in
the face of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   One interagency intelligence report coordinated by the CIA in
January 1999, for example, concluded that ``Milosevic doesn't want
a war he can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After enough of a defense to sustain his honor and assuage his
backers he will quickly sue for peace,'' the assessment went on.
Another interagency report in February stated, ``He doesn't believe
NATO is going to bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by such assessments and his advisers, the president
pressed ahead with a strategy of threats coupled with negotiations,
gambling that Milosevic would back down. These threats quickly
became a test of NATO's credibility, with the added onus of the
alliance's looming 50th anniversary, which is to be observed next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, former Sen. Bob Dole went to Kosovo to gather
facts for an international refugee group of which he is chairman.
On his return, he reported his findings to Clinton. Afterward
Clinton sat with him alone in the Oval Office and asked for his
help in lobbying his former Senate colleagues to vote against
conviction in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dole said he thought ``a lot of attention was
diverted'' from Yugoslavia and other foreign policy issues by the
impeachment. It was ``all-consuming,'' he added, and Kosovo ``may
have been one of the casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Yugoslavia fell apart in 1991, Kosovo was viewed
as a place from which a wider war could erupt. The Bush
administration, which had adopted a hands-off policy on the
killings in Croatia and Bosnia, warned Milosevic on Dec. 29, 1992,
that the United States was prepared to take unilateral military
action if the Serbs sparked a conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration reiterated the warning weeks after
the inauguration. Three years later, when the administration
convened a peace conference to end the Bosnia war in Dayton, Kosovo
was not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia was then the emergency, and it had to be stopped,''
said Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who negotiated the agreement
at Dayton, in an interview. ``Otherwise there would have been a
real risk that Bosnia would merge with Kosovo into a huge firestorm
that would destabilize the whole region.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, younger, more confrontational ethnic
Albanians began to build a ragtag army, supplied with weapons from
neighboring Albania and financed largely by the Albanian diaspora
in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They faced serious obstacles. Milosevic, who had risen to power
on the cause of protecting Kosovo's minority Serbs on the land
Serbs prize as their Jerusalem, took away Kosovo's broad autonomy
in 1989 and was unlikely to give it back without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The killing in Kosovo began in earnest in February 1998, when
the Serbs retaliated for rebel attacks on policemen with brutal
operations of their own in the Drenica area. Members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and their families were slain.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sent Robert Gelbard, its envoy to the region,
to confront Milosevic with horrific photographs of death and
mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran State Department official respected for his tenacity
but known for his temper, Gelbard had experience in Bosnia and
Croatia. But he did not have much of a personal relationship with
the Serbian leader, whom he castigated in unusually blunt language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Drenica killings, Gelbard felt, were the kind of ruthless
act that would further radicalize the restive Albanian population
and lead to an explosion that could affect the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have done more than anyone to increase the membership of
the KLA,'' Gelbard fumed at Milosevic. ``You are acting as if you
were their secret membership chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended badly, U.S. officials said. Milosevic was
infuriated and would eventually refuse to meet with Gelbard at all.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of violence in Kosovo in early 1998 could not have
come at a more inopportune moment for the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his aides were consumed by the Lewinsky
affair. The Clinton foreign policy team was focused on presidential
visits to China and Africa and on Russia's economic implosion.
Legislative electoral politics, especially with an incendiary sex
scandal enveloping the White House, was never far from the
president's concerns. And Kosovo did not register in any public
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the president's political advisers said in an interview:
``I hardly remember Kosovo in political discussions. It was all
impeachment, impeachment, impeachment. There was nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the spring of 1998 posed a question: Would the
administration, which had reaffirmed Bush's Christmas warning, take
any action?
</P>
<P>
   Weighing their options, officials said, they quickly ruled out
unilateral military strikes, the very response Bush had promised.
If anything was to be done, it would be in concert with the NATO
allies, who along with the United States had troops on the ground
as part of the international force in Bosnia. The United States
could not start bombing while its allies were exposed in a
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, everything about Kosovo was subject to decisions
by an alliance that worked by consensus and was soon to grow from
16 to 19 members.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials who had lived through the years
of delay and inaction in Bosnia believed they had learned a few
things about how to deal with Milosevic. Diplomacy could work, but
only if it was linked to the credible threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   Albright began making the case for military action. At one key
meeting in May, Gelbard argued that the time had come for
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, was
opposed, saying that the United States could not threaten without
being prepared to follow up with a specific action.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbard replied that he had already worked out some bombing
targets with Clark, the NATO commander. But Berger rejected the
plan and no one else in the room came to the defense of Gelbard,
who declined to discuss his role, saying only ``When I had the lead
role on Kosovo issues I had complete support from the president and
the secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration then turned to Holbrooke, who pressed the
Albanian political leader, Ibrahim Rugova, to meet with Milosevic.
The payoff for Rugova was a meeting with Clinton in the Oval Office
on May 27, which served only to illustrate the gap between the
Americans' public stance and the realities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief conversation with the president and Vice President Al
Gore, Rugova warned that without direct U.S. intervention, Kosovo
was headed for all-out war. He pleaded for urgent U.S. action and
an increased U.S. presence to halt the escalating violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow another Bosnia to happen in Kosovo,'' a
senior administration official quoted Clinton as telling Rugova.
The assurances were largely theoretical. Nothing concrete was
promised.
</P>
<P>
   After Rugova presented the president with a gift of a large
piece of quartz mined from Kosovo, Clinton spent part of their time
together telling him about similar minerals in his home state of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The two men posed for a photo. The meeting received little press
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of other news in Washington that spring. The
sex-and-lies investigation of Kenneth Starr's sex-and-lies inquiry
was still preoccupying the White House. There were drawn-out court
battles between the president's lawyers and Starr over whether
senior administration aides, a few of whom were involved in foreign
policy issues, should be forced to testify before Starr's grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   In June, with the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans
warning Milosevic that he could not count on the West's dithering
on Kosovo as it had on Bosnia, NATO was ordered to draw up plans
for military action. Milosevic promised concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. strategy seemed to be working.
</P>
<P>
   The situation on the ground, however, was far from stable. The
Albanian guerrillas used the early summer to take control of some
40 percent of Kosovo, and Milosevic responded with a major
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military planners began weighing their options. These
ranged from an attack involving only the firing of cruise missiles
to a phased air campaign to deployment of peacekeeping troops as
part of a negotiated or imposed settlement. The planners also
looked at what it would take to invade Yugoslavia. Western
officials said the numbers were staggering: As many as 200,000
soldiers would be needed for a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the spring and summer of 1992, Serbian forces in Bosnia
expelled hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Seven
years later, officials said, no one planned for the tactic that
Milosevic adopted in Kosovo: the expulsion of hundreds of thousands
of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of Milosevic watchers who said a few bombs
might do it,'' a senior NATO official said. ``What was not assumed,
and not postulated, was that he would try to empty the country of
its ethnic majority.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials were wrestling with several legal and political
hurdles, officials disclosed. Some NATO members were worried about
imposing a peace without the approval of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Vershbow, the U.S. representative to NATO and a former
National Security Council aide who had been deeply involved in
Bosnia policy, suggested an answer in a classified cable titled
``Kosovo: Time for Another Endgame Strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vershbow's plan, officials said, arrived with a heavy political
price tag: the possible dispatch of NATO soldiers just before a
midterm election and in the midst of the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   The cable spelled out a plan to impose a political settlement in
Kosovo with the cooperation of the Russians, longtime allies of the
Serbs. Moscow and Washington would then go together to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo endgame initiative could become a model of NATO-Russian
cooperation,'' Vershbow wrote. ``No kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal called for creation of an international
protectorate in Kosovo. The settlement would be policed by an
international military presence, or ground force. If a peace
settlement was negotiated in advance, as many as 30,000 troops
might be required to enforce it. But Vershbow also left open the
possibility that NATO might have to impose a settlement without
Belgrade's consent, requiring 60,000 troops. To help sell the idea
in Congress, Vershbow said, the U.S. contribution could be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later we are going to face the issue of deploying
ground forces in Kosovo,'' he wrote in his cable. ``We have too
much at stake in the political stability of the south Balkans to
permit the conflict to fester much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable landed in Washington on Aug. 7, the day bombs exploded
outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It was circulated
as Clinton and his aides were preparing for his pivotal appearance
before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky affair and the
White House was planning the cruise-missile attack against Sudan
and the Afghan bases of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile suspected
of directing the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan generated some interest among midlevel officials in
Washington. Senior officials agreed that it underscored the need to
come up with a comprehensive strategy. In the end nothing came of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was under attack for his grand jury testimony and faced
questions about whether his military decisions were motivated by
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes about the movie ``Wag the Dog'' became commonplace.
Fittingly, the president in the movie seeking to distract attention
from a sex scandal stages an ersatz conflict in, of all places,
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, impeachment was on Clinton's mind. Returning from
a September visit to the region, Dole stopped in to see Clinton and
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president listened carefully,'' Dole said in interview.
``I don't recall him saying a great deal. He agreed it was
terrible. Sandy Berger didn't say much either.'' Then Berger left
the room. ``We discussed impeachment,'' Dole said. ``This was a
critical time in the Monica events.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton asked for Dole's help in securing the 34 Senate
votes needed to avoid conviction if the House voted to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   Midterm elections were also at hand, and the Democrats were
perceived to be on the run. Republicans fired another shot across
Clinton's bow, warning against bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbians have done what they wanted,'' Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, said in an interview broadcast Oct. 4. ``Now
they're pulling back and now, only now what appears to be _ will be
_ three weeks before an election, we're going to go in and bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were warning at the same time that they had
little appetite for military involvement of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who favored action on Kosovo, said
then that several Democratic colleagues approached him at a party
caucus on Oct. 6 and said, ``Don't count me in, Joe, don't count me
in.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Gore, the Democrats' leading presidential
contender for 2000, was keeping an eye on his own political future.
Officials say he supported airstrikes in Kosovo, but was careful to
say little in meetings attended by large numbers of officials. His
national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, prodded intelligence
officials to scour the files for evidence that might implicate
Milosevic in war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the president outlined the plan for NATO airstrikes
in a letter to leading senators. The attacks, he said, would start
strong and ``progressively expand in their scale and scope,''
especially if Milosevic and his forces remained in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no pinprick strikes,'' the president said in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had agreed to the approach in a meeting of defense
ministers in late September, in Vilamoura, Portugal. At the private
meeting, Defense Secretary William Cohen challenged his colleagues
to embrace a new role for the alliance. If NATO could not muster a
threat to Milosevic under these circumstance, he asked, what was
the point of the alliance?
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's toughened stance was striking. During the Bosnia crisis,
he had assured his congressional colleagues that U.S. troops would
be out of the region within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   There were limits. As Cohen made clear last week in
congressional testimony, his commitment was to air power, not the
deployment of U.S. soldiers on the battlefield. Questioned by the
Senate Armed Services Committee about why the United States did not
field a credible ground threat last fall, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, you may recall there was great discontent up
here on Capitol Hill. If I had come to you at that time and
requested authorization to put a ground force in _ U.S.,
unilaterally, acting alone _ I can imagine the nature of the
questions I would have received. You'd say, `Well, No. 1, where are
our allies? And No. 2, who's going to appropriate the money? No. 3,
how long do you intend to be there? How many? How long? How much?
And what's the exit strategy?'''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary concluded, ``And that would have been the extent
of the debate and probably would have received an overwhelming
rejection from the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh words and warning to Milosevic in the fall of
1998, no one, either in the administration or in NATO, was eager to
use force against the Serbs. So the White House turned again to
Holbrooke to broker a deal that would push the issue into the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   For Dayton, Holbrooke had softened up Milosevic for months in
advance and had sensed that the Serbian leader wanted a deal. In
Ohio, Milosevic gave up territory in Bosnia, which was a separate
country, and ended a war that was costing Belgrade huge sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to Kosovo, the U.S. envoy was pushing Milosevic to
loosen his grip on land in his own country, a hallowed battlefield
on which Serbian soldiers died trying to repel a Turkish invasion
six centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   His only inducement was the threat of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and Holbrooke talked for nine days, and when it was
over, the Serbian leader had made some concessions, perhaps
significant, but they were only loosely outlined.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to withdraw the bulk of his forces from Kosovo. He
said he would permit 1,800 unarmed international inspectors to
monitor the deal and would allow overflights by NATO spy planes.
</P>
<P>
   A token number of Yugoslav officers were to be sent to the NATO
air base at Vicenza, Italy, with an equally small number of NATO
officers stationed inside Serbia's Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch. Milosevic wanted the lifting of the NATO
order that gave authority to launch strikes immediately. Holbrooke
made no promises. But he headed to Brussels, Belgium, where he
summoned NATO representatives to a meeting to report that a deal
was nearly clinched.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives voted to suspend the order, not remove it,
angering Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade the next day, Milosevic told Holbrooke he was
enraged that the order had not been entirely lifted. ``He
considered it a declaration of war,'' said one American involved in
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the deal as a triumph of force-backed diplomacy,
saying it was the basis for a lasting peace. Milosevic, he said,
has ``agreed to internationally supervised democratic elections in
Kosovo, substantial self-government and a local police _ in short,
rights the Kosovars have been demanding since Milosevic stripped
their autonomy a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, there were strong hints that Milosevic was not
cowed. At a meeting in Belgrade to discuss implementing the
agreement, Clark asked him why some of the security forces covered
by the agreement had not been withdrawn from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not agreed,'' Milosevic shot back, according to a
U.S. official familiar with the conversation. ``You call Holbrooke.
He'll tell you what we agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I won't do that,'' replied Clark, a veteran of hours of
negotiations with Milosevic in Dayton. The general walked to a map
to point out the locations of the brigades and battalions he wanted
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no extra forces,'' Milosevic said. ``NATO must do what
it must do.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Clark moved bluntly to the alliance's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, get real,'' Clark replied. ``You don't really
want to be bombed by NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The October agreement quickly fell apart, and Western officials
now acknowledge that the Serbs' preparations for a purge of Kosovo
were evident in what they did and what they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO officials, the Serbs began infiltrating
reinforcements and equipment in violation of the deal. Serbian
officers bluntly told Clark in October that they were just two
weeks away from eliminating the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the commander of the main military unit in Kosovo,
Lt. Gen. Dusan Smardzic, told local reporters that they could look
forward to a ``hot spring'' in which the problems in the province
would finally be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanian rebels were pushing ahead with their own war
aims. Sensing that the deal essentially placed the world's most
powerful military alliance on their side _ despite NATO's continued
assurances that it did not want to become the guerrilla army's air
force _ the rebels quickly reclaimed territory abandoned by the
Serbian forces and mounted a continuous series of small-scale
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that the rebels were
buying weapons and improving their training, and becoming a more
formidable force.
</P>
<P>
   The unarmed observers, caught in the middle, could do little.
William Walker, the U.S. diplomat who headed the observer group,
was threatened at one point by a belligerent drunken Serb wielding
a gun and a hand grenade. Walker pleaded privately with old friends
at the State Department for some security. The State Department was
sympathetic but was struggling to cope with the aftermath of the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence analysts struggled to read Milosevic's
intentions. Was he playing for time or preparing for war? Were the
troop movements in October a prelude to a major offensive in which
the population would be displaced so that the Serbs could more
easily root out the Albanian guerrillas?
</P>
<P>
   ``The October agreement,'' read a highly classified National
Intelligence Estimate dated November 1998, ``indicates Milosevic is
susceptible to outside pressure.'' The estimate is a lengthy formal
report drafted by the CIA and vetted by all government intelligence
agencies. It suggested that Milosevic ``could accept a number of
outcomes from autonomy to provisional status, with the final
resolution to be determined, as long as he remained the undisputed
leader in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, this assessment added, would only accept ``new
status'' for Kosovo ``if he thinks he is in danger because the West
is threatening to use sustained and decisive military power against
his forces.''
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, NATO intelligence detected signs of a
Serbian military buildup around Kosovo. Western intelligence
officials, particularly the Germans, believed that these troops
could form the backbone of a military operation to push hundreds of
thousands of Albanians out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Its code name was Potkova _ in Serbian, Horseshoe.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials agree that Jan. 16 of this year was a turning
point. On that day, the bodies of at least 45 peasant farmers and
their children were found on hillsides and courtyards in the
village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Most had been shot at close range in the head or neck with a
single bullet, according to U.S. officials. Some had been
mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said a small group of hooded men dressed in black and
wearing gloves had carried out the killings. Walker arrived on the
scene within hours, and accused the Serbian security forces of
committing ``a crime very much against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government declared him persona non grata and
fiercely protested its innocence. The killings galvanized public
opinion in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the bodies were discovered, Albright presented
her new plan at a White House meeting. It again threatened bombing
if Milosevic did not go along with the West. But for the first time
it demanded that he accept NATO troops in his own country to
enforce a deal under which he would withdraw almost all his
security forces and grant Kosovo broad autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was skeptical. Until then the goal had been to stick to
what came to be known as ``October plus,'' the agreement reached by
Holbrooke plus some sort of protection for the observers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, had even greater reservations. They had wanted at all costs
to avoid a troop presence that would require Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the advisers embraced Albright's approach and
sent it to the president, who accepted it.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Clinton was on the phone to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair describing the new approach.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed that there were two options: to initiate
an immediate bombing campaign in reprisal for Racak, or to fashion
a diplomatic solution that included ground troops as peacekeepers
in Kosovo, according to a White House aide who listened in on the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair said that ground troops could not be used to fight a
war, but only as part of a political strategy,'' the official said.
``The president said, `I completely agree with you on that. If we
sent in a ground force without some sort of agreement beforehand,
sooner or later they're sitting ducks for either side who is
willing to provoke something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would instruct his aides to try to bring
Milosevic and the Kosovo Albanians to the bargaining table. ``I
will try to get Congress to go along with me,'' he promised Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clark and Naumann were confronting Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The two generals refused food and drink. This was to be a
serious negotiating session in which they told Milosevic he was
violating the October agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured we'd starve him out,'' Clark told colleagues
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was, as Clark later told reporters, ``determined to go
his own way.''
</P>
<P>
   His face red, his voice cracking, the Serbian leader described
the Racak incident as provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a massacre!'' Milosevic insisted, according to a
NATO official familiar with the meeting. ``It was staged. These
people were terrorists. They do these things to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark warned that NATO was ``going to start telling me to move
aircraft'' if Serbia did not live up to its agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a war criminal to be threatening Serbia,'' Milosevic
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the meeting had gone badly. But Clark, perhaps
because he had lived through the stormy Dayton peace talks,
reported to his superiors that he still saw some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Clark's meeting, two State Department veterans of
the Dayton talks, James Pardew and Christopher Hill, delivered a
similar message to the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Milosevic said that the killings had resulted from a
firefight between rebels and Serbian security forces. The rebels,
he continued, rearranged the bodies and dressed them to make them
look like peasants and farmers, shooting the bodies through the
heads and necks to make the incident look like a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's behavior raised a crucial question for Western
officials: What were his intentions? Were the troop movements into
Kosovo saber rattling, or preparations for war?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies government-wide were utterly divided
on how to read the Serbian leader, classified reports show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confronted with a take-it-or-leave-it deal, Milosevic may opt
to risk a NATO bombing campaign rather than surrender control over
Kosovo,'' read one late January report, according to a government
official. ``He may assume he can absorb a limited attack and the
allies will not support a long campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later the prediction was the opposite. ``Milosevic will
seek to give just enough to avoid NATO bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The day the bombing began, March 24, an intelligence report said
Milosevic ``would interrupt the offensive and sign the peace plan
if he suffers or expects to suffer substantial damage to his armed
forces and national-level infrastructure from a bombing campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the analysts had changed their minds. ``Air
attacks,'' they wrote, ``will not suffice to shake Milosevic's
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while it was widely expected that NATO bombing
would prompt retaliation against the Kosovo Albanians, officials
said there had been no predictions that Milosevic would try to
empty the province of them, as he has done.
</P>
<P>
   After the Racak killings in January, some U.S. officials favored
airstrikes. But there remained the delicate matter of NATO unity.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 28, the NATO allies warned that they were ready to use
force immediately, and Britain and France said they were prepared
to send in ground troops to enforce a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
that the threat of force was justified to get the Serbs to the
bargaining table, the allies decided they had justification enough
under international law to authorize airstrikes against Yugoslavia
if it did not agree to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   To try to strike that deal, the Europeans wanted a conference
that would be their equivalent of Dayton, Albright said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the gathering at Rambouillet, a former royal hunting lodge
near Paris, was no Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Americans approached the negotiations hoping to impose a
solution on the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians, but that attempt
quickly broke down. Milosevic, who was a central figure at Dayton,
did not even attend the meetings. The Albanians were balky, too,
refusing to accept a three-year autonomy deal offered by NATO
because it carried no guarantee of eventual independence.
</P>
<P>
   If Dayton was a diplomatic triumph for the Clinton
administration and Holbrooke, Rambouillet was a debacle for
Albright. She told friends it was one of the worst experiences of
her career.
</P>
<P>
   With the two-week deadline set for the talks almost expired,
Albright went to Rambouillet and implored the Albanians to sign on
to the deal. Albright failed to convince the hard-liners, the
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who insisted on
inserting language that held out promise of a referendum on
independence after the three years of autonomy. But they also
insisted that they needed a two-week pause to sell even that deal
to their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the ultimate failure of diplomacy and the
outbreak of war. By refusing to sign the deal, the ethnic Albanians
had taken the pressure off the Serbs. ``If this fails because both
sides say `No,' there will be no bombing of Serbia,'' Albright said
on Feb. 21, as the Rambouillet talks wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, for his part, concluded that there was not enough
incentive for him to deal. Two days after Rambouillet ended, said
the European Union envoy to the talks, Wolfgang Petritsch, the
Yugoslav president decided he was not going to accept NATO troops _
and mustered his own forces and propaganda to prepare for the
military showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff over Kosovo was growing more dire as Clinton's
political fortunes were rising and as the crisis drew more of his
focus and energy. On Feb. 12, he was acquitted by the Senate. Only
a few days later, on a trip to Mexico with Biden, the president
wanted to talk about the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way down on the plane I was reading a book about the
Balkans and he saw me reading it,'' the senator recalled in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The book was ``History of the Balkans,'' by Barbara Jelavich,
published by Cambridge University Press. ``And you know how he
is,'' Biden added, ``He asked me to give it to him to read. And I
said, `No, get your own copy.' And I'll lay odds that he eventually
got it and read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believed war could still be averted, though he was
prepared to undertake a short burst of bombings, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Italy's new prime minister, Massimo D'Alema,
in the Oval office on March 5, Clinton said that ``Milosevic has
accepted almost everything,'' according to Italian officials in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, a rough-around-the-edges former communist, was
skeptical. He asked the president what the plan was if there was no
deal and if NATO airstrikes failed to subdue the Serb leader. The
result, D'Alema said, would be 300,000 to 400,000 refugees passing
into Albania and crossing the Adriatic into Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen then?'' D'Alema wanted to know, Italian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked to Berger for guidance. NATO would ``keep
bombing,'' Berger replied.
</P>
<P>
   After Rambouillet fell apart, a follow-up conference was called
in Paris three weeks later. While the world waited, Milosevic
continued to build up his forces in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A defining moment came on March 18 at the International
Conference Center on Avenue Kleber in Paris. To polite applause,
four ethnic Albanian delegates signed the peace plan that would
give their people broad autonomy for a three-year interim period.
The Serbs didn't sign. That paved the way to airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the United States and its NATO allies were now
committed to war, three European foreign ministers _ Robin Cook of
Britain, Hubert Vedrine of France and Joschka Fischer of Germany _
began murmuring about making a final appeal to Milosevic in
Belgrade. Albright persuaded them to allow Holbrooke to go instead.
But even as Holbrooke was en route to Belgrade, the situation grew
more hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racial hatred was unleashed,'' said one senior
administration official. ``Albanians began to kill Serbs; Serbs
were shooting up villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has described his last meeting with Milosevic in
Belgrade's Beli Dvor _ White House _ on March 22 as ``unreal.''
Milosevic accused the Americans of ``sitting at the Albanian side
of the table'' at Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that there was no war in Kosovo, just a few
terrorists who needed to be rooted out once and for all. Holbrooke
later described parts of his conversation with Milosevic. ``I said
to him, `Look, are you absolutely clear in your own mind what will
happen when I get up and walk out of this palace that we're now
sitting in?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `You're going to bomb us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `That's right.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was Milosevic who was left to decide whether his
country and NATO would go to war. ``It was Milosevic who
deliberately and consciously chose to trigger the bombing of his
own country,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that setting up a deal signed by only one side was
a crucial step forward. ``Signing Rambouillet was crucial in
getting the Europeans two things: getting them to agree to the use
of force and getting the Albanians on the side of this kind of a
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs had already begun their offensive, she added, and if
the signing had not been forced at that time, ``we would be
negotiating while they were carrying out their village-a-day-keeps
NATO-away.''
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 in the morning on March 25, just hours after the first
bombs fell, the president was wide awake. He had called his key
counterparts in NATO and monitored the beginning of the air war
that day. His foreign policy team had gone home and there was
nothing left to do.
</P>
<P>
   But the president apparently needed to assure and be reassured.
So he called his secretary of state and rousted her out of her bed.
</P>
<P>
   The president said, ``We're doing the right thing here,''
Albright recalled in an interview. ``We've got a long way to go.
This is not going to be over quickly and we're all in this. I feel
we've explored every option, that we're doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same way,'' the secretary said she replied.
``Nobody should ever think that we had gone into this without our
eyes wide open.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO's air war of attrition with Yugoslavia
continued Saturday with attacks on tanks in Kosovo, but it could
not halt Yugoslav forces from driving tens of thousands more ethnic
Albanians out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO command officers said that Yugoslav army and Serbian police
units were carrying out sweep operations all along southwestern
Kosovo near the border with Albania and Montenegro, burning and
wrecking villages and driving the inhabitants onto the roads to
flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather moved in over the area Friday night, once again
making it difficult for allied planes to do much about the Yugoslav
operations on the ground, allied officials said. But on Friday
afternoon they destroyed seven tanks from the air, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ground forces successfully hit by the allies Friday appeared
to be miles away from the most intense Yugoslav operations along
the border. The allied attacks were concentrated instead near
Pristina, the provincial capital, and in the northern part of
Kosovo. The command did not say how many missions allied planes had
flown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the allied command, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani,
said that allied planes had also bombed strategic targets,
including an ammunition plant, and British military officials in
London said that a Yugoslav army headquarters near Pristina, which
was helping to direct Yugoslav operations on the ground, had been
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   But as Marani said, ``For ethnic cleansing, you don't need a
very strong structure in terms of command and control.'' In other
words, the targets NATO was striking from high in the air might
slow down but could not stop the ongoing destruction and killing by
Yugoslav forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of killing has taken place,'' the alliance's
spokesman, Jamie Shea, said. NATO on Saturday made public an aerial
photograph of what it said could be a mass burial site near the
village of Izbica with up to 150 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Shea and Marani offered no new information Saturday about
Yugoslav assertions that allied warplanes had killed scores of
fleeing Albanian civilians on the road between Djakovica and
Prizren on Wednesday afternoon. Foreign correspondents allowed to
go to the scene found debris from NATO ordnance near the wreckage
of civilian tractors and wagons, but all Marani would say was,
``Debris will be one element of our investigation, but debris can
be moved around.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that when NATO had figured out what had happened it
would make its findings known, but Marani said he could not say
whether allied planes had attacked the road on Wednesday. That day,
the command said it had carried out a strike on a military convoy
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic Albanian refugees once again pouring across the
border from Kosovo into neighboring countries, Shea said that
Yugoslav authorities under President Slobodan Milosevic appeared to
be trying to empty the province of as many of its 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected NATO's demands to stop the expulsions,
accept a cease-fire and let international peacekeepers escort the
refugees back home, and Shea said that Yugoslavia rejected similar
demands by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received reports that up to 100,000 people may be
trying to reach the border at Morina,'' Shea said Saturday. Morina
is just inside Albania near the already overcrowded refugee camps
at Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henderson, the British armed forces minister, said in
London that officials had received reports of 50,000 more refugees
on their way to Macedonia and 18,000 to Montenegro, on top of
560,000 driven out of Kosovo over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said in a telephone
interview Saturday from Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, that the
bombing could still be going on in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic is losing,'' he said. ``If he does not
change his policies, we're going to destroy those things President
Slobodan Milosevic values.'' As he spoke, allied planes continued
systematically trying to destroy military and police headquarters,
bridges, anti-aircraft guns and missiles and Yugoslav air force
planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies are finding it hard to pick off the tanks and
armored vehicles the Yugoslavs are using to systematically destroy
ethnic Albanian villages and settlements and drive out their
inhabitants. The Yugoslav campaign began late last year and
increased after the allies began bombing on March 24 because
Milosevic rejected a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, as has been described before, his
whole military structure has a great deal of redundancy,'' said a
British admiral, Sir Ean Garnett, at a British Defense Ministry
briefing in London.
</P>
<P>
   Another NATO military officer said the Yugoslav armed forces had
been structured over the last 50 years to be able to wage a long
war of resistance against foreign invasion, with vast underground
bunkers storing fuel, ammunition and weapons the allies may not yet
have even found, let alone destroyed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Henderson estimated that 1.1 million of the approximately 2
million people who were living in Kosovo at the last census in 1991
had fled since fighting flared up a year ago between the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, which wants independence for the province,
and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clark went to the Balkans Saturday to talk with leaders in
Macedonia and Albania about the refugee situation and about the
more than 20,000 NATO troops that are, or soon will be, in both
those countries to help deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has taken in 160,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the
last month, and 12,000 NATO troops originally intended for a
peacekeeping mission to Kosovo have built refugee camps and tent
cities for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7,200 allied soldiers are on their way to Albania to do
the same there, and another 4,000 American troops are on their way
to the northern part of Albania to fly Apache anti-tank helicopters
into Kosovo to hunt down Yugoslav units. The helicopters will also
be protected by powerful surface-to-surface missile batteries based
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials say their country cannot take in any more
Albanians, and a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva said Saturday that if the flow continued, an
airlift to fly refugees elsewhere might have to be organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the numbers rising again, it will be extremely urgent to
get more sites or expand the ones we have, and perhaps also then to
fly more people out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.N. official in Kukes, Jacques Franquin, said Saturday
that 5,000 refugees had arrived across the Morini border checkpoint
since midnight amid a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, it's a big problem,'' he said.

 &HT;    Dole aims to be definitive candidate for women
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Embedded in Elizabeth Dole's quest for the
Republican presidential nomination is the idea that she can be all
things to all women.
</P>
<P>
   She is the sharp-as-tacks, Harvard-trained lawyer and Cabinet
secretary in two administrations whose credentials attract
professional women who have chafed at glass ceilings, pay inequity
and a host of gender-based workplace insults.
</P>
<P>
   She is the proper Southern lady, raised in Salisbury, N.C., in
the 1940s and '50s and a born-again Christian. ``She grew up
saying, 'Yes, ma'am' and 'No, sir.' She's a conservative Southern
woman. It's genuine,'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler (R-Fla.), a Dole
backer who was reared in Georgia in a similar environment.
</P>
<P>
   Her candidacy has elicited cheers even from Democratic women who
have no plans to vote for her. Some Republicans are ecstatic about
the 62-year-old former president of the Red Cross because they
believe she will erase Democrats' recent advantage among female
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that she talks about it and that women
react to it,'' said Ari Fleischer, the Dole campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler called Dole the ``Jesse Ventura of the 2000 election,'' a
reference to the governor of Minnesota who won election with an
unorthodox campaign that drew voters from across the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's ability to mount a broad appeal may be telling in states
that have open primaries, like Georgia, in which voters can choose
to participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   California, which awards all its delegates to the Republican
National Convention to the winner of the statewide vote, also
employs an open primary, although officials there are considering
other options for its March 7, 2000, presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls give Dole a solid advantage over Vice President Al
Gore among women, as well as an overall edge. By contrast, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, who also comfortably leads Gore in the polls,
runs slightly ahead of Gore among women, but has a 25-point margin
among men.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some question about how soon Dole will have to make
her positions known on an array of issues, before opponents try to
define her, according to their purposes, as either too moderate or
too conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Bebitch Jeffe, a California political science professor,
said Dole's advantage among women stems from the fact that voters
know so little about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have never simply voted for women because of gender.
They're not likely to start now,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the former Christian Coalition executive who now
runs his own political consulting business out of Gwinnett County,
Ga., identified potential problems in Dole's one-size-fits-all
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be this strategy of `we can close the
gender gap and oh, by the way, she's a Christian,''' Reed said.
``Sooner or later, you have to decide which one of those you will
try to do. If you do both, you'll do neither well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed is not affiliated with any campaign at the moment, but is
expected to work for Bush once he formally announces his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the National Abortion Rights Action League and GOP
opponent Gary Bauer have attacked Dole's stance on abortion from
their respective views.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL television ads have sought to remind viewers that Dole and
Bush do not support abortion rights, while Bauer chided Dole for
her ``retreat'' on the abortion issue and pledged to press for a
constitutional ban on abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter released by her campaign, Dole pronounced herself
``pro-life'' and in favor of an anti-abortion amendment to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``it's not going to happen because the American
people do not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she added, Republican women who hold different views on
abortion should set an example. ``We should agree to respectfully
disagree,'' Dole wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Dole campaign is betting that her answer will satisfy
Republicans who back abortion rights, particularly in a campaign in
which the GOP is seeking to avoid a major battle over the divisive
issue.

 &HT;    Subtle yet powerful Holden first African-American to lead
Southern highway patrol
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C._The South's only black state highway patrol chief,
Col. Richard Holden, remembers the first ticket he ever wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers it not so much for the traffic offense, but for a
judge's encouragement to the 22-year-old North Carolina State
Highway Patrol trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of authority. Use it wisely,'' state District
Judge George Stuhl told Holden privately. ``But don't let anybody
else, regardless of who they are, make you afraid to do your job
and do what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the North Carolina patrol's two black troopers in
1969, Holden knew the Fayetteville, N.C., judge was referring to
race, a highly charged issue in the aftermath of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing police images linger from that tumultuous era, of
Alabama state troopers wielding clubs and bullwhips against civil
rights marchers in the 1965 ``Bloody Sunday'' confrontation in
Selma, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an image that law was an instrument of the white
establishment, rather than an instrument of the type of justice
envisioned by the U.S. Constitution,'' said Blease Graham, a
political scientist and dean of the College of Criminal Justice at
the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, in a growing number of cities, African-Americans have
risen to top cop jobs. But Holden, 51, is the only black to command
a Southern state highway patrol, according to the National
Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt praised Holden as a ``man of great
character and integrity'' after selecting the 29-year patrol
veteran in February over five other finalists.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, where the State Highway Patrol is politically
powerful and, in recent years, plagued by controversy, Holden is
grappling with accusations that black motorists are unfairly
targeted by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate last week accepted the House version of a bill
requiring an analysis of traffic stops by state law enforcement
agencies to see whether minority motorists are stopped more than
white drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is happening, we plan to put an end to it,'' Holden said
last week in an interview at his Raleigh office looking across a
grassy lawn at the state legislative building. ``I want to stop
people for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden, who supports the legislation requiring state police to
keep statistics about the race, gender and age of motorists they
stop, isn't convinced that state troopers are targeting minority
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, he said, that patrol officers are pulling more
blacks in communities where African-Americans represent a larger
percentage of the population. ``I think we need to look and see,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion is widespread enough that Holden, in a recent
visit to all of the state's eight patrol posts, raised the issue of
fairness to the patrol's supervisors and urged them to spread the
message among the 1,380-member patrol. He told them, ``We are not
going to tolerate anyone, whether it be driving or just in an
office setting, harassing anybody for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   During much of Holden's career, the patrol was under a federal
court order to hire more African-Americans. The order was lifted
last year, and now about 15 percent of the agency's sworn personnel
are minorities. At an awards ceremony in Greensboro last month
honoring a retired patrolman for bravery, four African-Americans
were among the 22 troopers attending. Holden was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He offered kind but brief remarks honoring retired Patrolman
George D. Steele, who in 1997 risked his life pulling a
tractor-trailer driver from his burning rig. After the ceremony,
Holden approached him and said quietly, ``God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden is low-key and forceful, a style that so far has garnered
him broad support in the legislature and among fellow troopers.
``It leaves you in a good state of mind to see an African-American
in such a high-ranking position,'' said Tim Whitaker, 35, a black
trooper. ``I feel it gives the agency more credibility.'' One of
nine children who grew up on a farm in rural Wake County, outside
of Raleigh, Holden said his parents instilled Christian values of
hard word, patience and fairness. His father, Willie, taught the
broader lesson in mundane tasks, such as milking Betsy, a cow that
liked to kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while you learned to do the kind of things that were
soothing to the cow,'' Holden said. ``You have to learn the kind of
things that make people kick, just like with that cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden attended segregated public schools and earned a
bachelor's degree in industrial technology from North Carolina A&AMP;T
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he did not support student rioting that followed
King's assassination in 1968. He believed in obeying the law and
took an interest in the state patrol after meeting a trooper who
assisted him with a college research paper. Urged by others,
including a brother, to become a trooper, Holden placed an
application in Raleigh. He completed Basic Patrol School in 1969
and was assigned to Fayetteville, where he moved with his new wife,
Sandra Paulette Daye Holden, now a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed through the ranks, living in Raleigh and
Winston-Salem. From 1993 to 1997, he was director of internal
affairs, putting him in charge of investigating allegations against
troopers. The past two years, he supervised training,
communications, research and planning.
</P>
<P>
   Holden remembers an occasional racial slight early in his career
and name calling by white motorists who questioned his authority to
stop them. He also remembers suspicion among some African-Americans
that he might be part of ``the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he always reminded himself, as he does now, ``What I
am doing has to do with safety. These vehicles don't pick out
somebody's color when they run into somebody.

HINDU-LED INDIAN GOVERNMENT FALLS BY MARGIN OF ONE VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Hindu nationalist-led government that
turned India into a declared nuclear power collapsed Saturday. It
lost a vote of confidence, 270-269, the narrowest parliamentary
defeat for a government in independent India's 51-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, the
Italian-born widow of an assassinated prime minister, will now try
to cobble together a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the vote, India's president accepted the
resignation of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, leader of the
Bharatiya Janata Party, but asked him to stay on as a caretaker
while efforts to form a new government go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Congress Party, which has dominated Indian
politics for most of the past half century, said they would
immediately begin talking to other political parties with the aim
of forming India's sixth national government in three years, a
period that has seen the rapid rise and fall of several unstable
coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi, president of the Congress Party and heir to the
Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, greeted thousands of well-wishers at her
home. They showered her with red rose petals, garlanded her with
marigolds and danced on the tops of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Gandhi, who drew huge and ecstatic crowds when she
campaigned across India in the last election but who has drawn some
criticism for her foreign birth, made no comment about whether she
will seek to become the next prime minister. Several party leaders
credited her with rebuilding the party and said they hoped she
would head a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the leadership of Soniaji, the shape and structure of
the alternative government will be decided in consultation with the
Congress Working Committee,'' said Congress Party spokesman Arjun
Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive by the prospect of more political instability, the
Bombay stock exchange's index plunged 7 percent after the
confidence vote. It was unclear what impact the change of
government will have on the modest steps taken recently by India, a
nation of 980 million people, to open its economy to foreign
investment and to build better ties with Pakistan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The past year marked the Hindu nationalists' first real taste of
power. For decades, they had been unable to challenge Congress'
dominance. And as champions of the idea that India was
fundamentally a Hindu nation and culture, they had been seen as
opposite to the country's secular traditions and dangerous to
religious minorities, particularly Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the party came under fire as attacks on India's small
Christian minority climbed. Those attacks, opposition leaders
charged, were incited by associates of the party. Congress Party
leaders contended that Bharatiya Janata failed to rein in allied
Hindu nationalist groups _ a charge the party denied.
</P>
<P>
   In laying out his government's record Saturday, Vajpayee, 72,
touted its decision to conduct nuclear tests in the Pokhran desert
and develop a full-fledged nuclear deterrent, as well as its
efforts to build closer ties with Pakistan. The tests last May
stirred international fears that India and Pakistan, which
responded with its own nuclear tests, would soon be engaged in a
dangerous arms race.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Vajpayee took a much-heralded bus trip to Lahore,
Pakistan, to meet with Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and
to discuss the core issues that divide them. The two nations have
fought three wars since independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Pokhran tests and my bus trip to Lahore are two sides of
the same coin,'' Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
   His government has had a very rocky year in power. Its tenure
has been plagued by the threats of its largest coalition partner _
a party from the state of Tamil Nadu that has 18 votes and is led
by the flamboyant Jayalalitha Jayaram _ to quit the government.
This week, Jayalalitha went through with her threat, depriving the
government of its majority and forcing the confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
   And the political strength of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which
led the coalition, was badly eroded in state elections elections in
November. Voters turned on the party largely because of the soaring
prices of onions and other vegetables and a general sense that the
government had mismanaged the economy.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The capital's political class _ or chatterati, as they call
themselves _ has not yet turned to post-mortems on the government,
or attempts to fathom the impact of its fall on the crucial
questions of governance. Rather, the hot topics Saturday were the
horse-trading and political intrigue that came with this test of
the government's majority.
</P>
<P>
   Politics here in the world's largest democracy is ``a game of
numbers,'' Vajpayee said in his address to Parliament Saturday. His
government believed Friday night that it had the votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   But it received several nasty surprises Saturday when members of
Parliament pushed the buttons on their electronic voting machines,
with the most devastating one delivered by a small party with a
grudge against Bharatiya Janata.
</P>
<P>
   Mayawati, who heads the Bahujan Samaj Party, which draws its
support from lower-caste people, had declared Friday on the floor
of Parliament that the five members she controlled would abstain,
rather than oppose the government. Bharatiya Janata leaders
rejoiced at the news.
</P>
<P>
   But her promise was a trick. Still furious about what she
believed was the Hindu nationalists' betrayal of her party in the
state of Uttar Pradesh in 1997, Mayawati _ who like many
lower-caste women goes by one name _ got her revenge by voting
against the government Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was appropriately symbolic that a formerly lower-caste woman
should have dealt the blow that helped bring down the government.
It is in large part the upsurge in political participation by
restive lower and middle castes, as well as regional parties, that
has undone the dominance of Congress, once the umbrella party that
sheltered Brahmins and untouchables, Muslims and Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote has become an instrument in the hands of the poor,''
said Yogendra Yadav, a researcher at the Center for the Study of
Developing Societies. ``They realize this is a unique possession in
their hands. They prize it and they make it work to their advantage
to get things they would not get otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The government had only a year to try to build a record.
Vajpayee, who insisted his government had safeguarded people of all
faiths, said in interviews he gave after a year in office that the
precariousness of the coalition had made the job of governing very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been trying to meet the challenges, but at almost every
step I have had to compromise,'' he told one journalist.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Renell Grant learned something new about her adopted
teen-age son the other day when she was summoned to his high school
in the Bronx. He was seeing a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, 15, was showing up a half-hour late for class every
morning because he was squiring the 14-year-old girl from her home
to school. Ms. Grant angrily told Pierce that he had better focus
on his schoolwork, not on being a ``lover boy.'' After some heated
words, he promised his mother that he would not do it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   While this was a typical squabble between a mother and a son who
has hit his teen-age years, it has extra potency in Pierce's case.
He has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is part of a maturing, little-understood population of
infected children who, because of medical advances, are living far
longer than anyone expected, thriving into their teens and beyond.
As these children grow, the normally turbulent issues of youth _
like dating and independence _ are colliding with their chronic
terminal illness in ways that their families never envisioned when
the children were babies.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, HIV-infected children were considered
lucky to make it to the first grade. But their life expectancy has
been so extended that some children, including Pierce's older
brother, Antonio, 18, are graduating from high school. AIDS deaths
dropped by 50 percent in children from 1996 to 1997, a reduction
that federal health officials say is probably the result of
combination drug therapies and medicines to treat opportunistic
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of planning funerals, parents like Renell Grant
worry that their children's behavior could hurt them, and _ if
unprotected sex is involved _ others.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are an estimated 20,000 infected children and
teen-agers, including those with full-blown AIDS, born to infected
mothers, according to health officials. And the officials say that
between 2,000 and 5,000 of these children are getting old enough to
have their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Family Relives Its Time With Two Who Died
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx housing project near Yankee Stadium where Ms. Grant
lives with her five adopted children, she was frying chicken wings
for dinner on a recent Sunday when Antonio popped in an old family
video.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the video has become a kind of ritual for visitors to
this household where three of the five children are infected. An
image appeared of another adopted brother, Damien, at age 5 in
1990, wasting away from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Damien looked like a fetus, his big head flopping over a frail
chest. Ms. Grant kept trying to lift his head. She donned a toy
fireman's hat and comically wiggled, hoping to make him smile. The
boy weakly tapped his chest to indicate that he could not breathe
well.
</P>
<P>
   As the Grant children watched the old video, they were silent,
but not visibly upset. They have seen it before. Damien, weighing
10 pounds, died two weeks after the video was taped. Plastic was
stuffed into his burial suit to fill it out. Antonio, who has
full-blown AIDS, used to sleep fully clothed because he was certain
his dead brother was coming to get him.
</P>
<P>
   That was years ago, though. Now, Antonio is eager to point
himself out on the television screen. ``That's me,'' he said,
giggling at the shy boy in a white shirt and green cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant agreed to be interviewed only if her children's first
names were not used. For this article, two are identified by their
middle names and one by his birth father's surname.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, Ms. Grant was among the
care givers who opened their homes to babies like Antonio and
Damien, born to mothers who could not care for them because of
AIDS, addiction to crack cocaine or other circumstances. Many of
these infants, known as boarder babies, languished in hospitals
with nowhere to go and became a symbol of an overwhelmed
foster-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio used to be gravely ill from AIDS. He had been infected
with HIV by a blood transfusion shortly after his birth in 1980 and
spent most of the first four years of his life in a Brooklyn
hospital crib. In 1985, when Ms. Grant's own children were
teen-agers, she was so touched by a news report about boarder
babies with AIDS that she took in Antonio, knowing little about him
or the disease. About 40 percent of infected children are cared for
by someone other than their biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told that these kids might die at any time,'' she
said, adding that she had been told to ``be strong, give them a
life and make them comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when Antonio was in his worst condition, Ms.
Grant also took in Damien, then a 5-month-old boarder baby from the
Bronx, and Rasheen, 4, from a foster parent too old to care for
him. By the end of 1990, Damien and Rasheen were dead.
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of new antibiotics and other medicines in
the next couple of years, Antonio's health began improving. Now
parents like Ms. Grant face a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought the child was going to die,'' said Jenny Grosz,
co-director of the HIV team at the Children's Evaluation and
Rehabilitation Center of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in
the Bronx. ``There's an ambivalence that the kids are doing well.
They have invested so much to try to keep the kids healthy and now
the kids are taking their fate into their own hands. They're making
risky choices.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Once a Foster Child, Now a Harried Mother
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ms. Grant, 49, a school crossing guard, is typical
of people who accepted the infected children into their homes with
a hope and a prayer. A short, scrappy woman, Ms. Grant is black,
working-class and the mother of four grown children in addition to
her adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant also was a foster child herself. Her mother was
hospitalized with a nervous breakdown when she was nearly 9; her
father was an itinerant musician. She spent five years at a
Westchester County children's home while her five younger siblings
were sent to various other foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got to see my sisters and brothers grow and have
arguments and fights,'' Ms. Grant said. ``I missed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my way of giving back,'' said Ms. Grant, who has, in
addition to her three HIV-infected sons, two other adopted children
_ a girl, 11, and another son, 10 _ who are not infected.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents are currently paid $1,199 a month, triple the
regular rate, to care for a child under 5 with HIV; as an adoptive
parent, Ms. Grant receives a bit less. But echoing the sentiment of
many care givers, she said the extra stipend was not her primary
motive.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have adopted HIV-infected children include people
like the gay couple in Manhattan who got word that a child-care
agency urgently sought homes for unwanted babies and was receptive
to gay people. The two white men, who took in an African-American
boy seven years ago when he was 1 month old, saw it partly as a way
to respond to friends dying of AIDS. They were told their son
probably would not survive beyond his seventh birthday. But now he
is thriving, they say, because of the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, fewer infected babies are being born, because
the drug AZT has been found to prevent maternal transmission. But
because rapid test results were not available seven years ago, the
gay couple did not know for 18 months that their little boy had
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the angst of parents in their situation, the couple have
yet to tell their son that he is HIV-positive. Their son has taken
HIV drugs his entire life but does not know why. One drug tastes
like motor oil and bad scotch, according to one parent. ``He will
say `Why am I taking this?' and I say, `To keep you healthy.'
That's enough now, but it's not going to be enough soon,'' one of
the parents said.
</P>
<P>
   And many families do not tell schools or neighbors about a
child's HIV status because they fear ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant, in fact, took the New York City Board of Education to
court in 1990 when staff workers at the Bronx elementary school
gossiped about her oldest son's condition. As part of the
settlement, her son Antonio gets a free education at a private
school in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Grant's three adopted boys with HIV, the gay couple's
son has taken special-education classes, as do an estimated 60
percent to 70 percent of infected children. But unlike Ms. Grant's
children, the men's son recently was moved into mainstream general
education classes after he received intensive speech and physical
therapy. As a result, they say, their son no longer has the
developmental delays associated with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a Good Day, the Pills Go Down Easy
</P>
<P>
   Most children with HIV, though, do not have the luxury of their
parents' undivided attention. They live with care givers like Ms.
Grant in sometimes chaotic homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Grants live in Highbridge Gardens, a drab housing project
surrounded by a chain-link fence. Drug dealers loiter there and
undercover police officers cruise the neighborhood. Ms. Grant likes
her children to be locked indoors by 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   She is the only adult in the household. Her husband, who is
diabetic, does not live with her. He stays with his invalid mother.
It is an arrangement that suits Ms. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is around kids. I don't have time for adults,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Grant's apartment, bottles of HIV medicine fill three
shelves of a kitchen cabinet. More bottles of drugs clutter the
kitchen table. Medicaid picks up the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The other morning, Antonio, the 18-year-old, sauntered into the
kitchen. At 5 feet tall, he has the small physique common among
infected children. He made a beeline to the cabinet for his HIV
medication. This relieved his mother, who worries that her son
skips so many doses that his health will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio wearies of taking nearly a dozen pills every day. But on
this morning, he washed down three pills with Pepsi-Cola and
dissolved other pills in water before gulping them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of the time, I don't really take it that much,'' he said.
``I'm sick of it. Sometimes I just don't feel like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant's two other sons with HIV, Pierce and Martin, 12, also
skip doses, known as drug holidays. But Antonio has the weakest
immune system of the three. His doctors no longer prescribe for him
the powerful new AIDS drugs, protease inhibitors, because of his
erratic adherence to the regimen. They feared he might develop a
drug-resistant virus. He now follows a simpler drug regimen.
</P>
<P>
   His mother gives him ominous warnings: ``You know if you don't
take it, your behind is going to be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio is gambling with his life, says his pediatrician, Dr.
Joanna Dobrosyzcki. ``At this point, he is missing more than he is
taking,'' she said. ``He's really been under a lucky star for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, Antonio is not the child that is
worrying Ms. Grant most. She is more concerned about Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Street-savvy and handsome, Pierce loped into the kitchen.
Slightly built, but not as short as Antonio, Pierce was wearing a
gold chain over a white T-shirt and sweat pants. His head was
covered with a black-knit kerchief fashionable among his teen-age
male friends. His mother said the head wrap made him look like a
gang member. He rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce and his mother are at war over his independence. His
doctor has become involved. So have the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-grader lately has been skipping school. He also was
caught stealing camera film at the drugstore near his home. Some
weekends he has not come home.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Ms. Grant hauled Pierce to Bronx Family Court in
hope that a judge would talk some sense into him. He has to see a
probation officer every other week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to mess around on the street and end up in a
box for something other than the virus,'' she said. ``The virus
ain't killing him. It's stupidity that's killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated with the situation earlier this year, Pierce's
pediatrician, Dr. Andrew Wiznia, made the boy and his mother sign a
contract. Pierce said in the contract that he wants his mother to
stop yelling at him. His mother said she wants to know his
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant met the girl her son Pierce has been escorting to
school. The girl has not been told that Pierce is HIV-positive. But
Ms. Grant said she had a pleasant telephone conversation with the
girl's mother. They both agreed that they did not mind the
teen-agers spending time together as long as it was only
friendship. Ms. Grant did not bring up her son's HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's her business to know, because they ain't
doing anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An Awkward Subject to Mention to Friends
</P>
<P>
   After school one day, Pierce was saying that he has told about
10 close friends that he is infected. Unlike his quiet older
brother, Antonio, Pierce is loquacious. As Pierce confidently held
forth on a plastic-wrapped couch, Antonio edged closer to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I do it like, `What would you do if you have a friend
who has HIV?''' Pierce said. ```Would you still be with them?' So I
tell them and they say, `I feel sorry for you,' and they ask me:
`How does it feel? Are you all right? Are you afraid of dying?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I tell them, they don't care,'' he said, and then
added, ``as long as they can't catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said that he lost his virginity at 12 and that he has had
sex with 20 girls, none of whom he told that he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager said he did not reveal his status, because he
fears rejection. And even though he said he uses condoms, he said
he still gets a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant said that Pierce exaggerated his sexual experiences
and she said he has now told her that he had sex with only one
girl. She said she had warned him that knowingly spreading the
virus might carry a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's doctor was surprised to hear that his patient was
having sex at all. ``We talk about sex all the time and he looks at
me as if it's a distant event,'' Wiznia said.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric programs are trying to cope as the infected children
grow up. At St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, the pediatric HIV
program now has a gynecologist on staff and a support group for
teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with more teen-age issues than we used to,''
said Dr. Stephen Arpadi, the program's director. ``In many
respects, for all the problems, it's like answered prayers. Many of
us are surprised to see the way things have unfolded.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WORDS FROM THE DEPTH OF HIS SERBIAN HEART 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best hour to call is 2 or 3 in the morning, New
York time. That is when his brothers return home from the air-raid
shelters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's six hours' time difference,'' Bora Milutinovic said.
``They spend the night there.''
</P>
<P>
   He cannot reach his sister at all, up in the mountains of
Serbia, because the lines have been cut. However, he hears she is
all right, for now.
</P>
<P>
   When he is on the soccer field, he tries to put the fighting out
of his mind. If people ask, he deflects it in fragments of four
languages, but when his fear and anger come out, they are as clear
as a scream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry but I must ask the question,'' he said, this time
in French. ``You have politics, but you also have people. Everybody
thinks they're right, but I must ask why do you destroy a country?
In the cause of what?''
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the most recognizable Serbs in North America, and
he recognizes that being Serbian is not exactly fashionable at the
moment. NATO is bombing Belgrade and other Serbian sections of the
former Yugoslavia, amid evidence that genocide has been perpetrated
upon ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Albanians,'' Milutinovic said. ``I feel sorry
for all humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, he is a blithe citizen of the world, the Fifth Beatle,
Ringo in a trench coat. He is currently coaching the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer, who are having their best
start. The operative word is ``currently,'' because Bora gets
around. He is the only coach in the history of soccer to take four
national teams to the second round of the World Cup _ Mexico in
1986, Costa Rica in 1990, the United States in 1994 and Nigeria in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Mexican passport,'' he said, ``but I am a Serb.''
</P>
<P>
   It works that way in this new world. People who thought they
were integrated North Americans suddenly realize they are more
Irish or Korean or Ghanaian or Chilean than they had imagined. The
bombing has blasted through Milutinovic's effervescent veneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in Belgrade in May last year,'' he said, referring
to his Nigerian team. ``We lost, 3-0, to Yugoslavia. The city was
beautiful. Beautiful. Now I hear hospitals and schools are being
bombed. NATO says it only bombs military targets. How do you
separate? It is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his plea during a luncheon he suggested, deciding to
unburden himself last Thursday at Serafina, a restaurant on East
61st Street in Manhattan. The busboys from Latin America bustled
when they spotted Bora, and the management from Italy gave him a
corner table.
</P>
<P>
   We spoke French mostly, but when his stylish Mexican wife, Mari
Carmen _ whom he adoringly calls Pancho _ arrived, we switched to
Spanish and English, with key phrases in Italian. But the subject
was anything but normal, as an impassioned and probably typical
Serbian expatriate emerged.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke with emotion about his parents, saying they had died
from ``fighting fascism'' during World War II. Later he suggested
they had died from enfermedad, Spanish for infirmity. At any rate,
he evoked the era when Yugoslavia was a valued alternative to
Russian-based communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have big alliances,'' he said, ``but inside you have small
countries, very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He drew diagrams on the paper tablecloth, arrows here, lines
there, but instead of his strikers infiltrating opposing defenses,
he was demonstrating the tensions of a shattered Yugoslavia _ the
Serbs, the Croats, the Bosnians, the Kosovar Albanians, moving this
way and that in a vicious pattern. He scribbled some numbers on the
tablecloth, ratios tilting from a Serbian majority to an Albanian
majority in the south. He did not deny that violence had taken
place, but maintained that much of the impetus came from Albanian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people not write that?'' he asked. ``Television can
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the details, he suggested that President Clinton
had been too busy defending himself against impeachment over the
Lewinsky affair to be up to speed on Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, once NATO goes in there, they never go out,'' he
said. ``Bombing does not solve anything. It only kills more people.
Here you have India and Pakistan testing nuclear weapons. You do
not bomb them. People kill people in Africa. You do not bomb them.
You've got crazy generals all over the world. Here, one missile
goes off target, maybe it lands in Bulgaria. What about Russia? It
is dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic did not discuss the past political divisions in
Serbia, and he did not get into whether the Serbs have committed
atrocities. The bombing has united all Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American people are great,'' he said. ``I love being here;
nobody says anything to me. German people, I have many German
friends. Italy, the planes come from there; I love Italian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As he departed, he chatted up his hosts, and scuttled down the
street with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say, nous ne sommes pas barbares, we are not,
how you say it, barbarians,'' he said. ``Please, stop the
bombing.'' Soon he would be back at soccer practice, where all
languages speak only of goals, where there is no talk of bombing.
Other people's loved ones were struggling to stay alive to reach
the border of Albania. There was no point in Bora Milutinovic's
calling home at this hour. His loved ones were in the air-raid
shelter.

 &HT;    Lakers underestimated task of coping with Rodman's instability
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The risk of hiring Dennis Rodman as the savior of a
talented team with cohesion issues came to a harsh and inevitable
denouement. The Los Angeles Lakers took the calculated gamble that
Rodman's championship pedigree would permeate the team. Instead, he
infected it. That's what germs do.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while, but the Lakers finally realized that they were
better off without Rodman and cut him Thursday. It was a decision
made to stabilize a reeling club, but also to restore some dignity
to a franchise that bowed to the mindless antics of a caricature
out of desperation to win an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman had been at his distracting worst, a virus that ate at
the core of vulnerable cells. The Lakers had no cure for his
devastation. They won 11 consecutive games after he was signed, but
split the next 12 games, which should never happen on a team with
so many skilled players. For them to be in fifth place in the
Western Conference with all their talent speaks for Rodman's
destructive power.
</P>
<P>
   He showed respect for no one. Not vice president Jerry West, not
first-year coach Kurt Rambis, not all-star center Shaquille O'Neal.
It got so bad that owner Jerry Buss _ who enjoyed the attention
Rodman brought as much as George Burns did cigars _ finally
realized Rodman had no respect for him, either. So, Buss gave West
the go-ahead to thrust Rodman into the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of respect, however, did not stop there. Not even
himself did he respect. Any self-respecting man who was paid six
figures to play basketball would not abandon his team for a week or
refuse on four occasions to enter a game or repeatedly come late to
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rodman's antics and disrespect of the Lakers and the
profession virtually was played out for all to see, as they were
featured on nationally televised games seven times this season.
Rest assured that much of the seven other Lakers appearances will
be spent examining the team's recovery from Rodmanitis.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers insist they didn't dump Rodman for his latest
misadventure, in which he showed up more than an hour late for
practice on Thursday. Fittingly, he searched aimlessly for his
socks and shoes as Rambis sent him on his way.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``a pattern of behavior'' that did in Rodman, the Lakers
said. The exact pattern of behavior that has, sadly, typified his
last several seasons in the NBA. As Kobe Bryant said, ``We knew
what we were getting into when we signed Dennis. We knew what kind
of guy he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. Rodman did not do anything that surprised anyone. He
was himself, sad as that may be. He had a prime opportunity to
distinguish himself as a championship cog. The Lakers had the
ingredients, what with inside-dominant O'Neal, the slashing Bryant,
perimeter marksman Glen Rice and a host of other pieces. All Rodman
had to do was show up on time, bring his enthusiasm to the game and
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he brought lunacy. He brought the team down. During a
27-point loss at Portland on Tuesday, he played just 13 minutes
because of an elbow injury that players questioned. That was his
last game with the Lakers and, almost certainly, his last NBA game
ever. Who'd risk poisoning their team on Rodmanitis now?
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to go out a champion in Hollywood, Rodman instead
went out ignobly, placed on the curb like so much litter. The
Lakers were not going to win a championship with him the way they
were going. At least they can seize some dignity in losing without
him.

 &HT;    State beginning project to revive quail population
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People might have been skeptical when the restoration
of Georgia's deer herd began during the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   And some folks had to wonder if nearly extinct wild turkeys
really could be reintroduced in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing existed as public and derogatory as the ``Stuck Pig
Award'' that state Sen. Bill Stephens (R-Canton) recently gave to
the Georgia Department of Natural Resources for the $1 million
appropriation for the Bobwhite Quail Initiative that includes
$50,000 for wood duck boxes.
</P>
<P>
   If Stephens had given a ``Stuck Pig'' for deer or turkey
restoration funds, the senator might be embarrassed today.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if he will regret ridiculing the Bobwhite
Quail Initiative, but the odds are more in the senator's favor on
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is going to be manyfold greater than deer or
turkey,'' said Dan Forster of the Game Management Unit of the
Wildlife Resources Division of the state Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   To restore deer and turkey was challenging, but was a matter of
replenishing wildlife in existing habitat. Of the state's 37
million acres, 24 million are forested timberland, perfect for deer
and turkey, but far from ideal for quail.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring quail is a matter of finding or creating habitat for
existing game. ``Seed quail'' are available, Forster said, but
habitat is a finite resource that is shrinking daily.
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 to 1993, bobwhites declined 62 percent across the
Southeast. Quail-hunting trips in this region declined from
7,644,000 in 1970 to 2,693,500 in 1991. The numbers of quail
hunters in Georgia have decreased from 135,000 in 1962 to 42,000 in
1996. Bringing them back will be the toughest, most ambitious
undertaking in the history of the state's wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   The total projected cost of some $40 million for the project is
daunting enough, but that could be the easy part compared with
persuading the farming community _ farmers and bankers, etc. _ to
change current agricultural practices, the source of most of the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are now managed to eliminate weedy, shrubby areas between
fields, along ditch banks, adjacent to hedgerows and in odd field
corners. Fields have increased in size and double cropping has
become a common practice, meaning that fields stay in production
most of the year and seldom are ``laid by,'' or allowed to become
weedy.
</P>
<P>
   Many fields of row crop, especially in the Piedmont region, have
been converted to pine plantations and exotic pasture grasses.
Prescribed burning no longer is used to manage mature, thinned pine
stands and woodlots between agricultural fields.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have made those changes to grow cash crops and for
aesthetics. Farmers need to borrow money for seed and equipment and
for cash flow, and appraisers and bankers frown at weedy, shrubby
areas.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, quail need ``early succession habitat,'' which
consists of native grasses, legumes, forbs (herbaceous plants),
small shrubs and small trees in combination to form a mosaic that
satisfies the bobwhite quail's requirements throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   It might not look pretty, but it's the source of life for good
hunting and for prey for almost all other carnivores in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The initial study, with a $939,000 budget and staff of nine,
will cover three focus areas of about four counties each and will
work with landowners on how to manage for quail or encourage them
to use more quail-friendly agricultural procedures. More details
will be available before July 1, when funds for the project become
available.
</P>
<P>
   As daunting as the task appears, Forster has hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be 1.5 million acres planted in cotton this year.
That's more acreage than all of Georgia's Wildlife Management
Areas. If every cotton field had a 30-foot buffer around it
suitable for quail habitat _ the concept is staggering.

 &HT;    Breaking Boston's barriers
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fatuma Roba, surprise 1996 Olympic gold medalist,
pocketed an appearance fee approaching $100,000 just to make the
trek here from her native Ethiopia. When she steps to the starting
line Monday for the Boston Marathon, the crowd will cheer and Roba
will be swiftly on her way.
</P>
<P>
   No race official, irate at the sight of a woman in the race,
will try to remove her bib number or attempt to yank her from the
course. Boston, after all, is home to Harvard and a bastion of
progressive thinkers, along with being the favorite stomping ground
of such champion marathoners as Joan Benoit Samuelson, Uta Pippig
and Ingrid Kristiansen.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   While the Boston Marathon has been around for 103 years, women
didn't become approved for the race until 1972. That did not
prevent some intruders from sneaking in.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable was Kathrine Switzer, then a Syracuse University
student, who was almost tackled by an official during the all-men's
1967 race.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer entered wearing bib number 261, which she gained
surreptitiously by applying under the name of K.V. Switzer. When
official John ``Jock'' Semple, who himself ran 19 Boston Marathons,
jumped from the press truck four miles into the race and tried to
rip the number from her sweatshirt, Switzer's boyfriend, a hammer
thrower who was competing, shoved him away _ in full,
camera-clicking view of the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, that photo is more popular than it's ever
been,'' Switzer, 52, said. ``The legend continues to grow. HBO did
a big documentary on women's sports, and a lot of it focused on
that incident, because it was so dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not me that is famous, but the photograph. It was a
picture that was on the front of the world's newspapers the next
morning. It polarized people. There was a whole group that had no
problem with women wanting to run 26 miles, while you had another
group that was outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Semple wrote years later in his autobiography that he wasn't out
to harm Switzer. ``I just wanted my number back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer prevailed on both counts. She managed to keep her
number, and she finished the race unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As funny as the photo looks now, it was a traumatizing
incident,'' Switzer said. ``If you look at the guy's face, he was
out of control. I had never been shouted at like that by anybody,
not even by my father. I was terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was right on the eve of the women's liberation movement,
but I was unaware of all that. I was a kid. I was in college. I
thought women barging into men-only bars was crazy. I never felt
discriminated against until that official tackled me. Then, it was
instant radicalization. It changed my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when Boston officially welcomed female runners
into the fold, Switzer was back. Although never a winner in Boston,
she won the New York Marathon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But her name is forever tied to Boston, and the incident endures
as one of the defining moments in women's running. She used it as a
springboard to help start the Avon running program for women and
still serves as program director. The television networks have
called on her as a marathon analyst, and this year she'll be
announcing her 21st Boston race on a local station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed incredibly since the 1970s and '80s, when we were
all feisty and trying to prove ourselves,'' she said. ``Now,
running has evolved into a lifestyle. It's the whole acceptance
thing. It's no longer unusual to see a woman out running in a pair
of shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it out of the ordinary to see elite runners like Roba,
running for a top prize of $80,000 _ the same as for the men of
Boston. In fact, prize money in Boston is split equally between men
and women.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Militant supporters of the government
unleashed an orgy of attacks Saturday against supposed separatists
in the capital of East Timor, leaving more than 30 people dead,
scores injured, and homes and cars burned, diplomats and human
rights workers said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, which erupted after a parade by pro-Indonesian
militia supporters, was the worst in the provincial capital, Dili,
since 1991, when Indonesian troops shot and killed more than 100
people.
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed Saturday was the adopted teen-age son of
Manuel Carrascalao, a leading pro-independence activist from one of
East Timor's most prominent families.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the violence followed a speech given this morning
by Eurico Gutteres, head of a paramilitary group, to a rally of
supporters outside the governor's office on the Dili seafront.
</P>
<P>
   ``I command all pro-integration militia to conduct a cleansing
of all those who have betrayed integration,'' Gutteres said.
``Capture and kill them, if you need.''
</P>
<P>
   They said civilians were then rounded up by militia members and
forced to attend the rally, while carloads of paramilitary members
drove around town firing in the air and attacking the homes of
known and suspected independence supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the rally included the East Timor governor,
Abilio Soares, and the province's army and police commanders.
Diplomats said other senior Indonesian military commanders were
also in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and human rights officials in Dili said members of
the Indonesian military were seen actively cooperating with the
paramilitary members, waving them on and providing food and water.
</P>
<P>
   The violence casts fresh doubt on a U.N.-supervised vote on
self-determination for East Timor that is scheduled for July. It
also appeared timed to derail talks scheduled in New York this week
between Portugal and Indonesia to discuss a U.N.-sponsored meeting
on autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 militiamen attacked the home of Carrascalao, the
independence leader, where some 150 refugees _ earlier victims of
paramilitary violence _ had sought shelter. They fired shotgun
blasts and smashed down doors to enter the house.
</P>
<P>
   Two journalists from Agence-France Presse who were at the scene
said the refugees were lying on the floor crying and pleading for
their lives. Both journalists were beaten with rifles and taken
back to a nearby hotel while the attack continued.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the offices of a local newspaper, Suara Timor
Timur, were gutted by a hand grenade blast. Human rights officials
said a young man was lying dead outside the Resende hotel, while an
unknown number of people were killed and wounded in a suburb,
Metiaut.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon some 30 civilian casualties had been brought to
a small clinic operated by an American, Dan Murphy. Others were
taken to the city's understaffed general hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the Foundation for Legal and Human Rights was
evacuated after being attacked by militiamen armed with guns and
machetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its height 3,000 to 7,000 militia paraded around the city
displaying their homemade weapons,'' the human rights group
reported by e-mail. ``They divided themselves to the east and west
of Dili and began terrorizing civilians with machetes and by
burning homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats said they believe the paramilitary violence had
been allowed to take place with the cooperation of senior
Indonesian military commanders opposed to an independent East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the East Timorese independence leader, Xanana
Gusmao, under house arrest in Jakarta, declared that his supporters
had the right to bear arms for self-protection from the
paramilitary members.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners in Jakarta interpreted the call as a declaration of
war.

   Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and
harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her
German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her Cold
War memoir published and praised as a literary event, died Tuesday
at her home in Berlin. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had
returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to
promote her new book, ``Love in Exile,'' published in March by
Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and
correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a
conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, N.Y., to a stint at
the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard
Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other
literati. She also wrote of her consuming and troubled romance with
Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and anti-fascist whom she
married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to
Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing
and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and affecting
portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to
today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New
York Times Book Review found the book most affecting when Ms.
Anderson recounted her domestic torments and search for love
outside the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The
Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only
$5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I
bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me
joyously. `You're just the person I need!' He told me he was
cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into
the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker.
But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'll break you in,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `In three days?
</P>
<P>
   `` `Less.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as
cultural editor. ``My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was
delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx
said, was a struggle, and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women
on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly
afterward, she met Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime
bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in
Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next
year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a
desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost
everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to
remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years,
although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia,
who still lives in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she
considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was
deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ``What right have you to
deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went
into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson
was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer
Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the
Bronx. ``She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope
that a just society could be built,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death
throes of the German Democratic Republic as communism collapsed and
the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ``a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,''
as she described it.
</P>
<P>
   In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology,
``Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through
East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching
a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions
and take up the taboo subject of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans
``had just about had it,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Six months,' she replied.''
</P>
<P>
   Her grandson grew alarmed, and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him.
``But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had
broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice,
`Enough!'
</P>
<P>
   ``The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The
unthinkable happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former
West Germans ``tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it
with inferior ``Western goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and attended
Columbia University, graduating in 1932. In addition to her
daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of
Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ``Gelbes Licht''
(``Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short
stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ``Wo Ist
Katalin? (``Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977.
From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York
National Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New
York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging
her fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi, said any
infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New
School for Social Research on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ``but the
people would not let her stop.''

   SKULL VALLEY GOSHUTE RESERVATION, Utah _ The desert here is
silent, but for bird song and wind. The vegetation is springtime
green, the mountain tops covered with snow for the next month or
so, and all is still except for the jack rabbits, hawks and
occasional antelope, and a rare car on the two-lane blacktop road.
But this is a rough neighborhood, environmentally speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Stansbury mountains, the only source of potable water
here, the Deseret Chemical Depot holds half the United States'
chemical weapons and an incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, a magnesium factory has let clouds of chlorine gas
loose into the reservation's air. To the northwest, a private
company buries low-level nuclear waste under a license obtained
after the operator gave gold coins and a condominium to a state
environmental regulator. Three sites nearby store toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   To the southwest, the Army tests protective gear for chemical
and biological warfare at the Dugway Proving Ground. And to the
west, the Air Force trains F-16 pilots, who sometimes crash.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation could also provide storage for more than half
the nation's civilian nuclear waste, the tiny Skull Valley Band of
the Goshute tribe says. The tribe has signed a 50-year lease with
eight electric companies, led by Northern States Power Co. of
Minnesota and including Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, to use
840 of the reservation's 18,000 acres for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal chairman, Leon Bear, argues that the project is safe
and that his tribe is using its last asset, its land, to assure its
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Michael Leavitt, who grew up downwind of atmospheric
nuclear tests, says that he will do whatever it takes to stop the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen with my eyes the effects of radioactive
material,'' Leavitt said. ``I had friends in childhood die, farmers
lose herds of sheep only to be told by the federal government it
must have been something they ate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Skull Valley Band has about 120 members (depending on who is
counting), half of them adults, but only 24 people live here, about
50 miles west of Salt Lake City. Nuclear waste could bring the
others back, Bear said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the economics, that's why people left,'' he
said. ``There's nothing there for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The waste storage site, which would be a concrete pad covered
with concrete silos, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence, would
produce 40 or 50 permanent jobs, Bear said, for guards, technicians
and administrative workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a plant on the reservation that tests rocket motors
employs a few members of the tribe as security guards. There is
also a tribally owned convenience store, most of its shelves empty,
which sells gas, six kinds of beef jerky, and beaded knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   The ``village'' area, overlooking where the waste would go, is a
run-down collection of sheds, shacks, trailers, campers and
weather-beaten homes, some abandoned; rusting hulks of cars and
farm equipment dot the area. Here the utilities would pay rent,
perhaps millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   For all their wants, the Goshutes are a sovereign tribe. So the
state cannot veto the project, which will begin accepting waste in
2002 if the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which begins
hearings later this year, grants a license. The commission has
already licensed similar arrangements near reactors, and opponents,
who include some members of the tribe, think it will do so here.
</P>
<P>
   Margene Bullcreek, who lives on the reservation, argued that the
lease should have been put to a vote of all the adults, not just
those who came to a small meeting where it was approved. Calling
the waste dangerous and inconsistent with traditional respect for
the land, her faction is asking the Interior Department to overturn
the Bureau of Indian Affairs' approval of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fall back on who we really are and what we really
want,'' Ms. Bullcreek said. ``This is where wisdom comes in. It
wouldn't be wisdom if we go for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really pretty down there,'' she said. ``It's not a
desert. There are deer in the mountains, eagles, badgers, raccoons,
foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the tribe see it differently. ``It's just land;
it just kind of sits here,'' said Mary Allen, vice chairwoman of
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen accompanied a reporter past the long row of wood
stakes that mark where an access road to the storage site would be
built. ``What can we do with this?'' she said. ``There's no water
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Nielson, executive director of the state Department of
Environmental Quality, said, ``Outsiders may say it's in the middle
of nowhere, but in fact it's in the middle of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, Ms. Nielson asked, if an earthquake hit the
area and released some nerve gas, and forced an evacuation? A leak
of radioactive material at the same time could block people fleeing
the area, she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Utah took over the paved road from Tooele County and, near the
beginning of the 27-mile route from Interstate 80 down to the
reservation, erected a highway sign that says, ``High Level Nuclear
Waste Prohibited.'' Then the state seized from the county two dirt
roads that run near the reservation, effectively blocking the
utilities from crossing the roads with a railroad spur to the site.
</P>
<P>
   The roads, officially designated as ``highways that serve a
compelling statewide public safety interest,'' thus became the only
unpaved highways in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt has vowed to build ``a moat'' of state-owned land to
prevent waste from coming in. Bear said that if this was done, his
people would be the first desert tribe to learn to swim.
</P>
<P>
   The state fears that once the waste gets here, it will never go
away.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, storage here would be ``interim,'' until the Energy
Department prepared a burial spot. All reactor operators signed
contracts with the department in the mid-1980s and paid it fees. In
return, the department was to begin taking waste deliveries in
January 1998 for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the department says it will begin taking the waste in 2010,
at the earliest, if Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, can be shown to
be suitable. By that time, some reactors are expected to be out of
storage.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen to the waste at the end of the 50-year lease?
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is eventually going to want to bury it where it
is collected,'' said Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute
for Energy and Environmental Research, of Takoma Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy never met a repository location it
didn't like,'' Makhijani said. ``Once you take all the trouble of
taking the waste to a certain place, I have a sneaking suspicion
they will find geological virtues nobody knew existed,'' and try to
bury the waste there.
</P>
<P>
   Bear insisted that if the tribe wanted it moved, the utilities
would have to take it away: ``Do you think they would relinquish it
to a bunch of Indians? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leavitt said that wherever the wastes are now, they are
better off there. ``The nature of technological life is that we all
have to live with the rule `If you create waste, you take care of
it,''' he said.

KOSOVO NOTEBOOK: A MARATHON IN BELGRADE; MILOSEVIC'S SON
REAPPEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In the bizarre world of wartime Belgrade
in the spring, Saturday saw the running of a marathon sponsored by
the International Amateur Athletic Federation and dedicated to the
memory of Fred Lebow, who founded the New York City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And after a cold morning downpour, the runners ran under a
clearing sky _ ``good bombing weather,'' as one caustic Serb named
Vladimir said. The runners included an American and two Germans,
representatives of the very countries that are part of the NATO
alliance now bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon was intended, according to the federation
president, Primo Nebiolo, to symbolize the role of athletics as a
``means of getting to know and respect others of differing ethnic,
linguistic, cultural and religious origins.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his reaction, Vladimir, who asked that his surname not
be used because he works for a government media outlet, laughed and
said: ``It seems a little late for all that, doesn't it?'' He noted
that Yugoslavia has been ripping itself apart for the last 10 years
over just those very issues, and that the Kosovo war is only the
latest example of ``the Balkan inability to be Americans, no matter
how many bombs you drop.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon began in Terazije Square and passed by the wreckage
of the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministry buildings, which face
each other on Kneza Milosa street and were hit the same night by
American and British cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The runners also passed some of the more clever and increasingly
professional billboards now appearing in Belgrade. One of the
latest shows a picture of the Eiffel Tower collapsing in flames and
the words: ``Just Imagine. Stop the Bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example of the use of sports for political ends, just
as sincere and naive as the marathon, perhaps, another billboard
shows one of Belgrade's top soccer teams, Red Star, over the same
slogan: ``Stop the Bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Son in Uniform
</P>
<P>
   In the mysterious realm of the Milosevic family, the son of
President Slobodan Milosevic, Marko, has reappeared on state
television and in the pages of the government-run Politika daily _
and in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   British officials had announced that Marko had run away to Crete
and had been excused by his father from military service. But in
Wednesday's TV news and newspaper he was shown in the family's
hometown of Pozarevac, where he owns a large discotheque called
``Madonna'' and other businesses, soon to include an amusement park
called ``Bambi-land.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he was also on television in a sort of
paramilitary uniform of black, with dyed yellow, punkish hair. Last
week, he was in a regular Yugoslav army uniform, with his
3-month-old son, also named Marko, and his wife, Milica.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yugoslavs have wondered in conversational asides why NATO,
if it is so interested in stopping the war, has not targeted any
Milosevic businesses in Pozarevac. To these people, it is only more
proof that Milosevic and President Clinton are really in cahoots
over this war, which is designed, they say, to boost the political
fortunes of both.

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah A. Gavit is leading an invasion of Mars. Built under her
direction are two craft now speeding toward a December rendezvous
with the red planet to help see if it harbors life.
</P>
<P>
   Her top aides are also women and, like her, edgy. They are all
pioneers pushing back frontiers of inquiry, technology and gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really out on a limb,'' the 37-year-old Ms. Gavit said.
This is probably the most anxious time, because there is little to
do but wait until December, hoping the risky technical gamble will
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Never before in NASA's 40-year history, officials say, have
women held all the top posts _ project manager, scientist and
engineer _ in any space mission. And this one is tough. The craft,
which set off from a launching pad in Florida last January, are
meant to set planetary exploration on a bold new course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Suzanne E. Smrekar, 37, the lead scientist.
``I really believe it's going to work. But even in a mission that
isn't high-risk, there are risks. In this whole business, you're
never sure of the outcome until it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has come a
long way since the right-stuff days when the top people tended to
be male, white, former military and macho. Now female astronauts
are routine, and the space agency prides itself on the women in its
ranks of experts and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no women have led a planetary exploration until now,
making it a milestone for them.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team of experts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., designed and built the two intricate spacecraft.
Each is about the size of a grapefruit but they are heavy with
circuits and high-tech components, and built to slam into Mars at
high speed and penetrate at least three feet into its surface.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to study the rocky composition of the soil and look
for signs of water, which is considered a key to life but appears
scarce on the desert-like surface of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   No planetary probe has ever before crash-landed and radioed
signals back to Earth. Ms. Gavit, the project manager, said finding
a way to accomplish that goal took every ounce of skill and
creativity the team could muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the technology is new,'' she said. ``A couple things
were off the shelf. Everything else had to be invented, and some of
it is pretty radical.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's size peaked at 55 men and women. The project costs
$29.2 million, a pittance in a field where spacecraft have run $1
billion or more. The effort epitomizes NASA's new philosophy of
smaller, cheaper, faster and better, making the job even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Kari A. Lewis, 25, the project's chief engineer, said much of
the assembly work was done under microscopes. ``You can't see the
wiring with the naked eye,'' she said. ``It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The three women have kept a low profile. They rejected the idea
of a Jet Propulsion Laboratory news release on their role, fearing
that it would be dismissed as a publicity stunt. But interviews
were allowed for this article and for the May issue of Working
Woman, which goes on sale on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the two firsts _ the new character of a NASA
exploratory team and the challenging new goal _ are seen as linked.
In hiring for the project, the women say, NASA officials seemed to
be eager for experts less vested in the status quo and more willing
to take risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have a higher probability of getting into these roles,''
said Dr. Smrekar, the chief scientist. ``I didn't have the burden
of lots of experience on lots of past projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gavit said youthfulness was probably a more important
factor. ``They didn't want people with the old ways of thinking
because they knew it was a really challenging mission,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The team's composition also had an element of chance. Ms. Lewis
became chief engineer last June when her boss, a man, went into
private business, giving her the lead just as the project reached
its hardest phase, building the tiny craft and finding ways to make
nebulous plans come to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're women hasn't made a difference,'' she
said. ``It's not an issue here. But it's good that young girls see
that engineering and technical fields are wide open to women.
That's the good thing about saying it's a woman-led team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's tiny spacecraft, dubbed microprobes, are hitching a
ride to Mars aboard a larger mission known as Mars Polar Lander. In
December, as the large craft nears the planet, the microprobes ,
which are enclosed in so-called aeroshells that shatter on impact,
will fly off and crash-land at more than 400 miles an hour. The
bigger spacecraft will follow, firing rockets to slow its descent
to a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   For the microprobes, the degree of risk depends on whether the
impact site turns out to be sand dunes, polar ice or unforgiving
solid rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got two tries,'' Ms. Gavit said. ``The whole idea
ultimately is to put eight or 10 of them on spaceships, so if you
lost a couple, it wouldn't be a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   If the microprobes work, the effort will pave the way for new
studies of Mars and other planets and planetary moons.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the December mission fails, Ms. Gavit said, the idea
is so sweet technically that it will flourish in time. Already, she
added, the team's innovations have spread to other projects,
showing the merits of pushing back all kinds of frontiers,
including those of gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have really added to the workplace because we do come at
things from a different angle,'' she said. ``For the same reason
that cultural diversity works, gender diversity is wonderful, too,
especially when you're trying to do something creative.''

   DENVER _ Airline pilots typically learn in simulators how to
handle engine failure, stormy winds and other disruptions in
flight. But now United and other airlines are tossing them more
radical problems _ like what to do when a jumbo jet rolls nearly
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   It is such a rare event that the lesson may seem pointlessly
exotic. A commercial jet is almost as stable as a city bus; the
most frequent flier will probably never experience more than a
30-degree roll to one side, or feel the nose point down more than 5
degrees or up more than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Even pilots may fly 30 years without encountering the kind of
emergency for which United is training them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their experience seeing what the world looks like upside-down
is pretty limited,'' said one aviation safety expert, Stuart
Matthews, president of the Flight Safety Foundation. Fighter pilots
fly that way, but in recent years fewer airline pilots have
military experience.
</P>
<P>
   The training was begun by United Airlines, with American, Delta,
USAirways, Continental and Alaska following suit, after a 1996
recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board.
Airlines say that no single incident convinced them, but that the
crash of USAir 427 in Pittsburgh in September 1994, encouraged them
to prepare pilots. That plane, a Boeing 737, went out of control
apparently because of a rudder malfunction, and led to debates
among pilots about whether the plane was ``recoverable'' in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   There is no debate, though, that inexperience with ``unusual
attitudes,'' situations in which the plane may roll or pitch, lulls
pilots into a false sense of security and leaves them with no
guidance when something goes extremely wrong, like a flight control
that sticks, or a strong atmospheric disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of an upside-down jet, for example, the solution is
to use not only the normal flight controls but also the rudder,
which is hardly ever used in the cruise phase of flight. The way to
convince a pilot of that is to show, not tell, but that is hardly
practical with a $200 million plane.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if a plane's nose is pointing too high, United
teaches them that the fast way to level the airplane is not to use
the usual controls on the tail, but to bank very steeply, a
maneuver that most pilots may have seen only in old World War II
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The course takes about a half-hour of the 12 hours that pilots
spend in simulators during their annual re-training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots get very little practice, if any at all, on what we
call unusual attitudes, or upsets,'' Matthews said. That includes
situations where the plane rolls steeply sideways or even upside
down, or pitches up and seems to want to stand on its tail.
</P>
<P>
   So at United's flight training center here on the grounds of the
old Stapleton Airport, three dozen simulators can tilt, rock and
roll on hydraulic platforms to simulate extreme changes in flight,
as computer monitors mimic what the pilots would see out the
windows in a real flight emergency.
</P>
<P>
   During their three days of annual retraining, Capt. John C.
Penney drills crews on what to do if something throws the plane out
of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the simulator, instructors like Penney, the program
manager for advanced maneuvers, start them off. ``Attitude,'' he
barks, as the pilot is supposed to, to alert the other pilot of a
problem. Then the drill is to glance across the control panel at
the second pilot's instruments, to confirm that the problem is with
the plane and not with a malfunctioning instrument. The next step
is to disconnect the autopilot and aggressively work the controls
to level off the plane.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Penney shows off the rudder trick.
</P>
<P>
   The rudder is the movable panel on the vertical fin of the tail.
Operated with the feet, it is used mostly to keep the plane pointed
straight down the runway when taking off or landing in a crosswind.
Most of the steering in flight is accomplished by ailerons, the
panels on the backs of the wings, which are used to tilt one wing
up and the other down in a controlled roll that makes the plane
turn.
</P>
<P>
   When his simulator goes into an extreme roll, Penney first has
the crews try to right the plane with the ailerons alone.
Instruments show an accelerating plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Then he has the crews try using the rudder along with the
ailerons. That pushes the nose to one side, skidding the plane
slightly sideways. Now the wings are no longer swept back equally
from the direction of travel. One is almost perpendicular to the
direction of travel, and thus produces more lift; the other,
aligned nearly parallel to the direction of travel and shielded
from the wind by the fuselage, produces much less lift. The uneven
lift helps roll the plane right side up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not show-boating or hot-dogging,'' said Penney, a former
fighter pilot. ``It's an eye-opening exercise.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FINE LINES FOR ETHICS IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ ``Medicine is just about life and death,''
said the graybeard Welsh philosopher Andrew Edgar last weekend.
``Sports is more important than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Take doing no harm, for example, certainly an ethical principle
in medicine, but not always one in sports. Can we chastise Mike
Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield's ear, asked Edgar, when both
men were trying to hurt each other in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   The current interest in sports ethics may have to do with the
general crisis in ethics (the ethics of business and politics are
better subjects for Comedy Central than for the academy, and
medical ethics is mired in end-of-life issues) as well as with the
current interest in sports, where moral imperatives and right
versus wrong seem to have no place on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement at a Brown University symposium on
ethics and sports, Edgar, director of the Center for Applied Ethics
at the University of Wales, promised his listeners that they would
find out just ``how difficult and irreconcilable the problems
are.'' Over two days, an impressive roster of panelists seemed to
agree only that politics, power, race, gender, class, disability
and sexual preference were the prisms through which sports could be
understood.
</P>
<P>
   The most personal and moving statement came from Richard
Hoffman, a 50-year-old poet and novelist, who had been raped at 10
by his soccer coach. In his 1995 memoir, ``Half the House''
(Harcourt Brace), Hoffman named the ``predatory coach,'' who had
first used heterosexual pornography to entrap him in a web of shame
and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   After the book's publication, according to Hoffman, he received
hundreds of calls from men who had never before spoken about being
sodomized by their coaches. Many had been raped by the same youth
coach who raped Hoffman. The coach was subsequently arrested and
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman offered specific advice and a program to counteract the
sexual violence that he sees as part of the ``curriculum of
boyhood,'' and thus of sports. But there is also a more systemic
violence, he said, which was put in place by that so-called
greatest generation, which returned from World War II with a
``combat mentality''; the militarism of modern American sports,
such as the authoritarianism of the coach, the insistence on
obedience, and the ``willful confusion of opponents and enemy'' are
among its legacies.
</P>
<P>
   In an even larger and more metaphorical context, Hoffman offered
his own ``Big Coach'' theory, finding the root of all sports ethics
in the Bible. Abraham, after all, was ready to sacrifice Isaac, as
we continue to sacrifice our children to the gods of games.
</P>
<P>
   In other sports news, fans, Richard Lapchick, founder of the
Center for the Study of Sport in Society, reviewed his group's
``racial report cards,'' again finding discouraging statistics on
the representation of blacks in coaching and administration. Eli
Abarbanel-Wolff, a Brown undergraduate who lost fine motor control
of his left arm and leg during heart surgery at 2, discussed
discrimination in sports against the disabled. He has played on the
U.S. National Disabled Soccer team and envisions a disabled
movement in sports on the model of the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   One notable, and model, activist, Mariah Burton-Nelson, a former
college and pro basketball player and author most recently of
``Embracing Victory'' (Morrow), described a vision of competition
in which athletes ``seek together'' rather than do battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men,'' she said, ``are in danger of thinking winning is
everything while women think winning is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Reamer, a professor of social work at Rhode Island
College, led a series of lively panels that managed never to answer
such ethical questions as, Where does the responsibility begin in
the case of a basketball star who, under pressure not to let down
her team, plagiarizes a paper? And, What is the individual
responsibility of a linebacker sent in by his coach to knock out
the opposing quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   William Reynolds, a Providence Journal sports columnist and
author of a memoir, ``Glory Days,'' pointed out that the current
mantra ``Play hard'' contains the implicit ``Go get him.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference was created by Arlene Gorton, a recently retired
professor of physical education and associate athletic director at
Brown. It was not without its own ironies, underscoring Edgar's
premise of ``difficult and irreconcilable.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's record of Title IX compliance led to a bitterly divisive
and expensive lawsuit. Its new president, E. Gordon Gee, was also
president of Ohio State, Colorado and West Virginia, where, as he
enjoys recounting, he entertained prospective donors in his
football box. In his welcoming statement, he told the conference
that he was ``finally making more than the football coach.''
</P>
<P>
   One participant was Larry Farmer, the former UCLA basketball
player and coach and currently head coach at Loyola University in
Chicago. While here, he lobbied unsuccessfully for the head
coaching job at the University of Rhode Island, where he had been
an assistant. He was not pressed on the ethics of leaving a class
of recruits behind.

IN COLORADO, 3 JUDGES RULE ON PENALTY IN MURDER CASE  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo., Neb.)  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Three judges in Colorado made history last week in the
state's first case in which a panel of judges, rather than a jury,
decided whether a convicted murderer should be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The state law transferring death penalty decisions from a jury
to a panel of judges was enacted in 1995, but its first test did
not come until last week. Criticism of the system mounted as the
panel neared its decision, and one judge who was not on the panel
resigned over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This removes the process from the conscience of the community
and makes it a dry legal process,'' said Richard Dieter, director
of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, which has
been critical of the way the death penalty is applied. ``The death
penalty is unique and is supposed to represent the will of the
people and this evolving standard of decency. Although the jury may
not be the perfect instrument, it is the traditional one.''
</P>
<P>
   In this first case, the judges unanimously concluded on Friday
that a life sentence was appropriate for Robert Riggan, citing in
part the reluctance of the jury to find that the murder was
intentional or premeditated.
</P>
<P>
   Riggan, 39, was found guilty last fall of first-degree felony
murder for raping and killing a 22-year-old Denver prostitute in
1997. Riggan has maintained that he is innocent and that the woman
injured herself trying to jump out of his vehicle. He has said he
would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cohen, a Denver lawyer and legal analyst, agrees with the
decision in the Riggan case, but not with how it was reached. ``I
think this was a just result but a terrible procedure,'' he said.
``It is likely to skew the process much more in favor of death
verdicts,'' as judges who are elected might be susceptible to the
wishes of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it seems to me that if juries wanted more death
verdicts,'' Cohen said, ``they would've voted for more.''
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty law in Colorado was backed by prosecutors who
had become frustrated with juries that would not impose capital
punishment and who did not believe juries should be given the death
penalty decision. The three-judge panel in each case is to be led
by the trial judge, with the other judges appointed by the Chief
Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges have to be concerned their decision will not be about
life or death, but about whether they will be retained as a judge
or not,'' said David Kaplan, a lawyer who represents a murderer
whose fate will be decided by a three-judge panel in May. ``And now
when you have people of conscience dissatisfied with the process
and leaving the bench, you have a bench with those who are greater
advocates for the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado law was modeled on a law in Nebraska, the only
other state to use the judicial panel method. Seven other states
let a judge determine the sentence in a capital case.
</P>
<P>
   There are four people on death row in Colorado. At least five
more death penalty cases will be decided by three-judge panels in
the state this year, and prosecutors in four cases scheduled to
come to trial this year have said that they would seek the death
penalty. Prosecutors say that this is an effect of coincidence and
the deliberate nature of the legal system rather than the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, these cases wended their way through the
system,'' said Ray Slaughter, executive director of the Colorado
District Attorneys' Council, ``and we are very circumspect in the
way we change and go forward on cases of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan says most of the current cases were filed as death
penalty cases after the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter defends the law as ``constitutionally correct and
rational.''
</P>
<P>
   But one Colorado judge, Michael J. Heydt, found the law so
problematic that he resigned, effective just one week before he was
to sit on a three-judge panel in early June.
</P>
<P>
   Heydt, a judge for 12 years, described the law as ``manifestly
unworkable'' in his resignation letter and listed three reasons he
would not sit on a panel: a lack of data, time and experience with
a case, a desire to preside over an entire case before deciding a
person's fate and the problem of working with only a ``paper
record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not wish to participate in a death penalty process,''
Heydt wrote in his resignation letter to the Colorado Supreme
Court, ``unless I believe that it is one that I can live with not
only as a judge but also as a human being.''

YOUNG TEAM AND FEW FANS FOR WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In New York, New York, the Bronx is up and the Battery is down.
But in Chicago, the Cubs are up, and the White Sox are so far down
they are practically invisible. Their fans may be invisible before
long. The White Sox did not have many for their first series of the
season, and the outlook is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very satisfied if we hit what we did last year, a
million four, a million five, with the young kids,'' Ron Schueler,
the general manager, said. Is there a danger of drawing fewer fans?
``Yeah, if we don't get off to a good start. In Chicago, you better
be playing good by the time school lets out. They want to win on
the South Side. You don't have to win on the other side of town.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of fans the White Sox attract this season is relevant
because, Schueler said, the club relied on the view of fans in
choosing to start over with young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of dictated this is the direction they wanted us to
go,'' he said. ``We had a lot of study groups, went to a lot of big
firms to find out exactly what our plans were. They wanted a
different type team. They wanted guys who would hustle, who would
get dirty, come to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   So the White Sox let Albert Belle and Robin Ventura exit as free
agents, leaving Frank Thomas the only established and proven hitter
in their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin's a great player, but he's quiet, no holler stuff,''
Schueler said. ``Albert just turned off everything. He wouldn't
talk to the kids, was rude to them, so that wasn't a fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Thomas, who will be 31 next month, the White Sox
field a team of players in their 20s, the youngest 21. Except for
Thomas, the basic starting batting order (eight players) has a
total of 12 years of major-league experience.
</P>
<P>
   An average crowd of 16,218, lowest in the American League,
watched these youngsters play their first three home games. That's
about the same average the White Sox attracted for their
season-opening series last year. They finished the season with an
average of 17,609 and a total attendance of 1,391,146, third lowest
in the league and lowest at Comiskey Park in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Lee MacPhail, when he was AL president, always said the league
needed a strong Chicago franchise. This version does not meet that
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some people blame 8-year-old Comiskey Park, the only new park
that has not lured fans. Others blame Jerry Reinsdorf, the team's
chairman. Some fans seemed to be turned off by Reinsdorf's militant
stance during the 1994-95 labor dispute. Then there certainly
appeared to be a backlash to his decision to trade three pitchers
at the trading deadline two years ago when the White Sox were only
three and a half games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   That trade, on the other hand, gave the team its current
shortstop, Mike Caruso, and closer, Bob Howry.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout last winter, speculation had the White Sox trading
Thomas to shed the last of their big salaries. But Thomas remains
the core of the lineup, and Schueler said he expects him to stay
there. To trade Thomas, the general manager said, ``they'd have to
overwhelm me, and I don't see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Thomas feel about that status?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home for me,'' he said. ``I'm going to make the best
of the situation regardless of what we've got to deal with. I plan
on spending the rest of my career here.''
</P>
<P>
   And until some of the younger players can develop into lusty
hitters, Thomas said he does not mind being naked in the lineup,
even though he is coming back from the worst of his eight full
seasons in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' he said. ``I can handle it. I'm looking forward
to a big year. That's my goal; that's my plan. I have a role here
now. It's not a selfish Frank Thomas anymore. I'm the protector in
the lineup. I'm going to have to protect the guy who's swinging the
bat well. That will be my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   How about someone protecting him in the lineup? ``I'm not
worried about me,'' he said. ``I don't need any protection.''
</P>
<P>
   He has certainly not needed any so far. In Chicago's first nine
games, Thomas collected 15 hits in 29 at-bats for a league-leading
.517 average. He hit two home runs and drove in seven runs. Last
year he batted .265, his first sub-.300 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about it anymore,'' he said of last year.
``It was one of those growing years. I had marital problems.
Everything went wrong. It was a stressful year. I wasn't playing
well; I wasn't doing well off the field. It was a roller coaster
last year. The game was not as much fun. Now I'm back having fun
and having fun with this young team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Enjoying Home-Run Tear
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell allowed himself a moment of fantasy. ``If the season
stopped today,'' he said before Friday night's games, a smile in
his voice, ``I'd be the home run champ.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks' second baseman indeed was the
major-league home-run leader, his five home runs putting him one
ahead of several players, including Mark McGwire, who last year hit
50 more home runs than Bell. With five in 10 games, Bell is 16
games ahead of his 1998 pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good spring training,'' the 33-year-old Bell said.
``But if I had to predict what would happen the first couple weeks
of the season, I would have had a real rough time because we were
facing tough pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks played their first 10 games against Los Angeles
and Atlanta. ``To have five home runs against the Dodger pitchers
is not the norm,'' said Bell, who hit his home runs against Kevin
Brown, Mel Rojas, Ismael Valdes (two) and Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, helping the Diamondbacks to three consecutive victories
over the Dodgers, whacked four of those home runs last week, which
was a ding dong of a week for all of baseball's Bells. Besides
Jay's four, David Bell of Seattle hit three and Derek Bell of
Houston hit his first of the season. Then there was a variation on
the theme: Albert Belle of Baltimore slugged a pair of home runs
against Roger Clemens of the Yankees on Thursday night.

<P>
   The Strides of the Shortstops
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez is envious of his best friend, but he begrudges
Derek Jeter nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Derek has reached the pinnacle,'' Rodriguez, the
Seattle Mariners' injured star shortstop, said. ``He's certainly
reached the highest standpoint you can reach from a winning
standpoint. Two out of three years is pretty tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   But his fellow shortstop can get better as a hitter, just as he
and Nomar Garciaparra of Boston, the other super young shortstop,
can, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an offensive standpoint, I think we can all get much
better,'' he remarked. ``Derek has made the most remarkable strides
out of all three of us. I think Derek has a good work ethic. He's
in a good environment to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is off to a remarkable start, leading the league in
slugging, total bases and extra-base hits going into the weekend,
an unusual position for a shortstop. Albert Belle led the league in
those three categories last season. But nothing the Yankees'
youngest regular does surprises Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides being my best friend, he's one of the biggest
competitors I've ever met in my life,'' said the currently disabled
Rodriguez. ``We always talk about ways to get better. He's always
thinking of how he's going to get better. He's always asking me
questions. He's relentless. He's going to keep getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken Showing Weaknesses
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's performance at Yankee Stadium last week did nothing
to discourage growing speculation that his career could be over
sooner than expected. The fading Baltimore star had difficulty
hitting and fielding as his batting average fell to .174, and his
number of errors rose to five in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken did have a rough ending to spring training with the death
of his father and a tough start to the season with a back ailment,
but his early play lent credence to the view of a former teammate
that once his incredible consecutive-games streak ended, Ripken
could lose his focus and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of the doubt about his hitting prowess was the
sacrifice bunt he executed in the third inning of the third game of
the Yankee series with the Orioles behind, 5-4. The first two
batters in the inning singled, and instead of swinging away and
trying to drive in one or both, Ripken sacrificed them to third and
second. The next batter was Charles Johnson, a .234 career hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken left New York needing 118 hits (it was 122 when the
season began) to reach 3,000. In 17 seasons, his lowest hit total
was 140, and that was in the strike-shortened 1994 season. But he
could very well fail to get to 3,000 this season because the time
may soon come when the Orioles decide they have to give Willis
Otanez, a rookie, a chance to show what he can do at third. Otanez,
in fact, played Friday night in Toronto as Ripken was benched.
</P>
<P>
   If that time comes, Ray Miller may not be the manager who makes
the decision. Even though Miller was not responsible for putting
together the Orioles' ill-conceived collection of players, he
figures to be the first person to take the blame for the team's
failure on the field.

   WASHINGTON, April 17 _ On some days in Acadia National Park in
Maine, the air pollution is so bad, visibility is half what it
might be on a clear day.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in
Tennessee, the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and so many
other national parks and wilderness areas _ where the pollution
frequently matches the levels in major cities _ that the
Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to give states a new
deadline to clean them up.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline is a long way off: 2064.
</P>
<P>
   As part of regulations that could be announced by President
Clinton as early as Thursday, which is Earth Day, states will be
asked to assess their haze problems over the next few years and
submit plans for cleanup strategies to the environmental agency by
2008.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following six decades, they would set out to return air
quality in scores of parks and wild areas, especially in the East,
to what amounts to pre-industrial conditions. That is, pure.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ambitious goal that, like many other environmental
policies, has evoked criticism on both sides of the issue. This
week, lobbyists for environmental and industry groups continued to
meet with administration officials as the final decisions neared.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials stressed that many details were still
being worked out, including the possibility that deadlines might
vary in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists say that 60 years is too long to wait to
clean up areas that are used and revered by millions of Americans
each year. They say technology now exists to clean up the leading
sources of the pollution _ power plants that burn coal and other
fossil fuels _ at a much faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is far too weak to accomplish where we need to go,'' said
Armond Cohen, director of the Clean Air Task Force, a consortium of
80 environmental groups, based in Boston. ``It is the first step,
and it does set a marker, which is helpful and better than nothing.
But it's not sufficient. The time frame is too slow.''
</P>
<P>
   L. Bruce Hill, senior staff scientist for the Appalachian
Mountain Club in Gorham, N.H., a conservation group with 80,000
members, applauded the EPA for shortening its original schedule,
which would have required 200 years to meet the goals of the Clean
Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   He called the goal of restoring pure air to the wilds within a
generation ``a huge accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said 60 years was too long to wait, calling the
regulations ``softer than they could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Power industry executives, as well as elected officials in the
South and Midwest, who constantly argue with Northeastern states
over the pollution that drifts across their borders, argue that the
new regulations are too rigid and in some cases, redundant. They
say that cleanups could cost billions of dollars, a price that
could be reflected in electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most folks on the industry side of the issue say the
regulations are too inflexible,'' said Dave Flannery, legal counsel
for the Midwest Ozone Group, which represents 25 power companies in
nine states. ``We feel their approach is taking on too much too
fast. We need a much more flexible, more cautious program.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bailey, vice president for environment of the Edison
Electric Institute, a trade association that represents most of the
country's power plants, said states also needed wider latitude in
eliminating haze because problems are more concentrated in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, some states may need to work with neighboring
states to develop a regional strategy, which could take longer to
implement. The draft encourages states to work together, and some
already are, like the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission,
which is studying air quality problems in nine Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Johnson, policy analyst for the Southern Governors
Association, said that other programs aimed at improving air
quality for health reasons already addressed the objectives of the
EPA's new proposal. He said some of the governors were concerned
that resources being used to make the air healthier would be
``misallocated'' to improve visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are a lot of visibility benefits to what
we're doing now,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One apparent reason for regulators' allowing so many years for
improvement is that the visibility problem is partly one of
aesthetics, not public health.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent draft of the new regulations, EPA officials
determined that ``visibility impairment caused by air pollution
occurs virtually all the time'' at most national parks. In some
places, the draft says, pollution has reduced visibility by half or
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Like many air quality regulations, the proposed haze protocols
bring a new focus to an old problem _ the older fossil-fuel power
plants, which have been excluded from the strictest controls of the
1977 Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrated in the East, they produce as much as 75 percent of
the sulfur dioxide emissions that are polluting parks and
wilderness areas, some environmentalists say. Forcing them to meet
modern emission standards or shutting them down, they say, would go
a long way toward cleaning out the parks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations are expected to require states to
identify the main sources of pollution and either force companies
to modernize their plants to reduce emissions or, in an approach
that has been used to help control smog and acid rain, to buy and
sell pollution credits in a trading arrangement that would reduce a
region's overall pollution as efficiently as possible.

ANALYSIS: AFTER VOTE IN ALGERIA, NEW DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria _ When Algeria's presidential campaign began
last month, the talk among optimists was of setting a new standard
for the Muslim world by installing a leader recognized by the 30
million Algerians as the people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The vision was offered more in hope than belief, given three
decades of military rule here and the brutal conflict with Islamic
militant groups in recent years that has killed tens of thousands
of people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, six candidates withdrew at the last minute before the
election Thursday over accusations of fraud. Algeria got its
elected civilian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a 62-year-old
former foreign minister. But the circumstances of his victory
persuaded many Algerians that they remained in the grip of the
generals and bureaucrats who have ruled the country since a
military coup in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bouteflika won nearly 74 percent of the vote, with a
turnout of slightly more than 60 percent among an electorate
estimated at 17.5 million. Bouteflika declared himself the
``consensus president'' and prepared to take office later this
month. Meanwhile, street protests in central Algiers right after
the result was announced indicated at least some people disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Placards reading ``No to dictatorship!'' were waved before
policemen in riot gear broke up the crowd with truncheons. On
Saturday, news vendors quickly sold out of independent newspapers
that have urged an end to military rule, most suggesting that
Bouteflika's election was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page commentary in El Watan, one of the most widely read
newspapers, implied that little else could have been expected.
Bouteflika, it noted, once served as right-hand man to Houari
Boumedienne, the army colonel who in 1965 overthrew Algeria's first
civilian president, Ahmed Ben Bella.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the regime installed in 1965 by Boumedienne's coup
d'etat, in which Bouteflika played a part, did not want to take the
risk of an open and transparent election,'' the commentary said.
``Democracy and open competition for power will have to wait for
better days.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Bouteflika repeatedly denied that he was the
army's man, despite the fact that he was backed by two political
parties that have been the army's political vehicles, and appeared
to have campaign funds out of proportion to his modest declaration
of personal wealth. Still, independent newspapers reckoned he was
virtually assured of victory, especially with his main opponents
dividing the reformist vote among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the surprise lay in the size of the turnout,
reported to be about double what most foreign reporters and
diplomats expected after visiting polling stations in Algiers. ``If
the turnout was more than 30 percent, I'll eat my hat,'' one
Western envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika himself said on the eve of the vote that he needed a
large turnout _ he mentioned 60 percent _ in order to achieve
``popular legitimacy.'' After the withdrawal of the other
candidates, there was speculation that he might decline the
victory. But in the end he dismissed the claims of election rigging
as sour grapes by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Algerians were left to ponder the kind of president Bouteflika
will be. As a candidate, he avoided controversial subjects like the
army's political role. In the campaign, he lauded the military's
role in ``protecting'' the nation against Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   When a Western reporter pressed him during an interview last
week to say whether he would push the generals out of politics, he
became angry, saying he would not tolerate insults to the military.
When another reporter asked if it was time for the army to
surrender political power, he replied, ``Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Without full control of the army, few Algerians believe that
Bouteflika will gain the flexibility he needs to tackle the
country's problems, which include a stagnant economy and a way to
establish a ``reconciliation'' between those who want a secular
future for Algeria and groups that seek Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Although less active now than they were only 18 months ago, when
whole villages were being massacred only 20 miles from Algiers, the
Islamic rebels remain a major threat. Their brutality has
apparently alienated many of the people who voted for the main
Islamic group, the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front, in an
election in 1991 that the army canceled, setting off the
bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that political inertia will play into the
rebels' hands, especially if it delays economic reforms needed to
halt widespread unemployment that has left tens of thousands of
young Algerians without jobs. The country's real political future
may rest not so much with Bouteflika as with the 70 percent of
Algerians who are under 30: It is their problems the new president
will have to resolve if Algeria is to find a lasting peace.

 SPORTS COLUMN: CADE McNOWN, THE RUNT WHO WOULD BE FAVRE  
(jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cade McNown is the runt of the litter. Not that strong an arm.
Not that tall. Not that quick. At least according to most scouting
reports. That's why this 22-year-old left-hander was the fifth
quarterback selected in Saturday's National Football League draft,
behind Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb, Akili Smith and Daunte Culpepper.
The Bears took McNown with the 12th selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of scouts miss the forest for the trees,'' McNown
was saying. ``They worry about a guy having one more mile per hour
on his arm, or about one guy running the 40 in 4.6, another guy in
4.57. But one scout told me I had a stronger arm than two of the
guys who are here.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown didn't identify those two quarterbacks, but by ``here,''
he meant two of the four higher-rated quarterbacks waiting with him
backstage in the Theater at Madison Square Garden for their names
and teams to be announced by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue shortly
after the draft began. McNown assumed he would be the last of the
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ultimately,'' he said, ``you're going to be judged on
production. Accurate passes. Moving the team. Winning games.
Winning championships.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's production at UCLA was impressive. He led the Bruins to
a 10-2 record and the Rose Bowl last season; they scored at least
40 points in seven games. Over his Pac-10 career, his 11,285 yards
of total offense ranked first, his 10,708 passing yards ranked
second and his 68 touchdown passes ranked third.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if he were really a runt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Im 6 feet 7/8 of an inch, so I say I'm 6-1,'' he said. ``I
weigh between 210 and 215.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Couch is 6-4 and 227, McNabb 6-2 and 226, Smith 6-2
and 221 and Culpepper 6-4 and 252.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McNown cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be 4 feet 3 inches; then I could throw under the
pass rushers,'' he joked. ``Hey, I wouldn't change my height for
anything. Most great quarterbacks, there's something quirky about
them. I'm just looking forward to the challenge. It's the next
step.''
</P>
<P>
   As a left-handed passer, McNown has created comparisons to Steve
Young and Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young runs the same offense with the 49ers that I ran at
UCLA,'' McNown said, ``but he may do things way different. I was a
big Joe Montana fan. And I've gotten to know Troy Aikman pretty
well.''
</P>
<P>
   When he smiles, McNown has that same mischief in his eyes that
Brett Favre does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way Favre plays,'' he said of the Packers' All-Pro.
``If a linebacker is coming, he'll try to run over him. He likes to
get his nose into it. I do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What McNown is saying is that, at heart, Favre is a football
player, not just a quarterback, and so is he.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis in February, not
many quarterbacks were willing to be timed in the 40-yard dash.
McNown ran for the stopwatches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my nature,'' he said. ``I love to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, he competed at almost every position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was big in the fifth grade, so they put me at offensive
guard and defensive lineman,'' he recalled. ``Then I went to being
a linebacker and a fullback, then a running back and an outside
linebacker, then a quarterback and a free safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to create a family crest as a sixth grader in Hollister,
Calif., the red-haired McNown drew a cross with a football and a
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents divorced, he moved with his mother to West
Linn, Ore., to be near his older brother, Jeff Jr. During his only
year at West Linn High, he was both a quarterback and a free safety
before enrolling at UCLA, where he was a history major.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ancient language,'' he has said with a wink, ``McNown
meant football.''
</P>
<P>
   And as soon as he arrives at training camp, McNown will mean
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is ahead of me, I'll just keep pushing,'' he said
firmly but quietly. ``When I get the opportunity, I'll make that
guy a Wally Pipp.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows baseball history, too. Wally Pipp was the Yankee first
baseman who never got his job back after Lou Gehrig was installed.
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown also won't be afraid to speak up in an NFL huddle,
even as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   After Terry Donohue resigned as the UCLA coach after the 1995
season, the Bruins' hierarchy sought Gary Barnett, then at
Northwestern, and Rick Neuheisel, then at Colorado, but both
spurned the job.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, then 18, told Pete Dalis, the UCLA athletic director,
that Bob Toledo, then the offensive coordinator, deserved the job.
Toledo got it.
</P>
<P>
   And when Cade McNown, the runt of the quarterback litter, was
asked before the draft to assess his NFL potential as if he were an
NFL scout, he spoke up, quickly and defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `Get him.''' he said.

</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lynn Jennings' memory plays tricks.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers back to 1975, when she was in the ninth grade and
watched on television as Bill Rodgers stopped twice to tie his
shoelaces and still won the Boston Marathon. But she says she
remembers little about 1978 when, as a 17-year-old high school
senior, she ran her first Boston Marathon _ unofficially, because
no one under 18 was supposed to run _ and was the third woman to
cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, running officially, she has become one of the
world's premier distance runners. In 1990, 1991 and 1992, she won
three consecutive world cross-country championships. In 1992, she
won an Olympic bronze medal at 10,000 meters. She has won 39 U.S.
championships and holds six American records.
</P>
<P>
   But she has never officially run a marathon. That will change
Monday when, at 38, the pride of Newmarket, N.H., will run in the
103rd annual Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, who has won the women's race here the
last two years in 2 minutes 26 minutes 33 seconds and then 2:23:21,
is favored again. Her rivals include Franca Fiacconi of Italy, who
won last year's New York City Marathon; Colleen De Reuck of South
Africa, Anuta Catuna of Romania and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings seems likely to run in the 2:20s. She says only that
she wants to run 2:42, the automatic qualifying time for next
year's U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my publicly stated goal,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   And her private goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's private,'' she said. ``Besides, John and I haven't had
our summit meeting yet. We will on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   John Babbington has been her coach much of the time since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lawyer,'' she said. ``He went to Harvard. I went to
Princeton. These are long, detailed sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings has not always listened. In 1978, she wanted to run in
this most hallowed of all marathons. Babbington said she was too
young, and besides, the minimum age was 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I ran,'' she said, ``because John told me not to. It was
typical 17-year-old rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Barron, who was 30, won in 2:44:52. Jennings finished
third in about 2:46 _ she received no official time _ but don't ask
her about that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember nothing,'' she said. ``I have complete amnesia.
There's no psychological insight or Freudian reason. I just can't
recall. I've run a lot of races in the intervening 21 years. And as
Shakespeare said, `What's past is prologue.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said she did not swear off the marathon after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just got sidetracked by all the other things I could
do running,'' she said. ``The marathon has been lurking in the back
of my mind, but the timing never seemed right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a reason to move up, and I don't now. It would be
a mistake to think I'm no longer a track runner. I've done
everything else, and now I'm going to do something else. I am an
experienced runner, not an experienced marathoner.''
</P>
<P>
   No American woman has won here since Lisa Larsen Weidenbach in
1985, no American man since Greg Meyer in 1983. Jennings says she
feels no pressure because she does not consider herself a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running my own race,'' she said. ``I think I'll be in the
pack. I'm comfortable with the course. I know every inch of it. I
know the towns. I've done all the work necessary. I'm ready to put
that work to use. I would like to have a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Her preparation has been exemplary. She trained nearby during a
relatively mild New England winter. She did nine or 10 20-mile
training runs. On March 31, she finished behind seven men in a
half-marathon in New Bedford, Mass., in the good time of 1:11:41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I would be on a couch prone after a 20-mile
training run,'' she said. ``I wasn't. After the last one, I took my
dog on a four-mile walk.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows the knowledgeable crowd will be cheering for her, but
she is quick to say: ``Boston is an egalitarian town. People here
cheer for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   She was going to run here last year, then backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't injured,'' she said. ``It was not so much my training
as my mental discipline. It was like the difference between reading
and studying. Last year, I was reading. Now I'm cracking the books.
I feel robust, optimistic, eager. It's going to be a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun? Marathon runners seldom use that word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's fun,'' she said. ``I'm at ease. I don't run scared.
I don't get nervous. I'm an emotional runner. I get adrenaline.
I've been in this situation in the world championships and
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, running seems to be as rewarding as ever. Would
she be as happy with life without running?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I can help it,'' she said.

 BY DAN BARRY AND MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For three years now, Police Commissioner Howard Safir
has dutifully taken his place behind Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at news
conferences, his hands folded, his face set in inscrutability. It
is the enduring image of a friendship forged by time shared in
federal service, one in which roles are understood and discretion
is a given.
</P>
<P>
   But now Safir suddenly finds himself front and center _ and
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
African immigrant, in February, his department has been accused of
being insensitive to black and Hispanic residents, sometimes to the
point of brutality. Some of his recent actions have prompted
questions about his judgment and inquiries into his ethics. Then,
last week, the dominant police union cast a vote of no confidence
in his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all _ even as his own job approval ratings plummet
_ Giuliani has steadfastly supported the friend he lured into city
service, a man he described in an interview last week as honest,
straightforward and ``a very regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Howard Safir known to the mayor is not the Howard Safir
revealed to the city. What the public sees, often through the prism
of the press, is a tall, jaw-jutting symbol of federal arrogance, a
man not at peace with microphones and not inclined to provide basic
public information. He is so reserved that some police officers are
unaware of his background as a federal agent and dismiss him as a
former fire commissioner _ in other words, an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   This is not how Safir sees himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive interview on Friday, he talked of his long
career as a federal law enforcement agent who worked on several
high-profile cases. He also defended the professional and personal
decisions he has made and criticized the press for unfair coverage
of him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he as reserved as he often appears. For one thing, he
considered his experiences in law enforcement so exciting that he
once unsuccessfully shopped around a book proposal and even toyed
with plans to help create a fictional television series.
</P>
<P>
   For another, he is a self-confessed ``Parrot Head,'' a member of
the corps of Hawaiian-shirted, margarita-drinking fans of singer
Jimmy Buffett. ``I have every single one of his albums,'' he said.
``I know the words to every song. And in fact, when I go to the
concerts I sing every one of his songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir, 57, who grew up in the Bronx, argued that his public
persona belies his private, good-humored self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I unfortunately am stuck with a face that has a down-turned
mouth,'' he said. ``When my face is not animated _ when I'm just
sitting somewhere _ I look like I'm mad. But I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   The job, by nature, does not lend itself to humor. ``In a way,
it's very difficult to project when you're talking about homicides,
rapes, explosions. It's very difficult for that image to come
across,'' Safir said. ``I was just talking to a friend of mine who
said: `How come they don't really know who you are?'''
</P>
<P>
   Before choosing to stand in the shadow of Giuliani, Safir had
already lived a life of adventure, intrigue and some acclaim. After
working as an undercover agent for the federal agency that would
become the Drug Enforcement Administration, he moved on to the U.S.
Marshals Service, where he made a name for himself tracking down
fugitives and reviving the service's troubled witness-protection
program.
</P>
<P>
   Among his cases was Christopher John Boyce, the ``falcon'' of
``The Falcon and the Snowman'' fame, a convicted Soviet spy who had
escaped from a federal prison in Lompoc, Calif. After a lengthy
investigation, Safir recalled, Boyce was captured in Washington
state as he was about to board a private plane bound for the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher Boyce was the spy who cost the United States the
most money in history,'' Safir said. ``He gave the Russians all of
the codes to our spy satellites, which meant that all of our spy
satellites had to be retooled, which cost billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, Safir's successes and administrative
abilities had caught the attention of Giuliani, who was also then
in Washington, as the third-highest-ranking official in the Justice
Department. ``The Marshals Service had changed from being a
semi-political operation to a very, very excellent law enforcement
organization,'' the mayor recalled. ``Much of that was due to
Howard's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship was strong enough by 1984 that Safir called
on Giuliani to testify on his behalf in a lawsuit in which he had
accused Geraldo Rivera of slandering him in a television report
about the witness-protection program. That lawsuit was later
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani returned to New York to become the U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District, he and Safir continued to work together,
further strengthening their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, however, both men had left the federal
government. Giuliani was planning a second run for mayor, while
Safir was overseeing a private security business that until
recently was run by his wife, Carol, and his son, Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Public records show that he and his wife, who is a real estate
agent and investor, own 10 pieces of property with a combined worth
of between $500,000 and $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Safir was also trying to sell his story, and one such attempt
resulted in a lawsuit. Dan E. Moldea, a freelance writer, was
awarded $17,500 in 1995 after accusing Safir of hiring him to work
on a book without revealing that he already had unsuccessfully
sought a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A book proposal in the court files opens with a dramatic,
first-person account of one of Safir's adventures: an episode in
which he is inside a church crowded with dignitaries that has just
received a bomb threat. It reads, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a small bead of sweat begin to form on my forehead as I
whispered to Mickey, `Have you swept the place?' He replied: `Dogs
and a complete physical search.' I looked at him and said, `That's
why I get the big bucks, we'll sweat it out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Safir joined the Giuliani administration in 1994 as fire
commissioner. In 1996, when the mayor forced the resignation of
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, known almost as much for
his love of the limelight as for his successful innovations in
fighting crime, he selected Safir to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main reasons I selected him was that I knew he had
this ability to have tremendous command and organization of
facts,'' the mayor said, ``of how to analyze problems and to come
up with solutions, and to make good personnel choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, Safir generally presented himself as
the un-Bratton _ tight-lipped, often hostile to the press, not one
to take Bratton's place at late-night sessions at Elaine's.
Although he was often portrayed as Giuliani's marionette,
administration officials say that Safir feels comfortable enough to
challenge the mayor on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard is not afraid to tell the mayor what he thinks and to
disagree with him,'' said Peter Powers, a former deputy mayor. ``He
follows the rule that most people follow: You disagree in private,
you don't disagree in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani agreed. ``It's a professional relationship, but it's
also a personal relationship,'' he said. ``Howard disagrees with me
fairly often enough, and has, at times, been able to talk me out of
things that he thought were the wrong approach.''
</P>
<P>
   During his three-year tenure, Safir has frequently been
dismissed as a caretaker for crime-reducing policies instituted by
Bratton and has drawn criticism for several administrative miscues,
including a proposal to have a New York City Police Department
presence in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir maintained that he would be remembered for a number of
programs: the city's expanded anti-drug initiatives, the
installation of security cameras in city housing projects and his
call for taking DNA samples from everyone who is arrested. Most
important, the crime rate has fallen even more sharply under Safir
than it did under Bratton.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the strong Giuliani-Safir relationship is being
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting death of Diallo, who was black, by four white
police officers renewed charges that police officers mistreat black
and Hispanic residents in ways ranging from discourtesy to civil
rights violations to brutality. It also aimed the spotlight on
Safir because the officers belonged to the Street Crime Unit, an
aggressive squad whose success in making gun arrests had led the
commissioner to triple its size and, some say, dilute its
precision.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the case snowballed, as protesters rallied
outside Police Headquarters, the four officers were indicted on
murder charges and federal and state officials began investigations
into Police Department practices. The mayor and Safir at first
resisted calls for reform, but in recent weeks have met with
community groups and have begun to announce a series of modest
changes in police policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight on Safir has lingered. In the midst of the
outcry over the Diallo shooting, he and his wife flew to Los
Angeles for the Academy Awards on a private jet as guests of a
corporate executive whom the commissioner describes as a friend.
Images of Safir at the ceremony, in a tuxedo and mingling with
celebrities, caught some City Council members by surprise: They had
been told he would probably miss a hearing on the Diallo case the
next morning because of a ``scheduling conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   With news of his California trip causing a stir in New York,
Safir caught a red-eye flight back to the city in time to attend
the hearing. It did not help matters that the Giuliani
administration had criticized his predecessor, Bratton, for
accepting similar trips. Safir's trip has sparked two ethics
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Then came news that Safir had dispatched two detectives to the
home of a Queens woman who had given a false name after her car
rear-ended one being driven by his wife. The accident came to light
after a lawsuit naming the Safirs as plaintiffs was filed in
Manhattan Supreme Court; it alleged that the Queens woman was
intoxicated and that Safir had lost the ``consortium'' of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, reports surfaced that eight police detectives had been
assigned to the January wedding of the police commissioner's
daughter, an FBI agent, and had assisted in chauffeuring guests.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocate Mark Green has called for Safir's resignation,
and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, in a no-confidence
vote, has demanded his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said that the criticism is a result of a
``pile-on'' attack by a press in mid-frenzy. ``Are there times when
I would do something differently, or when he would do something
differently? Of course,'' the mayor said. ``But I think he has
excellent judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the police commissioner defiantly defended his
handling of the car accident and the wedding as appropriate, even
necessary, for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my wife had this accident, a woman ran into the back of
her car and lied'' about her name, he said. ``Anybody in law
enforcement knows that this is a great technique for finding out
people's addresses, for finding out who people are. When we found
out that this woman lied, I wanted to find out who she was, to see
if she was a threat to me or my family. And once we found out who
she was, that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also insisted that the lawsuit in his name was filed without
his knowledge and he has since fired the lawyer. While the matter
of loss of consortium was raised in the lawsuit, he called the
press' coverage of that detail a ``cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his night at the Oscars, Safir shared some remorse _ but
not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, would I go to the Oscars?'' he said. ``Probably
not, but only because, in hindsight, I know what the media has made
of it. But do I believe that I did something improper in going to
the Oscars? I don't believe I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to be contrite and say, `I did something
terrible,' '' he added. ``I don't believe I did.''

WHERE SILVER TINKLES NO MORE, PHONE HAS YET TO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVERTON, Wash., _ At the turn of the last century, this
mountain town had 300 residents, six hotels, five saloons, four
general stores, a newspaper, its own band and a small local phone
company. But as the ``Bonanza Queen'' and other mining claims
became unprofitable, the town lost most of those amenities,
including phones.
</P>
<P>
   Now Silverton is year-round home to about 20 people, some
defectors from the city, others who have lived in the area for
decades. They enjoy waking up to the solace-giving trills of the
varied thrush and the raucous trash talk of Steller's jays.
</P>
<P>
   But they never wake up to the ringing of a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where technology-based industries are responsible for
more than a third of total employment, no one east of the bridge
over Lake 22 Creek here on the Mountain Loop Highway can get a dial
tone. Silverton residents with cellular phones have to drive 15
miles toward Seattle for the nearest signal. Satellite phones are
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   There are parts of the highway tucked so deeply between the
mountains that even the ambulances lose radio contact and cannot
call for helicopters or other backup, said Vince Henry, a local
fire commissioner and owner of Mountain View Inn, about 11 miles
west of Silverton. The inn's pay phones, the closest ones to
Silverton, are often too jammed with coins to work.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven decades, federal law has called for universal
telephone service, even in places like Silverton, 65 miles
northeast of Seattle, that do not fall in any company's area of
responsibility. In past years, the nearest phone company would have
been required to install lines out to Silverton and could have
recouped the cost by raising service charges in urban areas that
are cheaper to serve.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1994, when phone companies in Washington were
deregulated and their monopolies ended, GTE, the closest of the
main phone companies that could serve Silverton, has had no
incentive to lay phone lines to serve so few new customers. It
would cost $750,000 for GTE to extend its land lines to Silverton,
said a company spokeswoman, Melissa Barran, and residents there
would be charged $19,000 per household to get phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty Silvertonians, including seasonal residents, met recently
with a representative of the Washington Utilities and
Transportation Commission about their concerns, but no easy answer
is in sight. This month, the state Legislature failed to pass a
bill that would have established a fund to provide service to
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shirley, a telecommunications analyst with the commission,
has been trying to find companies to serve Silverton, but in
Washington's $3.67 billion telephone market, no company has the
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are a small number of folks, they're going to be very
high-cost to serve, and they're not likely to spend all day talking
to Australia,'' he said. He estimated that there were 300
households in the state that could not get phone service.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Cellular, a company that provides mobile cell phone
service, had been interested in Silverton's business, until it
recently found that providing service was not feasible, Shirley
said. He plans to talk with several other wireless companies.
</P>
<P>
   In emergencies, Silverton residents rely on a police radio, kept
at Denny and Diane Boyd's house, to reach the sheriff's office. But
if the couple is not home, or if the radio breaks or cannot get a
signal, there is no way to get help short of driving to a ranger
station near the inn.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, mostly in the summer, 125,000 cars drive the Mountain
Loop Highway, a federal scenic byway, to enjoy its many hiking
trails and the fishing and camping along the Stillaguamish River.
Too often, they need the sheriff's radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're gone, everyone else is out of luck,'' Ms. Boyd said.
The Boyds have had to answer their door at all hours, to cold,
frightened or drunken strangers whose cars were not equipped for
mountain roads. One group of bedraggled travelers ended up soaking
their shirts in motor oil and using them as torches to find their
way out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how dark it gets here,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Frampton, 44, who retired to Silverton from a
pharmaceutical company in Seattle, paid cash for his house and now
spends his days volunteering and working in his garden, says he
pays about $200 a month making calls from pay phones and his
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   A few driveways west, Jeffrey and Diane I. Dukes were just
getting back from Seattle. It was Tuesday, their day to check
e-mail. The couple built themselves separate cabins on the
Silverton hillside. (``She keeps hers at 80 degrees,'' Dukes
explained. ``I keep mine at 60.'') At his old office, ``my computer
had its own telephone line,'' he said. He gets by without a phone
now, but his wife misses one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question keeps coming up, when you go to write a check,''
she said: She has to explain to shop clerks that she has no phone
number to write down for them.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes, dressed in plaid pajamas and a hooded green bathrobe,
complained that he lost several thousand dollars when one of his
stocks took a nose dive and he did not know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being off the grid is a selling point for some
people. One nearby house, advertised for sale as a ``Self-Contained
Y2K Retreat,'' offers propane appliances and both bathroom and
outhouse, for $89,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the current residents are not ready to give up their fight
for phone service. ``If Bill Gates wants everyone in the world to
be online, Silverton should at least be able to call 911,'' Boyd
said.

CALENDAR CHANGES MAY AVOID BURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time of year, National Football League general managers
and coaches get to the office at 6 a.m. and leave well after the
sun comes down. And for the coaches, that kind of schedule is
nothing new. Whether it is this weekend's draft, or the scouting
combine, or coaching in the Pro Bowl, five hours of shut-eye is
sleeping in to the average coach. Vacations? What are those?
</P>
<P>
   Never before have pro football coaches had so little downtime, a
situation created by free agency. After the Super Bowl comes the
Pro Bowl in Hawaii, an assignment you would think coaches would
love. But Jets Coach Bill Parcells skipped the Pro Bowl this year,
citing his health. The common perception among coaches was that
Parcells simply did not want to go because he was tired from a long
season.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pro Bowl comes the deadline to designate franchise and
transition players. Then comes the free-agent signing period. Then
the trading period begins, and the scouting combine in Indianapolis
follows. And it is only February.
</P>
<P>
   There are owners' meetings in March, the restricted free-agency
period, the draft in April, more meetings in May. In June, head
coaches start to put together their plans for training camp in
July. After camp comes the season, and then it starts all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches are extremely well paid, with some, like Parcells,
making millions of dollars a year. So no one should cry for them.
But it is has become clear to members of the league's competition
committee that a break must be built into the system, or the league
will lose coaches to burnout. Last year, Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson
almost quit, citing the pressures of the game and how it had taken
over his life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many so-called old-school coaches, like Johnson,
Parcells, Mike Ditka of New Orleans and Jim Mora of Indianapolis,
have complained in recent years about how coaches no longer have
any chance to have a life. It would not be surprising if those four
_ especially Parcells _ retired from coaching at the end of next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much, much more tough for coaches now than it ever
was,'' Rich McKay, general manager of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
said. ``The off-season is gone. You're constantly on the job. The
pressure to win is constant.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition committee, of which McKay is a member, is
considering making significant changes to the NFL calendar. The
league wants to move the start of free agency from February to
sometime in mid-March, McKay said. The idea is to make February a
down month, so coaches can take vacations and spend more time with
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has already spoken to the players' union about the
proposed changes, and there is agreement. The change could be
implemented in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   McKay was asked if he would ever coach. ``I might try it
someday,'' he said, ``but under the conditions that coaches work
now, I don't know how long I would last.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Drafts Well
</P>
<P>
   A number of teams have drafted extremely well during the '90s,
the Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers among them. But the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers has arguably drafted as well as any of them,
thanks to Rich McKay, one of the more talented _ and underrated _
general managers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   McKay was officially named general manager of the Buccaneers in
1994, but had really been doing the job beginning one year earlier.
Under McKay, who has emerged as one of the best talent evaluators
in football, the team has gone from the Yuccaneers to one of the
top franchises in the league.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 Pro Bowl, the Buccaneers were the only team
represented by at least one player from each of their drafts from
1993 to 1997: safety John Lynch (1993), quarterback Trent Dilfer
(1994), linebacker Derrick Brooks and defensive lineman Warren Sapp
(1995), fullback Mike Alstott (1996) and running back Warrick Dunn
(1997). In the 1996 draft, the Buccaneers got four starters:
Alstott, cornerback Donnie Abraham, tackle Jason Odom and defensive
end Regan Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 25 players drafted by McKay since 1993 are still on the
roster. That's a pretty good track record.
</P>
<P>
   McKay knew when he took the job that changes had to be made in
the way Tampa Bay drafted. So the first thing McKay did was sit
down with Buccaneer scouts and others to ask what they thought was
wrong. ``The feelings were pretty unanimous about what we needed to
fix,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   McKay felt that the organization was putting too much emphasis
on potential and not enough on what a player did on the field. In
other words, McKay wanted to pay less attention to stopwatches and
shuttle runs in postseason workouts, and more to performance in
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had to dip that much into free agency because
we've drafted well, and that has helped the franchise,'' McKay
said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a very chilly start with pockets of early morning frost,
abundant sunshine will cover the southeastern states on Sunday as
high pressure builds across the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the potency
of the midspring sun, afternoon temperatures will average 5 to 10
degrees cooler than normal across the region with daytime readings
generally in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, residual moisture trailing a cold front will
bring clouds and scattered showers to extreme southern Florida on
Sunday morning. Drier breezes from the northwest, however, will
promote clearing skies over northern and central sections of the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Stubborn low, gray clouds will obscure the sun throughout the
Great Lakes and portions of the interior Northeast. Most of the day
will be dry, though spotty light showers will occur at times,
especially over southern Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, the air will likely be sufficiently cool to
produce a few flurries over the Green and White mountains of New
England. Winds from the northwest drying on descent from the
Appalachians will cause clouds to crumble east of the mountains,
where intervals of sunshine and milder conditions will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will rule the western states on Sunday as a large
high-pressure system persists. Patchy clouds, however, will cover
the sky at times across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies.
Meanwhile, abundant sunshine will promote record warmth in parts of
Southern California and deserts of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frost Above Freezing
</P>
<P>
   Frost can cover the ground when the official temperature is
above 32 degrees. Early Saturday, a late frost was noted in
portions of Texas and the interior Southeast as the mercury hovered
above freezing. Official thermometers are placed 5 feet above the
ground. On a clear, calm night, the air at the ground cools rapidly
as it loses heat to space. As the night goes on, the layer of cold
air gets deeper, but the coldest and densest air hugs the ground.
The difference between the ground temperature and the official
temperature can be more than 5 degrees.

BLEAK FORECAST FOR A MATCHING FUND 
NATIONAL PARTY RULES? FORGET ABOUT THEM 
REPUBLICANS DECIDE TO IGNORE DAVID DUKE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., La.)   (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More bad news from the tax man for those who would be president.
</P>
<P>
   The federal fund that matches cash raised by candidates running
in primaries and caucuses _ dollar for dollar per contributor, up
to $250 _ is running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The problem?
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as citizen dissatisfaction with the political
system has spread, fewer and fewer taxpayers have been checking the
box on the tax form that authorizes the IRS to shift $3 of their
tax payments to the matching-funds pool. Making things worse, at
the same time that the checkoff rate has been falling, to 10
percent this year from almost 30 percent in 1976, the demand for
matching money has been steadily growing as candidates have been
forced to raise ever more cash to meet the ever-escalating cost of
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Come Election 2000, the demand for matching funds could be the
greatest ever, given that more than a dozen people are talking
about running.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials of the Federal Election Commission, which
administers the matching money, when the initial requests for
Election 2000 come in next Jan. 1, they are likely to total $65
million or more unless the current field of hopefuls shrinks. But
at that point, the commission projects, there will be no more than
$20 million in the pot. And on top of that, the commission projects
that candidates will file for $35 million more in matching cash
before the primary and caucus season ends.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The checkoff will produce more than $20 million this year for
distribution in Election 2000. In fact, the take may be as much as
$70 million. But at least $50 million of that must be set aside up
front to help finance national nominating conventions and the fall
race that follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll have left _ the $20 million _ will be all that
candidates get initially for the primaries and caucuses,'' said Ian
Stirton, a commission spokesman. ``They'll still be entitled to the
full $65 million that they've requested, but we'll just have to
make it up with late payments drawn from tax checkoffs in later
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The late payments may be but a small inconvenience for
candidates able to raise a lot of money on their own, like Vice
President Al Gore, currently the leading Democrat, and Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, currently the leading Republican. But most other
candidates will probably be left scrambling at a time when they
need every possible dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Election 2000 primary and caucus schedule is the most
``front-loaded'' ever, with the most important contests scheduled
in February and early March.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates will most likely take out loans, putting their
government IOU up as collateral. But there will be plenty of
interest to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels in South Carolina
</P>
<P>
   The way Democratic leaders in South Carolina figured it, the
Republicans, already on a roll in the state, would get a free
publicity ride if they were the only party on the presidential
primary ballot next Feb. 26. So when the state Democratic executive
committee met on Tuesday, it voted unanimously to hold the South
Carolina Democratic primary on that date, too.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody pointed out that under rules set by the Democratic
National Committee, all state parties, with the traditional
exception of New Hampshire and Iowa, are forbidden to hold either a
presidential primary or caucus before the first Tuesday in March.
But the South Carolinians decided to ignore that prohibition on the
ground that their struggling party needs all the help it can get.
Besides, it was argued, everybody else seems to be joining the rush
to the front end of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go our own way,'' said Dick Harpootlian, the
party's outspoken chairman, adding that in his judgment the
national party had almost totally ignored the needs and problems of
South Carolina Democrats in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC is not ignoring Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   It has sent word to Harpootlian that if the primary is not reset
to conform with national party rules, 25 percent of the state's
delegates to the national convention will not be seated, including
Harpootlian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Party rules are very clear,'' Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for
the national committee, said on Thursday. ``We're intent on having
a balanced primary and caucus schedule. But we're also willing to
work with them, to compromise. Perhaps they could make the Feb. 26
vote nothing but a beauty contest and then reschedule an event,
within our rules, at which they would actually take an official
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian seems little interested in a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being disconnected from the national party isn't all that
bad,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Duke It Out
</P>
<P>
   Ever since former Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana's 1st
Congressional District resigned, opening the way for a special
election on May 1 to choose a successor, there has been little
doubt that the winner almost certainly will be a Republican, like
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   But which Republican?
</P>
<P>
   There are seven running, among them David Treen, a former
governor and member of Congress; Monica Monica, a wealthy eye
doctor with an eye-catching name; and David Vitter, a state
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is David Duke, a former state representative but more
famously _ some would say infamously _ a former Ku Klux Klan
leader.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Republican leaders in Louisiana, and also in
Washington, have worried that in a contest crowded with nine
candidates (there are also two Democrats running), no candidate
would emerge as a clean winner, with more than 50 percent of the
vote. That would mean a runoff, and Republican leaders fear that
given the particular kind of appeal that Duke has in a Deep South
district, he just might make that runoff.
</P>
<P>
   After that, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than face that question, Republican leaders, especially
those running the National Republican Congressional Committee, have
been exploring the idea of abandoning the party's usual policy of
remaining neutral in contests involving more than one Republican.
They commissioned a poll to determine who might be the best bet,
who might head off Duke by winning outright on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The precise results of the poll have not been made public. But
Rep. Jim McCrery of Shreveport, a committee member, said Treen, Ms.
Monica and Vitter all ran well, especially Treen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's moot,'' McCrery added, ``because David Duke ran
even worse than the Democrats. We'd do better to worry about them.
We don't have to get into this. Duke's not a player. Let the field
fight it out and go on to a runoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's response?
</P>
<P>
   His polls have him on top.

EDITORIAL: THE GREAT GRETZKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 18:
</P>
<P>
   Just as the name Michael Jordan registered with those who pay no
attention to basketball, so Wayne Gretzky infiltrated the
consciousness of a much larger group of Americans who care little
for professional hockey. Athletes cannot do that unless they are
transcendently good. Gretzky was that good, over a 21-year career
that began in Edmonton, Alberta, and will end with one last
appearance in a New York Rangers uniform at Madison Square Garden
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell only part of the story. He holds the record for
points scored with 2,856, including an astounding 1,962 assists, a
testament to his uncanny ability to find the open man and make the
perfect pass. He was voted hockey's most valuable player nine times
and led the Edmonton Oilers to four Stanley Cups. Traded to Los
Angeles in 1988, he is seen as a kind of Johnny Appleseed of the
sport, spreading what was essentially a Canadian game to America's
Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   But what truly set Gretzky apart from most hockey players was
his awareness. In a game known for strength and speed, Gretzky was
neither strong nor particularly fast. He was small and slender _
floating, as Jordan did, almost above the game, knowing at any
given moment where the puck and the players were on the swirling
ice around him and sensing, intuitively, where they would be a
moment hence. Most hockey fans go to hockey games to root for their
home team, and a few go to watch the fights. But some went just to
watch Gretzky, who played a game all his own.

 &HT;    Riley: Wilkens' record is secure
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pat Riley, 54, said catching up to 61-year-old Lenny
Wilkens' all-time record for coaching victories ``is not a goal. If
I decide to coach another 10 years, I guarantee you Lenny Wilkens
will still be coaching. I see him winning 50 games a year for the
next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't catch him,'' Riley said after winning his 939th last
week. ``I will probably retire before he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley's winning percentage (.700) is second among coaches who
worked at least 400 games behind Phil Jackson's .738. The Heat
coach has moved into third place on the all-time victory list,
trailing only Bill Fitch (944) and Wilkens (1,144) through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only joy I take in that is I never thought this would
happen to me,'' Riley said. ``I was hired as an interim coach, and
I thought it would be short-lived. I never thought I would be more
than four or five years in it, and here I am 17 years later. Being
in the company of guys I really admire _ (Jack) Ramsay, Fitch,
(Dick) Motta, (Red) Auerbach. It's great company to be in, and I'm
flattered I could stay around this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks' hefty payroll
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York Times, the Knicks' $68.6 million
payroll is the highest by far in the NBA, with Portland second at
$53 million and Indiana next at $51 million. Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts denied there were problems between club
president Ernie Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van Gundy, but it's clear
the payroll will weigh heavily in the evaluation of Grunfeld after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what we've invested, the results have been
disappointing,'' Checketts said. ``When the Knicks were in the NBA
Finals, we were at $26 million on our payroll. So, yes, we've spent
a lot. I understand that. It hasn't worked out, and the
responsibility comes back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers getting serious
</P>
<P>
   They've eliminated the theatrics in Indiana, vowing it's time
for business.
</P>
<P>
   That dance routine the Pacers do at introductions is history.
Mark Pope's ritual encouraging offbeat talks to the team are over.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame huddles are limited to pertinent matters only, with
everybody on court exactly 18 minutes before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson says, ``We pretty much took away our privilege of
doing things with flair. That has nothing to do with winning or
losing, but that's something that was a privilege because we were
an elite team. We've gotten away from playing like that, so until
we show we're there again, we've put it on ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland cautions Marbury
</P>
<P>
   Rod Strickland, a former Knicks point guard, didn't disagree
when Stephon Marbury said the Knicks will never win with Chris
Childs and Charlie Ward on point. But the Wizards' Strickland
warned Marbury that it might not be wise to disrespect other NBA
players that way. ``Young guys speak their mind, but we're men
first,'' Strickland said. ``I respect everybody in this league. I
respect the fact that they got in this league. You have to be good
to be here. But for me, it's an issue of how we relate to each
other, man to man.

 &HT;    Marbury the Mouth
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It apparently wasn't enough for Stephon Marbury to
force a trade from a franchise on the rise and later claim ``it
wasn't God's will.'' Neither was it enough that he called Minnesota
coach Flip Saunders to tell him he wanted to go back to the
Timberwolves from New Jersey. Nor was it enough that he admitted he
couldn't play on the same team with friend Kevin Garnett because
Garnett's contract is worth $50 million more. No, Marbury has more
mouthing to do.
</P>
<P>
   He chose moments after his team was trashed by New York last
week, when he was held to eight points and committed eight
turnovers against Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, to talk trash
about the Knicks guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still need a point guard,'' Marbury said. ``They'll never
win no championship with them two guys. They'll never, ever win.
You can put that on your back page if you want to. It's just not
gonna happen. They're just not the guys you need to win a
championship. They might not even make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Childs appropriately responded: ``Until you win a
championship, and prove you're playing the game for love and not
for money, you shouldn't be making comments like that. The person
who is defeated should admit it and go on. The guy is a talented
player, but when you speak like that, you should go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Marbury's Nets went to pathetic Denver and
were crushed by 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK OUT, DIKEMBE
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs will have revenge on his mind when he returns in 10
days with the Knicks to face the Hawks. Dikembe Mutombo knocked out
a tooth, cutting Childs' mouth with an elbow nine days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see next time we play him,'' Childs said. ``Hopefully,
it's not a game we need to get into the playoffs, because I'm gonna
get him back. I might not be able to reach him in his mouth, but
I'm gonna get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH'S ENOUGH, BOO BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' Antoine Walker was 3-for-12 in a loss to the Hawks
on Wednesday, and he got booed for every false move. The Boston
fans have put so much energy in belittling their own player that
they hardly provide a home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans have got to cut Antoine a break,'' coach Rick Pitino
said. ``He's played terrific basketball the last three weeks, and
every time they start booing, he starts pressing. He missed a shot
from the free-throw line and they were all over him. It's totally
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Walker: ``I guess I'm not a person or a player the fans
want. I enjoy playing here, but for it to continue throughout the
season, I guess it's not going to get any better. I don't know what
to do at this point. I guess I'm not playing to their standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If our fans could give it to the opposing team
rather than us, maybe things would change. Last year, this was a
tough place for opposing teams to play. This year, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan scored more than 49 points all by himself 37
times in his career. He scored 60 or more five times, 40 or more
197 times. So, he was bound to have much to say to his old Chicago
teammates, who scored just 49 points against Miami recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Harper wanted to wait on that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't check my message, but I ain't calling Michael,'' said
Harper, a friend of the retired legend. ''Maybe I will this week,
but not yet. I can just imagine him using one of his favorite
quotes: `Forty nine points? I could do that all by myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Utah's Karl Malone. His style may be annoying and borderline
dirty, and his arrogance and quickness to shoot off the mouth are
annoying. But the Wailman has been great in pulling the Jazz past
Portland for the best record in the league. He continues to play as
he has for the last five years _ hard, tough and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Dennis Rodman. Can one player be so destructive to a team?
It's likely not. Los Angeles brought him in for stability and all
he did was tear the team down. Here's to the Lakers for dumping
him.

 &HT;    U.S. coaching snub still rankles Sloan
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After holding his tongue for months, Jerry Sloan
finally admitted his disappointment over not being named U.S. coach
for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is: What did I do wrong? I'm a competitive person.
I don't mind criticism. Did I do something wrong? I'd like to know.
I thought I did it right,'' said Sloan, who worked as Lenny
Wilkens' top assistant in 1996. Sloan believed he was next in line
after Wilkens went from top assistant to Chuck Daly in 1992 to the
head coaching job four years later. However, USA Basketball gave
the job to Rudy Tomjanovich, who finished third with a collection
of CBA players in the 1998 world championships, which were
boycotted by NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an inconsistency here. Jerry should have been a lock
for that job,'' Jazz president Frank Layden said.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley barks at refs
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley had fun with the referees Monday night after
Houston's victory over Minnesota. ``The officiating was terrible,''
Barkley said. ``We had two blind mice. They let them get in the
game. (The T-Wolves had) seven players on the court at all times
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's explanation: ``It's tax season. The refs are nervous.
... The IRS didn't come to me. They said I don't make enough to
check me.''
</P>
<P>
   The league didn't come to him, either, though Barkley made
similar comments in a postgame TNT interview and the Timberwolves
also complained about referee Jack Nies' crew. The nose-breaker
</P>
<P>
   Spurs forward Malik Rose fractured teammate Will Perdue's nose
in a win over Houston with an inadvertent forearm. Rose also broke
reserve Brandon Williams' nose in training camp. ``Go check Malik's
belt,'' Perdue said after his fourth career fracture. ``I think he
has a couple of notches in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber working out
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are more than happy with Chris Webber. ``His attitude
has been unbelievable,'' Kings vice-president Geoff Petrie said.
``From day one, Chris has been terrific with our coaching staff,
the people in the office, the community, his teammates. He came in
here totally committed to the team, and I think along the way he
was surprised by the talent we have here. Vlade (Divac) is better
than he thought. He loves playing with Jason (Williams).''
</P>
<P>
   Woeful Nellie
</P>
<P>
   Once regarded as an innovator bordering on genius, Don Nelson
has never recovered from his sudden resignation in New York and his
public feud with Webber when both were in Oakland. Now, Nelson is
apologizing for repeated failures in Dallas and vowing to retire as
coach after next season, provided owner Ross Perot Jr. and club
president Terdema Ussery allow him to stay that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take full responsibility for how the team is playing,''
Nelson said, with the Mavericks doomed to their ninth straight
losing season. ``I'm very disappointed with myself for how this
season is ending up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson reiterated that next season, his 22nd as an NBA coach,
will be his last. ``I'm going to retire from coaching for good,''
Nelson said.

 &HT;    Tide quarterback race begins
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Charlie Stubbs put the pictures on his office
wall as a reminder to all who entered: It means something to play
quarterback at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Starr, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler, Steve Sloan, Scott Hunter
and Walter Lewis are but a few of the legends on the wall of the
Crimson Tide quarterbacks coach. Beside the pictures is a solitary
frame surrounding the words: ``Who's Next?''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Crimson Tide fans want to know as Alabama concludes
spring practice today and looks toward the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike DuBose won't call it a quarterback controversy. He
prefers to call it a ``competition'' at a program that hopes to
rejoin college football's elite. Alabama, 7-5 last season, hasn't
won an SEC championship since 1992, when it also won the school's
12th national title. That's a long dry spell for the SEC's most
successful franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the type of competition at each position that we've
got at the quarterback position, then we'll contend again for that
13th national championship,'' DuBose said.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback debate _ Andrew Zow or Tyler Watts _ will be the
thing that keeps the talk shows humming throughout the state during
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Zow, a sophomore from Lake Butler, Fla., is No. 1 for now. As a
redshirt freshman, he was inserted into the fourth game against
Florida when the offense was struggling behind starter J.D.
Phillips. Zow moved the ball against a very good defense, and
Alabama came close to knocking off the Gators before finally losing
16-10. He started the rest of the season and finished with 1,969
yards passing and 11 touchdowns, a school record for a freshman
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Zow would have gotten an opportunity earlier in the 1998 season,
but he never really excelled in practice. Chalk up another lesson
for a young head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned last season that you can't really judge a
quarterback strictly by what he does in practice,'' DuBose said.
``He has to be a guy who can make plays when there are 80,000
people in the seats. Andrew is a guy who proved he could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, DuBose and Stubbs both said last week that
Watts will get significant playing time in the Crimson Tide's first
few games, starting with the opener at Vanderbilt on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really never knew what Andrew could do before we put him in
a game,'' Stubbs said. ``We have to find a way to play Tyler so we
really can get a sense of who's further ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning at Tennessee was one of the few quarterbacks to
have entered college with more fanfare and hype than Watts. A
SuperPrep All-American, Watts threw for 2,485 yards and 20
touchdowns as a senior at Pelham (Ala.) High School. Upon signing
with Alabama, he was hailed by some as the savior of a program that
was trying desperately to move its offense into the modern age.
Some even predicted that Watts would become the starter immediately
and help the Tide compete for the SEC championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Watts never got on the field as a freshman, taking a
redshirt year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now that it was the best thing that could happen to
me,'' said Watts. ``When you first come to a place like Alabama,
you get humbled real quick. Then after a while, people accept you,
and you can just relax and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Zow entered the spring with the attitude that the job was his to
lose. He now has seven starts under his belt in Stubbs'
sophisticated passing offense, and his arm is a little stronger
than Watts'. He accepts the fact that Watts will get some playing
time and welcomes the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyler makes me a better player,'' said Zow, who completed 55.9
percent of his passes last season. ``He's a great competitor, and I
have to raise the level of my play to stay up with him.'' ``There
is no friction between us,'' Watts said. ``We share ideas all the
time. We may be competing, but the ultimate goal is to make the
team better. If we can learn from each other, it helps the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to have that attitude in the spring, before the
games begin. Stubbs wants to make sure the two still work well
together after the fans start fueling the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing you have to do is communicate and let both of
them know everything that's going on,'' Stubbs said. ``Unless it's
something personal, I will always have them both in the room when
the position is being discussed. Even if it's going to bother one
of them, you've got to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coach a tough position,'' Stubbs said. ``You can't run a
happiness camp. We're going to make decisions, and there are times
when we are going to get criticized. It comes with the job.

 &HT;    Gretzky going out on top
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The exit will not be Jordan-esque. If Wayne Gretzky
scores the winning goal in his career finale today, his final NHL
point will be in an otherwise meaningless regular-season game, not
a championship. The New York Rangers aren't the best NHL team. Only
the Islanders enable them to be New York's best.
</P>
<P>
   But the retirements of Gretzky and Michael Jordan do have one
thing in common: Both came at the right time. Jordan had achieved
every conceivable goal and left on top. Gretzky embraced thoughts
of another Stanley Cup, but didn't let his ego cloud the reality
that it wasn't going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in New York was agreeable to Gretzky, but playing for an
organization that broke a promise and changed paths wasn't. The
Rangers signed him as a free agent in 1996 with the understanding
they would do everything possible to win a Cup while he was there.
In his first season, they went to the conference finals. But after
the playoffs, the team let Mark Messier, the team leader and
Gretzky's close friend, sign with Vancouver as a free agent. In
ensuing months, general manager Neil Smith started to rebuild with
youth _ which may seem logical, but it wasn't the program Gretzky
signed on with.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are now an odd mix of inexperienced players and
expensive oldies and will miss the playoffs for the second
consecutive season. There were suggestions, mostly by the Canadian
media, that Gretzky should be traded to Toronto, where he could
close his career with a contending team a mere skip from his
hometown of Brantford, Ontario. But Gretzky didn't want to change
addresses again and give the impression he was leaving the Rangers
merely because he didn't get his way (which happened in Los
Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman would have preferred a more
glorious exit, which is one reason the league was scrambling to
make today's ceremonies special _ a decorated distraction from the
game's lack of ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to this: There will be no farewell tour next season,
something the low-key Gretzky never embraced. But the NHL should do
something to honor a player whom most consider the greatest ever,
something beyond retiring his No. 99 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bettman announced a new trophy to be given to the
goal-scoring champ will be named for Hall of Famer Maurice
``Rocket'' Richard, the NHL's first 50-goal scorer. Hockey has a
history of honoring its heroes. The league should waste no time
creating an honor for Gretzky or renaming a current one _ be it the
Most Valuable Player (Hart Memorial Trophy), scoring (Art Ross
Trophy) or for sportsmanship and career dedication to hockey
(Masterton Memorial Trophy).
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's on-ice accomplishments _ 61 league records, 10 scoring
titles, nine MVPs, two playoff MVPs, four Stanley Cup rings, etc. _
pale in comparison only with what he achieved off of it. If not for
him, hockey would have remained a Northern pastime and Southern
obscurity. He said he never thought of himself as the game's
leading ambassador, but acknowledges, ``I just happen to fall into
that category.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edmonton dealt Gretzky to Los Angeles in 1988, hockey
boomed in the shadow of Hollywood and franchises sprouted in San
Jose and Anaheim, Calif., Phoenix and Dallas, Miami and Tampa,
Fla., Raleigh, N.C., and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers fans can pout about not getting a chance to watch
Gretzky perform next season. Or they can realize that without him
the Thrashers likely wouldn't even exist. ``He is the best thing to
ever happen to hockey,'' Philadelphia general manager Bob Clarke
said. ``There's always going to be those who argue (Gordie) Howe or
(Bobby) Orr (was better). But there's no doubt over who has done
more for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Dafoe, the Boston goalie and a former teammate of
Gretzky's in Los Angeles, said this week by phone, ``I think he's
worthy of some type of award being named after him. He's had one
accomplishment after another. There's Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe. But
Wayne Gretzky has surpassed everybody in bringing hockey to the
point it's at now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that better than Les Jackson. He went from working
for an NHL team in Dallas to one in Atlanta as the Thrashers'
assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's left us with 21 years of highlights,'' Jackson said.
``They should give him whatever he wants. They should name a trophy
after him. Heck, they should name the league after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is not about to make any such suggestions. He only knows
it was time for him to leave. And Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally,'' Gretzky said, ``I thought Jordan should've kept
playing.

 &HT;    Fans heap scorn on Isles owner
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was not a festive atmosphere for the New York
Islanders on Fan Appreciation Night. The Isles were smacked by
Carolina 6-1 in their final home game of the season, leaving them
with the second-worst home record (11-23-7) in franchise history.
Fans not only booed and yelled the usual soft-core obscenities,
they targeted maligned owner Howard Milstein with such choice signs
as ``Milstein: The NFL Wanted You About As Much As We Did.'' The
reference was to Milstein withdrawing his $800 million bid for the
Washington Redskins after it became clear that NFL owners were
going to reject his second attempt to join their fraternity. He
lost out earlier in an attempt to land the Cleveland Browns
franchise. With all of those nine-digit bids, Isles fans wonder why
he can't throw another $10 million into the payroll for players and
a decent coach. Milstein's one-year ownership has been disastrous,
from the time he claimed that Nassau County Coliseum was unsafe
because the scoreboard might fall on the players. NHL Gary Bettman
would have preferred that the NFL accept Milstein's bid for the
Redskins, because it might have expedited his move out of hockey.
While pursuing the Skins, Milstein sold 45 percent of the Isles to
his brother. It is assumed that Milstein eventually will sell; his
father, millionaire Paul Milstein, didn't want his son to buy the
team in the first place. But finding a buyer might not be easy.
Finding a buyer willing to keep the team on Long Island could be
even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Flying low
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the probable loss of Eric Lindros for the
playoffs, Philadelphia will be without Mark Recchi for the start of
the postseason and has an ailing John LeClair. Recchi suffered his
second concussion in three weeks, and it is evident that he came
back prematurely from his first one. A physician also thinks that
Recchi has a degenerative condition in his neck. LeClair has been
undergoing treatment for a bad back but will play. The Flyers' best
hope is that they finish the season the No. 6 seed, pitting them
against somewhat overrated No. 3 Carolina. Lindros, LeClair and
Recchi have combined for 98 goals and 138 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell has been named vice
chairman and assistant general manager for USA Hockey for the
upcoming World Championships and will help select players from the
NHL's nonplayoff teams. . . . Isles general manager Mike Milbury
has had preliminary talks with interim coach Bill Stewart about a
contract extension. But uncertain ownership makes both of their
jobs uncertain. There is speculation that the team might pursue
former Islander Butch Goring, who has been coaching the IHL's Utah
Grizzlies and last year rejected an offer from Anaheim. . . .
Despite projected losses of $20 million, Caps owner Abe Pollin has
cut ticket prices for next season. . . . Buffalo's Joe Juneau
hasn't solved Buffalo's scoring problems. He has netted just one
goal since being acquired from Washington at the trading deadline.

 &HT;    Thrashers: The search begins
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Thrashers' coaching picture is any clearer
today than it was several weeks ago, it's only because of the
number of potential candidates who have been eliminated. General
manager Don Waddell's first coaching hire will not be:
</P>
<P>
   _ Marc Crawford, who got fidgety in a TV booth and leaped into
the ulcer-inducing position of coach of the Vancouver Canucks. They
will finish with their second-worst record in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Larry Robinson, who is expected to lose his job in Los Angeles
and has shown neither the patience nor the motivational abilities
necessary to be a coach of any team _ let alone an expansion club
in search of an identity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacques Lemaire, who despite his denials appears likely to end
up with the general manager job in Montreal and, besides, preaches
a defensive style that, while successful, is in conflict with
Waddell's preference to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even Waddell doesn't know who the Thrashers' coach will be. He
said he probably won't start interviewing until after he returns
from the World Championships, May 1-17 in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But Waddell will begin background checks on potential candidates
as early as this week, perhaps including preliminary telephone
contact. Waddell previously confirmed that former Buffalo coach Ted
Nolan is one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the preliminary list might be Montreal assistant coach
Dave King. King fills Waddell's spoken prerequisite of having head
coaching experience _ three seasons in Calgary that include two
firsts and one second-place finish _ and isn't quite in the retread
category. He was head coach of the 1992 silver medal-winning
Canadian Olympic team and has a reputation for being a good
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said he probably will make preliminary checks on ``nine
or 10 guys'' but have face-to-face interviews with only ``three or
four.'' Even if he started the interviews in mid to late May, that
small a field would give him plenty of time to have a coach in
place before the Thrashers' expansion and amateur drafts, June 25
and 26, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get back from the World Championships, once I start the
interviews I expect things to move very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he has made it clear that he doesn't feel any sense of
urgency with any potential head coach, as evidenced by not
immediately pursuing Crawford before this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say it's wide open,'' Waddell said. ``In my
mind, that's good.''

 &HT;    Lacroix works wonders for Avs
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few NHL general managers were under as much scrutiny
as Colorado's Pierre Lacroix entering the season. Lacroix played a
significant role in the departure of former Stanley Cup-winning
coach Marc Crawford and there were questions about player chemistry
on the team's roster. But the Avalanche will enter the playoffs as
one of the three most likely teams to win the title, with Dallas
and Detroit being the others. The team has played well under Bob
Hartley, Lacroix's no-name replacement for Crawford. Off the ice,
Lacroix has settled the team's two biggest potential personnel
losses, signing would-be free agents Patrick Roy and Peter
Forsberg. Both signed lucrative deals but probably could have
netted more on the open market. Forsberg, only 25 and arguably the
league's best player, acknowledged as much after agreeing to $30
million over three seasons, including a $3.5 million signing bonus.
``Maybe I could've gotten an offer,'' he said, ``but I didn't see
any reason why I should wait until after the season. I wanted to
stay here, and that's what we were working for the entire time.''
With Lacroix earlier extending the deals of Sandis Ozolinsh and
Adam Foote, the Avs' payroll will top $40 million next season. That
doesn't include the recently acquired Theo Fleury, who will test
the market. Lacroix said the team is ``building a relationship''
with Fleury. So far, all of his relationships have gone well.
</P>
<P>
   Reason to howl
</P>
<P>
   Remember that trend of declining suspensions handed out by NHL
police chief Colin Campbell? Scratch that. Campbell dealt out seven
suspensions totaling 15 games and $214,751 in lost salary in the
first two weeks of April. And that was before Dallas' 6-foot-5
Derian Hatcher went airborne to drive an elbow into the jaw of
Phoenix forward Jeremy Roenick. The play got Hatcher suspended for
seven games _ the longest penalty in league history _ but cost the
Coyotes much more. Roenick's jaw was dislocated and fractured in
three places, and he is out for the playoffs. Further, Hatcher
can't use the ``It was an accident'' defense. He had vowed before
the game that the Stars would get retribution for a boarding
penalty by Roenick on Mike Modano that opened a seven-stitch gash
near Modano's eye. The difference is that Modano didn't miss any
games. Coyotes center Keith Tkachuk said, ``We lose a guy who's
been our leading scorer and best centerman all year to a piece of
dung like Hatcher. It was a premeditated incident.'' This was
actually the second time Hatcher ended Roenick's season. His
knee-on-knee check in 1995 also knocked Roenick, then with Chicago,
out for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's most likely downfall in the playoffs will be its power
play. Even before Roenick's injury, the Coyotes' 11.4 success rate
ranked 26th out of 27 teams, and they had scored just three goals
in their last 40 power play attempts. ... San Jose goalie Mike
Vernon wasn't bitter, at least not publicly, about the possibility
that Steve Shields had stolen the starting playoff job from him,
based on Shield's recent 9-0-2 run. ``It's hard to break up
something that's working,'' Vernon said. ``Steve has been
sensational. He's been a big reason why we're successful.

SPENDING DOWNTIME PEDALING IN A 5-DAY RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After three highly successful weeks of racing his
bicycle over the roads of Italy, Belgium and France, George
Hincapie is getting a chance to enjoy what he calls downtime. For a
while, there will be no more battling the wind, rain and
cobblestones, not to mention 180 or so rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie, though, won't be sitting near the sea in Spain, where
he lives during the long season, or watching television at home in
Charlotte, N.C., or even visiting his family in the borough of
Queens, N.Y., where he grew up. By downtime he means a five-day
race in Spain for his U.S. Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be so nice to be in a race where you're not fighting for
position every moment of the day,'' he said in an interview before
the Tour of Aragon began last Wednesday. ``I won't have any
pressure there. If I don't want to go to my limit in a climb, I'll
just go easy; not easy, but find a good group where I'm not killing
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That relatively soft life contrasts with his springtime campaign
in the World Cup of prestigious one-day races, where Hincapie, the
American national champion, posted some of the best results of his
career. He was ninth in Milan-San Remo, 21st in the Tour of
Flanders and fourth in Paris-Roubaix, adding up to 10th place
overall in the World Cup standings.
</P>
<P>
   Competition continues Sunday with the Liege-Bastogne-Liege
classic in Belgium, but Hincapie will skip it, returning to the
circuit in the Amstel Gold Race next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Few riders participate in the Liege race after taking a pounding
the Sunday before on the cobblestones of Paris-Roubaix. In
addition, Hincapie raced on the Wednesday between Flanders, on
April 4, and Paris-Roubaix, finishing fourth in the Ghent-Wevelgem
semiclassic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those World Cup races are so stressful,'' he said. ``People
who are your friends, you don't even talk to them in those races.
Maybe you say hello, but hardly ever in the pack is there talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always battling for position. I mean always. If it's
not a climb coming up, it's windy. The first attacks come early,
and then it's boom, boom, boom, boom. In Spain, the races are hard,
of course, but you always get your downtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning 26 late in June, Hincapie is in his sixth season as a
professional after dominating races as an amateur in the United
States. His progress has been steady and, as he nears a racer's
peak years, he has become more powerful and higher placed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every year I'm getting stronger,'' he agreed. ``Also,
I've been happy with my form the last couple of weeks. I could have
had even better results if a few little things had happened
differently. Like in Milan-San Remo, it was just a matter of
positioning. I had a very strong finish, right after the line I was
third instead of ninth on the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that helps is that the teams have really been
working for me,'' he continued. ``It's nice in the first 100, 150
kilometers when the team is looking out for me. I never had that
before, a rider whose only job is to keep me out of trouble.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In other years he was that rider. Previously Hincapie built to a
peak for the Tour de France in July and the World Cup classics that
follow it, but this year his program was reshaped to emphasize the
spring races.
</P>
<P>
   After the Amstel race, he will return to the United States for a
three-week break, return to Europe for a couple of races and then
start preparing to defend his national championship in Philadelphia
early in June.
</P>
<P>
   That red, white and blue jersey with the white stars means a lot
to Hincapie, who thought he won it in 1997 and then learned he had
been disqualified because of actions by team officials. Last year
he won the jersey and kept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the winter, when I'm just out training, it's so
important for me to be wearing the jersey,'' he said. ``I try to do
well in big races wearing it. I've always wanted to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another jersey he covets is the yellow one that the Tour de
France leader wears. Hincapie came within two seconds of earning
the jersey in the last Tour, but admits that his future is more in
the one-day classics than in three-week stage races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next couple of years he can become one of the best
classics riders,'' said Fred Mengoni, who has sponsored the G.S.
Mengoni racing team in New York City for 25 years and who helped
guide Greg LeMond, Mike McCarthy and Hincapie. ``He's developing
the strength. What he needs now is the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie agreed that confidence was vital and said he was
working on it. ``I definitely gained confidence this spring,'' he
said. ``If you go into a race thinking, `This is not my style, this
is not my thing,' you're already 50 percent less than the other
riders. If you come in, `I think I can win this,' that does a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after his breakthrough spring, he's beginning to think ``I
can win this.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wayne Gretzky probably won't be the only New York
Ranger playing his final home game at Madison Square Garden Sunday
when the regular season concludes against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Mediocre teams that miss the playoffs for two consecutive
seasons, even with respectable improvement, rarely stay intact.
</P>
<P>
   As Gretzky ends his 20-season career in the NHL, his Rangers
bring a 33-37-11 record into the nationally televised farewell to
the Great One. Their 77 points, up from 68 last season, would
qualify for the postseason in the Western Conference. But the East
has fewer great teams and more good ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very obvious what we need,'' said John Muckler,
finishing his first full season as coach. ``We need help behind the
blue line. We need help up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the season, when Gretzky missed 12 games with an injury,
the Rangers went 6-3-3 and seemed poised to earn one of the eight
conference berths. ``With Wayne coming back, I thought that would
put the icing on the cake,'' Muckler said. ``We just didn't get the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   So the next job will be to lure more first-line forwards and top
defensemen. The quick fix could be through free agents. The easiest
to recruit, for a wealthy team such as the Rangers, are
unrestricted veterans over age 31 who have played out their
contracts. ``The Rangers have a lot of resources to do these
things,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for them, the most attractive free agent in a
shallow market this summer is Brian Leetch, their captain and
attacking defenseman. With only 12 goals, Leetch is almost certain
to finish with the lowest total of any full season in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Possible factors for his drop in production include the awkward
compatibility between his style and Gretzky's, something Leetch
cited last season; the limitations on his mobility under Muckler's
system, something Muckler denies; or the gradual erosion that comes
from 12 seasons, several serious injuries and too many playing
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The team lost toughness with Jeff Beukeboom's career-threatening
concussion and Ulf Samuelsson's trade to Detroit. Alexander
Karpovtsev was traded to Toronto for Mathieu Schneider, a deal that
probably helped both teams. Younger players like Rumun Ndur, Chris
Tamer and Richard Brennan showed potential and limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Among forwards, Petr Nedved became the first-line center after a
trade from Pittsburgh for Alexsei Kovalev, another deal that helped
both teams. Nedved scored 20 goals but took a beating and left the
lineup three weeks ago after a serious rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Asking him to do two jobs _ center a scoring line and check the
other team's top line _ is a sure way to burn him out. When Gretzky
was injured, young centers Marc Savard and Manny Malhotra played
more minutes and showed encouraging moments of creativity and
speed. But neither has yet proven he is ready to sustain the energy
for 20 minutes of playing time per game over an 82-game season.
</P>
<P>
   On the wings, Adam Graves, healthy again, revived his career
with 38 goals, excelling at even strength, on the power play and
killing penalties while earning a multiyear contract. But he is 31,
and it is fair to wonder how many more injury-free seasons of high
productivity he has.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean, signed as a free agent last summer, has 28 goals
and consistently gave full effort, but sometimes looked weary as a
34-year-old veteran of 16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens, has 23 goals and played more strong games than
some thought possible. But he is 34 and might soon decorate an
expansion team's roster.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harvey, a 24-year-old right wing, added spirit, but missed
half the season with injuries, a major concern. Niklas Sundstrom
has 13 goals, down from 19 last season and 24 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom, an excellent checker, is one of few Rangers who would
draw value in the trade market. Another possibility is one of the
goalies. Mike Richter, the veteran, had a good season, and Dan
Cloutier, the rookie, showed promise. But Neil Smith, the general
manager, always says it is difficult to trade goalies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Smith has seemed increasingly irritable and is
drawing more criticism than ever before, not all of it fair. On the
dais at Gretzky's news conference on Friday, while others looked
sad, Smith seemed to frown and scowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even the television executives and basketball bosses who run the
Garden know that Muckler and several of Smith's top aides have
succeeded elsewhere as general managers. Like many of his players,
Smith's future in New York could be decided by moves made in the
next few months.

ANOTHER GRETZKY WAITS FOR HIS BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A familiar name graces the back of the sweater worn by
the speedy center for the Wolves, this city's independent
minor-league hockey team. He can play behind the net, pass with
deadly accuracy, and coaches say he sees the ice almost as well as
the man who shares his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Gretzky is accustomed to being told he is almost as good
as his older brother, Wayne. And like any other aspiring hockey
player, he thinks ``not quite as good as Wayne Gretzky'' is a nice
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever be as good as Wayne,'' Brent said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the hockey world was held captive while Wayne
pondered retirement, Brent quietly went about his usual anonymous
role. As a midseason addition to the Wolves, he has helped the
defending International Hockey League champions to another
regular-season division title and, unlike Wayne, is readying for
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Brent said Wayne didn't discuss his retirement with him. He had
hoped his brother would play another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's another reason for me to read the sports page,'' Brent
said. ``I'm always hoping for him to break another record or do
something else on the ice. And I'm not just saying that because
he's my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent is the youngest of five children, three of whom pursued
the sport that their father, Walter, loved and coached. Eleven
years younger than Wayne, Brent was only 2 when his brother left
home in Brantford, Ontario, to play junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I'd watch Wayne on TV and then go out
to the rink and try out some of his moves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that backyard skating rink, built by Walter Gretzky,
where the brothers honed their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys used to want to skate all the time, and if I took
them to a park it was just too cold,'' said Walter, who worked for
the local phone company in Canada. ``I built that rink for
self-preservation. People always say, `Wow you built a rink so
Wayne and the boys could skate.' No. It was for me. It was so I
wouldn't freeze to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent said, ``Everything my brothers and I learned about hockey,
we learned from our dad. People ask me all the time what I learned
from Wayne. We don't talk hockey, but he did teach me how to play
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is still relentlessly compared to Wayne, Brent said
he felt fortunate that his brother Keith came along first. It was
Keith who absorbed the nickname the Other One. Brent is merely the
Little One.
</P>
<P>
   Brent also attributes much of his recent success and return to
North American hockey to Keith. After several years floating
between minor-league teams, Brent decided in 1997 to play in
Europe. He spent a season in Austria, and after a contract dispute,
thought his playing days might be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith, who was a career minor-leaguer himself and is now a
minor-league coach for the Asheville (N.C.) Smoke, gave his little
brother a chance. Brent credits Keith with re-energizing his
offensive game and his mental approach to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Europe, he spent parts of three seasons in
the Tampa Bay Lightning organization and was called up to the NHL
for a total of 13 games. One of those was against the Los Angeles
Kings _ whose starting center was Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he won every faceoff we had,'' Brent said. ``Finally
the last one, he let me win, and the crowd started cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gretzky added: ``I thought I was going to have go down
there and referee the game myself. The two can't play a game of
cards without fighting about something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent calls that game the best experience of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hadn't hit me until right before the game,'' he said. ``I
was walking out of the tunnel and my knees were shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 27, Brent acknowledges his chances of making the NHL again
decrease every year, but he says he is playing the best hockey of
his career and is still optimistic. Others agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely got NHL ability,'' said his coach, John
Anderson. ``He needs a team to come along that is willing to let
him showcase his abilities, because he's definitely got them.''

BACK INJURY PREVENTS SAMPRAS FROM PREPARING EARLY ON CLAY
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARCELONA, Spain _ The man voted the greatest tennis player in
the last quarter-century by a panel of experts has yet to reach a
final in 1999. And Pete Sampras, because of a back injury suffered
earlier this week, won't be reaching one any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   After earnestly and eagerly deciding to start his clay-court
campaign early by accepting a wild card into the Open Seat Godo in
Barcelona, he left here on Wednesday without playing a singles
match after withdrawing because of a lower back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras felt his back tighten during a doubles match on Tuesday
night, and despite a hot bath and a long massage, he awoke very
stiff in the morning, the muscles surrounding his sacroiliac joint
in spasm. By Wednesday afternoon, he was sitting in a crowded
interview room wearing the slightly self-conscious expression that
he often reserves for bad days at the office.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of those this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a setback, no question,'' said Sampras, who blamed
himself for not warming up properly. ``Having not played many
tournaments and not played great this year, it's disappointing. But
I'm not sitting here panicked about everything. There's a lot of
tennis still to be played this year.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ATP trainer Per Bastholt, Sampras will not be
playing or practicing for five or six days, at least. He has
already decided to withdraw from next week's Monte Carlo event, and
unless he changes plans, his next tournament will be the Italian
Open in Rome from May 10 to 16. Instead of getting onto European
red clay early in an attempt to prepare for the French Open (the
only Grand Slam event he has not won) Sampras will again get onto
it late. The French Open starts eight days after the Italian Open
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I wanted to start off my clay-court
season: with an injury,'' he said. ``But sometimes you have to
listen to your body and be smart about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing No. 1 in the ranking for a record sixth
consecutive year, Sampras skipped the year's first Grand Slam, the
Australian Open, to rest his weary mind and body. ``At the end of
last year, I was miserable,'' he said. ``But I felt this was really
the only chance for me to break this record, and I put so much
pressure on myself that I wasn't eating well or sleeping well.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he returned to the tour in February, his results hardly
have been reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reason is that he's been putting too much pressure
on himself,'' said his coach, Paul Annacone. ``Missing Australia
for the first time was a change of routine for him.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first tournament, Sampras defaulted from the semifinals
in San Jose, Calif., with a sprained ankle. He was beaten in the
second round in Scottsdale, Ariz., by Jan-Michael Gambill; by Felix
Mantilla in his opening match at Indian Wells, Calif., and, more
understandably, by Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals at Key
Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I needed the break,'' Sampras said. ``I felt like
the pace I was going the last couple years, I was burning that
candle pretty quickly, and after stressing over whether I should go
to Australia, I decided not to and then told myself that I had my
break and was ready to go. But then all of a sudden it starts all
over again: not getting the results you want. I was putting in the
time and training in January, but it's not easy. And you know the
next couple of years are going to be interesting for me. They
really are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Interesting because Sampras is not at all certain that he wants
to continue playing in enough tournaments to remain in contention
for No. 1. Under the new ranking system that will start in January,
top players will be penalized if they don't compete in the four
Grand Slam events and the ATP Tour's top nine events, now known as
the Super 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if I'm willing to play every Super 9 event,'' he
said. ``The next few years, I really want to have a schedule where
I play when and where I want to play and not where I'm forced to
play. Last year, I felt I had to play those tournaments at the end
of the year to finish No. 1, but now that I got the record, is that
what's going to keep me driving and working hard?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean I've analyzed this. When you have a lot of time off,
you sit and think about your career and what I went through at the
end of last year. How happy was I going through this? I'm not
fighting for my life out there. I'm trying to achieve a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances to the contrary, Sampras said one of his
goals is to return to Davis Cup. Though he declined to play last
year or in this month's first round against Britain, he said he had
kept track of his former teammates' 3-2 victory in Britain while
training on clay in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a bit of it, and it was a hell of an effort by the whole
team,'' he said. ``When you hear about the matches and how exciting
they were, there's a part of you that thinks twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the captain, Tom Gullikson, he added: ``I know Tom
has his team set for the next round, or at least that's what I've
heard. I have no problem with that. Those guys made the commitment,
and they get the first shot, but my Davis Cup career is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it is the French Open that matters most, and
though his chances grow slimmer by the season on his least favorite
surface, he and Annacone have decided that his best chance is to
attack the net with great regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I realized I need to come in more,'' he said. ``I
don't need to do it to the same extreme as Pat Rafter. I need to
use what I have, the whole arsenal I have in my game. But these
clay-courters don't like guys chipping and charging and serving and
volleying. And it's something I'm just going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To do it at Roland Garros he will need to be very healthy, and
his lower back problems are not new. Last fall during his stressful
and successful effort to maintain his virtual edge, he had spasms
with some frequency, and despite efforts to improve his strength in
the off-season, he experienced more discomfort in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a lower back injury keeps coming up like this, you can
never be sure it won't happen again,'' Bastholt said. ``Pete will
now have to be very careful about warming up and stretching out
before he goes out to play any match.''

BROOKLYN MAN, 21, IS DEAD AFTER SHOOTING IN A THEATER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 21-year-old Brooklyn man who dreamed of rapping his
way to a better future died five hours after he was shot in the
back at a Flatbush movie theater during a Friday night screening of
the film ``Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Jumaane Cox, was one of three men wounded shortly
after 10 p.m. at the Kenmore Quad Theater. Cox died of his wounds
at the hospital shortly after 4 a.m., the police said. They
described him as a bystander to an argument between two rival
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dispute over seating,'' said Detective George Nagy, a
police department spokesman, adding that the shooter also had been
angered by noisy patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Batiste and Nigel Ramirez, both 19 and from Flatbush, were
also shot in the dispute, he said. Both were listed in stable
condition at Kings County Hospital Center Saturday afternoon, with
Batiste suffering a single gunshot wound to the back and Ramirez
with three gunshot wounds to the torso.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that the department had
suspects, but declined to reveal details because the shooting
remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cox had been sitting to the right of the shooting with his niece
and a friend. ``Everything happened all of a sudden,'' said his
niece, Shamika Page, 19. ``We weren't even five minutes into the
movie when I heard the shots, and we hit the deck. I thought he was
fine and was already out when I got to the street. I didn't even
know that I had crawled over him, that he was the one on the floor
who had been shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's mother arrived at the theater a few minutes after
receiving a call from Ms. Page telling her what had happened. When
she got there, her son was still lying inside the theater,
conscious but unable to speak and without any signs of a wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed with him, and tried to talk to him,'' Ms. Page said,
speaking on the phone from the Cox family apartment. ``Then when
they turned him over there was this tiny hole, no bigger than a
dime on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeping, she added: ``That little hole, that tiny thing, it
killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other family members said that it had been uncertain on Friday
night whether Cox was actually going to attend the movie. Although
he had been eagerly awaiting the release of the prison comedy,
starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, his brother Kevin said
in an interview that he had urged Cox to go to another theater
because of the gang activity around the Kenmore. He said the
theater is covered with gang graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls to the theater seeking comment went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Better known in local rap circles as Wax, Cox had begun to shop
his first demo tape, family members said. They added that he was
also an accomplished artist who spent hours each day drawing
super-heroes inspired by his love of Spider-Man and designing logos
for businesses, including the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had recently passed a test to become a track cleaner
for New York City Transit, Mrs. Cox said, he retained dreams of
making it big in the music world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to do anything to make it out of here, and he
was always talking about rapping,'' said his mother, a nurse's
assistant. ``He always said he was going to make money, buy cars
and houses, get me a place to stay and take care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a troublesome kid, someone who stayed out late or
got involved with the bad people,'' she said, drifting off into
tears. ``I just can't believe this is happening. I'm just so sad,
and I don't understand.''

SILAS MAY HAVE FOUND A BIG ALLY IN JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan and George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Hornets,
are moving closer to a partnership that would result in Jordan's
owning 50 percent of the team, a first for a former National
Basketball Association player.
</P>
<P>
   An official of another Eastern Conference team said Jordan and
Shinn met last week and are merely working out details of what each
one's role in the organization would be.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Shinn have tentatively worked out an arrangement in
which both would have veto power over major decisions. And both
would be consulted on every matter pertaining to the team, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ownership structure may not be final until after
this season, the Hornets' interim head coach, Paul Silas, may not
have to worry about his future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that the former Bulls coach Phil Jackson
would supplant Silas after this season, Jordan has apparently
agreed with Shinn that Silas, a longtime assistant, should be kept
as head coach if Charlotte continues on its current pace.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's 95-94 victory in Milwaukee, the Hornets had
won six straight under Silas and were 14-9 since Dave Cowens
resigned on March 8. Part of the resurgence can be attributed to
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. Obtained for Glen Rice from the
Lakers last month, the two have been consistently good _ a
description seldom applied to Campbell's game before. That Silas
has been able to coax energy and effort out of the formerly
lethargic Campbell is a testament to his ability.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets entered the weekend two and a half games out of the
eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot, with a Band-Aid
lineup that was missing Derrick Coleman and Anthony Mason. They
have beaten New York, Orlando and Utah under Silas, whose
reputation among players is golden.
</P>
<P>
   Even notoriously unhappy players like Coleman, who has four
years left on his contract, and Mason, who has three seasons left,
count Silas as one of the few authority figures in the game to whom
they actually listen. Silas coached Mason on the Knicks on Pat
Riley's staff and worked with Coleman on the Nets as part of Chuck
Daly's and Butch Beard's staffs.
</P>
<P>
   With the conference up for grabs for the next several years, the
possibilities in Charlotte are tantalizing. If Coleman drops 30
pounds, if Mason returns healed from a torn biceps, if Campbell and
Jones keep fitting in, and if point guard David Wesley thinks pass
instead of shoot first, that team is a bona fide contender. And
Jordan as owner would not hurt the team's marketing possibilities,
either.
</P>
<P>
   If Silas is given a longterm deal, it will send a message that
NBA coaches are not necessarily saviors, and that longevity and
loyalty mean something. And it would be one of the few times in
recent years when a black coach inherited a promising situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, Silas has been interviewed for positions
in Seattle, Chicago and Sacramento and come up empty. His only
previous head coaching job was essentially a no-win situation,
overseeing the San Diego Clippers in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With the dismissal of Bernie Bickerstaff two weeks ago in
Washington, Silas is one of four black head coaches in the league.
He joins Alvin Gentry in Detroit, Butch Carter in Toronto and Lenny
Wilkens in Atlanta. It's no secret that many in the black coaching
fraternity wonder why their peers often inherit underachieving
teams doomed for the draft lottery, never to resurface as head
coaches again.
</P>
<P>
   From Beard with the Nets to Jim Cleamons in Dallas to Eddie
Jordan in Sacramento, the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, in this type of situation, you get passed and passed
over, and you wonder if it's ever going to happen,'' Silas said
last week. ``You interview several times, and you end up getting
beat out by a recycled coach with a pretty good record. It's the
nature of our business. About the only way a longtime assistant
gets a head coaching job is when he becomes an interim coach after
a firing and turns the situation around.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time NBA owners begin promoting loyal souls again.
That's how Jackson and Rudy Tomjanovich, among others, got started.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to keep your nose clean, you try to do the right
things, you try to learn your craft, and you're constantly missing
out,'' Silas said. ``Fairly or unfairly, it wears on you after a
while.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Many Stops on Coaching Carousel
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silas may be safe, but the other interim head coaches are
beginning to emerge as clear long shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Rambis, who replaced Del Harris, may have only a month left
to blend all that Lakers ego and talent into a contender, a
gargantuan task that Harris could not accomplish in four and a half
seasons. His authority undermined by Dennis Rodman for the last two
months, Rambis' only hope may be getting the Lakers back to the
Western Conference finals. And even that may not be enough to
guarantee security.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson is an obvious candidate, but don't discount Dave
Cowens.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bernie Bickerstaff was fired so late in the season in
Washington, Jim Brovelli was given an impossible job. If Silas does
not re-sign in Charlotte, look for Wes Unseld to give him serious
consideration for the Wizards job. Gar Heard has also been
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey, meanwhile, was looking like a sure bet to take over
the Nets on a permanent basis. But Stephon Marbury and his fragile
friends fell apart against the Knicks and on the West Coast this
past week, dousing some of those hopes, although the Nets blew out
Seattle Friday night to go 8-11 under Casey.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, he is more contemporary than most of his peers, able to
get through to his players with biting sarcasm and humor instead of
challenging their manhood. Like Silas, he is another career
assistant who understands the old Chuck Daly credo: In the NBA,
your players allow you to coach them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Rule Out Rodman Return
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for Dennis Rodman, who was released by the Lakers on
Thursday, because he became more of a hindrance than a help.
Because Rodman was released after the first week of March, he is
not eligible for a playoff roster this season, but even though he
is 37 there are plenty of desperate franchises who may give him a
job next season.
</P>
<P>
   A few places Rodman could still play:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Sonics need an ornery rebounder. Plus, Rodman is a
good friend of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Having been tattooed and
pierced more than most of Grunge America, Rodman would go over big
in the smoky clubs and latte hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Pistons, the team Rodman began his career with, are
soft in the middle, too. And imagine the tearful homecoming when he
sees his former club.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill: ``Welcome back, Dennis. Look, there's your old
locker.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman: ``You guys still practice?''
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI: Even though Rodman has said, ``Not even Pat Riley can
control my demons,'' the Heat needs another solid veteran for the
playoffs. Believing he can motivate any human being to fit in with
the franchise, Riley would accept Rodman with the proviso that he
be on time, work hard and not detract from the team concept. From
his South Beach cabana, though, Rodman would label the conditions
completely unacceptable.

GOTTI BELIEVED TO BE USING BROTHER TO CLING TO POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his son and reputed successor about to follow
him into federal prison, John Gotti is trying to cling to the reins
of the Gambino crime family through his brother Peter, Mafia
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gotti, 59, a former New York City Department of Sanitation
employee, has been identified by the FBI as a capo, or captain, in
the Gambino family. He is said to run a crew from the Bergin Hunt
and Fish Club in South Ozone Park, Queens, which was once the
headquarters for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   As a close relative, Peter Gotti is allowed to meet with his
brother, and investigators believe that these visits will enable
John Gotti, who is serving a life sentence, to maintain a pipeline
to the Gambino family.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bruce Mouw, a former FBI agent who was in charge of the
agency's Gambino family investigations from 1980 until his
retirement last year, described Peter Gotti ``as not exactly a
Rhodes scholar nor particularly aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But just by the process of elimination he is actively running
the family now,'' Mouw said. ``Does he have the capabilities?
Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts, current and former federal and state investigators,
say that John Gotti, 58, is determined to remain the Gambino boss
despite the recent guilty plea by his son, John A. Gotti, to
racketeering and tax evasion charges and the difficulty of
communicating his wishes from a prison where he is locked in a cell
for 23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives for Gotti are strong, the investigators say: As
long as he remains boss, he or his relatives are entitled to a
share of the family's illicit profits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state law-enforcement agencies estimate that in the
early 1990s the Gambino family reaped about $100 million a year
from gambling, loan-sharking, gasoline tax frauds, and labor
rackets and extortion in the construction and garbage carting
industries. The loot, the experts say, has been sharply cut by a
government crackdown against the family.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the younger Gotti, 35, admitted his guilt in a
plea bargain, he claimed that legal battles with the government had
virtually impoverished him. But federal and state agents say he has
squirreled away millions of dollars that agents have been unable to
trace.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was imprisoned in 1992 at the federal penitentiary in
Marion, Ill., the elder Gotti has relayed directions mainly through
meetings at the prison with his son, law-enforcement officials say.
Although all of Gotti's prison visits are recorded on video and
audio tape, federal prosecutors contend that he and his son,
reportedly the acting Gambino boss, discussed Mafia matters in
code.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a control freak,'' Mouw said of the elder Gotti. ``He
just wants to maintain control through his son or his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Schiliro, the head of the FBI in the New York area, said
John J. Gotti remained the Gambino family's paramount leader. ``We
still carry him as the boss,'' Schiliro said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After the conviction of the younger Gotti, Schiliro said it was
too early to determine the new composition of the hierarchy that
will supervise the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust has not settled, and they are still in flux, but
Peter Gotti is a front-runner,'' Schiliro added.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cutler, a lawyer for the Gotti brothers, denied that Peter
Gotti was an organized crime figure, pointing out that he was
acquitted, in 1991, of the only racketeering charge brought against
him. ``He is a devoted brother,'' Cutler said of Peter Gotti.
``These unsupported allegations are an unholy obsession by law
enforcement with anyone who has the name Gotti.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Gambino family, based in the New York City area, is the
nation's second-largest and second-most-powerful Mafia group, with
about 200 soldiers and several thousand associates who work for the
gang, according to the FBI. Many of the soldiers, however, are
elderly or imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Mouw said John Gotti might seek to deter rivals by
re-establishing a committee of Gambino members loyal to him to
oversee the family's day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   While imprisoned for the last seven years, Gotti has left vacant
the family's other high-ranking posts of underboss and consigliere,
investigators said. ``The last thing Gotti wants is a permanent
underboss or consigliere who can slowly take over the family,''
Mouw said. ``If he tries to run the family through a committee he
will appoint his own people from the loyal palace guard, and if he
doesn't like anyone he will throw him off the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at best, Mouw added, Gotti only has superficial authority
and must depend on loyalists to carry out his policies and to
resolve issues that cannot await instructions from him.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigators maintain that Gotti also wants to exercise
control to ensure that his relatives, known as the Gotti faction in
the crime family, get shares of illicit profits that generally flow
to a Mafia boss. In addition to his son and his brother Peter,
law-enforcement officials say two other relatives are Gambino
soldiers: another brother, Richard, 56, and a son-in-law, Carmine
Agnello, 37, the husband of Gotti's daughter, Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Before John A. Gotti, who is known as Junior, pleaded guilty to
federal charges on April 5, he claimed that he had difficulties
providing for his wife and four children because the government had
seized many of his assets and because of the expense of a $10
million bond to stay free while awaiting a trial.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators doubt the claim of poverty. Mouw said that
John Gotti received millions of dollars a year from Gambino family
rackets since 1986, when they say he became the Gambino boss. Since
1992, Mouw asserted, the son has been collecting payoffs for his
father and for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a plea deal with federal prosecutors for a reduced prison
sentence of about five to seven years, the younger Gotti agreed to
pay a fine of $1 million and to forfeit $358,000 in cash that was
found in a safe in his office in Queens. He also must forfeit homes
and property in Pennsylvania and Sullivan County, N.Y., but he has
been allowed to keep a $700,000 home in Mill Neck, N.Y., and a
$300,000 home in East Massapequa, N.Y., both on Long Island. He is
to be sentenced July 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tens of millions of dollars stashed away,'' Mouw
said. ``Where is it? If we knew we'd seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Shargel, a lawyer for John A. Gotti, said: ``It's very
easy for federal agents to say that Gotti has a lot of money. All
the evidence we have points to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro of the FBI declined to say if agents were trying to
locate cash they believe has been hidden by the Gottis. ``Certainly
the financial resources of the Gambino family are extensive,''
Schiliro noted. ``All I can say about searches is that our
investigation into the Gambino family's activities is continuing.''

PICKING QUARTERBACKS AS EASY AS 1-2-3: COUCH, MCNABB AND SMITH
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few quarterbacks have faced the microscopic scrutiny Kentucky's
Tim Couch underwent this month, on everything from the way he
selected an agent to how he held the football.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, the Cleveland Browns had their doubts about
selecting him with the No. 1 pick in the draft _ the first in their
reborn franchise's history. But Cleveland's thinking changed after
Couch performed so well in a recent workout. Following that
performance, Browns officials began talking of how Couch reminded
them of Joe Montana, who many of them knew first-hand from their
days with the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Couch could lead their franchise for the next 10
years, the Browns came to terms with him several hours before the
draft on a seven-year, $48 million contract that includes a $12.2
million signing bonus, the largest ever given to a rookie. By the
time the clock started for the Browns to make their selection,
their choice was the worst-kept secret in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After Couch, two more quarterbacks were selected, the first time
that has happened since 1971. Choosing second, the Philadelphia
Eagles selected Donovan McNabb of Syracuse and the Cincinnati
Bengals then picked Akili Smith of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the biggest shock of the day. Indianapolis, long
thought to be interested in Ricky Williams, the Heisman
Trophy-winning running back from Texas, or Champ Bailey, the
cornerback from Georgia, instead chose Miami running back Edgerrin
James, whose stock rose dramatically in recent weeks. While the
Colts say the reason they went with James was simply because they
had him rated higher, it is hard to believe that the conservative
Colts coach, Jim Mora, wasn't bothered by Williams's dreadlocks and
pierced tongue.
</P>
<P>
   James going before Williams led to one of those awkward moments
that seems to have become commonplace in the draft. Williams
thought he was going to the Colts and, with cameras focused on him,
expressed shock when his name was not called.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' decision immediately led to the first of several
blockbuster trades that will be remembered for years and could
change the course of franchises.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Coach Mike Ditka had pledged that he would pay
almost any cost to get Williams, and the price he paid was indeed
steep. Once the Colts passed on Williams, Ditka got on the phone
with Washington and offered all of his picks from this year's draft
_ from the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh rounds _
and a first- and third-round choice next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins took Ditka's charitable offer, moving from fifth
overall to the Saints' spot at 12, and the Saints selected
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected Indianapolis to take me, so I was surprised,''
Williams said. ``But I'm glad I'm going to a place where I'm
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Williams concerned about the pressure that will be on his
shoulders, the way the blockbuster trade Dallas made with Minnesota
more than 10 years ago followed Herschel Walker around for the rest
of his career?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too worried,'' Williams said, ``I'm just going to go
out and play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Washington made a trade of its own. The Redskins took some
of their new picks from New Orleans and combined them with a few of
their own to switch places with Chicago and move up to No. 7 to
select Georgia's Champ Bailey, probably the best athlete in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, like the Saints, gave up a lot to get Bailey.
Washington gave Chicago the Saints' first- and third-round picks,
then their own fourth and fifth-round selections from this draft
and a third-round selection from next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears used their choice to try to address their quarterback
problem, drafting Cade McNown of UCLA. He was the fifth quarterback
taken in the first 12 choices, coming one after the Minnesota
Vikings had drafted Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did quarterbacks dominate the draft, it was heavily
oriented toward offensive players.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, who just acquired running back Marshall Faulk from
Indianapolis, added a wide receiver for their anemic offense,
choosing Torry Holt of North Carolina State. Then, one pick after
Washington chose Bailey, Arizona selected another wide receiver,
David Boston of Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore then selected Chris McAlister, another cornerback. No
other defensive players were taken until Tampa Bay used the No. 15
pick to choose Louisiana State University lineman Anthony
McFarland, the latest a defensive lineman has been selected in the
first round in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the Giants, drafting 19th, chose the Notre Dame
offensive tackle Luke Petitgout, a 6-5, 315 pound player.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the quarterbacks who were the focus of the first
round. The last time quarterbacks went 1-2-3 was in 1971 when the
New England Patriots drafted Jim Plunkett, the New Orleans Saints
chose Archie Manning and the Houston Oilers selected Dan Pastorini.
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL personnel men felt that Cleveland's at times public
hesitation over Couch was an effort to gain an upper hand in
negotiations. Others felt that the Browns were genuinely puzzled
about whom to take, their top three choices being Smith, Williams
and Couch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what sealed the Browns on Couch was that second
workout. In it, Couch showed accuracy and confidence that wasn't on
display in his first workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That workout pushed us over the top,'' said Carmen Policy, the
former San Francisco executive who is now president of the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland officials had contacted the agents for all three
players, but in the last 48 hours the Browns had concentrated their
efforts on Couch. Talks between the Browns and Couch's agent, Tom
Condon, heated up beginning around 9 p.m. on Friday and did not
conclude until around 3 on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not tolerate any disruption of his focus,'' said
Policy when asked why it was so important to sign Couch early. ``We
needed our leader signed early and we wanted that to send a message
to anyone who was going to be part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch was glad to have it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a great moment,'' he said. ``I can't tell you how
happy I am.''

<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ There were more smiles and laughter than usual
Saturday for a team already out of the running and going through
the motions of a final practice. At least until the end, when
Rangers coach John Muckler gathered the team and demanded that
Wayne Gretzky skate a couple more laps up and down the ice.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates clattered their sticks on the ice in
encouragement, but Gretzky, for once, chose to exercise his clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to do a couple extra down and backs,'' Gretzky said
afterward. ``I said, `No, I'll retire right here.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Gretzky led the stretch instead, taking a spot at the center
of the ice at Rye Playland with his teammates gathered around him.
The jokes and banter went on, the sort of thing that Gretzky is
well aware he will miss more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   This was his final practice, the final preparation for a final
game at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon that he admitted
there is no way to prepare for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky announced his retirement on Friday, but as he made his
last appearance at Rye, the reality was setting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been in a situation like this,''
Gretzky said. ``I've been in the Stanley Cup finals, in All-Star
games, the Canada Cup, and I've always found a way to get through.
I think the best way is the way I always do. I'll prepare like
every game. Other things will go on around me that I can't change,
but my routine will be the same.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the schedule Saturday was a phone call from President
Clinton, which Gretzky headed home to receive. On Sunday, many of
the players he has befriended in 20 years in the NHL are expected
to be at the Rangers' game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   His former teammates, Mark Messier and Paul Coffey, told him
they would make the trip, and he also expected his former Edmonton
coach, Glen Sather. The Penguins' Jaromir Jagr, who had planned to
sit out the game, said he would now play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The doors will open at Madison Square Garden a half-hour early,
at 1:30 p.m. for the 3 p.m. game, and the Rangers will conduct a
ceremony following the warm-ups. Gretzky will use 40 sticks in the
game, change among three jerseys, and there will be none of the
usual sponsored events during television timeouts. Instead, the
Rangers will air a video tribute to Gretzky during each break in
play. At the end of the game there will again be a video tribute. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already, gifts were arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers and photos from fans adorned Gretzky's locker, and
before the start of practice the team got together and presented
him with a leather chair in the shape of a baseball glove.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, a baseball fan, had seen the same chair in George
Steinbrenner's office once and spoke of how he liked it, so the
team rushed to get him one of the 100 that were made. He was also
given a lifetime pass to any major-league baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say honestly that the last four days have been a tearful
time,'' Gretzky said. ``The other night in Ottawa, I came off the
ice, and the guys on the bench said I had to go back out there.
When I went out and looked back at the bench, that got me. Today, I
didn't expect anything from the players. Their friendship is
enough. But they gave me a beautiful gift. It was pretty
emotional.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around the locker room, his teammates seemed little different
from the fans surrounding the ice, collecting mementos. Marc Savard
seemed to be single-handedly retiring the No. 99 jersey, with three
of them in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had joked on Friday that Darren Langdon would steal most
of the mementos, and Langdon had a good assortment for the bar he
owns. ``I got a few things signed by him,'' Langdon said, showing
off two sticks and a jersey that was signed, ``To Langer and the
bar, Great beer!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody calls me a weasel,'' Langdon added. ``This is only
today's work. If he wants to give me anything else, I'll take
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky finished off the practice session by gathering
teammates, coaches and staff on the ice for a team photo, well
aware of each final step he was taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a wonderful day,'' he said. ``Talking to the
young guys today, I told them that this is something for them to
remember, that this is what it's like when you get to the Stanley
Cup finals. This is how exciting it can be.''

WELCOME TO REAL FOOTBALL, DRAFTEES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Usually, the top players and their families arrive
for the National Football League draft full of hope and optimism
and leave with even more. Often the day is one of smiles all
around, an oozy feeling of warmth among the families after an
exhausting process that finally leads to a new address along with
new riches. Instant peace.
</P>
<P>
   But after the draft Saturday at Madison Square Garden, most of
the draftees present felt as if they had just survived a big
squeeze. A sticky shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   Twist me, use me. Rip me up.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they dealt with it. Off they flew to their new teams and
new cities. But already, they had learned a valuable lesson in how,
as pros, to keep both eyes open both inside the locker room and
out. To expect even more scrutiny on the way to making their own
way.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the six players present _ Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb,
Akili Smith, Ricky Williams, Daunte Culpepper and Cade McNown _
experienced the shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   Couch was the draft's first selection. But it happened after the
Browns all but forced the quarterback to sign a contract before he
was picked.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb went next to Philadelphia, and some Eagles fans present
at Madison Square Garden booed him immediately. Some reporters
asked him if he really deserved to be selected so high and if he
expected to be a ``project'' at quarterback for at least three or
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the No. 3 pick, to Cincinnati. He and his agent, Leigh
Steinberg, said the Browns strung both agent and quarterback along
the night before and the morning of the draft, using them as
leverage in the Browns' negotiations with Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning, record-setting running
back, was snubbed by the Colts at the No. 4 slot (they selected a
back, Edgerrin James, widely considered less talented than
Williams). Williams went to the Saints at No. 5. And then Williams
watched as his agent, Leland Hardy of No Limit Sports Management,
the company founded by the rapper Master P., was grilled about his
ability to negotiate NFL contracts. The innuendo was that Williams
had fallen to No. 5 because of his agent.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that Culpepper would be picked as high as No. 7;
he slipped to No. 11 at quarterback and still is being questioned
about coming from a small school, Central Florida. McNown has
already been through the fires, having in the last few months
answered an assortment of questions about gambling ties that proved
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Relief!
</P>
<P>
   It is over now. And, then again, it just begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was anxious for this to happen, and I felt I could be the
best quarterback in the draft all along,'' said Couch, who for the
last month had been reported to be a toss-up choice along with
Smith. That was what the Browns said. Was it a ploy all along to
ensure Couch would sign before the draft?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not looking for the better deal,'' said Al Lerner, the
Browns owner. ``We were looking for certainty. I had said that if
our first pick was a contract holdout for 20 minutes, that would be
too long. We didn't want an 11th-hour idea to come up in
negotiations with new demands we had never seen. No new wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Couch is signed, and Steinberg feels used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland called us last night and talked contract
parameters,'' Steinberg said. ``And then they called back about
11:15 last night and said negotiations were done for the night. I
asked them if it was done for the Couch team. They said yes and all
along Couch people were there in front of them when the phone call
was being made. It was an emotional roller-coaster for the Smith
family. They kept telling them Akili really had a chance to be
their pick and all we asked (of) them (was) to be was honest. Akili
will handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch and Smith are once again linked, in the same state and
same division. They will play each other twice a year in the
American Football Conference Central division. Cleveland vs.
Cincinnati. Couch vs. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Tim,'' said Smith, ``but I also see a rivalry being
born. I don't know if he sees it that way, but I do. I'm looking
forward to playing Cleveland for a number of years. For one of us,
Cleveland or me, this is going to be a constant reminder on who
missed what.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb said Syracuse had not won in the years before he arrived,
but that that changed afterward. He said the same would happen in
Philadelphia. Culpepper said he was nervous as the clock slipped
by, that he thought he might go anywhere from No. 2 to No. 20 as
time passed. Like McNabb in Philadelphia, McNown looks to a future
in Chicago to change recent losing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, however, experienced the day's most startling
shakedown. And so did his managing team. The look in his eye,
however, hinted that he knew what to do. Likely, the others do,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of set back a little bit, kind of thrown off when
they took Edgerrin,'' Williams said. ``I don't know if it's because
of my agents or my braids or style or what. I feel very much today
like me and my team are sacrificial lambs. It's new for people, my
look, me having a black management team that falls under the
business of a megastar rapper. But I am not worried about it. The
Saints gave up a lot to get me, and now I'll go to a place where
they will use me. And time tells the story. We all just go from
here, and we get the last word.''

FAA DEAL WOULD LET KIWI AIRLINES APPLY TO FLY AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kiwi International Air Lines, which was grounded by
federal regulators last month, reached a settlement with the
Federal Aviation Administration late Friday that allows it to apply
to regain its operating license.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement clears the way for Kiwi to reapply for its license
as if it were a new airline. Both the FAA and the Department of
Transportation, which certify all carriers, said they would ``give
expeditious consideration'' to Kiwi's application, but it could be
many months before the low-fare airline is flying again, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi's four planes were grounded on March 24, a day after the
airline filed for bankruptcy as part of a deal that would have
provided up to $3 million in new financing from Pan American
Airlines. The FAA cited several maintenance violations by Kiwi,
which is based in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, Kiwi's license will be placed
on indefinite suspension instead of being revoked. In turn, the
airline also agreed to drop its legal challenge to the FAA's
action, which was scheduled to go to court on Tuesday. The deal
must still be approved by the federal bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Kulat, a spokesman for Kiwi, said the airline could be
flying again in 120 days. But it may take much longer.
Certification for new airlines often takes more than a year, and
the agreement did not specify what the government meant by
``expeditious,'' said Arlene Salack, an FAA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being certified as safe by the FAA, airlines also
must be deemed financially fit by the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Kulat said Saturday that Pan Am had not been notified of the new
agreement, so it was not clear whether it was still interested in
backing the airline. It is doubtful that the Transportation
Department would certify Kiwi unless it received new financing.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stanziale, the court-appointed trustee now running Kiwi,
said in a statement Saturday that the airline ``will work slowly
toward the ultimate goal of restarting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulat said that was a signal to Kiwi's 470 laid-off employees
that they might not be returning to work right away. About 30
people are still employed by the airline.

GIANTS DRAFT NOTRE DAME'S PETITGOUT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Mich., Wis.)   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When it was the Giants' turn to announce
their first-round choice in Saturday's National Football League
college draft, the Giants took less than a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   The selection process was speedy, and the selection was a
surprise. Luke Petitgout, a 6-foot-5{-inch, 315-pound tackle from
Notre Dame who was not rated a first-round pick by most who
evaluated the draft, became the Giants' choice with the 19th pick
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Giants Coach Jim Fassel announced minutes after the selection
that Petitgout would begin competing for the starting left guard's
job. Greg Bishop, the team's starter at left guard the last two
seasons, signed a free agent contract with the Atlanta Falcons this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 22-year-old Petitgout's versatility and foot speed
that made him the Giants' choice over tackles L.J. Shelton of
Eastern Michigan and Aaron Gibson of Wisconsin, who were considered
the most sought after offensive linemen after John Tait of Brigham
Young, who was taken by Kansas City with the 14th pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected you to be shocked,'' Giants General Manager Ernie
Accorsi told reporters after Petitgout was drafted. ``But he was
the highest rated lineman and the highest rated player remaining on
our board.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Petitgout also reveals Fassel's expanded
influence on the drafting process. Fassel prefers quick offensive
linemen rather than mammoth ones. He values agility over brawn.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout's selection also gives the Giants some flexibility
should they have trouble signing left tackle Roman Oben to a
long-term contract this year. Oben is scheduled to become an
unrestricted free agent after the 1999 season. Petitgout's
abilities at left tackle were prominently mentioned Saturday by
both Accorsi and Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   If Petitgout has trouble moving to guard, which is generally
regarded as an easier position to learn and play in most NFL
offenses, then the Giants might consider moving right tackle Scott
Gragg to guard and letting Petitgout play right tackle. They did
not pursue Bishop in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Things started to fall into place for the Giants as the
Pittsburgh Steelers and other teams picking ahead of the Giants
went for players at positions other than the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers in particular were expected to take an offensive
lineman, but they instead selected Louisiana State wide receiver
Troy Edwards with the 13th pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs then took Tait, which was hardly a surprise since
Tait was considered the class of this year's group of offensive
lineman.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Seahawks traded their first-round pick, the 17th
overall, to the New England Patriots, who used that spot to take
Boston College center Damien Woody. This also didn't hurt the
Giants, who were seeking a tackle/guard rather than a center, a
position at which Brian Williams is making a comeback from an eye
injury and the third-year center Derek Engler also returns.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the Giants were then deciding between Shelton
and Gibson. ``We would have been perfectly happy with either of
those two,'' Accorsi said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants moved fast on Petitgout instead. Why did their
selection take so little time?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a conviction on the player we were picking,'' Accorsi
said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   There were other first-round developments that will affect the
Giants, most notably the choice of Ohio State wide receiver David
Boston by the Arizona Cardinals. The Cardinals are a rising force
in the National Football Conference East, and talented Cardinals
quarterback Jake Plummer now has a big, physical, game-breaking
receiver to extend the field and improve what already is a quality
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins, meanwhile, added a player in the first
round that Giants fans may come to know all too well. Georgia
cornerback Champ Bailey has been compared to Deion Sanders, who has
terrorized Giants quarterbacks across several seasons.

is now locked in a battle for his job with redshirt freshman Tyler
Watts, the highly touted recruit who sat out last season. No matter
who wins the job, Alabama will be able to move the ball in 1999.
Passing coordinator Charlie Stubbs, who put in the attack last
season, turned down a head coaching job to return to Tuscaloosa an

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So what playing position do the majority of National
Football League teams favor as the overall first pick of the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Tim Couch's selection Saturday by the born-again Cleveland
Browns made him the fourth quarterback of the decade to go first.
There has been only one running back chosen No. 1. There were two
defensive tackles and one wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in the first 10 drafts starting in 1936, only one
quarterback _ Angelo Bertelli of Notre Dame _ was the top pick. But
after World War II and the importance of the T-formation, the
quarterback began to make his way to the top. Being picked first,
at any position, hardly guarantees a championship, however.
</P>
<P>
   Only one overall top choice of the '90s, Dallas defensive tackle
Russell Maryland (1991), has been on a Super Bowl winner. Indeed,
only one top choice in the 1980s, the Cowboys' Troy Aikman, has
been a part of that team's development into a Super Bowl champion.
John Elway was the league's top pick in 1983, but that was with
Baltimore, for whom he refused to play and was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed Results
</P>
<P>
   The Browns are in their glory, for now, with the expensive
acquisition of Tim Couch. But first-year teams, given the overall
top pick, have had mixed results with that choice. Here is how the
most recent expansion teams fared:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carolina, 1995: Traded its overall top pick to Cincinnati,
which chose Ki-Jana Carter, the Penn State running back whose
career has failed to live up to his high selection, at least in
part because of injuries. (Carolina went fifth, taking quarterback
Kerry Collins of Penn State, who is now with his third team, the
New York Giants.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tampa Bay, 1976: Picked Lee Roy Selmon, defensive end from
Oklahoma, who produced a Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta, 1966 (NFL): Picked Tommy Nobis, Texas linebacker, who
went on to distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miami, 1966 (American Football League): Picked Jim Grabowski,
an Illinois running back, who signed with the NFL's Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The Parcells Plan
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were twiddling their thumbs for more than five hours
Saturday because their first choice was the 57th pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   They have had mixed success in coach Bill Parcells' first two
Jets drafts, in which Dick Haley played the lead role in organizing
the selections. Of their 23 picks, 14 remain with the club. One is
a starter on offense _ last year's fourth-round pick, tackle Jason
Fabini of Cincinnati _ and one is a starter on defense _ lineman
Jason Ferguson of Georgia, the last pick of the Jets' 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also Leon Johnson, one of the best third-down backs
and kick returners in recent Jets history, as well as Dedric Ward,
the deep-threat receiver and kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker James Farrior, Parcells' first pick in his first
draft in 1997, was demoted to the second string last year. So was
free safety Kevin Williams, who began last season as a rookie
starter and now will try to convert to cornerback. Still, both
could develop into valuable players over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Two players who missed last year with injuries will get serious
opportunities this summer: linebacker Casey Dailey and defensive
lineman Terry Day. Doug Karczewski, a rookie guard last season, may
also be given a shot at starting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Jets' success in drafting, Parcells said,
somewhat defensively, ``Look around and tell me what other people
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Ward have been impact players, and the 14 who remain
from the Parcells drafts are his kind of people, which by any
yardstick has to be an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Classes
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of this year's quarterback class _ the first
three choices were quarterbacks, something that hadn't happened
since 1971, when Jim Plunkett (Patriots), Archie Manning (Saints)
and Dan Pastorini (Oilers) were selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers compare the depth of this year's crop to the 1983
group, which will probably produce three Hall of Famers: John
Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly. That collection also included
three others who went in the first round: Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien
and Todd Blackledge. Who remembers the order they went in, though?
</P>
<P>
   1. Elway (Colts, traded to Denver).
</P>
<P>
   2. Blackledge (Kansas City).
</P>
<P>
   3. Eason (New England).
</P>
<P>
   4. Kelly (Buffalo, elected to go to the U.S. Football League).
</P>
<P>
   5. O'Brien (Jets).
</P>
<P>
   6. Marino (Miami).
</P>
<P>
   According to Charley Casserly, the Redskins' general manager,
``The class of '71 was far better.''
</P>
<P>
   Phifer in the Big City
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Roman Phifer met with Jets fans Saturday, and he came
away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest Jets, Phifer joined the club as a free agent
after playing for the perpetually troubled St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by how excited they were,'' said Phifer, who
was at the Official All-Star Cafe on Broadway for the Jets'
open-house draft party. ``It's a big change coming from St. Louis.
The fans were around the block.''

EDITORIAL: WAR AND ANALOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 18:
</P>
<P>
   Every war is conducted in the shadow of its predecessors, and
the conflict in Kosovo is no exception. The nation is haunted by
memories of the Second World War and Vietnam as it considers how
intensely to prosecute the war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   That is entirely appropriate, for the history of those struggles
is relevant to this one. But neither analogy exactly fits Kosovo,
and seeing beyond them is essential if the country is to make a
searching examination of the proper course to follow in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other proponents of
American military involvement in Kosovo cast the conflict as a test
of American and European willingness to confront aggression and
homicidal ethnic hatred before they spread.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that in dealing with Slobodan Milosevic, the West
must not repeat the appeasement at Munich in 1938 and other
mistakes that initially allowed Hitler to move unimpeded against
his neighbors and led him to conclude that Nazi policies would go
unopposed. Because of the unimaginable devastation of World War II
and the Holocaust, this view has great moral resonance today.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of American military action in Kosovo fear that, as in
Vietnam, the country is being drawn deeply into a conflict where
the national interest is unclear or concocted, the sacrifices may
be dear and the outcome is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   They see another protracted, unpopular war that ends with an
imperfect settlement that might have been reached before fighting
escalated. The echoes of Vietnam are understandably _ and properly
_ strong in a White House and Pentagon populated with men and women
who saw the lives of their peers wasted by Lyndon Baines Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   For every American generation of this century, the power of war
analogies has been undeniable, and they have framed debate about
every recent American military venture abroad.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, who was probably the last of the World War II
veterans to occupy the White House, took America to war in the
Persian Gulf not only to protect the flow of oil, but also to
defeat Saddam Hussein, a tyrant whom he equated with Hitler. Ronald
Reagan maintained that his invasion of Grenada broke the paralyzing
spell of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both analogies contain enduring truths. World War II
did show that maniacal dictators are best crushed early. Vietnam
taught us that it can be a criminal act to send troops into combat
without the support of the American people and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But historical contexts change, and that affects the fit of old
analogies to new circumstances. The bipolar world of the Cold War
no longer exists. Does that mean that the remaining superpower has
unavoidable responsibilities to function as a humanitarian police
force? Or does it mean that America should intervene in genocidal
conflicts that would undermine the stability of an important region
or ally and ignore more isolated bloodlettings?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton began to grope toward an answer to these
difficult questions last week when he told a gathering of newspaper
editors, ``At the end of the 20th century, we face a great battle
between the forces of integration and the forces of disintegration,
the forces of globalism vs. tribalism, of oppression against
empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, the savage assault on Kosovo demands a
response, and one that proceeds from a clearer policy than has yet
been defined by Clinton or the foreign-policy leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing the economic, political and ethnic integration of
Europe is hard enough without a bomb-thrower like Milosevic. His
actions present an intertwined humanitarian and diplomatic test to
Europe and the United States. By forcing hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians to flee, Milosevic is using refugees to
destabilize neighboring areas that he is unwilling to attack with
his army. The sudden, explosive movement of peoples across Europe
is a new form of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In the days ahead, Americans must ponder how vital these
interests are to the United States. For the time being, NATO
airstrikes are the right way to attack the Serbian military and may
weaken Milosevic's resistance. But the hour has come for a national
conversation about how deeply the country is willing to be engaged
in the defense of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, directly tackling the Vietnam analogy,
predicts that a NATO ground force operating with advanced American
weapons would quickly overcome Serbian troops. Even if that is not
the case, Americans outraged by the Serbian brutality in Kosovo may
be willing to risk the casualties that could come with an invasion.
To make that judgment, Americans need to learn more about the
conflict and its potential consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the only person who can lead a national seminar on
Kosovo, and he made a good start last week, speaking in San
Francisco, Detroit and Boston. Before long, Congress must commence
a full debate.
</P>
<P>
   Though the military obstacles in Kosovo are different from those
in Vietnam _ the Serbian army, for example, is clearly not
supported by large segments of the population in Kosovo _ one
lesson of Vietnam should be foremost in Clinton's thinking. In
these excruciating situations, the president has to decide, in his
own heart and mind, exactly what he wants and then seek the support
of the American people and Congress for his military plan.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A BOOMING ECONOMY THAT CONFUSES THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's boom time in America. The U.S. economy is acting as if it
just got a new wind, and growth _ which virtually every forecaster
was sure would slow this year _ seems to be accelerating.
Unemployment is low and so is inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The seers at the Federal Reserve Board are as puzzled as the
rest of us. ``Recent performance is both better than expected and
better than most of us thought the structure of the economy would
allow,'' said Laurence Meyer, a Fed governor, in a speech last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The new belief in the vibrancy of the American economy was
visible in the stock market last week as investors moved money out
of Internet wonders and into companies that actually make stuff.
America Online stock fell 13 percent while Caterpillar soared 30
percent. You would think this economic recovery was just starting,
rather than in its ninth year. Recessions, investors think, are for
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last fall that there was a consensus that it was
just a matter of time until the world's economic illness infected
America. There were signs that it had already started, as
manufacturing companies reported falling profits and exports
declined.
</P>
<P>
   It now looks as if the contagion went the other way. Brazil's
recession is less serious than was expected and Asia is recovering.
American manufacturers report that exports are picking up.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American consumers have decided to spend more than
ever. ``The things that were strong last year have not missed a
beat,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
Retail sales are up 6 percent over last year, after adjusting for
inflation. That is a pace that is unprecedented except when the
country is coming out of a recession. The last time we saw such
growth was in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that confidence is about as high as it has
ever been. Investors believe there will be no recession, and
consumers have no fears that their incomes will fall.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it seems clear that the Fed overdid it last fall,
when it cut interest rates three times in an effort to stave off
world recession and moderate the expected slowing in this country.
Instead, it fostered a boom that may be unsustainable and could
bring on inflation. It also provided the liquidity needed to push
the Dow Jones industrial average up 39 percent since August.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether the Fed will reverse course and
start to tighten. If it does, that would certainly put upward
pressure on interest rates, and it might dampen both the stock
market and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The answer probably depends on what conclusions the Fed members
reach about why the economy has been so strong. If they still
believe in conventional forecasting, they probably will tighten. In
the past, unemployment rates this low and consumption this strong
were deemed sure signs of incipient inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the old economic indicators do not seem to be working the
way they once did, a fact that is reflected in the poor forecasting
record of the Fed and most other economists. The Fed members wonder
whether much of this can be explained by a surge in
computer-related productivity, and whether weakness in the rest of
the world is keeping a cap on American wages even when jobs are
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Most on Wall Street think the Fed is not likely to act soon.
``The days of pre-emptive tightening are over,'' says Barbera,
predicting that action will be delayed until inflation is clearly
on the rise. Similarly, Stephen Roach, the chief economist at
Morgan Stanley, thinks the Fed should raise rates to at least
partly offset last fall's cuts, but says it appears that such a
move will come later rather than sooner.
</P>
<P>
   But the bet here is that the Fed will act sooner than most
people think. Meyer, the Fed governor, said last week that a rate
increase might be appropriate if the economy continued to grow
rapidly, even if inflation did not rise immediately. If that was a
hint, it was one that Wall Street was not in a mood to hear.

STRUGGLE TO HELP

   KUKES, Albania _Heavy rain pelted refugees crossing into both
Albania and Macedonia throughout the morning Saturday, and blasting
winds ripped the plastic sheeting many tried to use as shields, as
the swell of exiles continued under a protracted Serbian campaign
of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, international relief agencies struggled vainly to
keep up with the growing numbers of people and vehicles, as the
day's intake of refugees neared 20,000. While fewer than 3,000
refugees entered Macedonia at two border crossings by nightfall
Saturday, compared with more than 12,000 who entered from Kosovo on
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian relief workers and NATO continued to brace for a
new, massive influx. They erected thousands of tents to expand the
capacity of the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Newly arrived refugees continued to report that ``a huge
movement'' of ethnic Albanians within Kosovo is working its way
toward the borders of Albania and Macedonia, said Paula Ghedini,
spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). Macedonian government officials and international relief
workers have said as many as 100,000 new refugees could cross into
Macedonia over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's government has said it can host no more than 20,000
refugees because of the strain on its poor economy and delicate
ethnic balance. It said it was reluctant to allow the UNHCR to
establish new refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could destabilize Macedonia permanently,'' warned Prime
Minister Ljubco Georgievski in an interview Saturday with Cox News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ghedini said that UNHCR may reassess its stated goal of keeping
most of the refugees in neighboring countries. ``We see possibly
the need to evacuate more people in a faster period of time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the numbers being squeezed into hastily built
tents continues to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big tragedy, a disaster. Nobody is left,'' said Sokoi
Byrami, 32, shortly arriving in Albania. ``All Kosovo is covered by
flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of others, he was waiting at the Morina border point
10 miles from here Saturday morning in hopes of finding missing
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and two children had gotten separated from him and two
other children. The family had nothing, after Serb forces burned
their tractor that was packed with food and clothing for the flight
out of Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a two-year-old daughter. I am afraid that without
eating or drinking she will die,'' Byrami said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials monitoring incoming refugees said they are
receiving more reports of babies dying and being buried along the
road in Kosovo. On Saturday they began hearing of adults left dead
en route, because they were too weak from lack of food and the
exhausting walk, said Angela Walker, spokesperson for the U.N.
World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it on a day-by-day basis. We have enough food for
this influx today and we have stock for tomorrow (Sunday),'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blankets also are reported in good supply, but water is a vexing
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``More refugees means the water has to be stretched further,''
said Peter Sweetnam of Oxfam, who has been trying to arrange the
piping of spring water to tent camps. ``Please be aware. There is
no more water.''
</P>
<P>
   One other potential disaster: a four-year-old girl was confirmed
with a case of measles, in this largely unvaccinated population of
children.

DEMAND FOR OFFICE SPACE IN MANHATTAN COOLS SLIGHTLY FROM RED-HOT
PACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pace of office leasing in Manhattan softened
somewhat in the first quarter of 1999, after two torrid years. But
asking annual rents continued to increase _ exceeding $70 a square
foot in some locations, although the average remains much lower _
and real estate executives say they see nothing on the horizon to
prevent the industry from having another prosperous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the base of a slowly rising plateau,'' said Anthony
E. Malkin, the president of W&AMP;M Properties. ``Supply and demand are
very nearly in balance, with demand slightly exceeding supply. We
can't see dislocations anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by Insignia/ESG, a large
real-estate services company, 2.9 million square feet of office
space was leased in midtown Manhattan in the first quarter of 1999,
a substantial drop from the 5.5 million leased in the first three
months of 1998. And the amount of space added to the market
exceeded that taken off by 800,000 square feet, compared to the net
withdrawal of 450,000 square feet in the period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the average annual asking rent in midtown has
increased 20 percent over last year's first-quarter level,
according to the Insignia/ESG figures, to $44.79 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason there was a rush to close deals in the fourth
quarter and so some that were set for the first quarter got done
before the end of the year,'' said Joseph R. Harbert, the chief
operating officer of Insignia/ESG's New York Metro Region.
</P>
<P>
   Harbert said that rising rates were inducing some tenants to
leave midtown for less expensive parts of the city, but he added
that demand was such that rental rates still had room to climb.
``We have seen deals in the $70s,'' he said. ``Whatever dropoff
there was in the first quarter did not affect the high end of the
market. And prices have not peaked yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said part of the problem was the short supply of available
office space. ``When you have a primary availability of 7
percent,'' he said, ``it means there is just not enough space out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because each company has different ways of categorizing and
counting transactions, the numbers vary from report to report. But
the trends are clear in all the reports. ``The Manhattan office
market started 1999 at a slower pace after two back-to-back
record-breaking years,'' reported Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, another
large real estate services company.
</P>
<P>
   ``With traditional large space users stalling expansion, overall
leasing activity was down 17 percent from the first quarter of
1998, the lowest level of first quarter activity since 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no megadeals in the first quarter,'' said Alex
Cohen, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's senior manager for research. ``Reuters
and Rock West got done before the end of the year,'' he said,
referring to the 855,000 square foot building that the Reuters news
agency is building with the Rudin family at 42nd Street and Seventh
Avenue and the 1 million square foot building the financial
services company Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is planning to build
with the Rockefeller Group on a lot on Seventh Avenue between 49th
and 50th Streets, just west of Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of big deals in the quarter does not mean there are
none to be had, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the accounting firms of E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal and
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Nasdaq financial exchange and the CIBC
Oppenheimer financial services company are all looking for new
locations and each is shopping for about 1 million square feet of
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all looking for the best deal,'' Cohen said. ``They
just haven't found it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said premium buildings in prime locations, like 9 W. 57th
St., have been signing leases calling for annual rents in the ``low
to mid-$70s.'' He said demand remains strong for space along
Madison and Fifth avenues in the 50s by companies that feel they
need a presence in New York and a posh address as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brokers are being contacted by people who say they just
have to be in New York City,'' Cohen said. ``That part of the
market is as dynamic as any time in the last 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   While some companies track vacancy rates, Williams Real Estate
uses a different measure, the vacancy rate plus all space expected
to come on the market within a year, and calls it availability.
</P>
<P>
   By that measurement, the availability rate in Midtown South
decreased 0.4 percent to 7.8 percent, as a net 277,000 square feet
were taken off the market. This decline in space pushed the average
annual rent up 42 cents to $30.38 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The availability downtown moved in the opposite direction,
increasing from 12.1 percent to 13.2 percent as an additional 1.1
million square feet was added to the market. But the rent trend was
the same as the rest of Manhattan, with annual rent moving up 20
cents a square foot to $31.49.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Williams view, availability increased from 9.7 percent
to 10.2 percent in the quarter, which added a bit of liquidity to
the market, but is not statistically significant,'' said Robert L.
Freedman, the company's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said the explanation for the increase in rents and
availability downtown was the completion of renovation programs in
older buildings in the area and the offering of space to the
market. ``A number of buildings have been redeveloped and the rents
reflect the better bricks and mortar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to his company's calculations, the average annual
asking rent in Manhattan is $38.45 a square foot, up $1.02 in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said the question is where the ``sweet spot'' is in the
current market; that is, the highest rent tenants will accept
without motivating them to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He said that $50 a square foot in annual rent was a resistance
point for many companies, so the question is how much below $50 is
considered acceptable. ``The sweet spot is probably around $42-$43
a foot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If that is as high as most tenants are prepared to go, it
ensures that there will be no new construction in midtown, because
rents of at least $50 a square foot are needed to justify building,
Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   The strong market is permitting landlords to reduce their
concessions packages, which have already shriveled from those in
the early and middle years of the decade. In those times owners
offered hefty packages of $40 or more a square foot for the cost of
interior alterations, and free rents of a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Midtown South, in Flatiron, in Chelsea, the rents are up 20
to 30 percent and the owners are offering nothing for work, they
are as-is deals,'' said James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth
Partners, which represents tenants.
</P>
<P>
   He added that free rent was down to three or fourth months,
which is the time it takes to build the interior and during which
the tenant is not occupying the space. He said the lack of space
and the stiff terms being demanded by landlords are going to lead
companies to look for alternatives. ``Some people are being driven
to the fringes, to places that had not even been looked at
before,'' he said. ``Now people are looking at Ninth and 10th
avenues in the 40s and 50s.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the architectural firm Gwathmey Siegel &AMP;
Associates had located at 475 10th Ave. at 36th Street, a 1913
industrial building that was renovated in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives attribute the current prosperity to
the turmoil in debt markets that started last August and gradually
settled down during the rest of the year. Steeply increased prices
for capital reduce the availability of funds for development, they
say, preventing overbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant fact today is the overhang from the
capital markets of last year,'' Malkin said. ``Risk capital for new
development has disappeared. It's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Financial markets are quite healthy for viable
projects. The money is available.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the uncertainty about buyers obtaining financing had
caused many companies, including his own, to withdraw properties
from the market or not offer them at all. ``When the capital market
took the guns and swords out of the hands of children the
transactions market was distorted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the crisis largely resolved, he said, he expects
property sales to begin to resume in the second quarter.

THOUSANDS HAIL UCONN AT PARADE HONORING TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Tens of thousands of faithful fans took to the
chilly streets here Saturday for a parade saluting the University
of Connecticut men's basketball team, which won this year's
national championship after years of late-season heartbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The UConn players donned T-shirts declaring ``Mission
Accomplished'' for the team's victory lap through the Connecticut
capital on a flatbed towed by a tractor-trailer, which drove slowly
enough for the state's heroes to dispense autographs and low-fives.
Three eighth-grade girls from Bristol vied for blown kisses by
wearing Husky boxer shorts and a basketball net on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The mushers from the Connecticut Valley Siberian Husky Club
delighted children with a sled towed by white huskies, just like
the UConn mascot. Rambunctious spectators showered the team and
coach Jim Calhoun with Silly String, and signs proclaimed ``The
Year of the Dog'' and ``Coach Calhoun for President.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the parade, cheers turned to shrieks when,
police said, an exuberant child darted into the street and was hit
by a police motorcycle. The parade halted briefly but resumed after
the girl was taken to Hartford Hospital, where she was listed in
stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Fans had arrived as early as 5:30 a.m. for the 11 a.m. March of
Champions, which Hartford officials billed as the city's biggest
event since the celebration of the end of World War II in 1945. The
mayor's office estimated that 250,000 turned out to honor the team,
which had made it to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA finals seven times in
10 years, but until this year had never cracked the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through all the Huskies' bad times _ these are the good
times,'' said Marilyn D'Andrea, 58, an order-entry worker from
Wallingford. ``We need more good things in the world, and
especially in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a compact state and the lack of any major
league team has made UConn basketball a unifying obsession for
Connecticut. Gov. John Rowland, who strolled the
one-and-a-half-mile route in a Husky sweatshirt and khakis, said:
``The excitement and the pride and the community spirit that we
have now, it's very infectious. I hope it lasts a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Patty Rowland, added, ``We want to know where
all these people were in January, at the inaugural parade.''
</P>
<P>
   A bit of a shadow had been cast over the festivities when Khalid
El-Amin, the star point guard, was charged Tuesday with marijuana
possession after being stopped for running a red light in Hartford.
El-Amin went to court two days later, accepting a sentence that
requires him to perform six hours of community service and give
antidrug speeches at three middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   One vendor tried to capitalize on the arrest by selling
Cat-in-the-Hat-style hats festooned with marijuana leaves.
Saturday's crowd was in a forgiving mood, however, and most
spectators said El-Amin, 19, had simply made a youthful mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Bronson, 37, had brought along a Sports Illustrated
commemorative issue, ``Top Dogs,'' with El-Amin on the cover, in
hopes of snagging an autograph. ``The cops should have just slapped
him on the head and let him go,'' she said, in a sentiment that was
echoed by many.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants and bars in the downtown area, which is usually
deserted during the day on weekends, opened for the occasion. A
popular bar with no name, known to locals as ``No Name,'' warmed up
fans with drinks called Lucky Dog (tequila and tonic) and Husky
Blue (schnapps, Sprite and a blue liqueur).
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour parade and a rally that followed at the Capitol,
including presentation of the Waterford crystal trophy, were
carried live on four Connecticut television stations. At 11:30 a.m.
on Sunday, WFSB Channel 3, the CBS station, is to replay UConn's
77-74 upset of Duke in the championship on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have shocked the world, but you did not shock all of
your fans here back in the state,'' Rowland said at the ceremony.
After El-Amin was introduced, he grinned as he acknowledged a
second round of applause that amounted to a supportive curtain
call.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had planned for 40 parade units, but that quickly
grew to 70, and 30 or so others were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Several bands boomed from flatbed trucks, including one with a
name that would have been sure to provoke raspberries in this
crowd: Duke and the Esoterics. For the day, the band playfully
crossed out the ``Duke'' on its banner and became ``Hugh Cohn and
the Esoterics.''
</P>
<P>
   The day brought out all of the state's political royalty, with
the exception of the lieutenant governor, M. Jodi Rell, who kept
her months-old promise to throw out the first ball for the Wilton,
Conn., Little League.
</P>
<P>
   The Husky triumph seemed to inspire long-suffering fans
everywhere. At the turn onto Jewell Street, a bedsheet decorated
with blue paw prints proclaimed, ``Dreams Do Come True.'' Someone
had added, ``Go Red Sox.''

   CRANFORD, N.J. _ The priests, the pastors and the rabbis of the
Cranford Clergy Council were having their usual Monday morning
breakfast meeting at the Family Diner on North Avenue the other day
when one of them asked, ``Did you see where the atheists have moved
to town?'' and someone else said, ``Well, we've got to find out
where they are and invite them to our Monday meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   As he recalls the moment, the Rev. George Freyberger of Calvary
Lutheran laughs so hard that the conversation starts to run off
track and into a bog of speculation about the nature of unbelief _
isn't it a kind of belief? _ and away from the news.
</P>
<P>
   That news, as everyone in town has heard by now, is that
American Atheists Inc., slayers of prayer in school and strict
constructionists of the establishment clause of the First
Amendment, have indeed moved from Austin, Texas, to a new national
headquarters in this pleasant inner suburb of Elizabeth, the better
to fight against Americans' tendency to mix government with
religion.
</P>
<P>
   They won't have to look far. As in a lot of other places,
Cranford's houses of worship are up to their rafters in government
business. Members of the clergy council rotate saying opening
prayers at the Cranford Town Council meetings, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Local observances of Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King Jr. Day
and Yom ha-Shoah, the Holocaust Remembrance Day, are suffused with
elements of church and state, with the clergy praying and
sermonizing and elected officials reading proclamations and
memorializing.
</P>
<P>
   And when Union County Social Services takes in a homeless
family, where do they turn? Among their options are the 12 Cranford
houses of worship that rotate duties as shelters, each serving
about a month, for families in distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 37 years as a pastor, I have never found a community where
the houses of worship and the pastors and rabbis work so closely
together with each other and with the government for the good of
the community,'' Freyberger said.
</P>
<P>
   So with church and state happily coexisting, the reaction to the
newcomers down around Walnut Street and South Avenue, where
Cranford is rebuilding its downtown, was pretty much a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're very interested in us,'' said Benjamin
Hardin, a dry-cleaning materials distributor who was catching the
train to New York. ``I'm a little surprised they came here instead
of the city, but it's a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranford has about 25,000 residents and was famous in the 1920s
as ``The Venice of New Jersey,'' for the way the Rahway River
meanders through town. These days it is a bedroom community for
commuters to New York City and the ring of office parks built along
the rail lines to the city.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Ron Barrier, the atheists' spokesman, the
organization chose Cranford for the same reasons hundreds of other
office-based concerns have moved to the area _ it was pretty and
clean, close to New York but without New York prices. ``Anybody
who's involved in a cause has to be situated in the New York
City-Washington, D.C., corridor,'' he said. ``This is the
communications center of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The atheists held the ribbon-cutting of their new headquarters _
on Christiani Street _ just two weeks ago, and the silence that
followed the news was another reason the nonbelievers came here,
Barrier said. ``In Texas, we used to get hate mail and hate calls
all the time, but we haven't had any here and we don't expect
any,'' he said, adding, ``This is a more enlightened part of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   John Laezza, the Cranford town manager, made pretty much the
same point. ``It's not like they came in here with banners flying
saying they were going to save the world,'' he said. ``When people
read it in the paper we got some calls along the lines of `Did we
know this was happening?' and some wanted to know if we could stop
it. But people are basically saying it's a free country and they
don't need our permission to move in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two sides remain in the wary watching stage of
new-neighborness. ``I just hope they're a tax-paying entity and
aren't going to file for a tax exemption,'' Laezza said.

AN AMERICAN'S ODYSSEY TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE WORLD'S GAME'S U.S.
LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soccer career of Jesse Van Saun has been anything but dull.
From leading the St. John's program to the 1996 NCAA championship
to undergoing surgery for a serious injury two years later, Van
Saun has experienced the heights and depths of his chosen sport.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, he has maintained a level head that has
helped him home in on a professional career in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Van Saun's soccer odyssey began when he was 4 years old and his
parents registered him in a league for 6 and 7 year olds. The
precocious Van Saun excelled against the older players, but he
still could not get peers interested in his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something comes naturally, you should try to excel at
it,'' said Van Saun, 22, a native of Hillsdale, N.J. ``It was tough
for a while when I was growing up because my friends really weren't
interested in the game, but I love to play so it didn't matter. It
never crossed my mind to ever give the game of soccer up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even when he was cut at age 16 from the New Jersey state
team by coach Dave Masur. ``It was a difficult process,'' Masur
said in his own defense, ``evaluating all of the players in such a
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it turned out, I may have overlooked Jesse when I made the
cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach would have another chance to evaluate Van Saun, and
this time Masur did not let the youngster get away.
</P>
<P>
   Masur became the head coach at St. John's in 1991, and he
offered Van Saun, an attacking midfielder for Pascack Valley High
School, a partial athletic scholarship for the fall of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on,'' Masur said, ``I said to Jesse, `Why didn't you try
out for the state team?' He said, `Because you cut me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Van Saun, who describes Masur as precise and a perfectionist,
credits the Red Storm coach with helping develop his skills as a
player, focusing on discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Masur's method involved visualization. Before each game,
the coach would ask the players to close their eyes and clear their
heads. He would then tell them to see themselves performing well
the next day during the game.
</P>
<P>
   The St. John's players began to believe in themselves and, long
story short, improved so much that they won the national
championship in 1996. The soccer team did what the school's proud
and renowned basketball program had never done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public reaction,'' Van Saun said, ``was incredibly
positive. You could immediately tell the difference in the way we
were perceived. The students at the school knew we were good
before, but they had never come out to support us until '96. The
community around the campus also embraced us after we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Having helped to win a national title in his sophomore year, a
dream season in which he led the Red Storm in scoring with 16 goals
and was named the most valuable player of the championship game,
Van Saun found his own act a tough one to follow. As a junior, he
scored only five goals and St. John's made a disappointing
second-round exit from the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 39 goals and 25 assists in four years for St.
John's, Van Saun left school a few credits short of graduation and
decided to turn pro. He entered the MLS draft and was selected by
the New England Revolution in the second round in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought I would be drafted by the MetroStars, because it
was close to home,'' Van Saun said. ``But the New England
organization was unbelievable. Robert and Jonathan Kraft give the
players a lot of attention and the fans in the area really
supported us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts are the team's owner-investors, and also own the New
England Patriots of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Van Saun appeared in only five games in his first year with the
Revolution, playing a total of 117 minutes, and was hampered
throughout the season by a severe groin injury. Last December, Van
Saun underwent surgery as doctors cut into his abdomen to release
tension on his pelvic area.
</P>
<P>
   He worked back into game shape for the 1999 season, but did not
play in New England's first two games and was released on April 7.
Five days later, he got a call from Bob Bradley, coach of the MLS
defending champion Chicago Fire. Bradley, the former coach at
Princeton, knew Van Saun from the schoolboy's playing days in New
Jersey. Last Monday, Van Saun was claimed on waivers by Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse needs experience, he has to grow on the job,'' Bradley
said of the 5-foot-9-inch, 160-pound scorer and playmaker. ``We are
always trying to put together a good roster with young players. We
think Jesse is that kind of player and that he will develop and
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Saun was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bradley told me that the organization is looking to gather
young, talented players,'' Van Saun said. ``They want to see what I
can do. There are no guarantees, but I heard great things about
Chicago and I am looking for a new start. &QL;

U.S. DOESN'T MISS DAVENPORT AS RUBIN TOPS MAJOLI IN FED CUP
OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Chanda Rubin, the designated replacement player
at this replacement site at Raleigh Racquet Club stepped in for the
injured Lindsay Davenport admirably Saturday and pulled off an
arduous 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 10-8 Fed Cup victory against Croatia's top
player, Iva Majoli.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's perseverance against the erratic Majoli, who hasn't won
a title since her breakthrough at the 1997 French Open, gave the
United States a 1-0 lead in the weekend's best-of-five-match series
against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans win, their next opponent will be the winner of
Spain-Italy. After the two singles matches Saturday in Reggio
Calabria, Italy, the two countries are tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   After being broken three times as she served for the victory at
5-4, 6-5, and 7-6, Rubin fell behind by 8-7 when Majoli ended a
five-game-long streak of broken service games by holding with a
backhand winner. More poised as the pursuer than the front-runner,
Rubin held for 8-8, and broke for 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she only had to hang tough on serve to convert this epic
match into a point for her nation. And finally, when she
desperately needed to, Rubin got herself to double match point with
an ace and ended things on her second match point when Majoli
netted a tired forehand 2 hours 46 minutes after the struggle
began.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the first set, the players battled a chilly,
skirt-blowing breeze that stole their shots and stirred up the
clammy green clay underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   They traded breaks in the fifth and sixth games, with Rubin
surrendering her serve with a netted backhand but breaking straight
back with a crisp cross-court forehand. The pair battled into a tie
breaker, where they stayed on serve until Majoli suddenly succumbed
to the tension and double faulted to give Rubin a set point at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin thought she had converted the set with an ace, but the
serve was called a let and had to be replayed. Rubin finally
captured the set in the tie breaker by blasting in another first
serve and following it with an untouchable down-the-line forehand.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first player to falter in the second set was Rubin, who fell
behind, 4-2, when she belted a backhand out of bounds at break
point. But just as she had in the opening set, she broke back
immediately. In trouble again on her next service game, Rubin
fended off four break points, the last with an ace, before finally
holding serve to level the set at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Majoli evened the match by breaking Rubin in the 10th game,
this time with a forehand that clipped the net and dropped over for
a winner to send them to a third and deciding set.
</P>
<P>
   Majoli, such a mainstay for the Croatian squad that its captain,
Vjeran Friscic, allowed her to show up for duty three days late on
Thursday, hasn't won a tournament title since she trounced Martina
Hingis, 6-4, 6-2, in the final of the 1997 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Seeded ninth there, at 19, Majoli became the lowest-seeded Slam
champion in the Open era. Majoli's first and only Grand Slam title
sent her ranking soaring to fourth in the world, but her dry spell
in the ensuing two seasons has caused her to plummet to No. 32, a
position far inferior to her talent.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 23nd-ranked Rubin, who once reached a career high of
sixth, Majoli, just 21, finds herself in the strange position of
trying to fight her way back to the stature she enjoyed while still
a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   But at least in Fed Cup, Majoli has been a reliable performer:
her 14-6 singles record is the reason Croatia managed to improve
itself into the elite World Group this year after defeating Japan
and the Netherlands in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin learned Wednesday night that she would be standing in for
Davenport, a role she also assumed in 1995 against Spain. Davenport
was unable to launch her two-handed backhand with any semblance of
authority due to tendinitis that set in after she sprained her left
wrist three weeks ago at Key Biscayne and informed team captain
Billie Jean King that she was unfit for singles duty. Rubin, with
her 2-2 Fed Cup singles record and 2-2 record against Majoli, was
the obvious replacement.
</P>
<P>
   This year has brought encouraging results for Rubin, whose
recovery from the wrist problem that required major surgery and
ruined her Olympic chances in 1996 has been maddeningly slow.
</P>
<P>
   She won her second career title at Hobart, Australia, in
January, and in March at Indian Wells, she reached the semifinals
by upsetting top-ranked Martina Hingis. According to King, who had
selected Rubin for that 1996 Olympic squad, the Lafayette, La.,
native is playing the most promising tennis of her career and is
the reason there was no panic in the American camp after it lost
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   King had a similar comment to make about this round's Fed Cup
anchorwoman, the Yugoslav-born Monica Seles, who became available
once the round was relocated from Zagreb to Raleigh and assumed the
head role for singles and doubles upon Davenport's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's getting better and better,'' King said, she's back in a
big way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's second singles match, Seles faced the 70th-ranked
Silvja Talaja. The two have never played each other, but they did
have one thing in common, unblemished Fed Cup records: Seles is
8-0, Talaja 5-0.

QUEENS PROSECUTOR TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR ACCUSED KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, has
decided to seek the death penalty for a man charged with killing
two people in separate robberies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who describes himself as an opponent of capital
punishment, said he reached his decision after a ``painstakingly
thorough review of all of the facts and circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the third time prosecutors in Queens have sought the death
penalty since capital punishment was revived in New York state in
1995. Since then, only two defendants statewide have been sentenced
to death, and both are appealing the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Steven Smelefsky, 34, of Ridgewood, Queens, is
charged with first-degree murder in the slayings of two Queens
residents during robberies with different accomplices. Both
accomplices have been charged with second-degree murder, which is
not a capital offense in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that after reviewing his office's findings, materials
presented by lawyers for Smelefsky and meetings with the victims'
families, he concluded that ``a sentence of death would be
justified if the defendant were convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, Smelefsky waited for a 92-year-old neighbor
in the garage of their building at 1724 Gates Ave., and attacked
him when he got out of his car. Authorities said Smelefsky then
bound the victim, Louis Thumudo, and threw him into the trunk of
his car.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that with his accomplice, Rubin Ortega, 44,
Smelefsky drove to Stroud Township in Pennsylvania and dumped
Thumudo by the side of the road. His body was found on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, authorities said, Smelefsky and an
accomplice went to the Rego Park, Queens, home of a friend,
44-year-old George Capobianco, on July 31. The authorities said
that Smelefsky and the accomplice, Keith Knoesel, 29, hit
Capobianco with a bottle and stabbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, according to the indictment, they
returned to Capobianco's house to steal his property, and were
arrested getting into his car.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from the capital defender's office in Manhattan, who are
representing Smelefsky, said they were ``deeply disappointed'' with
Brown's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case does not fit into the extremely narrow range of
cases where a jury should be asked to decide if the penalty of
death is warranted,'' they said. ``In short, Steve Smelefsky is not
among the worst of the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City prosecutors who oppose the death penalty have had
to resist intense political pressure to seek it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, nor
the Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, have ever brought a
death penalty case.

FREED SUSPECT TELLS OF TERROR DURING ARREST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man wrongly held for nearly a week as the prime
suspect in the killing of an Orange, N.J., policewoman told
Saturday of being assaulted as his family was terrorized by masked
police officers in a predawn arrest raid at his home, and said he
intended to file a civil rights lawsuit against the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Everett, a 24-year-old computer repair service clerk,
said that ski-masked, heavily armed officers hunting for the killer
of Officer Joyce Anne Carnegie broke into his home at 5:30 a.m. on
April 10, handcuffed his wife and mother, and, as his 5-year-old
son watched, threw him to the floor and handcuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started kicking and punching and spitting at me,''
Everett said at a news conference at the Newark office of his
lawyers on the morning after his release and exoneration by the
Essex County prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt. His wife, Ebony, 22, who
is six months pregnant, and other members of his family attended
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw me into the kitchen and an officer hit me with the
butt of his gun,'' he said. ``It was crazy. When they brought me
outside, there were police standing there, saying `We got him,' and
they started applauding.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in custody at the Prosecutor's office, he said, he took
two lie-detector tests, which he passed, although he said he was
told he had failed both, and gave interrogators detailed accounts
of being with his wife and eating hamburgers at a restaurant at the
time Carnegie was slain.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who still bore a blackened left eye and bruised cheek
that had been evident at his arraignment, did not criticize the
prosecutor's handling of the case, and said he had not been
mistreated during his week at the Essex County Jail. But he called
on the prosecutor's office to investigate the conduct of the
Orange, East Orange and State Police Departments during his arrest,
and said he would file a civil rights suit against the law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a harrowing experience for Everett and his family,''
said Ronald Hunt, a lawyer for Everett. ``He made it clear to us
that he was not the person involved. We followed up on all the
information he gave us, and it became clear he was not the person.
We're overjoyed for him and his family, but there are obviously
some repercussions from this that he has suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt added: ``It's important to recognize that he was dragged
out of his house at 5:30 in the morning and charged with the crime
of killing a police officer, a police officer who was beloved in
the community. He was assaulted in police custody. He was
incarcerated and, minimally, faced a murder sentence that could
have been 30 years to life, and possibly a death sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Hurt, Ray Weiss, said Saturday that the
prosecutor's office had no comment on Everett's statements or on
any other aspect of what he characterized as a continuing
investigation. Officials with the Orange and East Orange Police
Departments could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt had emphasized at a news conference Friday night that
Everett, whose release she was announcing, had been taken into
custody on the strength of identifications by four witnesses _ one
said to have seen the shooting, and three people who had been
robbed on nearby streets in the hours before the shooting,
purportedly by the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt declined to say what led investigators to Everett
initially. But other officials have said the witnesses picked
Everett because he bore a superficial resemblance to a police
sketch of a suspect in the killing, a bald man with a goatee. In
addition, the witnesses were said to have picked him from a police
photo array.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who is bald and wears a goatee, has a police record. He
served more than three years in prison on a robbery conviction, and
has been on parole since April 8, 1997. Aside from his arrest in
the Carnegie case, he has had no brushes with the law since then,
his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's release ended a week of twists, turns, riddles and
confusion in a case that has evolved from the death of an officer
into a perplexing tangle of events _ three arrests, a jumble of
charges and countercharges, the death of one suspect in custody,
misgivings among law enforcement officials and accounts of turmoil
in the Prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Everett, two other men were arrested last Sunday. One,
Earl Faison, 27, an aspiring rap artist, collapsed and died about
an hour after being taken into custody. The police suggested that
the cause was a severe asthma attack, but his father contended that
he was beaten to death by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Another man seized in the investigation, James Coker, 29, of
Newark, has been charged only with possession of drugs, and some
law enforcement officials have insisted that his name should not
have been cited in the Carnegie case and say he is not a suspect in
her killing.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture of turmoil in the inquiry, Ms. Hurt's
top aide, Patrick Toscano, resigned at midweek. He was the third
top official of the prosecutor's office to resign in the last two
months. Toscano denied that his departure had anything to do with
the Carnegie case, but other officials said mounting professional
difference between Ms. Hurt and her staff accounted for the staff
defections.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation took yet another turn Saturday. A report in
The Star-Ledger of Newark said investigators had gone to Georgia in
search of a man purportedly linked to a gun that was believed to be
used to kill Carnegie. She was shot in the abdomen and head on a
desolate street in Orange on the night of April 8 when she
approached a suspect in two armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators from the prosecutor's office and the Federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were said to be searching
for Cordell Woodson, a man with a criminal record in New Jersey and
the South, who was living in Orange at the time of the officer's
murder but has since vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The published report quoted unidentified law enforcement
officials as saying that Woodson was not necessarily a suspect, but
that his name surfaced in the inquiry after federal agents traced a
9-millimeter pistol, believed to be the murder weapon, to him in
Georgia using its serial number. The report said a partial
fingerprint found on the gun had not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's status as the prime suspect had been questioned from
the start by some law enforcement officials, who said privately
that they were not persuaded that he was the killer or that there
was enough evidence to charge him. There were other reports quoting
investigators as saying they had urged Ms. Hurt not to charge him
until his alibi and other factors had been evaluated.

SAILING SOLO ROUND THE WORLD, AN AMERICAN IN DISTRESS DISCOVERS
MANY FRIENDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Calif., Uruguay, Argentina, Great Britain, France,
Russia)   By SUSAN B. ADAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither wind nor rain nor broken mast will keep the American
solo sailor Brad Van Liew from the completion of his appointed
round. Or so it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Van Liew's odyssey in the Around Alone yacht race _ his first
solo circumnavigation _ seemed over as recently as last Sunday,
when he despondently reported that his 50-foot yacht Balance Bar
had been dismasted in a fierce squall and 10-to-15-foot seas less
than 90 miles out of Punta del Este, Uruguay. Van Liew and the
eight other solo sailors in the fleet were one day out of port en
route to Charleston, S.C., on the fourth and final leg of the
27,000-mile voyage that began last September.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Van Liew, a 31-year-old Californian who is the
youngest competitor in the race and the only American, limped back
to Punta del Este under jury rig, his team and other supporters
were rallying to his side. His wife, Meaghan, and the rest of his
team returned to the Uruguayan port to spearhead a fund-raising
effort with local volunteers; fellow sailors offered encouragement
and equipment; Hall Spars/Argentina said it could build a
replacement aluminum mast in 30 hours, and the Balance Bar Co., Van
Liew's sponsor based in Carpinteria, Calif., said it would match
every dollar raised by his ground crew to pay for the repairs and
new gear.
</P>
<P>
   Van Liew said Thursday that he hoped to be back in the race by
Saturday. ``I feel absolutely awesome,'' Van Liew said. ``It feels
like the world has picked me up by the scruff of my neck and said,
`You will not stop here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bond that develops between sailors in an event like the
Around Alone can make for extraordinary displays of sportsmanship,
and his peers rallied around Van Liew in his distress. When they
heard of the dismasting, Jean-Pierre Mouligne, the current overall
leader of Class II for 40-to-50-foot yachts, immediately diverted
to assist, as did Mike Garside on Magellan Alpha.
</P>
<P>
   Van Liew and Garside, who had battled each other for second
place in Class II for the better part of three legs, had struck up
a friendship, talking almost daily and encouraging each other as
they competed. By the end of Leg 3, less than 10 hours separated
the pair. When he heard of Van Liew's misfortune from race
headquarters, Garside was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like crying,'' the 54-year-old British sailor wrote in
an e-mail posted on the Around Alone Web site. ``The message was
bald enough. It simply said that Balance Bar had been dismasted and
that my young friend Brad was cutting away the fallen spars.''
</P>
<P>
   Garside said he felt better when Van Liew ``e-mailed to say he
was well on his way back to Punta under jury rig.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had more offers of help than he could possibly need and he
felt sure something would turn up for the good,'' Garside wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those offers, Marc Thiercelin, the Frenchman now in
second place in Class I for 60-foot boats, pledged a mast and a
full set of sails to his stricken fleetmate. Before the start of
Leg 4, Thiercelin had received a new carbon fiber mast, but his
temporary aluminum replacement mast was too large for the 50-foot
Balance Bar. Thiercelin's sails would do, however, and they were
being cut down and resewn to fit Van Liew's smaller rig.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the water at the front of the fleet, Giovanni
Soldini and Thiercelin, the two sailors left in Class I, were
leading the race to Charleston. Soldini aboard Fila led Thiercelin
on Somewhere by some 20 miles with about 4,700 miles to go before
the finish. Through Friday, the two were making their way up the
coast of South America with Soldini following a course as close to
the shore as winds allowed and Thiercelin much farther east. Both
looked as if they would stay just ahead of a fierce southern cold
front that was predicted to move through the rest of the fleet this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 miles behind Thiercelin, Garside was leading Class II
yachts, followed by Mouligne (Cray Valley); Viktor Yazykov (Wind of
Change Russia); Neal Petersen (No Barriers); Minori Saito
(Shuten-dohji II), and Neil Hunter (Paladin II).
</P>
<P>
   The wind from the cold front will push the Class II yachts
forward, but they will also run into the Brazilian Current and be
subject to ``really awful sailing conditions,'' according to Ken
Campbell of Commanders' Weather. By contrast, Fila and Somewhere
will beat into brisk northerly headwinds of 25 knots.  &QL;

 &HT;    POLL: GORE IMAGE WILTING UNDER WEIGHT OF CLINTON SCANDALS
 &HT;    Moving in both (w) Washington and (p) Politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore's campaign for president is starting to
feel Bill Clinton's pain -- that is, the fallout from the Clinton
administration scandals is beginning to contribute to the vice
president's declining favorability ratings, according to a new Pew
Research Center poll.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three out of four Americans polled by the center agreed
with the statement that they are ``tired of all the problems
associated with the Clinton administration'' -- a clear indication
that Gore is vulnerable to Republican suggestions that it is simply
``time for a change'' in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ``clearly hurt by weariness with problems of the Clinton
administration,'' said Andrew Kohut, the director of the research
center and its chief pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, for the first time since September 1997, when
allegations of wrongdoing in the vice president's reelection
fundraising activities first surfaced, Gore's favorability ratings
have slipped below 50 percent in the Pew poll, which was released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 47 percent of the public holds a favorable opinion of
Gore, significantly below the 58 percent favorable rating he
registered just before the Republican-led Congress began its
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the new poll suggests that Gore has some personal
image problems -- that is, a sizeable number of Americans simply
don't like the vice president, or rather, the caricature that Gore
himself has helped to promote: boring, dull, stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 percent of voters used positive words to describe Gore
in the latest Pew poll, compared to 32 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly a quarter of those polled used mocking words such as
``wimp'' or ``wooden'' to describe Gore. When voters volunteer such
negative terms to describe Gore, ``it may be their way of saying
they just don't like Al Gore,'' said Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, then, the task in seeking the Democratic Party's 2000
presidential nomination is to reintroduce himself to the American
people -- perhaps even, after having spent half of his 50 years in
public life, to reinvent himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the fact that he is vice president
and the vice presidency usually is a shadow role,'' said Gore
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar. ``And it's hard for a vice
president to define himself, but that's what we're fixing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans like Gore better than Clinton as a person, but
not by an overwhelming margin in the latest Pew poll, given Gore's
``Boy Scout'' image. Fifty-two percent agreed with the statement,
``I like Al Gore better as a person than Bill Clinton.''
Thirty-five percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't see Gore as more caring than Clinton. Only 34
percent agreed with the statement, ``Al Gore cares more than Bill
Clinton about people like me.'' Fifty percent disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is no Bill Clinton,'' said Darrell West, a political
scientist at Brown University. ``The vice president lacks the
president's personal charisma and ability to connect to voters.''
And while he is seen as more ethical than Clinton, Gore ``is having
problems controlling his own destiny,'' West added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem is not with Democrats, however. Seventy-one
percent hold a favorable opinion of him. And in the current
one-on-one scrimmage with NBA Hall of Famer Bill Bradley, the vice
president is the overwhelming favorite to win the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problem is with the American public at large,
specifically, independent and female voters and his fellow baby
boomers, as reflected in the Pew poll's latest theoretical match-up
of Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the
Republican 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In this poll, taken in the last week of March, Gore trails Bush
41-54 percent, a much wider margin than in January, when he trailed
the Texas governor 44-50 percent. Gore leads Bush only among
non-whites, senior citizens and urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the gender gap that helped fuel Clinton's
reelection in 1996 is helping Gore only at the margins. Women
prefer Bush over Gore by a margin of 52-42 percent. Men choose Bush
by a wider margin, 57-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Center's analysis of its polling data noted, however,
that Gore ``might take some comfort'' in the fact that early
presidential trial heat polls have a notoriously poor track record.
Not since 1967 have polls taken in the first quarter of the year
preceding a presidential election accurately forecast the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, the latest example, then-Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole led Clinton by 6 percentage points in the polls,
but lost the election 49 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by telephone March 24-30. It involved a
national sample of 1,786 adults 18 years of age or older. The
margin of error was 3 percent.

 &HT;    Hot flames, cool heads: Men just doing their job thrill nation
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only God, the young fire-eater said later, could have
brought him together with the cool-handed pros and the stony-faced
workman in the moment that transfixed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he is right, for no film director with millions to spend
could have assembled a better cast than those four men _ the
exhausted, adrenaline-driven firefighter eager to risk his life,
the steely-eyed veteran fliers just doing what they're paid to do,
and a quiet man who didn't flinch when death began licking at his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The day they came together began routinely enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ivers Sims lives in the little Alabama town of Woodland, and to
get to work at the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill in Atlanta by 6:30
a.m. he has to get up at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gone,'' he whispered to his wife, Mariland, before dawn
Monday. ``See ya' later,'' Mariland, who works nights in Wedowee,
merely mumbled at him.
</P>
<P>
   Sims, 49, a slender, medium-sized man with large spectacles and
a taciturn demeanor, laughs readily but doesn't talk much.
</P>
<P>
   He's an operating engineer. There isn't a piece of heavy
equipment made that he can't handle. For the past six months, he'd
been operating a high-rise crane for the Jasper Construction Co. at
the renovation project where the old mill is being turned into loft
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The alarm clock roused Matt Moseley at 4:45 a.m. Monday, but as
usual he punched the snooze button. The second alarm got him out of
bed at 5. It wasn't easy. He had had friends over Sunday night for
hickory-grilled steaks.
</P>
<P>
   He put on the blue fatigues of an Atlanta firefighter and headed
for work. It's a long haul from Moseley's house in Locust Grove up
Interstate 75 to Station No. 4 in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley is 30 but he doesn't look it, with blue eyes in an
unlined face under a pale blond crew-cut. Out of uniform, he could
be mistaken for a young businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, something more than a firefighter. He is a
member of Squad 4 _ specialists in hazardous materials and what the
department euphemistically calls ``heavy rescue.'' The men in Squad
4 fight fires alongside other firefighters but also undergo
intensive training in their specialties. They are the Navy SEALs,
the Army Rangers, of the Atlanta Fire Department. It was still dark
when Moseley left home for his 24-hour shift. A chill had come back
into the air after the warm weekend, and a stiff wind was blowing.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Clines got her husband, Boyd, up at 8 a.m. as usual
Monday. She has to get up earlier to get to work at Alexander High
in Douglasville. It was their first day back at work after a week
of vacation; they had returned from Boston on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clines is 52, a tall, slender man who towers over his tiny wife.
His has piecrcing eyes slightly squinted with a pattern of fine
wrinkles at the corners. A pilot, he has flown helicopters all his
adult life.
</P>
<P>
   He flies them now for the Department of Natural Resources,
following stints with Fulton County and Atlanta police and the Army
in Vietnam. He seems to live in a cocoon of perpetual calm; his
chief betrayal of emotion is a slight elevation of his right
eyebrow, frequently followed by a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rogers and his wife, Marsha, drive to work together from
their home in Canton. They got a late start Monday, and traffic was
tough. The commute to Charley Brown Airport off Fulton Industrial
Boulevard usually takes about an hour. But almost 1 1/2 hours had
passed by the time he dropped her off at her office a couple of
minutes from the DNR hangar.
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers is on the ground, he is a helicopter mechanic. In
the air, he is a crew chief. He spent nine years with the State
Patrol's helicopters before coming over to DNR.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, shy man of 43 with thinning blond hair and chubby
cheeks, he doesn't have a lot to say until the subject turns to the
stuff he works with. His eyes light up when he talks about ropes
and carabiners, Billy Pugh baskets and helicopter belly bands.
</P>
<P>
   At Station 4, Moseley opened his locker, hauled out his gear,
checked it over and put it next to the Squad 4 truck, known simply
as ``the squad.'' He headed to the kitchen, where Jose MacAdams,
Monday's designated cook for the Ellis Street Breakfast Club, was
whipping up eggs, bacon, and grits.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost done when the alarm bell rang and the eerie,
electronically disembodied voice of the dispatcher announced a
possible chlorine gas leak on Johnson Ferry Road. Squad 4 went
without breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley is the science officer for Squad 4. As the squad truck
raced north through the traffic-clogged streets, he crouched in the
back, thumbing through the hazardous materials library. He didn't
have to be told that chlorine gas is deadly, but he had to refresh
himself on every detail of dealing with it. But there was no
chlorine gas, and it was 11 a.m. when the squad backed into the
station house.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was just rising when Sims climbed the ladder to the
operator's cab in his 220-foot high Paco tower crane. He usually
had to take a breather during the trip up, but on Monday he went up
without stopping. He was glad he'd buttoned an extra shirt over his
normal pullover. The wind indicator in the cab was showing gusts up
to 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a clear, beautiful morning, and he took time to enjoy
the view from his steel aerie. It was cramped, but he'd found room
for some groceries, a hot plate, a toaster oven and a cooler. With
a long rope, he hauled, hand-over-hand, a bag of ice up to the cab
to keep his Cokes cold.
</P>
<P>
   At Charley Brown Airport, more properly known as Fulton County
Airport, Clines settled down at his desk to catch up on paperwork.
He chatted with Maj. Mike Thompson, commander of the DNR air force,
and Judy Floyd, their secretary, about his vacation and what he'd
missed at work.
</P>
<P>
   Clines didn't have a trip scheduled until Tuesday, taking some
Industry &AMP; Trade officials down to Albany. Monday looked like a
slow day, and as he ate his lunch of leftover chicken, Clines
thought he might be able to go home early.
</P>
<P>
   In the hangar, Rogers had his own paperwork and a new shipment
of parts and stores to catalog and shelve. But first, he checked
the choppers. Every morning Rogers does a standard pre-flight
visual check on the DNR helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are surprised to learn that something as enormous as
a tower crane is controlled, for the most part, with a little
joystick.
</P>
<P>
   Getting his instructions via radio, Sims can swing the crane
around in a 180-degree arc in less than 30 seconds; he can trolley
the crane's arm forward and backward, and, of course, he can raise
or lower the cable with the enormous hook on the end. It's called
``horsing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, workmen were removing the gravel-and-tarpaper roof of
Mill No. 1. They shoveled gravel into a 4-by-10-foot skid pan. When
it was full, they attached the crane's hook to it and Sims guided
it to a Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Sims stayed in the crane for lunch, warming a can of vegetable
soup on the hot plate, and went back to hauling skids.
</P>
<P>
   He had hauled five loads, and the gravel portion of the roof was
almost gone when Sims noticed white smoke billowing out of a
3-foot-square hole in the tarpaper. He watched as the workmen
picked up hoses and began squirting water down the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke seemed to get worse. After a few minutes, Sims saw the
men were trying to get the hose down the stairwell. Just as the
last of them disappeared, he heard a sudden ``whooosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Flames boiled through the roof. Sims keyed his radio: ``Y'all
got a fire on top of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no answer. Sims decided that it was time to abandon
the crane. But when he looked down, he saw his tower enveloped in
flames. He had nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   At Station 4, it seemed the alarms would never quit. ``Sounds
like they're sending the whole world out,'' Moseley remarked to no
one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the disembodied voice began dispatching. It called for
three engines and two truck companies, standard for a fire in a big
building. But it didn't stop there. ``Air 7,'' the voice intoned.
Air 7 is the truck which refills the firefighters' breathing
apparatus. ``Medical engine,'' which carries advanced life-saving
gear. ``Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   The men of Squad 4 threw their gear aboard their engine and
leaped in. As the engine screamed across the freeway overpass, they
saw clouds of smoke surging up between two towering brick
smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got one,'' the men told each other. ``Damn, we really got
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Workmen were sauntering out of the mill in no particular hurry
when Squad 4 ran past them. One grizzled man in a hard hat warned
them about the stairs. ``They're rotten,'' he said. ``Watch out for
the holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Squad 4, with four firemen from other units, reached the fourth
floor to find what appeared to be a large trash fire burning in the
back of the cavernous, 75- by-50-yard room. It looked manageable,
and officers called for a truck to extend its ladder up to the
window to provide water.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley walked around to the side of the fire with Lt. Todd
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look up there,'' Mosely shouted. ``It's breaking through the
floor!'' Burning embers were coming down from a fire raging on the
fifth floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up there and check it out,'' Edwards ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning his ax and hook against a wall, Moseley raced back to
the stairwell. Lt. Mark Green from Engine 6 joined him. They
pounded up the stairs, rounded the corner and took three steps into
the room before the heat stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   A cloud of black smoke was surging toward them, obscuring
everything from the ceiling to a foot from the old wooden floor.
Behind the blackness was an intense orange glow.
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, the two men turned and raced down the stairs. On
the fourth floor, they met other firefighters running toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get off the floor!'' officers were yelling. ``Everybody out!''
</P>
<P>
   As they reached the third floor, Moseley heard popping and
cracking above him, like the toppling of a row of giant dominos.
The fifth floor was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   With no chance of saving the mill, Squad 4 poured into the
streets of the Cabbagetown neighborhood, just downwind from the
inferno, kicking in back doors of houses that were beginning to
burn from blown embers and making sure no one was trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
   Behind one of the houses, Squad 4 kneeled down to regroup. The
firefighters had to stay low to keep the heat off their faces.
Water on the pavement was steaming. The radio was swamped with
orders and warnings. They heard the word ``rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Squad 4 picked up its gear and headed for its truck. The
firefighters thought they were being sent to an emergency elsewhere
in the city, but as they got near the truck, they saw men pointing
up at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Sims' crane had lost its electrical power and the wind whipped
it around until it was pointing south. It was getting warm in the
cab. Ivers Sims, a religious man, said a small prayer.
</P>
<P>
   His radio crackled. ``Ivers,'' the site superintendent told him.
``Just hang on. We're gonna have to get a helicopter to get you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Sims grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost an hour after he saw the first puffs of smoke, the cab
got too hot for habitation. Sims climbed up several steps to the
metal counterdeck above.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Clines had just finished his own visual check of
the choppers and was on the telephone. George Dukes came out of the
DOT hangar and told Rogers somebody was hollering on WSB radio for
a helicopter to get a man off a crane. Rogers ran upstairs to get
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   DNR owns the only rescue helicopters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ready,'' Clines said. He went to a corner of the hangar to
pull his flight suit on over his gray and green uniform. Rogers,
moving with the ease borne of training, took the back doors off of
35NR, a Bell Long Ranger L-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers loaded up sections of nylon rope capable of lifting
thousands of pounds and a Billy Pugh basket used for rescues. He
also fitted the rescue bellyband, a broad, heavy-duty strap that
runs under the aircraft and connects to itself like a man's belt
inside the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Clines was about to take the Ranger out of the hangar when he
heard a muffled cry and a thud behind the door to the stairs.
Opening it, he found Judy Floyd in a heap on the floor. Running to
get an emergency message to him, she had fallen down the stairs.
She didn't respond immediately, giving Clines his worst scare of
the day. The DOT officers called an ambulance, and in a few seconds
Floyd stirred and looked up at Clines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys go, do what you need to do,'' she said weakly. ``I'll
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clines and Rogers were airborne 10 minutes after getting the
word.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Moseley spotted a man peering over the crane's
railing, he and Bill Bowes, a tall, lanky member of the squad, put
on their harnesses. The heavy gear is like parachute harnesses that
belt around each thigh, rise up the front and back of the body and
connect like suspenders over the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   On the crane's counterdeck, Sims' feet, protected only by light
boots, were getting hot. He keyed his radio to talk to his
superintendent, whose last name he never knew. ``Hey, Keith, when's
that helicopter coming?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gonna get it here quick as they can,'' Keith replied.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was intense, sending Sims away from the edge and onto
the pile of concrete counterweights. Lying on his stomach, he
decided it was time for another small prayer.
</P>
<P>
   When Sims looked up, he saw three helicopters circling. Two made
hesitant runs toward him, then backed away. The third, a news
chopper, tried to come close enough for him to climb aboard. But
the heat was too fierce; Sims could not bear to even extend his arm
over the edge of the concrete weights.
</P>
<P>
   Lying back down, Sims tried to sort through all the construction
accidents he'd ever heard of. He could remember none that involved
fire and a tower crane. If he stayed flat on the concrete, he
probably won't burn, but he had no idea how much heat the tower
could take before it melted.
</P>
<P>
   With a sinking heart, Sims faced the possibility that he was
about to die. However, he didn't offer any more prayers. Two ought
to be enough, and he didn't want to be a bother.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the air, Clines tuned his radio to 123.07 VHF, the
common helicopter frequency. ``35NR is off from Fulton County
headed toward the fire,'' he reported.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, he was overhead, making a pass over the
inferno. Until he saw Sims lying on the concrete pad, Clines had no
real idea exactly what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   He circled briefly, testing the turbulence from the fire,
gauging the power of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters are flown, basically, with two sticks, one on either
side of the pilot. They are called, rather unhelpfully, the cyclic
and the collective. The collective is the throttle. Push it forward
and the engine revolutions increase; backward and they decrease.
The cyclic controls the pitch of the rotors, which determine the
attitude of the aircraft. Push the cyclic forward, and the
helicopter dips its nose and moves forward if it is given enough
collective. Push the cyclic to the right and the ship banks and
turns to the right, and so forth. Increasing the collective while
keeping the cyclic on an even keel lifts the chopper straight up;
decrease it and it drops downward.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a stable hover is not unlike rubbing one's stomach
while patting one's head. The cyclic and collective must be played
against each other in perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   Clines brought 35NR down on the grass where firefighters were
waving at him. Rogers helped Moseley aboard and gave him a radio
headset.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Clines had planned to use the basket to get Sims, but
firefighters were concerned about Sims' condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he grabs at the basket and misses, the whole thing'll be
over,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, if you wanna take the ride,'' Clines replied. ``Let's go.
Time's wasting.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Moseley didn't understand what Clines meant. The
firefighter intended to rappel down a rope to reach Sims.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers tossed the basket out of the chopper, laid out a
50-foot rope and connected it to a 30-foot length with half-inch
steel carabiners. One end of the rope was connected to the Long
Ranger's belly band, and then to the rescue hook. The other end was
hooked to Moseley's harness. The firefighter suddenly understood
what kind of ride he was about to take.
</P>
<P>
   He was anxious and getting irritated. Everyone was barking
suggestions and ideas at him. His mouth was dry and his tongue was
swelling. He was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes after landing, Clines lifted off.
</P>
<P>
   On the crane, Sims' radio gave a burst of static.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivers!'' Keith radioed. ``The helicopter's here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' grunted Sims. But he wasn't sure whether to believe it
until he looked out at the grassy hill and saw a man laying rope
out on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the line came taut and lifted Moseley off the ground, Clines
felt the slight tug. Helicopters are sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Clines rose slowly up beyond 300 feet, until Rogers, leaning out
the open back door, attached by straps to his seat, told him he was
high enough to clear any obstacle. Clines had to fly as slowly and
gingerly as he could to keep Moseley from swinging like a pendulum
at the end of the rope.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the air, Moseley's irritation evaporated and a strange
kind of peace settled over him.
</P>
<P>
   The view was lovely, the silence refreshing. There was only the
mutter of the helicopter and the snap and crackle of the fire. He
began to consider how he would handle the situation once he was on
the crane.
</P>
<P>
   As they came over the mill, Rogers had to drop his helmet visor
to protect his face from the heat. Eighty feet below, Moseley
turned his face into his shoulder to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Ranger moved through the worst of the turbulence before
it got over the crane; it wasn't so bad then, and the wind, blowing
down the length of the crane, gave the ship some added lift. At
that point, Clines could no longer see what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers kept a steady stream of conversation, trying to give
Clines something more than just instruction, trying to be the
pilot's eyes. ``Up, up a little more ... good, good ... left now,
more to the left ... ah, little too much, come right a bit, right,
right ... good, that's good, lookin' good...'' .
</P>
<P>
   Clines came over the crane sideways and a little high. ``Down,
down a little more, come on, down a little more,'' Rogers said in
his ear. Below, Moseley had his back to the crane. He twisted
around to see it, waving his arm like a man paddling in the water,
trying to turn himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming to get you,'' he called to Sims. ``Don't try to
grab me if I come close to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Moseley could grab a cable on top of the crane and get
aboard. He had to climb up a railing to reach Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful,'' Sims told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the crane, he's on the crane!'' Rogers told Clines.
``Careful, he's still hooked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clines blinked. He had expected Moseley to unhook himself from
the rope while he was preparing Sims. Remaining connected meant
Clines had to give him just the right amount of slack to move
around, but not enough to get hung up in the crane, and then remain
absolutely motionless. If the chopper bounced or lurched before
Moseley got Sims hooked to the rope, it would probably pull the
victim off the crane and send him into the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Clines' world was limited to his hands on the sticks _ making
constant, tiny adjustments _ the instruments and Rogers' voice. The
floor of 35NR could have burst into flames and he wouldn't have
noticed it.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, following his training, cracked a joke about coming up
to get Sims off work early. That kind of thing will often sooth a
frightened victim on the edge of panic. Sims, however, was closer
to death than he was to panic. He didn't respond. Moseley explained
that he was going to rig Sims into a harness to lift him off the
crane.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Sims said. He knew all about these harnesses; he used
one when he did routine maintenance on his crane. He got into the
harness and Moseley attached it to a carabiner above his head. The
firefighter looked up at Rogers and gave a thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready,'' Rogers called. ``Bring 'em now. We got 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly Clines pulled the Long Ranger up, then began a careful
circuit around the fire. Below the chopper, Moseley and Sims could
hear the cheers of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Clines put them down on the hill like a carton of eggs, then
slid off to the side to land the Ranger. Other hands quickly
unhooked Sims and rushed him to a stretcher. At the hospital,
doctors found him unharmed. He was released quicker than Judy
Floyd, who was hospitalized until doctors concluded at midnight
that she was only bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley's adrenaline rush faded and his hands began trembling.
His tongue seemed to fill his mouth. Hands were pounding his back,
but all he wanted was water.
</P>
<P>
   Clines merely raised his right eyebrow and grinned his small,
ironic grin when the heromakers descended upon him. Rogers did his
best to disappear. Clines tried to tell everyone how smooth it all
was, that it was no big deal, not for a man who began his flying
career rescuing shot-up Ranger units from hot LZs in southeast
Asian countries where they weren't even supposed to be. Compared to
that, Mill No. 1 was a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was shooting at me,'' he explained.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shy and soft-spoken, the 26-year-old Dominican woman
uses pictures rather than words to tell about the nightmare that
was her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   One photograph shows a ransacked apartment; the bedroom dresser
pushed onto its side, lamps, mirrors and pots of tulips shattered
on the floor. Another shows the woman battered; her mouth is
swollen, her eyes are black and she has bruises on her legs.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs, she said, were secretly taken by her sister and
show what happened when her husband became angry. In his fits of
rage, she said, he would beat her and throw her out of their home
in Manhattan. Then he would apologize and ask her to return _
always with a warning that made it impossible for her to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if I did not come back, he would call the
police and have me deported,'' said the 26-year-old woman, who
entered America illegally five years ago from the Dominican
Republic. ``He would say that because he is legal, he has more
rights in this country than I do, and that he could take my son
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for issues involving immigrants say spousal abuse has
long been one of the most critical and widespread problems endured
by women who do not have legal residency in the United States but
are married to someone who does.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government has toughened immigration laws in
recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for these women
to gain permanent residency, making threats like those of the
Dominican woman's husband more potent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most disputed changes came last year, when Congress
allowed the expiration of a law that permitted immigrants entitled
to permanent residency to stay in this country while awaiting green
cards. A green card certifies that an immigrant is a permanent
resident.
</P>
<P>
   The expiration has roused immigrant advocates, particularly in
New York, over the implications for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the loss of 245i, as the expired provision of the
Immigration and Naturalization Act was known, has already deterred
battered women from seeking permanent residency because of concerns
over what could happen when they are sent back to their native
countries while their green card applications are processed.
</P>
<P>
   Leslye Orloff, the national policy director for Ayuda, a group
supporting battered immigrants, said many of the women feared that
if they left the United States, they would be exposed to suits
claiming custody of their children, many of whom were born in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many also worry, Ms. Orloff said, that once they are outside
this country, it will be easier for U.S. consular officials to
challenge claims of abuse and hardship, and refuse to grant green
cards _ an irreversible decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that they are going to be forced to make an
impossible choice to either leave the country to get their green
card, and risk extreme danger for themselves and their children,''
Ms. Orloff said, ``or to give up their chance of ever getting a
green card, putting themselves and their children at risk for
different kinds of dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 245i expired, groups like Ms. Orloff's have organized
meetings to explore legal strategies that have so far allowed them
to keep their clients in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And members of Congress are debating whether to pass a bill
introduced in January by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich, that would
in effect re-enact 245i for battered women. Called the Violence
Against Women Restoration Act of 1999, it would allow battered
immigrant women to stay in this country while they wait for their
green cards. The Immigration and Naturalization Service also
supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are in these situations through no fault of their
own and our government should be encouraging them to get out of
abusive relationships,'' said Johanna Minguez, a lawyer at the
Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights. ``But without
245i, we are forcing them to make a choice between getting beat up,
or getting removed from the country.''

   KOSOVO-CLARK _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO's supreme commander, traveled here and to Albania for talks
with officials and visits to NATO troops Saturday. ``This is not a
campaign against the Serb people _ far from it,'' Clark said after
meeting with Macedonian Premier Ljubco Georgievski. ``But it is a
campaign against the policies which have caused the humanitarian
tragedy that is affecting this country.'' Meanwhile, another 5,000
refugees crossed over into Macedonia Friday, and aid officials were
bracing for an enormous influx in coming days. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said more than 100,000 refugees were
believed bound for Macedonia after being driven from their homes in
Kosovo. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ About 13,000
Kosovo refugees poured into Albania early today and thousands more
were on the move in Yugoslavia as Serb forces appeared to be making
a final push to clear Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population. In
neighboring Macedonia, where at least 5,000 refugees crossed over
Friday, officials were bracing for an enormous influx in coming
days. Ron Redmont, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, said more than 100,000 refugees were believed bound for
Macedonia after being driven from their homes in Kosovo.

   NATO-SUMMIT _ WASHINGTON _ More than 40 heads of state from
across Europe and North America gather this week to mark the 50th
anniversary of NATO. But the mood of celebration is being undercut
by the difficult situation in Yugoslavia. NATO spent a half-century
preparing for the great war that never came. Now it's being tested
by a symptom of its own success. It was the Cold War defeat of the
old Soviet model, after all, that set in motion the collapse of
Yugoslavia. The job of picking up the pieces has fallen to NATO, in
the first combat mission in the history of the alliance, and very
possibly its last. (Deans, Cox News Service).

Salinas is jailed in Mexico now on money laundering and drug

   DISABILITIES-CASE _ In a case that advocates for persons with
mental and physical disabilities are calling their ``Brown v. Board
of Education,'' the U.S. Supreme Court on April 21 will hear
arguments as to whether Georgia must pay for transferring disabled
patients out of state-run institutions if they can do better in a
more integrated facility, such as a group home. In December, the
U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case when 26 states, led by
Florida, petitioned the high court to overrule a ruling against
Georgia by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Since
then, however, disability advocacy groups have stormed state
attorneys general offices (with protestors being arrested in some
states) and successfully persuaded 18 of these 26 states to tell
the Supreme Court they've changed their minds. The lawsuit, filed
by two Atlanta-area women who resided at the Georgia Regional
Mental Hospital on Panthersville Road claims the Americans With
Disabilities Act allow disabled people to move into more integrated
settings if they are able, instead of being warehoused in state
institutions. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   FUNERAL-INVESTIGATION _ WICHITA FALLS _Tres Hood was a popular
Wichita Falls television news anchor when he died of cancer at the
age of 31 last summer. Hood stayed on the air until shortly before
his death, delivering the evening news with a sunken face and
thinning hair. More than 1,400 people attended his funeral, where
he was eulogized as a professional who demonstrated how to live and
die with dignity. But what happened to Hood after his death robbed
him of all the dignity he stood for, his family says. The funeral
home allegedly botched Hood's embalming. The funeral home, owned by
industry giant Service Corporation International of Houston, denies
responsibility. Hood's family complained to the Texas Funeral
Service Commission, a state agency whose future is up in the air
because of turmoil that has erupted since it began investigating
the embalming practices of SCI. Lawmakers may abolish the agency,
which has been beset with funeral industry conflicts of interest, a
backlog of complaints and investigations, and allegations of
political pressure to drop the nearly $450,000 in fines it has
proposed against SCI. But Hood's family worries that Texas may lose
sight of consumers and what needs to be done to regulate a funeral
industry that could continue to bury its mistakes rather than
correct them. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).

DESPITE INDUSTRY DEREGULATION, UTILITIES AVOIDING NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Mass., R.I., Pa., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For years, officials here and in other state
capitals have hailed competition as a way to lower electricity
bills, and New York is one of just five states that have actually
begun letting some customers choose their supplier of power.
</P>
<P>
   But the price framework the Pataki administration has created
provides very little room for competition, less than in almost any
other state that has begun the process. Customers are learning that
they cannot find a price much lower, or even slightly lower, than
the one being offered by their old, familiar utilities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of the nation's major energy retailers have
stayed out of New York, although they are competing aggressively
for customers in several other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not about to jump into the New York market and lose
money,'' said Howard Fromer, director of government affairs in New
York for Enron Corp. of Houston. ``I can't believe any outside
marketer is making money in the New York market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some officials at the Public Service Commission, the state
agency that regulates utilities, concede privately that there is
far less competition than they had hoped for. It was the
commission, whose members are appointed by Gov. George Pataki, that
designed the system for competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's chairwoman, Maureen Helmer, said that while
New York might have less robust competition than some states have
now, it has laid the groundwork for more competition in the future.
``I think when you look in one or two years, you're going to see a
very different picture,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New York has some of the highest electricity rates in the
country, about 50 percent above the national average. Business
groups say that makes the state less competitive economically, and
they have long pushed for a freer energy market.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, too, have high hopes for competition. They
predict that companies marketing ``green power,'' power generated
by the cleanest sources, will find ready takers even if the
companies charge a little more for electricity, a theory borne out
in other states. Power plants, particularly older ones burning coal
and oil, are a major source of air pollution and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to realize that the choice of an energy
provider is the single most important environmental decision they
can make,'' said Ralph Kavanagh, energy program co-director for the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   But if the rate structure does not leave room for the biggest
energy marketers to turn a profit in New York, smaller companies
offering green power say they stand even less of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's setup is just not supportive of competition,'' said
Julie Blunden, vice president of Green Mountain Energy of South
Burlington, Vt., a leading seller of green power that has shunned
New York. ``We don't market ourselves as being cheaper, but price
competition helps us because it means people are out shopping for a
new supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials and analysts say they believe that New York's
regulators wanted to shield the state's seven established regional
utilities, including Consolidated Edison, from the pressures of
competition. But some also contend that in making trade-offs, the
Public Service Commission believed that it had no choice but to
restrict competition.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a five-year transition from the traditional
monopolies to a competitive market, New York's utilities are being
radically reorganized. They are selling their power plants and each
one is splitting into two companies, one to own and maintain the
transmission and distribution system, and the other to sell power
to consumers. The commission was never sure that it had the legal
authority to order such changes _ the utilities threatened to tie
the state up in litigation for years if it tried _ so it negotiated
the transition with the utilities, reaching agreements with them in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Pataki administration was determined to
begin the process with across-the-board rate reductions, which
turned out to be 10 percent in Con Edison's territory and less in
other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the utilities to agree to restructuring and rate cuts,
they settled for less competition than they might have gotten,''
said Larry Shapiro, staff attorney at the New York Public Interest
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Helmer said New York has been more aggressive than other
states in getting utilities to sell their power plants. That, she
said, will mean vigorous wholesale competition among power
producers, which will eventually translate into retail competition
and lower prices. The result, she said, will be ``more sustainable
benefits for New Yorkers than they may get in other states.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Advocates of competition laud the sale of the power plants, but
they say the price structure the state set still poses a long-term
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in New York began last year in Con Edison's
territory, New York City and Westchester County, where about
one-fifth of the market has been opened up to competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers snapped up that power as soon as it was available, but
it is unclear how much real competition that reflects. Retailers
were able to offer only a very small savings over Con Edison's
rates, based mostly on a tax loophole that the administration has
warned it will close this year. And many of the consumers who took
advantage of the competition did not sign up with an outside
retailer, but with Con Edison's own new, competitive subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Even after states introduce competition, the old utilities still
hold monopoly control of the system that distributes power and
delivers it to homes and businesses. So a portion of every
customer's bill will continue to go to the utility, even if the
customer buys electricity elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly subjective process, state regulators look at the
old, monopoly-style utility bill and decide which charges represent
those services the utilities will continue to provide and which
reflect the actual price of electricity. The electricity portion of
the bill is known as a ``shopping credit'' or a ``back-out rate,''
meaning that consumers can stay with the utility, for now, at that
price, or shop for a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the shopping credit, the higher the guaranteed revenue
for the established utility, and the harder it becomes for any
company to undercut the utility's price.
</P>
<P>
   Among four of the five states where competition has begun _ New
York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island _ as well as a
few others that have set their price structures but have not yet
ushered in competition, New York allows the least room for
competition by setting the lowest shopping credits. The fifth
state, California, is an anomaly in that regulators did not set
specific shopping credits, letting them fluctuate instead, and its
system effectively leaves even less of a margin for competition
than New York's does.
</P>
<P>
   The rate structure the Public Service Commission created for Con
Edison allows a shopping credit averaging about 3.5 cents a
kilowatt-hour out of a total bill of about 15 cents per
kilowatt-hour, though both figures can vary widely. The credits are
smaller, often less than 3 cents, for customers of upstate
utilities like Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, most residents and businesses in Pennsylvania
have shopping credits of 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour; the
credits are scheduled to rise over the next few years until the
average is above 5 cents. New Jersey, which is scheduled to begin
some competition on June 1, has decided on a framework with
shopping credits generally above 5 cents. In Rhode Island and
Massachusetts, the average shopping credit is about 3.5 cents.

OUT OF NOWHERE, A BIG SCORE FOR NETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was like a gift from above, one night of nearly
perfect basketball for a team that has experienced a season filled
with hardship in the form of injuries, embarrassment and poor play.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, in their finest performance of the year, closed their
disappointing West Coast trip Friday night with a dominating 121-91
victory over the talented Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything went right for the crestfallen Nets, who will
try to maintain their momentum at home on Sunday against the
Philadelphia 76ers. They outrebounded the taller Sonics by 48-35,
shot 51.1 percent, hit more than half of their shots for the first
time this season, made a season-best nine 3-pointers and matched
the NBA's mark for points in a regulation game this season.
</P>
<P>
   That the showing came on the back of a three-game losing streak,
which included humiliating defeats against the dismal Los Angeles
Clippers and the Denver Nuggets, made it all the more astounding.
Even the Nets (11-28) did not know exactly what to make of their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a crazy year,'' said Keith Van Horn, who was one of
six Nets to score in double figures with 16 points. ``I don't
understand any of this. It makes you wonder what could've been.
It's kind of strange.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory should not be blown out of proportion, as Seattle
(19-20) is no longer the perennial Western Conference contender it
once was. And the Sonics were playing their third game in three
nights and coming off an emotional overtime victory in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who improved to 8-11 under the interim head coach Don
Casey, capitalized on the Sonics' weariness with the type of
tenacious defense that led them to five victories in six games
earlier this month. They double-teamed in the post to hold
Seattle's starting frontline to 16 points, played the passing lanes
well to make 12 steals and banged the Sonics to cut off their paths
to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty defense was pleasant to the eyes of the Nets'
coaching staff, which had watched its team play soft in allowing
229 points over the previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott Burrell drew a charging foul on John Crotty early in
the fourth quarter, Nets assistant Eddie Jordan jumped from his
seat to praise Burrell and pump his fist. It was only the fourth
charging foul the Nets have taken in the last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't contained people,'' said Jordan, explaining the
Nets' defensive demise during the three losses. ``People were
driving right by us and getting anywhere on the floor they wanted
to. Our reputation was being built on making steals, so we got into
this gambling, reaching thing. We weren't using our bodies to get
in front of people and when somebody drove the middle, we were just
reaching instead of coming all the way over and taking a charge.
Good defensive teams step in and take charges.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' defense led to fast-break opportunities and propelled
them toward their offensive explosion. &QL;

FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS, INGENUITY IS KEY TO EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN A. KLIMENT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The battle of Waterloo may have been won on the
playing fields of Eton, but for the private schools of New York
City it is the battle to find even a postage-stamp-size site for
baseball and tennis, or Latin and math, that has led to a range of
resourceful tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban campus-type schools can make inroads into vacant land,
but for urban schools the options are limited. They can build
upward _ a choice limited by zoning. They can dig down _ an
expensive, unsettling step that several have nonetheless taken as a
last resort. Or they can subdivide existing space, a dismal step
that can often produce a rabbit warren of tight, listless rooms
that Dr. Noam Shudofsky, administrator of the Ramaz School, calls
``sardine-can status.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in rare cases, they can buy real estate within walking
distance of the main building, then gut and rebuild or raze and
build, creating a sort of instant campus.
</P>
<P>
   Several private schools that have recently completed expansion
projects took distinct approaches to dealing with their space
problems. St. Aloysius School on West 132nd Street in Harlem
stretched its zoning-permitted expansion to the limit by
encroaching on its schoolyard to gain extra space for its library
and computer facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramaz School, anxious to consolidate its middle school,
managed with great dexterity to acquire a nearby site from the York
Preparatory School, in a creative exchange of sites that landed
York on the West Side and gave Ramaz an extended East Side urban
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to create for its girls an oasis in gritty, noisy New York
City, the Chapin School ended up using space over part of its
building for a large but cozy two-story learning and research
center, atop which is a new gymnasium along with a black-box
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Friends Seminary, which had enjoyed a single-building campus
since 1860, ventured across 15th Street to convert, in a gesture of
brightness and hope, the dark former art deco German Masonic temple
into a bright, high-tech, environmentally ``green'' math and
science center.
</P>
<P>
   Like other private schools, Trinity School was built in stages,
in its case on a constricted site that runs almost the full length
of West 91st Street between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Resolved to unify its middle school, which had been scattered
throughout an elegant brownstone structure and a corner concrete
fortress built in the 1960s, and in dire need of up-to-date gym
space, Trinity School razed the old story-and-a-half gym on its
midblock 130-foot site and replaced it with a carefully scaled
four-story glass and brick building.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure, designed by the architects Buttrick White &AMP;
Burtis, houses the new middle school classrooms on two of the
floors, and two 100-foot-long gymnasiums, one above the classroom
floors, the other below ground, on the other two floors, for a
total of some 43,000 square feet. The $8 million cost also covers
about 14,000 square feet of renovation in adjacent buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. To make room for the downstairs gym, Trinity had
to dig down 30 feet, 15 of them through rock. In the upper gym, to
make sure that bouncing balls and running feet didn't upset classes
beneath, a floating double floor was put in, with the upper floor
isolated from the lower by a system of spring mounts.
</P>
<P>
   The big worry in any addition or renovation is the risk of
losing the physical features that say ``school.'' Trinity's
headmaster, Henry Moses, frets over saving this element, which he
calls ``schoolness.'' At Trinity, on the side facing the playing
field _ an acre of Astroturf atop the roof of a parking garage _
the architects deftly hid the air-conditioning equipment behind a
new clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek tower houses a bell that once graced the parish house
of St. Agnes Chapel, which had formerly occupied the very site of
the new middle school. By a curious odyssey, the bell had migrated
to Trinity Church in Cornwall Bridge, Conn., only to return in 1998
to its first site.
</P>
<P>
   Like Trinity, the Ramaz School focused on a middle school _
grades five to eight _ when it embarked on its current building
program. Ramaz has had its high school in a metal-clad building on
East 78th Street since 1980 _ on the site of the now-defunct Finch
College _ and its lower school on East 85th Street. Grades five and
six were in the lower school, seven and eight in the upper school.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how it came to build a six-story building on 85th
Street between Lexington and Park avenues has as much to do with
real-estate resourcefulness as with architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The 85th Street site had been owned by York Preparatory School,
which was looking in vain for bigger quarters. Ramaz, determined to
keep its middle school students in the neighborhood, offered to buy
the York Prep buildings for $6 million, a sum that York, a
for-profit school, turned down because of the huge threatened tax
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Born, a Ramaz board member who is a New York hotel
owner, developer and operator, then came into the picture,
Shudofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Born's idea was to buy a suitable building for York, then
exchange it for York's 85th Street building. Under a section of the
Internal Revenue Code that allows like-kind exchanges, such a
maneuver would avoid a tax. Born found a site for York Prep on West
68th Street and bought it. York liked it, the exchange was made,
the old York complex was torn down, and work began on the new Ramaz
middle school.
</P>
<P>
   Designing and building the school on the former York Prep site,
augmented by an adjoining brownstone, has been anything but
straightforward, although the project is on track for a fall 1999
opening. Ramaz at first wanted to build a bridge to connect the new
site with the lower school almost directly across the street, but
the plan didn't work because East 85th Street is an east-west fire
street and cannot be obstructed. The idea of a tunnel was
eliminated because of the spaghettilike infrastructure of pipes and
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part, according to the architect, Robert Immerman
of Horowitz/Immerman Architects, has been ``fitting the school's
requirements into a medium-sized space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The midblock zoning regulations are very strict,'' Immerman
said, ``which means we don't have the luxury of high ceilings and
two-story, double-height spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   To fit the school's 60,000 square feet into the envelope allowed
by zoning requirements, it chose an option also used by Trinity, to
dig down. Ramaz ended up excavating three stories to accommodate
the gym, locker room, mail room and music studio, all of which
could prosper without daylight.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million construction cost, which does not include
furnishings or retrofitting existing space, was borne by a
fund-raising campaign among members of the modern Orthodox Jewish
community that includes outlying areas of the New York region, as
well as the 1,000 families of the Orthodox Congregation Kehilath
Jeshurun, with which Ramaz is affiliated.

 &HT;    Patients stage showdown over rights of disabled
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a mental health patient at Georgia Regional
Hospital, Elaine Wilson wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt trapped, I felt like I was in a little box,'' said
Wilson, 47, who is mildly mentally disabled and has a personality
disorder. ``You couldn't do anything there but sleep or eat or
smoke. That's all you could do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Wilson joined a lawsuit filed by fellow patient Lois
Curtis, who is also mildly mentally disabled and has been diagnosed
with schizophrenia. Curtis, 31, was institutionalized for three
years at Georgia Regional before Atlanta Legal Aid lawyers filed
suit on her behalf in federal court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson now lives in College Park with a roommate; Curtis lives
in a group home in Decatur. Although the women have been released
from the mental health hospital in DeKalb County, their lawsuit has
made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will consider the two
women's claims on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on the Americans with Disabilities Act. Signed
into law in 1990, it calls for greatly increased access to public
and private facilities and programs for individuals with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The high court will decide whether the ADA requires states to
pay for the placement of mentally disabled patients such as Curtis
and Wilson in community settings when doctors say they are ready to
be removed from institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought by Wilson and Curtis, known in the lawsuit only
by their initials, E.W. and L.C., is being closely watched by the
country's well-organized disability rights organizations. The
groups have staged protests nationwide, calling the lawsuit a
symbolic civil rights case that follows decades of government
segregation of disabled people in mental health institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To people with disabilities, this case is as significant as
Brown vs. Board of Education was to people of color,'' said Mark
Johnson, advocacy coordinator for the Shepherd Center in Atlanta,
referring to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling on school
integration. ``When the ADA was passed, it was a mandate for
integration. Now we've got our state challenging our right to
integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Olmstead, director of Georgia's Department of Human
Resources, fears the case will lead to the wholesale release of the
state's mentally retarded patients into places where many cannot
receive proper care.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has been steadily removing its mental health patients
from institutions over the past several years, Olmstead said. Since
1996, he noted, the DHR has closed three mental health institutions
and funneled $83 million toward services in community settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid making mistakes that have been made in the
past with the release of mental health patients, many of whom wound
up living under bridges, homeless or in jails,'' he said. ``You
need to have adequate resources to care for them after their
release. I just think you can do this without a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead has not been immune from the protests. He returned home
from work this month to find wheelchair tracks all over his front
yard and placards posted in his lawn. The Macon chapter of ADAPT, a
disability rights group, had held a protest at his house earlier
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Jamieson, an Atlanta Legal Aid lawyer, said the ADA allows
the integration of disabled individuals into the community only
when their doctors say they are ready to go and only when their
release will not fundamentally alter the state's ability to
administer its mental health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case forces us to focus on what we've allowed states to
do for generations,'' Jamieson said. ``They've said they'll treat
these people, but only if they're put aside in a big building and
left there. Now the ADA mandates that people with disabilities get
to decide if they want to live a reasonably normal life in a
community setting.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Jamieson's arguments have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob in Atlanta first ruled in her
favor, and, a year ago, so did a three-judge panel on the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the denial of community placements to individuals
with disabilities such as L.C. and E.W. is precisely the kind of
segregation that Congress sought to eliminate,'' Judge Rosemary
Barkett wrote in a unanimous opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But 26 states joined Georgia in its appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court, and in December the high court decided to hear the case.
That decision _ coupled with the 26-state petition _ was tantamount
to throwing down the gauntlet to the country's disabilities rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, advocacy groups have exerted enormous
political pressure on state governors and attorneys general, urging
them to withdraw from the Supreme Court petition.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning reversal, 19 of the 26 states did, telling the
U.S. Supreme Court they no longer supported Georgia's position.
</P>
<P>
   Disabilities rights groups have deluged state offices with
letters and e-mails, staged protests and news conferences. In
Texas, 17 activists were arrested at the governor's mansion while
urging Gov. George W. Bush to remove his state from the petition.
Although Bush refused to budge, his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, later withdrew that state's support.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, only eight states remained on the petition.
Eddie Roland, director of the DHR's mental health division, wrote
to them, imploring them to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, you and your public officials are being pressured to
withdraw your state's support,'' he wrote. ``I am writing to urge
you to stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, South Carolina notified the Supreme Court that
it, too, was withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issue for the court to consider Wednesday is the
language in Title II of the ADA, which says ``no qualified
individual with a disability shall, by reason of his disability, be
excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the
services, programs or activities of a public entity or be subjected
to discrimination by any such entity.'' The court must also
consider ADA regulations that require the services to be
administered ``in the most integrated setting appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In its briefs to the Supreme Court, Georgia argues that the ADA
provides disabled people access to activities that only nondisabled
people engage in. Ramps must be constructed so wheelchair-bound
individuals can have equal access to public facilities such as
museums, according to the state's arguments. But the ADA should not
apply to mental health patients seeking state treatment in a
group-home setting because those facilities have only disabled
people in them _ and for that reason, there is no discrimination
when such care isn't provided, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gottesman, who will argue the case on behalf of Atlanta
Legal Aid, said Congress never intended the ADA to be interpreted
so narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the statute is to enable the disabled to be
integrated into the community,'' he said. ``Obviously, if you're
locked up in a mental institution, that's impossible. ... It's like
saying to AIDS patients, `If you want medical treatment paid for by
the state, we'll provide it, but you have to agree to live in a
prison to get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Olmstead, the former mayor of Macon who was
appointed to head the DHR in 1994, said he finds the criticisms of
his agency ``kind of insulting.'' He said he fully supports moving
disabled patients out of state hospitals and into the community,
but only when adequate planning and services are in place.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the DHR has moved 450 people from mental retardation
institutions into the community, he said. ``That's something they
don't speak about.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead added that 1,900 mentally retarded individuals _ many
living with aging parents who can no longer provide for them _ are
on a waiting list to receive state services. If the state is
required by the courts to move patients in institutions into group
homes, it may create further delays for people on the waiting
lists, Olmstead said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 3,000 people housed in the state's eight mental
health institutions. About 1,200 of these individuals are
psychiatric patients who reside there only for brief periods. About
220 are forensics patients, such as those charged with crimes. The
rest are mental health patients, as were Wilson and Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Gottesman, a Georgetown University Law Center professor, said it
costs less money to treat mentally disabled people in the
community, compared to an institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming in that regard,'' he said. ``It's
politics that explains the states' resistance. It's a combination
of the employees in these institutions don't want to lose their
jobs, the admnistrators don't want to lose their kingdoms, and
there are still lots of folks out in the community who are happy
with continuing to lock these people up and keep them out of
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   During her stay at Georgia Regional, Curtis sat in a day room
for hours at a time and smoked up to three packs of cigarettes a
day. Since her release, she has stopped smoking and takes six
classes a day at a habilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really blooms at art,'' said Sandra Fields, director of
the Foundation of Exceptional Achievers center. ``She's happy,
she's content, she's expressing herself more and making more of her
own choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled times at the hospital when she was bound to a
wheelchair by a bedsheet because she was over-medicated. Since her
release, Wilson said, she has taken up ceramics, crocheting and
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have accomplished a lot since I've been out,'' she
said. ``It feels great to do all those things that I want to do.

<P>
   A special problem faced the 98-year-old Chapin, an all-girl
kindergarten through high school on East End Avenue at 84th Street,
across from Carl Schurz Park. Last September Chapin completed an
extensive library, gymnasium, and black-box theater over an
existing gym.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying challenge, said Sandra Theunick, the head of the
school, was not so much growing enrollment _ from 573 in 1992 to
619 today _ as a concern that the quality of school life was in
danger of getting lost in the effort to reconcile the technical
demands of modern education with Chapin's goal of small classes and
informal settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed space for the girls for reflective thought,'' said
Ms. Theunick, ``spaces where they'd be more able to learn to
communicate one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Butler, a partner in the architectural firm Butler
Rogers Baskett, which designed the addition, said the new
construction was ``a wonderful opportunity to rationalize the
internal organization and create new spaces that would serve the
faculty and students well into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was a two-and-a-half-story addition with 22,000
square feet of new space at the geometric center of the school, as
well as 26,000 square feet of renovations elsewhere in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Most in sync with Chapin's goals is the library, known as the
Annenberg Center for Learning and Research. It's a two-story
spread, amply studded with small group-study rooms, plus warm brown
alcoves with carrels, tables and huge comfortable armchairs,
suitable for quiet study, reading and informal talk. The center
provides just the sort of haven Ms. Theunick seeks as a foil to the
toughness of the city. Large windows flood the space with natural
light.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the library is a large multimedia classroom equipped
to handle everything from lectures to video presentations and
conferencing. And for fitness, there's a well-equipped gymnasium,
adjoined by a 72-seat theater. The entire design is topped by a
sloping roof of gray metal and a row of matching air exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   A renovated ground-floor dining room big enough to feed 750
students and staff in 90 minutes for breakfast and lunch was part
of the renovation, completed last October. There is even a space
where kindergartners can take a 30-minute nap, as specified under
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 million construction budget, which includes renovation
of existing space plus money for maintenance, was met in part by
funds from a successful $25 million capital campaign. The Walter
Annenberg Foundation, no doubt motivated by the presence on campus
of an Annenberg granddaughter, with other relatives as alumnae,
gave $6 million for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Friends Seminary, a 570-student coed school whose enrollment has
nearly doubled since 1950, has had a single-site campus since 1860.
It sits on a block between East 15th and 16th streets and faces
tree-lined Stuyvesant Square, the sort of fresh-air amenity popular
with city schools hungry for open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, pressed for space, committed to reducing class size,
eager to strengthen its math and science instruction, and having
exhausted possibilities of expanding within its site, resolved to
cross the street, thereby creating the first unconnected campus in
its history. ``We're very tightly packed,'' said Richard Eldridge,
the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around for feasible, affordable space, Friends Seminary
viewed some 15 sites, including banks, clubs and a Salvation Army
home. In the end, it bought a five-story-plus-basement structure on
the south side of East 15th Street for some $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The structure had been built in 1880 and renovated in 1936 into
a stylistic mix of Greek Doric and art deco by its occupants, who
were members of a group of Masonic lodges. The building was known
as the German Masonic Temple. During its 1936 remodeling the
structure lost nearly all its daylight; the front windows were
pared down and rear windows covered entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The resolve to cross 15th Street was unsettling to teachers and
administrators, some of whom felt the move would be divisive. They
saw themselves as a single-school community where children in
kindergarten could have contact with 12th-graders, and they didn't
want to lose that.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was to save the casual contacts among grades in the
old building, and to use the annex to beef up math and science and
add a black-box theater and seminar rooms. The 16,000-square-foot
annex adds about 25 percent to Friends' original space.
Construction cost came to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation was radical. First, said its architect, Ross
Anderson of Anderson Architects, ``We had to let in the light.''
The building had functioned as a dark place of secretive ceremonies
and rituals. ``Our challenge was to convert it to light,'' he said.
So the stairway was moved to the center, freeing up outside walls
for windows to light the classrooms. Each floor has a piazza, an
irregular open place where students, as in Chapin's library, can
casually meet.
</P>
<P>
   The annex ended up a cheerful, funky place, with walls at odd
angles, and plenty of industrial materials such as diamond plate
sheet steel and fiber-reinforced cement board walls with intricate
arithmetical incisions that change from floor to floor. The
architects retained some of the Masonic symbols on the facade, half
concealed by panels of green frosted glass.
</P>
<P>
   The annex went ``green'' with a vengeance. Old wooden joists
were removed, but not discarded, during demolition, to be reused on
other construction projects. Materials were chosen for their
healthy qualities _ low v.o.c. (volatile organic compound) paints
were used because they release fewer toxic compounds as they dry.
</P>
<P>
   Materials were also chosen for their environmental properties.
Anderson asked suppliers about possible pollution occurring during
each material's mining and manufacture, how durable it was and how
easily recycled. Glass was chosen that has reduced heating and
cooling loads, and lights are set to turn off in any room that no
one is using. Students and teachers may open windows.
</P>
<P>
   Friends paid for the Annex construction in two ways, Eldridge
said. A $7 million capital fund-raising campaign has yielded $5.3
million so far. Some of this paid for a part of the construction.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of construction cost came from bonds issued by the
Industrial Development Authority, a New York state agency empowered
to issue tax-exempt Civic Facility bonds to nonprofit institutions,
typically at a 6.125 percent interest rate, rising to 7.0 percent,
a point or two below commercial rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds are sold as a package to investors. They are used by
independent schools, such as Friends and Trinity, which typically
create a sinking fund to pay off the bonds over 10, 20 or 30 years,
according to Fred Calder, executive director of the New York State
Association of Independent Schools.

GROUND

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ NATO's relentless air assault on Yugoslavia
continued Saturday as the alliance's top military leader visited
Macedonia and Albania in an effort to seek support for deploying
more U.S. combat forces in the region, possibly including ground
troops for action in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander,
made his first visit to the Balkans since the start of the bombing
campaign last month in an apparent effort to sound out political
and military leaders about an escalation of NATO operations on
Yugoslavia's southern flank.
</P>
<P>
   His surprise trip came a day after the Clinton administration
formally acknowledged it was considering a limited ground-forces
operation into Kosovo as one of three options in the next phase of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Clark won assurances from Macedonian leaders that 4,000 more
troops could be added to the 12,000-troop NATO contingent already
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, Clark indicated that NATO's newly established
airbase would soon be handling a rapid influx of U.S. troops and
equipment for an American strike force, as well as more NATO troops
devoted to helping Albanian and international humanitarian agencies
cope with the influx of more than 300,000 refugees into the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Rinas Air Field ``is probably going to be one of the busiest
spots in Europe for the next several days,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after meeting with Macedonian officials in Skopje,
Clark vowed to crush Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
military capability. He called NATO's continuing air war ``a
campaign against the policies which have caused the humanitarian
tragedy that is affecting this country.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent wave of new refugees has pushed the total number of
Kosovar Albanians seeking refuge in Macedonia to nearly 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces appear to be making a final push to empty Kosovo of
ethnic Albanians. Some 25,000 refugees, lashed by rain and high
winds, arrived in Albania and Macedonia Saturday and as many as
100,000 more are expected in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather over the area Friday night hampered air operations
and again made it difficult for NATO planes to target Serb forces
in the southern Kosovo region where refugees are being driven from
the province, NATO officials said. However, by mid-day Saturday,
the weather had improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO on Saturday revealed what it said was further
evidence of atrocities by Serb forces in Kosovo, disclosing aerial
photos of what it claimed may be up to 150 fresh graves near the
Kosovo town of Izbica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that there is mounting evidence of detentions,
summary executions and mass graves,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that based on refugee accounts, about 3,200 ethnic
Albanians had been slain by Serbs in the province in the past
several weeks. He said the figures could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that NATO is considering three
possible scenarios to rescue ethnic Albanians trapped inside
Kosovo, which has been ravaged by Yugoslav forces and Serbian
paramilitary gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is a plan to send NATO combat troops across
Yugoslavia's southern border to carve out a corridor of territory
the alliance would control. The other options are air drops of food
and medical supplies and the insertion of humanitarian aid groups
under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials stressed that the corridor plan is merely
under consideration and spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon called the
option ``unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clark held his consultations in Macedonia and Albania, a
senior Yugoslav commander told Serb reporters that NATO would
suffer heavy losses if it launched a ground invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is ``preparing for an all-out war,'' said Gen.
Nebojsa Pavkovic, chief of the army's third division, based in
southern Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of an intervention on the ground in Kosovo, NATO would
face 150,000 armed men,'' Pavkovic said. ``Even if every third
bullet (these men) fired hits a target, it will be a price the
aggressor will have to pay for coming into our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's trip to the region seemed aimed at gauging reaction in
Albania and Macedonia to the plans under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that the initial goal of American Apache attack
helicopters and artillery units being deployed in Albania may be a
limited one: clearing out a zone along Albania's northern border
with Kosovo of Serbian gunners and infiltrators who have been
raiding and shooting mortar shells into Albania for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do everything we can to stabilize the
situation here in Albania,'' Clark said. ``We are very concerned
about the situation in the north, where Serb aggression against
this country is increasingly evident, with artillery being fired
across the border and infantry forays and other things. That has to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian leaders gave Clark assurances that the contingent of
12,000 NATO troops currently in Macedonia could be increased by
4,000 in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Cox Newspapers after his meeting with
Clark, Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski said Clark did not
formally request that Macedonia allow a NATO invasion force to be
based in the country.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops initially came to Macedonia last fall as a
contingency force to extract international truce monitors in Kosovo
if needed. A United Nations force has been in the country since the
early 1990s, created to ensure that the Balkans conflict did not
spill across the border into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgievski suggested that Macedonia would consider a NATO
request to serve as a staging area for offensive troops if it
received a fast-track application to become a member of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very good if Macedonia becomes part of NATO,
because then the obligations of Macedonia toward NATO would be
different. The security and long-range consequences would be
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, NATO has more than 650 aircraft committed to its air war
against Yugoslavia, which began March 24. More than 22,500 NATO
ground troops are posted near Kosovo's borders or scheduled to
arrive over the next week or so.

 NEW YORK: Independent Schools.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With far skimpier resources but no less urgent space problems,
St. Aloysius School is a 330-student pre-kindergarten through
eighth grade co-ed school at 223 West 132nd Street. Enrollment has
more than tripled in the last three years, largely because of the
efforts of its principal, Laurel Senger.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which the Jesuit Province of New York operates for
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese, occupies a nondescript brick
structure in the middle of a long block of distinguished
brownstones. It is two houses away from the ornate, neo-Italian
Gothic church dedicated to the same saint.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by its strong-minded principal, who taught elementary
school in Vermont and worked at Covenant House before joining St.
Aloysius in 1990, the school took some of the pressure off when it
expanded into its courtyard with a 4,500-square-foot building
completed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Its architect, Michael Doyle of Acheson Thornton Doyle, said he
was able to squeeze two stories into the 22-foot above-ground limit
by excavating enough for the lower story to count as a cellar,
which doesn't count toward the overall zoned height. The students
benefited most from a new library, an 11-terminal computer room and
a roof garden used for teaching. The cost was $1 million _ a high
figure necessitated in part by the small landlocked site and a tiny
7-foot access alley, making for a difficult construction job.
</P>
<P>
   Its annual tuition is $1,600, about 10 percent of the fees
charged by richer schools such as Trinity and Chapin, and St.
Aloysius had to work hard to finance the recent addition. Seventeen
individuals and foundations ended up paying the bills. Operating
costs have come from the Archdiocese and the Jesuit Province, but
the school is under pressure to obtain more independent financing
or face closing. A capital campaign to raise $4 million to $5
million is pending.
</P>
<P>
   In a city like New York, the options to grow that are open to
private schools are limited. The Buckley School on East 73rd Street
bought an adjacent brownstone for expansion, but on finding that
the floors didn't match, ended up gutting the interior and
rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Collegiate School, on 78th Street off West End Avenue, retained
an architect, David Helpern, who managed deftly to fill in the
narrow alley between its two main buildings. The alley had been
used for play space. The new infill building provided room for an
expanded gymnasium, an art studio and a new kindergarten, but above
all it integrated the two buildings horizontally _ all without
requiring a zoning variance.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill School is negotiating to sell its current East 95th
Street building, and is under contract to buy the five-story
Madison Square Boys and Girls Club at Second Avenue and 29th
Street, with a September 2000 planned move-in date, according to
Kristine Baxter, the head of school. Churchill has hired Paul Segal
Associates Architects to renovate the building, adding two stories,
to accommodate the school's expansion to include grades nine
through 12.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding in dribs and drabs doesn't pay, said Calder, the
executive director of the independent schools association. In 1990
Ramaz considered a modest 11,000-square-foot addition over its
present 78th Street structure. But the work would have cost $5
million, and code problems were awesome. ``So we discarded it,''
said Shudofsky. A little can be worse than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With a spacious campus built around a large green, Horace Mann
School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx has managed to avoid
many of the pressures facing schools in more built-up areas of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Mann is set to expand this fall into two new buildings on
its Riverdale campus designed by the firm of Gruzen Samton. A
horseshoe-shaped structure with 21 classrooms will be neighbor to a
pie-shaped arts and dining center with a 225-seat concert hall
overlooking Van Cortlandt Park. A major renovation of Horace Mann's
1910 high school building is to get under way in 2000, says Dr.
Eileen Mullady, the head of school.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line facing private schools' boards and
administrators that with annual tuition pushing through the $20,000
level, parents are looking for more than simply getting sons and
daughters into Mount Holyoke or Yale. They are after value _
congenial environments, small classes, well-equipped resource
centers, individual-centered athletic programs _ and expect the
schools to provide such amenities.
</P>
<P>
   And a nice modern new building creates a challenge for teachers
and principals. As Ms. Theunick of Chapin said, ``We now have to
live up to the opportunity.''

AN EARLY START TO BATTLE FOR PIVOTAL HOUSE SEAT IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ The moment Rush Holt, a Democrat, had broken
the Republicans' grip on the 12th Congressional District last
November, both political parties decided that central New Jersey
would be a major battle zone in the fight for control of the U.S.
House of Representatives in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But few could have imagined then that the skirmishing would
start so soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a second former Republican congressman stepped
forward as a potential challenger to Holt. And before the day
ended, the national congressional committees of the two parties had
already issued statements pummeling each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seems a bit premature,'' said a slightly bewildered
Holt, whose 105th day in office was Thursday. ``I'm not prepared to
engage in a partisan campaign for re-election only three months
after I was sworn in.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional start of the all-out campaigning for
congressional seats is still about eight months off, after the
November elections. But last week provided a preview of the kind of
seat-by-seat fight that each side intends to wage next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12th District is very high on our target list,'' said
Terry Nelson, the political director of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, on Friday. ``We think Rush Holt is
vulnerable on the demographics of the district. This is a
Republican seat by any measure, and we should be able to get it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson conceded that recapturing the district would not be
easy. ``I think the Democrats know it is not a seat they should
have,'' he said, ``but they are going to do everything they can to
keep it in their column.''
</P>
<P>
   The district stretches from the green lawns of Princeton
University near its southern boundaries to the foothills of
Bedminster in the north, and despite the ideological and geographic
landscapes it covers, it could always be counted on to vote
Republican in House races _ that is, until last November.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's victory and a sprinkling of other upsets across the
nation helped the Democrats reduce the Republican majority's margin
to six seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the margin is only six seats, every seat is vitally
important,'' said David Plouffe, the executive director of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``This is a swing
seat, and so we will watch this race very closely, as will the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least three candidates who have held the 12th District
job in the last five years vying to return to it, voters are going
to need a score card to follow next year's race.
</P>
<P>
   There is Holt, 50, a physicist from Princeton. He was declared
the loser on election night, only to see that call reversed when
election officials discovered late in the evening that they had
transposed results from a heavily Democratic precinct and given a
huge advantage to his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, so far, is Richard A. Zimmer, who
represented the district for three terms before he gave up the seat
in 1996 to run for the Senate. Zimmer lost in a bare-knuckled
contest to Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat whose campaign was
managed by Plouffe.
</P>
<P>
   Standing between Zimmer and the House nomination is Michael
Pappas, who succeeded him. Pappas lost to Holt last November but
promptly announced that he would be a candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A primary match-up between Zimmer, who calls himself a social
moderate and fiscal conservative, and Pappas, a hard-core
conservative, sets up a proxy fight between two ideological wings
of the party. ``The presence of both Dick and myself in this race
will offer voters a clear choice between our two different visions
of government and where the Republican Party is headed,'' Pappas
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said he had the backing of David Norcross, the Republican
national committeeman from New Jersey, a grass-roots organization,
and support that was ``second to none.'' Pappas also noted that
Zimmer, who had amassed at least 64 percent of the vote in each of
his three races for the House, received only 50.8 percent of the
vote in the 12th District ``in his first race against a
well-funded, formidable Democrat'' _ Torricelli.

 &HT;    Newscaster's death raises questions about funeral homes'
influence on regulatory rulings
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Everyone in town knew that Jefferson
Frank ``Tres'' Hood III was dying _ and that he was too young to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Hood was a TV star in this North Texas city, a homegrown news
anchor with a soft touch for storytelling. When the story affected
him, though, he wouldn't tell it. Colon cancer was killing Hood at
age 31, but he ignored the gaunt face in the mirror and anchored
the news on the local CBS affiliate until he couldn't get out of
bed anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1,400 people attended Hood's funeral last July. Within
months, the death of this beloved local celebrity would become
entangled in one of the nastiest government messes in Texas: how to
regulate the state's multimillion-dollar funeral industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hood's family claims the funeral home botched his embalming.
Fluid leakage caused the wooden casket to break, and a maroon
liquid leaked from his marble crypt and puddled on the mausoleum
floor. The family paid nearly $7,000 to have the crypt cleaned and
Hood's remains put in a new copper casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like my son was violated terribly,'' said Gayle
Johnson, Hood's mother. ``I want justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The family filed a consumer complaint with the Texas Funeral
Service Commission. But chaos over funeral regulation in Texas
delayed the investigation and raised questions about the influence
of funeral home companies in state regulatory decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hood was embalmed by the world's biggest funeral home company,
Service Corporation International of Houston. The company's
embalming practices have been under investigation by Texas for more
than a year. Regulators have recommended a record fine of nearly
$450,000 for alleged violations. SCI is fighting back, and the
controversy has exposed the agency's lackluster record of enforcing
the law and added to internal strife and staff turnover.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy involves campaign contributions to Gov. George
W. Bush, whistleblowers who allege government corruption and a
mistrust that runs so deep that the agency's acting director often
uses fluorescent-orange tape to secure his office door when he's
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Texas are simply not being served in an
acceptable manner,'' said state Rep. Jim Pitts (R-Waxahachie), who
is leading a move in the Texas Legislature to dismantle or
reconfigure the state funeral agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a consistent concern that this agency may be
hampered in its effectiveness due to the strong industry
representation on the board,'' he said. ``The Texas Funeral Service
Commission does not exist to serve the industry; it is there to
serve the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas House of Representatives voted last week to kill the
agency's $500,000 annual funding beginning in September. But Pitts
and others said the vote was mostly symbolic and that they plan to
restructure the agency to reduce funeral industry influence that
has left Texas with lax enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral agency has been in turmoil for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission challenged SCI's embalming practices in 1998,
finding that the company used an unlicensed, in-house company to
embalm bodies in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and allowed
unsupervised apprentices to embalm bodies. The commission
recommended a fine of nearly $450,000. In February, however, the
commission decided to re-evaluate its investigation after questions
were raised by the governor and state lawmakers who received
campaign contributions from SCI's political action committee. If
the commission's internal review of its SCI investigation finds
that its staff overstepped their authority, the whole matter could
be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Two key agency employees have been fired, and both are suing to
be reinstated. Executive director Eliza May was fired in February
after the board said it lost confidence in her ability to manage
the agency. Her lawsuit alleges she was fired for complaining that
SCI held improper influence over the commission's work and that
Bush's staff tried to pressure her to end the investigation into
SCI's embalming practices. Bush, she pointed out, received $35,000
in campaign contributions from SCI's PAC between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cole Reed, the agency's only investigator at the time, was fired
in January for alleged insubordination. His lawsuit alleges that he
was fired after he contacted Bush's office to complain that May had
instructed him to go to the Texas Ethics Commission to research
campaign contributions by SCI's PAC. Reed was the funeral agency's
representative at the disentombment of Hood's body in Wichita Falls
in December. After Reed was fired, the Hood case stalled. Another
investigator has since been hired. The governor's office has
allowed SCI to have two of its executives on the agency's
nine-member governing board since February even though Texas law
prohibits such dominance by one company. Last week, Bush named a
replacement for one of the SCI commissioners, but the new appointee
cannot serve until the Senate confirms the nomination. That is not
expected to happen until next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Funeral Service Commission has a backlog of about 50
complaints, including the one filed by Hood's family last year. The
agency received 167 complaints last year, most of which are
generated by staff inspectors who uncover alleged violations during
routine inspections or are filed by consumers concerned about
overpricing.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about botched embalmings are not common, said David
Richards, general counsel at the funeral agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hood's family had planned to hold an open-casket visitation at
SCI-owned Hampton Vaughan funeral home the night before the
newscaster's funeral. But when they saw Hood's embalmed body, they
had to change plans. Fluid leaked from Hood's eyes and mouth, and
his face was so distorted that his 18-year-old brother became
hysterical and fled the room. ``My husband said, `It looks like a
rookie did it,' '' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of his July 27, 1998, funeral, Hood's $4,495
mahogany casket began to leak. An odor developed. Soon, Johnson
found swarms of gnats when she visited her son's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral home officials urged Hood's family to put a strong
deodorant in the mausoleum because a mouse might have died in the
walls, then suggested the family should have the local cemetery
monument company bleach the crypt and reseal it if necessary,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   By November, Johnson had made arrangements to have Hood's body
disentombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you've got to take care of it whether they're going
to help you or not,'' Johnson said. ``I know my son's soul is not
in there, but his earthly remains are. It was not the kind of
dignity that he deserves. No one does.''
</P>
<P>
   SCI general counsel James Shelger declined to comment on the
case except to say, ``We want to resolve this family's concerns
privately.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hood's family, an SCI funeral home official said
the embalming was difficult because the body had been autopsied.
Johnson said she had requested an autopsy because she suspected her
son had received incompetent medical care.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the funeral commission, Hood's uncle, Bill
Walker, said a funeral home officer ``told me that because a wooden
casket was used that leakage of fluid from the vault was possible
and that they had no control over that.''
</P>
<P>
   After arranging to have the crypt opened, Johnson's lawyer filed
a complaint against Hampton Vaughan with the funeral commission,
along with a request that the state send a representative to the
disentombing Dec. 1. SCI officials declined to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this is a private family mausoleum in a city cemetery, I
am of the opinion responsibility lies with the family and the City
of Wichita Falls,'' SCI's area manager wrote in a Nov. 24 letter to
Lancaster Memorials, the company that would be opening the crypt.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m. Dec. 1, Hood's casket was removed from the crypt and
several local funeral experts helped clean up the seeping liquid.
But when they attempted to lift the casket back into the crypt, the
bottom split.
</P>
<P>
   The disentombment cost Hood's family $5,070 for a replacement
casket and transfer of the body and $1,900 to have the monument
company open the crypt and reseal it. The original funeral handled
by SCI had cost $8,229, including the mahogany casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shouldn't happen to anybody,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers say they want to protect consumers from
incompetent or dishonest funeral companies. But one of the two
funeral bills that have been filed was written by a lobbyist paid
by SCI and would curtail the commission's regulatory powers. The
other bill would kill the agency and require the Texas Department
of Health to regulate funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say they expect the final legislation will be
somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   At a March hearing, the House Appropriations Committee
criticized the agency's lackluster performance. Statistics
collected by lawmakers show the 10-employee agency has fallen
behind in completing investigations, imposing penalties and taking
disciplinary action _ even though the number of complaints has not
increased substantially. The agency is taking half a year to
resolve a complaint, twice as long asagency standards. Complaints
are backlogged, and last year the agency imposed 14 fines for
violations of Texas funeral law, compared to 92 fines in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral commission officials attribute the problems to high
staff turnover, inexperienced staff and vague and contradictory
funeral service rules.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee brought the problems to light, the full
House passed a budget that included no money for the funeral
commission. But lawmakers said they did it to send a message and
that they would rather revamp the commission. To do that, they plan
to take the SCI-drafted bill and make it more responsive to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As written, the SCI bill would limit funeral commission fines to
$10,000 per complaint. It would limit the agency's executive
director from issuing subpoenas for funeral company documents
without a commission order, which May did last year in
investigating 23 SCI homes. It also would prohibit an agency
employee from simultaneously serving as an officer of a state
political party, a provision prompted by May's role as treasurer of
the Texas Democratic Party last year. And, the bill would prohibit
the public from seeing information that state inspectors compile
when they investigate a complaint against a funeral home, even
after the case is closed. Similar inspection reports for nursing
homes, state psychiatric hospitals and other facilities are open
while an investigation occurs. Inspection reports of day care
centers under investigation are made public after the investigation
is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Marchant (R-Coppell), who received a $5,000 campaign
donation from SCI's PAC last October, introduced the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing sinister about it,'' he said. ``It was mainly
a shot across the bow to say something's really wrong here, and we
really need to do something. There is a lot of chaos over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawmakers were negotiating how to make the bill more
consumer-friendly. One compromise would change the makeup of the
commission so there are fewer members from the industry. Now, the
commission has five public members and four funeral industry
members. The proposal is to have a six-member board, with four
public members and two industry representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also are discussing a proposal to prevent the
commission from disclosing any proposed fines against a funeral
home until they become final. Such a provision would have kept
secret the proposed $450,000 fine against SCI.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richards, who took over day-to-day operations of the
funeral commission after May was fired Feb. 8, is generating
controversy of his own. The commission awarded Richards a $20,000
pay raise, from $40,000 to $60,000, and Pitts and other lawmakers
quickly criticized the increase. May was paid $43,000. Richards,
the agency's general counsel,points out that his new salary is
within the state pay scale allowed for agency attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said he is working on the review of the funeral
agency's 1998 investigation of SCI's embalming practices and hopes
to have it completed in time for the commission's next meeting, on
May 27. The board also plans to take up the complaint about Hood's
embalming at the same meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has not changed under Richards' leadership is a
problem with security fears. When May was executive director, she
hired a private security guard because of an attempted break-in and
a death threat from a disgruntled former SCI apprentice embalmer.
May also was concerned about a private investigator hired for a
short time by SCI to dig into her personal background. Now, when
Richards is out of town, he usually tapes his door shut with orange
tape so he can tell if anyone enters his office, where sensitive
investigative files and working papers are kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been entries into the office that have been
unauthorized,'' he said of the unusual security measure.
</P>
<P>
   None of the controversies engulfing the funeral agency gives any
comfort to Tres Hood's family. They fear their complaint against
Hampton Vaughan could fall through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned they're going to minimize and negate our
complaints in some way because of the conflicts of interest,'' said
John Horany, a Dallas lawyer who represents Hood's family. ``They
may put it on slo-mo and wait until there is no more funeral
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitts, the Waxahachie lawmaker, vows the Legislature will do
something to protect consumers like the Hood family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be assured that the state will be looking over the
shoulder of this industry when we're finished,'' he said. ``It's
just been a circus, and we need to restore the public confidence in
this agency. We're going to abolish it and start one over.

 &HT;    Waffle House waitress sued for big helping of lottery pie
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BAY, Ala. _ Tonda Dickerson's days of serving $1.98
breakfasts at the Waffle House are over. She quit her waitress job
March 7 after seemingly becoming a millionaire thanks to a Florida
Lotto ticket she received from one of her regulars.
</P>
<P>
   She wants a Camaro to replace her stolen one so she can quit
driving her mother's Chrysler LeBaron. She's looking at plans for a
two-story brick house that will replace her trailer and wants to
provide college tuition for her child and nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   But what Dickerson wants most, she says, is the good name of her
family restored. That may not come, if at all, until after a
verdict in a civil trial that starts Monday in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Three Waffle House waitresses and a shift manager claim
Dickerson was part of a pool that agreed to share winnings from
lottery tickets they received from Edward Seward Jr., a regular
customer who had been giving waitresses Florida Lotto tickets for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When Dickerson refused to sign a settlement giving away 70
percent of a jackpot stake worth $10 million, she was hit with a
civil lawsuit. The complaint contends Dickerson and her family
conspired to shut out the other waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never an agreement,'' Dickerson, 28, said at the
kitchen table of her dad's house, eating a Mrs. Smith's French silk
chocolate pie.
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Stephen E. Clements, who represents the other
waitresses, said the verbal agreement to share jackpots was
discussed whenever Seward came to the Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the point,'' Clements said. ``It was discussed all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Favors Alabama game
</P>
<P>
   With Alabama residents scheduled to vote on their own lottery
this fall, Dickerson says she's a bad barometer of how others might
vote. She rarely watches the news or picks up a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything doing with politics, from the president on down, it's
so confusing, so unimportant to me,'' said Dickerson, who for a
while pursued a physical therapy degree at the University of South
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, she favors an Alabama lottery. ``It would
give someone else a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said she's heard rumors she's divorcing her husband of
seven months, James, because they're squabbling about the money.
And they're sure they're being watched by private detectives trying
to turn up anything that can be used against them in court.
</P>
<P>
   She chuckles. He's defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're smearing her name from here to Atlanta,'' James
Dickerson said. ``Just like taking a garbage truck and just dumping
it out in someone's yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson and other Waffle House waitresses began crossing paths
with Seward around January. Seward, 41, a former seafood cook and
restaurant manager, suffered a stroke three years ago. His sister
lives near the Waffle House in Grand Bay so he frequently stops to
eat and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   After getting to know the morning shift, Seward started handing
out Florida Lotto tickets. Friends said he usually bought them at a
Groovin' Noovin' convenience store just across the Florida line
near Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like he was trying to build up these friendships, and
then in return for the friendships he would kind of like reward you
with these tickets,'' Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7, the day after the drawing for a $20 million Florida
Lotto jackpot, Seward handed Dickerson a ticket in a sealed
Groovin' Noovin' envelope. Written across the top were the winning
numbers: 3-4-7-36-39-40. One ticket was sold in Stuart, Fla. Seward
bought the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he really did want them to divide it,'' said Emma
Seward, Edward Seward's aunt. He also wanted a new truck from the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Clements said Seward will testify to both verbal agreements at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Emma Seward told her nephew, ``give it to your
aunt. I'd share it with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A family trip to Florida
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson hasn't talked to Seward since she struck it rich. She
initially led the other waitresses to believe she might have bought
the winning ticket from a local resident who often sells Florida
lottery tickets. She started the talk, she said, to throw people
off track so she could thank Seward for the winning ticket.
Dickerson said she wants to reward Seward but hasn't figured out
what to give him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson says she regrets the ruse, which is mentioned
prominently in the suit against her.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after Seward gave the ticket away, Dickerson and her
husband, father and mother drove to Tallahassee to claim the prize:
$10 million divided by 30 annual payments, about $216,000 a year
after taxes. They formed a corporation, 9 Mill Inc., named for
their $9 million share. After last-minute sales were counted, their
stake grew by $1 million.

<P>
   ``We didn't want everybody just to take a lump sum and spend
their money and 20 years from now everybody be broke,'' said
Dickerson, who slept with the ticket in a Ziploc bag before she
filed her claim.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem. A Mobile attorney had called Florida
Lotto officials, saying his clients were in a pool with Dickerson
and that she fled so she wouldn't have to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we conspired that,'' said Dickerson's father, Bobby Reece,
``she could have took off Sunday night and been there waiting
Monday morning and cashed that thing in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible for us to pay the winner without
having this resolved,'' said Ed George, director of communications
for the Florida lottery. ``Any information we have puts the burden
on us to get some facts to see if it's a real person with a real
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rags-to-riches story either way. I'm surprised one of
the TV networks hasn't approached us yet. Or at the very least
`Oprah.'''
</P>
<P>
   For now, everyone will have to settle for Court TV, which will
tape the trial.

Los Angeles: 99.8 cents 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   California, where heavy demand and extra environmental
regulations make gas especially expensive, has experienced the
sharpest rise. Premium prices are flirting with the $2 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Comforted slightly by Attorney General Bill Lockyer's pledge
last week to investigate whether oil companies are gouging
motorists at the pump, Mayes said it is ``time to make a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schlichting, a spokesman for the California Energy
Commission, said he supported the goals of The Great American Gas
Out, but warned the action could actually have a detrimental
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could raise prices,'' Schlichting said. ``The whole concept
is don't buy gas on April 30, but buy as much as you want on the
29th and the day after the boycott. There could be an artificial
shortage on the day of the boycott that could raise prices. The
Great American Gas Out only shifts the buying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could hold it for a week, maybe then it would have some
power. A much better idea would be to for everyone to car pool. A
car pool would create a significant fall in the amount of gas
purchased. Or do like I did this morning and ride your bike to
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schlichting, prices likely will drop soon. The
expected fall in prices would be mostly due to recent reports that
supplies are much larger than expected despite a vows by overseas
oil producers to cut back on shipments, and two notable refinery
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get angry for that day and protest, but maybe you can
take that energy and get even for a long time,'' said Bill
VanAmburg, a spokesman for Calstart of Pasadena, a transportation
technologies consortium that develops and promotes alternative
fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid vehicles that rely on electricity and gas already are
affordable and will only get cheaper in the next year, VanAmburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's electric car, the VV, is available in a few major
markets and will debut across the country this fall. The car, which
looks similar to the company's Civic coupe, relies on both an
electric motor and a gas engine and gets about 70 miles per gallon.
Unlike its predecessors, the VV retails for under $20,000,
VanAmburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn has been leasing similar electric-powered vehicles to
drivers since 1997, and General Motors, Toyota, Ford and Chrysler
all plan to have either electric or natural gas vehicles ready for
sale within the next year, VanAmburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred recharging stations for electric vehicles and
about 80 natural gas stations already exist throughout Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas sells for about 75 cents per gallon; electric cars
can be recharged for about 40 percent of the cost of an equivalent
gallon of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a Great American Gas Out maybe it should be the
Great American Gas Alternative,'' VanAmburg said. ``There are lots
of technologies out there that are starting to come into their
own.''

GROUPS URGE GASOLINE BOYCOTT ON APRIL 30
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the face of skyrocketing gas prices, a
grass-roots protest dubbed The Great American Gas Out is spreading
like wildfire across the Internet and gaining credibility as
politicians line up to support the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   With gas prices leaping an average of 43 cents per gallon in
California and 14 cents nationwide during the last month, The Great
American Gas Out is urging drivers to turn their backs on the pumps
for one day, April 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sick and tired of high prices when there are
literally millions of gallons in storage,'' blares a widely
circulating e-mail promoting the protest. ``Know what I found out?
If there was just ONE day when no one purchased any gasoline,
prices would drop dramatically. ... Let's have a GAS OUT! Do not
buy any gasoline on April 30, 1999!''
</P>
<P>
   The rabble-rousers responsible for the e-mail remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   While gasoline industry experts and economists argue a one-day
boycott isn't likely to send prices plummeting, noting organizers
urge drivers to buy gas the day before or after the protest, the
idea has caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs jumped into the hoopla
Friday, introducing a proposal to have the city go on record in
support of the April 30 boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present dramatic increase has stirred up frustration and
anger similar to that of the energy crisis during the 1970s,''
Wachs said. ``An angry public is demanding solutions. They want
their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The city councilman said he hopes The Great American Gas Out
will send a message to oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll join the boycott. Sign me up,'' Emily Charles said as she
filled the tank of her gas-guzzling Chevy Tahoe sport-utility
vehicle at an Arco station in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a good idea and it might show them we don't
want to pay so much for gas,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Langland, spokesman for Arco in Los Angeles, wasn't
exactly rattled by the mounting protest movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we live in America. People have the right to
protest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Langland refused to predict what effect the boycott would have
on prices. He did, however, offer a suggestion for a better way to
curb gas costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better protest is to buy your gas at the station with the
lowest price in the neighborhood. That creates competition, which
will drive the prices down.''
</P>
<P>
   Arco and other oil companies just don't get it, according to the
creators of two Web sites -- www.gasout.org and gasout.tntspace.com
-- that are fanning the flames of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protest is the important thing,'' said David Griswold, 33,
a computer systems worker in the Silicon Valley who launched
www.gasout.org three weeks ago after receiving the anonymous
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If millions participate, someone will sit up and notice. We're
looking to draw media attention to the problem and let politicians
know we're angry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has received between 200 and 300 visitors a day,
and includes a chronology of recent price increases, as well as
links to legislation introduced to combat the hikes. Perhaps more
useful, the site also details ways drivers can conserve gas.
Suggestions include car pooling, keeping tires properly inflated
and driving at moderate speeds.
</P>
<P>
   A similar Web site -- gasout.tntspace.com -- created by Citizens
Against High Gas Prices announces weekly boycotts at individual gas
stations in Los Angeles. The most recent protest took place
Saturday at a Texaco on West Century Boulevard in Los Angeles. Site
visitors were urged to drive by the station and ``honk your horn
for support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if one-fourth of the automobile drivers in
California participate in the rally on April 30 it will send a
strong signal that drivers are fed up with high gas prices,'' said
the Rev. Lowe Barry of Compton, who founded the citizens group last
month with Dr. James Mayes of Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Mayes, a general practitioner who tends mostly to low-income
patients out of his office in South Central Los Angeles, said the
price increases are magnified for people on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed some of my older patients weren't making
appointments. They said it was too expensive to drive to the
doctor,'' Mayes said. ``Some of my younger patients tell me they
have to make the agonizing choice of buying milk or buying
gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide review of 10,000 gas stations by the
Lundberg Survey showed the average price was nearly $1.23 a gallon.
Three weeks ago, it was $1.09, and in late February it was a
stunningly low 99.8 cents.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians poured
out of Kosovo on Saturday, driven from their homeland despite
NATO's continuing air war of attrition with Yugoslavia and what the
alliance called successful attacks on Yugoslav tanks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO command officers said that Yugoslav army and Serb police
units were carrying out sweep operations all over southern Kosovo
near the border with Albania and Macedonia, burning and wrecking
villages and driving the inhabitants onto the roads to flee for
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13,000 ethnic Albanians streamed into Albania
overnight, relief officials said, while another 7,000 arrived in
Macedonia, where the defense minister was quoted as saying he would
not permit new camps to be built for them and urged foreign
countries to airlift them from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hint of movement on the diplomatic front, too.
Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia, appointed last
Wednesday as his country's special envoy in talks on the Yugoslav
crisis, will present President Boris Yeltsin with proposals on
Monday to resolve the conflict, Russian news agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying that resolving the conflict
would be a difficult process but that he was ready next week to
start foreign trips to try to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has held meetings with Western diplomats and
Russian experts, and has said that Russia should keep a cool head
with NATO despite its anger over the bombings of fellow Slav
Orthodox Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather moved in over the southern Balkans overnight, once
again making it difficult for allied planes to do much about the
Yugoslav operations on the ground, allied officials said. But on
Friday afternoon they destroyed seven tanks from the air.
</P>
<P>
   The ground forces successfully hit by the allies Friday appeared
to be miles away from the most intense Yugoslav operations along
the border. The allied attacks were concentrated instead near
Pristina, the provincial capital, and in the northern part of
Kosovo. The command did not say how many missions allied planes had
flown.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the allied command, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani,
said that allied planes had also bombed strategic targets,
including an ammunition plant, and British military officials in
London said that a Yugoslav army headquarters near Pristina, which
was helping to direct the operations on the ground, had been
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   But as Marani said, ``for ethnic cleansing, you don't need a
very strong structure in terms of command and control.'' In other
words, the targets NATO was striking from high in the air might
slow down but could not stop the destruction and killing by
Yugoslav forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of killing has taken place,'' the alliance's
spokesman, Jamie Shea, said. NATO on Saturday made public an aerial
photograph of what it said could be a mass burial site near the
village of Izbica with up to 150 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Shea and Marani offered no new information Saturday about
Yugoslav assertions that allied warplanes had killed scores of
fleeing Albanian civilians on the road between Djakovica and
Prizren on Wednesday afternoon. Foreign correspondents allowed to
go to the scene found debris from NATO ordnance near the wreckage
of civilian tractors and wagons, but all Marani would say was,
``Debris will be one element of our investigation, but debris can
be moved around.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that when NATO had figured out what happened it would
make its findings known, but Marani said he could not say whether
allied planes had attacked the road on Wednesday. That day, the
command said it had carried out a strike on a military convoy in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon on Saturday, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Capt. Steve Pietropaoli, said the pilot of an American F-16
whose taped interview was released last week after the incident had
attacked a military, not a civilian, vehicle. Pentagon officials
expressed concern that the aviator was being unfairly blamed for
the civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the new flow of refugees, Shea said that Yugoslav
authorities under President Slobodan Milosevic appeared to be
trying to empty the province of as many of its 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has rejected NATO's demands to stop the expulsions _
initially an enormous exodus, then more intermittent as the
Yugoslavs alternately opened and closed their borders _ accept a
cease-fire, and let international peacekeepers escort the refugees
back home. Shea said that Yugoslavia rejected similar demands by
the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received reports that up to 100,000 people may be
trying to reach the border at Morina,'' Shea said Saturday. Morina
is just inside Albania, near the already overcrowded refugee camps
at Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henderson, the British armed forces minister, said in
London that officials had received reports of 50,000 more refugees
on their way to Macedonia and 18,000 to Montenegro, on top of
560,000 driven out over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   In comments published in Macedonian newspapers Saturday, the
Macedonian defense minister, Nikola Kljusev, said his government
had rejected a request from the U.N. refugee agency and NATO to
build new camps in his country. ``It's possible to expand existing
camps,'' he was quoted as saying. ``But new refugees must
definitely go to third countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, with a large ethnic Albanian minority, is worried
that a huge influx of ethnic Albanians will destabilize its own
delicate politics.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in
Geneva said Saturday that if the flow continued, an airlift to fly
refugees elsewhere might have to be organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the numbers rising again, it will be extremely urgent to
get more sites or expand the ones we have, and perhaps also then to
fly more people out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While 7,000 refugees arrived in Macedonia, about 1,000 more were
turned back at the border by Serb security forces, who continued
their erratic pattern of behavior about when and whether to let
Kosovo's Albanians flee, refugees who made it across the frontier
said. Relief officials expressed hope that those 1,000 people would
make it across later.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said in a telephone
interview Saturday from Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, that the
bombing could still be going on in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic is losing,'' he said. ``If he does not
change his policies, we're going to destroy those things President
Slobodan Milosevic values.'' As he spoke, allied planes continued
systematically trying to destroy military and police headquarters,
bridges, anti-aircraft guns and missiles and Yugoslav air force
planes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies are finding it hard to pick off the tanks and
armored vehicles the Yugoslavs are using to systematically destroy
ethnic Albanian villages and settlements and drive out their
inhabitants. The Yugoslav campaign began late last year and
increased after the allies began bombing on March 24 because
President Milosevic rejected a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, as has been described before, his
whole military structure has a great deal of redundancy,'' said a
British admiral, Sir Ean Garnett, at a British Defense Ministry
briefing in London.
</P>
<P>
   Another NATO military officer said that the Yugoslav armed
forces had been structured over the last 50 years to be able to
wage a long war of resistance against foreign invasion, with vast
underground bunkers storing fuel, ammunition and weapons the allies
may not yet have even found, let alone destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson estimated that 1.1 million of the approximately 2
million people who were living in Kosovo at the last census in 1991
had fled since fighting flared up a year ago between the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, which wants independence for the province,
and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clark went to the Balkans Saturday to talk with leaders in
Macedonia and Albania about the refugee situation and about the
more than 20,000 NATO troops that are, or soon will be, in both
those countries to help deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has taken in 160,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the
last month, and 12,000 NATO troops originally intended for a
peacekeeping mission to Kosovo have built refugee camps and tent
cities for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Another 7,200 allied soldiers are on their way to Albania to do
the same there, and another 4,000 American troops are on their way
to the northern part of the country to fly Apache anti-tank
helicopters into Kosovo to hunt down Yugoslav units.

 &HT;    Milestone start a nice surprise
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Ernie Irvan makes his 300th career start in
a Winston Cup race in today's Goody's Body Pain 500 at Martinsville
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 Winston Cup regulars who have more career starts
but few have endured the pit falls Irvan has faced.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, 40, stared at death nearly five years ago, and has
battled a reputation of being reckless .
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been as low as you can get,'' Irvan said. ``I've been as
high as you can get. I've been a lot in the middle. ...''
</P>
<P>
   In his second season of driving the No. 36 Pontiac of MB2
Motorsports, a team owned by University of Georgia graduates Read
Morton, Nelson Bowers and Tom Beard, Irvan is 23rd in points after
seven races, trailing leader Jeff Burton by 389.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a surprise to many drivers that Irvan is still alive
to make the milestone start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wild on the track and he was taking a lot of chances
and putting a lot of people in jeopardy,'' veteran Darrell Waltrip
said. ``He was going to get somebody hurt. That's what we were all
worried about. You hate to see a talented driver go out and do
things that jeopardize him and everybody else. It doesn't have to
be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's reckless driving finally caught up to him in 1991, his
fifth season on the circuit. He caused an accident at Darlington,
in which Neil Bonnett suffered head injuries. A month later at
Talladega, Kyle Petty broke his leg in a wreck that was blamed on
Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Waltrip and Richard Petty sat Irvan down at
Talladega, telling him he had to temper his aggression and
apologize to the other drivers. Waltrip said Irvan immediately
reacted by ``sticking his chin out'' and saying, `That's the way
Dale Earnhardt does it.' I told him we don't need another Dale
Earnhardt,'' Waltrip said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, though, Irvan asked if he could apologize at
the drivers' meeting before the Winston 500 in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one turning point in your career that makes a
difference, I think that really made a difference,'' Irvan said.
``Not because of what I said, but because of my attitude and what I
changed about myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell Waltrip said, `You're as good a race car driver that
has ever stepped into Winston Cup racing, but if you don't
straighten up, you're going to get kicked out, not from Winston
Cup, but you're going to get kicked out because nobody is going to
like you and nobody is going to associate with you.' There's no
doubt those guys knew what they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   If Irvan didn't earn the respect of his competitors then, he
undoubtedly did after he was nearly killed in an accident at
Michigan Speedway in August 1994. Irvan was given only a 10 percent
chance of surviving, but, miraculously, he returned to racing after
14 grueling months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly four years later, he's still climbing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm kind of like coming back again,'' he said.

 &HT;    New pit road to play major role in race
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Winston Cup veteran Darrell Waltrip says you
better be careful what you ask for.
</P>
<P>
   For years, NASCAR drivers implored Martinsville Speedway to
reconfigure its pit road. The track finally obliged this year,
switching from pit roads on the front and back straightaways to
one, long continuous one. Drivers complained that cars pitting on
the backstretch had barely any shot at winning a race.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip and others believe the new pit road could play a major
role in today's Goody's Body Pain 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful what you pray for sometimes,'' said
Waltrip, second only to Richard Petty with 11 career victories at
Martinsville. ``We've all been praying for one pit road here and
we've got it. Now we've got to help them make it as good as it can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers have complained that the .526-mile oval is too
short to accommodate a 35-mph speed limit on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit road is going to kill you, period, on a green-flag
stop,'' said Kyle Petty, who will start 10th. ``Look at the race
track. It's a half-mile track. We can get around here in 20
seconds. It takes you 44 seconds to go down pit road at 35 mph.
That's two laps you've (lost) already during a green-flag stop.''
</P>
<P>
   B. Jones goes home
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker, Ga., was one of
three drivers who failed to qualify for today's race. It's Jones'
third DNQ of the season, and snapped his string of five starts in a
row.
</P>

   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ In another sign of forthcoming
American troop increases on the ground in Albania, a ranking Marine
Corps general from Camp Lejeune, N.C., arrived Saturday to scout
out the prospects for a possible deployment of Leathernecks in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup,'' Marine Major General Randy West, the deputy commander
of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, said in a brief interview
here when asked about whether the Marines may join the NATO forces
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   West is one of the operational chiefs who would be in charge of
deploying the battle-ready Marine landing unit of roughly 2,000
Marines that is now afloat in the Aegean Sea aboard the assault
ship U.S.S. Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark, made no mention
of a possible deployment of Marines during his first visit Saturday
to the Balkans since the start of the alliance's bombing of Serbian
targets.
</P>
<P>
   But after flying in for whirlwind consultations with Albanian
political and military leaders, Clark disclosed that the Army's new
outfit, called Task Force Hawk, was now in business at its
impromptu camp by the air field.
</P>
<P>
   He said Task Force Hawk will be under the command of a
three-star Army general, Lt. Gen. Jay Hendrix, who commands the U.
S. Fifth Corps in Heidelberg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a three-star general to command Task Force Hawk
was a hint, perhaps for Slobodan Milosevic's benefit, that the
Pentagon might eventually send as many as 20,000 ground troops
here. One of the few times in this decade when the U.S. has
entrusted a three-star general to command an expeditionary force
was the Somalia operation in the early 1990s, where U.S. troops
exceeded 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Corps, which includes the famed First Infantry
Division -- the Big Red One -- that has made its mark in nearly
every conflict involving American troops in this century.

   (NYT13) NEW YORK -- April 17, 1999 -- ABUSE-IMMIGRANTS-WIVES-2,
4-17 -- The abusive husband of this 26-year-old Dominican woman
threatened her because he was a legal resident and she was not.
``He would say that because he is legal, he has more rights in this
country than I do,'' she says. Advocates for issues involving
immigrants say spousal abuse has long been one of the most critical
problems endured by women who do not have legal residency in the
United States but are married to someone who does. (Joyce

   (NYT12) ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- April 17, 1999 --
ABUSE-IMMIGRANTS-WIVES-1, 4-17 -- Leslye Orloff, the national
policy director for Ayuda, a group supporting battered immigrants.
Ms. Orloff says that many of the women fear that if they leave the
United States, they will be exposed to suits claiming custody of
their children, many of whom were born in the U.S. ``They know that
they are going to be forced to make an impossible choice to either
leave the country to get their green card, and risk extreme danger
for themselves and their children,'' she says. (Peter Yates/New

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- April 17, 1999 -- NY-POLICE-COMMISSIONER,
4-17 -- For three years now, New York City Police Commissioner
Howard Safir has dutifully taken his place behind Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani at news conferences, his hands folded, his face set in
inscrutability. It is an enduring image of a friendship forged by
time shared in federal service, one in which roles are understood
and discretion is a given. (Don Hogan Charles/New York Times Photo)

career in the NHL. Gretzky's Rangers play against the Pittsburgh

   (NYT9) NEW YORK -- April 17, 1999 -- HKN-GRETZKY-RANGERS-1, 4-17
-- As Wayne Gretzky ends his 20-season career in the NHL, when his
Rangers play against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Madison Square
Garden on Sunday afternoon, Gretzky chooses to retire with the same
grace and creativity that led him to spread his sports' popularity
past the borders of his native Canada. Having shattered nearly
every offensive record, the great one always managed to keep his
ego in perspective, and control it as he did his stick. (Barton

   (NYT8) DENVER -- April 17, 1999 -- FLYING-UPSIDE-DOWN, 4-17 -- A
flight operations intern, Eric Gancarz, left, of United Airlines,
watches as Capt. John C. Penney, in a Boeing 747-400 simulator,
explains how a pilot would recover control of an airliner that was
rolling or diving. During three days of annual retraining, Capt.
John C. Penney drills crews on what to do if something throws the
plane out of kilter. ``It's not show-boating or hot-dogging,'' says
Penney, a former fighter pilot. ``It's an eye-opening exercise.''

   (NYT7) BEIJING -- April 17, 1999 -- CHINA-STREET-MARKETS, 4-17
-- At the Dragon Temple market, Yang Zhuju, 36, right, sits next to
the rubble of her stall. Like the man next to her, she repairs
shoes. Ms. Yang moved to Beijing a decade ago from a village in
southern China. By demolishing street markets, the local government
hopes it can drive rural migrants back home. ``How can they get rid
of us? What we do benefits the everyday life of Beijing
residents,'' says Ms. Yang. (Erik Eckholm/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) WASHINGTON -- April 17, 1999 -- UNEARTHED-BORDELLO, 4-17
-- The towering stone memorial for Mary Ann Hall, a determined
woman who built and managed one of this city's finest 19th-century
bordellos, stands just down the way from a phalanx of smaller
stones of departed lawmakers in the once-rural Congressional
Cemetery. Archaeologists have found no mention of Mary Ann Hall in
history books, but have uncovered bureaucratic records of her
bordello in the federal census. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times

   (NYT5) COLTON, Calif. -- April 17, 1999 -- HOSPITAL-ROOMS, 4-17
-- Thelma Waln, 64, recovering from hip surgery at the new
Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, likes her private room complete
with bathroom and television. Private rooms in hospitals were once
for only those affluent patients willing to pay extra. Now a
growing number of hospitals are eliminating shared rooms and
offering all patients -- Medicare and Medicaid, rich and indigent
-- their own rooms, often at no extra charge. ``This is going to
lead to malingering,'' says Mrs. Waln. (Edward Carreon/New York

   (NYT4) NEW YORK -- April 17, 1999 -- AIDS-TEEN-SURVIVORS-1, 4-17
-- Renell Grant, 49, is one of thousands of parents across the
country facing an unexpected challenge -- the three children she
adopted as HIV-infected babies in the 1980s are now thriving into
their teens. About 40 percent of infected children are cared for by
someone other than their biological parents. ``We were told that
these kids might die at any time and to be strong, give them a life
and make them comfortable,'' says Ms. Grant. (Nicole Bengiveno/New

   (NYT3) PASADENA, Calif. -- April 17, 1999 -- NASA-WOMEN, 4-17 --
Kari A. Lewis, 25, left, chief mission engineer, Sarah A. Gavit,
37, project manager, and Suzanne E. Smrekar, 37, lead scientist, a
women's team of experts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, head a
Mars mission. The team designed and built the two intricate
spacecraft. Each is about the size of a grapefruit to study the
rocky composition of the soil and look for signs of water, which is
considered a key to life but appears scarce on the desert-like
surface of Mars. (Edward Carreon/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT2) SKULL VALLEY GOSHUTE RESERVATION, Utah -- April 17, 1999
-- NUCLEAR-WASTE-FIGHT-2, 4-17 -- A sign near the reservation of
the tiny Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Tribe in Utah prohibiting
high level nuclear waste in the area. The Skull Valley Band has
signed a 50-year lease with eight electric companies to store bury
high-level nuclear waste on its reservation. The state fears that
once the waste gets here, it will never go away. (George Frey/New

<P>
   (NYT1) SKULL VALLEY GOSHUTE RESERVATION, Utah -- April 17, 1999
-- NUCLEAR-WASTE-FIGHT-1, 4-17 -- The chairman of the tiny Skull
Valley Band of the Goshute Tribe in Utah, Leon D. Bear, says making
the reservation a nuclear waste deposit could bring back tribe
members. The Skull Valley Band has signed a 50-year lease with
eight electric companies to store bury high-level nuclear waste on
its reservation. ``It's because of the economics, that's why people
left,'' says Bear. (George Frey/New York Times Photo)

USC AMONG WOMEN'S ROWING POWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A trivia question: Which school is the reigning
national champion in women's four-rowing?
</P>
<P>
   East Coast colleges come to mind: Princeton, Boston College,
Dartmouth. But the answer is USC.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to Trojans coach George Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an outdoor sport, and this is the best weather for
outdoor sports,'' he said. ``Why should someone in Boston be better
than us?''
</P>
<P>
   Rowing's not just for East Coast colleges anymore. Washington is
ranked first nationally according to U.S Rowing. USC is fifth, and
Gonzaga is a West Coast Conference power, having won each of the
first two WCC titles.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has designated women's rowing as an emerging sport,
freeing up scholarship money (USC has 20 scholarships). The West
Coast Conference has its championships today in Folsom, Calif. At
the same time and place, USC is competing in the California State
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have had rowing as a club sport since the late
1970s. Its importance to intercollegiate athletic programs is
increasing because schools now need more female athletes to achieve
gender equity.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins equates rowing's rise to that of women's volleyball
about 15 years ago. Back then, the best teams were in California.
Now, ``Nebraska is as good as Stanford,'' he said. ``Florida State
is as good as USC or UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Ott, the WCC assistant commissioner, said rowing is a
metaphor for life: You can only go forward by looking back.
</P>
<P>
   You also can come to the school, hook up with the program and
row your way to a scholarship. That's what USC's Annelisa Gross,
Kasey Ryan and Rebecca Moneymaker did, and they became three-fifths
of the winning women's fours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large numbers of women want to be involved,'' Ott said. ``It's
growing out here.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem: USC lost the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
women's water polo title to Cal last week. But coach Jovan Vavic
said it means nothing in the Trojans' plan to win the national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the MPSF is to get an MPSF winner,'' Vavic said.
``It also counts for our national seeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans next compete in the West Regionals at USC next week.
No matter what, the Trojans likely will be seeded no lower than
fourth at the NCAA tournament in Davis next month.
</P>
<P>
   Commitment: USC's volleyball team signed 6-foot-8 outside hitter
Marcus Gilmour, an All-Southern Section Division III second-team
pick who helped Santa Ynez High reach the section final. He also
helped his Junior Olympic team finish ninth.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA notes: The gymnastics team qualified for next week's NCAA
championships by winning last week's regional. The Bruins earned
the second seed in the 12-team nationals that start Thursday in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams compete in two separate preliminary sessions, with the
top three from each session advancing to the final. UCLA has a
favorable draw, going against Alabama, Stanford, West Virginia,
Arizona State and Louisiana State. The odds are good, coach Valerie
Kondos said, that the team will make the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since '89, we have the talent,'' Kondos
said. ``We don't need another team to fall. If we hit, we'll win.
In '97, if Georgia would've hit, we wouldn't have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four schools have ever won the national gymnastics title:
Utah, Alabama, UCLA (1997) and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Heidi Moneymaker is defending her NCAA uneven bars title.
Moneymaker is one of only four Bruins to have won an individual
title, but none won on the bars. She said tendinitis in her right
shoulder will make it difficult. She's more confident in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   _Swimmer Keiko Price was named to the Pacific-10 All-Academic
first team. Gymnast Susie Erickson made the second team.
</P>
<P>
   _The school is celebrating its 25th anniversary of women's
athletics with a gala dinner May 1 at the Beverly Hilton. Many of
the top UCLA athletes _ Ann Meyers Drysdale, Dot Richardson, Evelyn
Ashford, Lisa Fernandez, Jackie Joyner Kersee and Gail Devers _ are
expected to attend.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An explosion tore through a packed south London street
market on Saturday, leaving more than 40 people injured by flying
nails, shattered glass, and debris. The police said that the blast
did not seem to be linked to the Northern Ireland conflict or the
current impasse in peace negotiations there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this huge puff of smoke and then people started running
away,'' one witness, Brenna King, told British television. ``There
were people lying about on the ground in pools of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, there still was no clear picture of what
caused the explosion or anyone taking responsibility. The police
said that there had been no warning. Anti-terrorist units sent to
the area, near a supermarket in Brixton, south London, declined to
confirm reports by witnesses that what seemed to be a nail bomb had
been planted in a sports bag between market stalls, exploding when
a young boy picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Jules Thomas, told reporters that there had been a
``big flash and massive explosion'' and that medical personnel had
treated people who had nails embedded in their bodies. Reports
spoke of up to 48 people injured, two seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the explosion had been thronged with afternoon
shoppers. The police cordoned off access roads as explosives
experts combed debris. Jack Straw, the home secretary, called the
blast an `'outrageous and mindless act.''

 &HT;    Hudek glad to join Braves, leave Reds
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ John Hudek, the newest member of the bullpen, acquired
from Cincinnati in the Mark Wohlers trade, is both eager to join
the perennial playoff-contending Braves as well as to leave the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh thrilled, thrilled to death,'' Hudek said was his reaction
to Friday's news. ``There have been rumors years before that I was
asked to come here and now that's it's come true (my wife and I)
are just thrilled to death. That's why I got on the plane (Friday)
when they told me to get here for last night's game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for leaving the Reds, he said: ``I was glad to get out of the
Cincinnati scene, not as much for the players as I was upper
management.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Hudek heard Jim Bowden's comments in Saturday
morning papers, which were: ``I call this an `AON' deal _ all or
nothing,'' Bowden said. ``Mark Wohlers has a tremendous upside.
He's possibly one of the most dominant closers of the '90s. And if
we can't get him over the Steve Blass disease, we haven't lost
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudek's response to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Bowden for you,'' Hudek said. ``I'll leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudek is a hard-throwing reliever who has been up and down in
stints with the Astros, Mets and Reds in the last four seasons.
Hudek, who came back from 1996 rib extraction surgery _ the same
that Braves reliever Mike Cather had last summer _ characterized
his career as roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek is on the upswing now, coming off a career year with the
Mets and then the Reds, setting personal marks in appearances (58),
innings pitched (64), wins (5) and strikeouts (68) but also walks,
something that has hampered him throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   His role with the Braves is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Injury Update
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko was back swinging the bat against soft toss and took
some light batting practice on Saturday. For the first time since
he pulled his hamstring Wednesday night in Philadelphia, Klesko was
able to stretch his leg. ... Reliever Mike Remlinger is set to come
off the disabled list today. He's been on the 15-day DL with a
pulled lat muscle in his back.

TIGERS BEAT YANKS, 3-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Yankees of 1999 will help define the greatness of
the 1998 Yankees before this summer is over. These Yankees are
exceptional, with deep starting pitching and an even more explosive
Derek Jeter and a hungry Roger Clemens. They will win many games,
and they are the favorite to win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the '99 Yankees have already showed themselves capable of
slumps, the physical and mental slides and the periodic loss of
concentration that even the best teams inevitably experience over
the course of a 162-game season _ every team, of course, except the
'98 Yankees, who competed with intense concentration in almost
every game.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Yankees played poorly again Saturday in their third
consecutive defeat, a 3-1 loss to Detroit that was twice delayed by
rain. A poor decision by the reliever Jeff Nelson led to a throwing
error and cost the Yankees the lead in the bottom of the seventh
inning. And for the third straight game, the Yankees made two
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte, making his first start after beginning the season
on the disabled list, pitched six shutout innings, throwing
impressively, but when it was over, Pettitte spoke quietly in a
sullen Yankee clubhouse. Paul O'Neill, who made the final out with
the tying runners on base, slumped in front of his locker, stared
off into nowhere, arms crossed, his leg propped on another chair.
The Yankees are not accustomed to playing this way, squandering
scoring chances and giving away runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better club than that,'' said Don Zimmer, the Yankees'
interim manager, who on Friday referred to the team's recent play
as shabby. Hopefully, Zimmer said, ``we'll get our act together
tomorrow and play like we're capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Zimmer's 51st year in baseball. He has seen great teams
slump, and bad teams experience winning streaks. ``You can say
things like that happen,'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the '98 Yankees were so exceptional: things like that
did not happen to them. They lost games, sometimes two or three at
a time, but as Manager Joe Torre noted, he had never seen a team
maintain such a high degree of concentration for so long. The '98
Yankees were relentless, holding a lead in 48 consecutive games, a
streak that lasted from June to August.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Yankees (7-4) are a great team. They are not the '98
Yankees, they most likely will not win 114 games in the regular
season and will avoid the comparisons. ``It's our job to try to
stay away from those comparisons,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``To
me, that would be a big mistake, to entertain those comparisons.
It's a different year.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Cone acknowledged, the comparisons will be made all
year. The '98 Yankees ran the bases aggressively in the first half
of the season, setting a tone they maintained all season. They
swiped 23 bases in the first 11 games of '98, everybody from Jeter
to O'Neill to Darryl Strawberry looking to run; the '99 Yankees
have five stolen bases in the first 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch ran aggressively Saturday, and it cost them. The
Yankees assumed a 1-0 lead in the third inning, when Joe Girardi
rolled a double down the first-base line and scored on Knoblauch's
single.
</P>
<P>
   But then Knoblauch made the Yankees' first mistake of the day:
Jeter pulled a single to left, and Knoblauch churned around third,
challenging the strong throwing arm of Detroit left fielder Juan
Encarnacion _ and Knoblauch was cut down when Encarnacion made a
perfect throw. With nobody out and O'Neill, Bernie Williams and
Tino Martinez due to bat, it was a questionable decision that
loomed after the Yankees failed to score any more runs in the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cardinal rule in baseball that you don't get called out
at third base or home plate on the first out of an inning,'' said
Zimmer, who then recalled the times when he coached third when he
had violated that rule. ``Knoblauch thought he could make it,''
Zimmer added, with a shrug, ``but he didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who scored one run in Friday's loss to Detroit,
were 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position in the first six
innings. They had runners at first and third and two out in the
seventh when rain stopped the game for the second time. After a
delay of 1 hour 4 minutes, the game resumed with Jeter batting
against the hard-throwing Matt Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter coaxed a walk, loading the bases for O'Neill, and it
figured Detroit Manager Larry Parrish would call on a left-hander
to face O'Neill. But Parrish stuck with Anderson, based on a
scouting report that showed O'Neill batted .067 on high fastballs
last year _ and Anderson throws a very hard and high fastball.
O'Neill struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson relieved for the Yankees in the bottom of the seventh,
and with one out, Damion Easley hit a chopper down the third-base
line. Nelson charged the ball, telling himself over and over, throw
to first, throw to first. He picked it up, turned _ just as Easley
neared first _ and fired the ball away and into the vast foul
territory along the right-field line. Easley ended up at third on
the play, and later Nelson said the ball had slipped out of his
hand. ``But I should've eaten it,'' Nelson said, meaning he should
not have thrown the ball at all.
</P>
<P>
   Encarnacion singled home the tying run, and stole second and
third _ a problem that has plagued the Yankees this season _ and
scored the go-ahead run when the pinch-hitter Brad Ausmus singled
over a drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Even in beating Baltimore last Tuesday and Wednesday, the
Yankees did not play their usual brand of baseball. They are
slumping, and will break out of the slump. ``We'll be all right,''
Zimmer said the other day.

METS BEAT EXPOS, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the 35th anniversary of the first game played at
Shea Stadium, the Mets managed a 3-2 victory over the Montreal
Expos Saturday. The victory relied on a formula the Mets often won
with last season before Mike Piazza arrived _ good starting
pitching supported by maximum offensive efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had just six hits Saturday, but their lineup was
depleted with Piazza (sprained knee ligament) on the disabled list
and Rickey Henderson (tight hamstring) and Robin Ventura (sore
foot) out of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   As for the starting pitcher, however, not many could have
foreseen Bobby Jones opening the season like this. He performed
Saturday much as he did two seasons ago, when he opened with a 12-3
record and was selected to play in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   In his third start of the season, the 29-year-old right-hander
survived a shaky first three innings to retire 14 of the last 15
batters he faced. Jones, who struggled to a 9-9 record last season,
is now 3-0 with a 1.29 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt confident, as I did my first two starts,'' he
said. ``I was throwing every one of my pitches for strikes. And
when I can do that, those are the times I can be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones threw 82 strikes in 121 pitches. And with much help from a
big, lollipop curve ball, he scattered seven hits in his seven
innings, allowing only two runs, in the second inning, while
walking none and striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, enjoying a rare start at third base, tied the game
for Jones with a two-run double off Carl Pavano in the bottom of
the third. The Mets manufactured the winning run in the fifth when
Roger Cedeno doubled, Edgardo Alfonzo grounded to the right side,
John Olerud walked and Bobby Bonilla hit a run-scoring fielder's
choice. Olerud's hard slide was the key ingredient, breaking up a
potential inning-ending double play and allowing the winning run to
score.
</P>
<P>
   That offense was enough for Jones, after Armando Benitez pitched
a dominating eighth and John Franco came on to pitch a scoreless
ninth for his fourth save in as many opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a two-game losing skid for the Mets (8-4) and
enabled them to retake first place in the National League East from
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It still did not seem good enough, however, for some of the
announced 34,784 in attendance _ many of whom could not decide
whether to cheer or boo Bonilla and Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not dictating or concerned with what the crowd does,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``They have their own minds and they
can do what they want to do. But when someone is doing the b-o-o-o
thing with their mouth, it's a whole lot louder than 10 people
clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who ran out the fielder's choice play with a partial
ligament tear in his right knee, said: ``It's New York, man.''

THE ALLURE OF CONCORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ They started coming here in the 1790s.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders realized while George Washington was still president
that something extraordinary had occurred at Concord's North Bridge
on April 19, 1775, and they wanted to see the site for themselves.
They have never stopped coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter always knew when the tourists arrived because
their pocketbooks matched their shoes,'' recalls Barbara Powell,
director of the Concord Free Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The look is back. It's showtime once again in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   The bunting is up at the Colonial Inn, the front door repainted
at the North Bridge Visitor Center. Saturday, the Redcoats and the
Minute Men engaged in faux warfare along Battle Road, and some of
them danced the night away at the annual Patriots Ball. Monday
morning, a tattoo of musket fire breaks the dawn at the North
Bridge, followed by the requisite pancake breakfast at the Knights
of Columbus building and the town parade.
</P>
<P>
   This is distilled Yankee tradition at its purest.
</P>
<P>
   No other town in the country of comparable size can match
Concord's river of history, which began at the Puritan headwaters
and coursed through turbulent eddies of revolution and dreamy pools
of transcendentalism from the early 1600s to the Civil War. Since
then, the community has made an uncommon effort to memorialize its
past. Few other places have been as aware of their history as has
this town of 15,328.
</P>
<P>
   But managing history is harder than it looks, particularly when
there is so much to handle. Concord is no Potemkin village. Unlike
Colonial Williamsburg, the historic recreation in Virginia,
families here log onto the Internet while living in houses that are
two centuries old. It gets tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``People along Battle Road say that tourists peer in their
windows thinking their houses are museums,'' says Sally Schnitzer,
chairwoman of the Board of Selectmen, about the stretch of highway
between Concord and Lexington, where the bloodiest fighting of
April 19 took place. Adds David Hackett Fischer, author of ``Paul
Revere's Ride,'' ``Concord has always been very mixed feelings
about tourists. They are proud of their history but don't want to
be overrun.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is that historic turf is a sensitive subject in these
parts, honed to a fine edge by the inherent weirdness of smalltown
politics and the relentless pressure from developers to build on
the town's dwindling stock of open land as homes skyrocket into
seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the current contretemps between the Orchard
House, home of the Alcotts and a National Historic Landmark since
1963, and its neighbors. Last week, its board of directors closed
on a house across the street to alleviate structural problems and
severe shortage of space in the Alcott home.
</P>
<P>
   But the board did not inform any of the Orchard House neighbors
of the acquisition, which began more than a month ago. Bad idea.
Signs now dot the front yards of the homes in the area reading,
``This Is A Residential Neighborhood'' and ``No No Orchard House
Annex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bronson Alcott would have never behaved to his neighbors this
way,'' says Lee Bagley, who lives with her family across from
Orchard House. ``We already tolerate a lot with tourists, but this
is just intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the firestorm, Christopher Davies, the board chairman
of Orchard House, vows to find a compromise. ``We're very anxious
to work things out with our neighbors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And relations between the Historic District Commission, which
rules on all new construction in historic areas, and the Board of
Selectmen are a tad frosty these days because the commission keeps
rejecting projects proposed by the selectmen, such as an
air-conditioning system in the Town House, Concord's old town hall.
Then too, there is a byzantine warrant on the Town Meeting agenda
this month that conceivably could lead to the abolition of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, history.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, though, the degree of comity over the
years within the community over its history has been remarkable,
and Concord has managed its extraordinary patrimony with care. ``It
does an excellent job,'' says Fischer, who teaches history at
Brandeis. There are, to be sure, a few altercations at the moment,
but Schnitzer is unfazed. ``This is what real life is all about,''
she says. ``There has been a flurry this year, but it comes and
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Concord's approach to its past is to know its
congenital reticence. `` `Don't mess with it too much' is how
Concord has handled it,'' explains Powell. ``Everyone relaxes until
something comes up and then you have a polarizing controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Concordians, after all, have always been an independent lot.
This explains why there is no Concord Historical Society. Instead,
there exists a dizzying array of groups devoted to the different
strains of its story spanning three centuries. The closest thing to
an umbrella structure is the Concord Historical Collaborative, a
loose confederation linking the directors of the various historic
organizations. It is not listed in the telephone book, and no one
is sure when it started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talked to everybody and then someone finally put a
name on it,'' says Nancy Nelson, superintendent of the Minute Man
National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborative effort was overdue for a town with such a
breathtaking patrimony, anchored by two superb institutions, the
private Concord Museum, and the public Concord Free Public Library.
``They have the documents and we have the artifacts,'' says Desiree
Caldwell, the museum director.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just for starters. Other private outfits include the
Thoreau Society, the Thoreau Institute (whose headquarters are over
the Lincoln line), Walden Woods (a project of the institute), the
Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, the Ralph Waldo Emerson
Memorial Association, and the Old Manse, the Emerson ancestral
home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the library, the town fields the Thoreau
birthplace and Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, where Thoreau, Emerson, the
Alcotts, and Hawthorne are buried.
</P>
<P>
   The US government boasts the historical park stretching into
Lexington, the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, and The
Wayside, home at various points to Alcotts and Nathaniel Hawthorne.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts claims Walden Pond State
Reservation, which includes the site of Thoreau's iconic cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Phew.
</P>
<P>
   The very richness of this historic stew invites controversy over
the best way to digest it. Exhibit A is the imbroglio over the
visitor's center, a spirited slugfest that has kept things
interesting for years. The selectmen twice have tried
unsuccessfully to gain Historic District Commission approval for a
plan to turn a garage in an open field near the center of town into
a visitors center to replace the current one across the street,
which resembles an off-season roadside blueberry stand.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, tourists are basically on their own now when they
hit town. ``You see the first person walking on Lexington Road and
ask where to begin,'' Powell says.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes would be minimal, supporters maintain.
Besides, something is needed. More than a million people visit
Concord each year and they lack a coherent way to plan their day.
More important, they need restrooms. There are none now at the
current site, and history without toilets is a tall order for a
family of four.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is deadly serious to some. ``There is an
extraordinary rift in the town over this,'' says Chris Rinaldo,
cochair of the Concord Historic Commission, who opposes the plan.
``The site is one of the last remaining pieces of open land near
the center of town.'' Adds John Althouse, Historic District
Commission secretary, ``Selectmen want to take a 1950s Cape garage
and dress it up with colonial accoutrements and say it is
appropriate for a meadow.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lull in combat now, and the two sides should reach a
compromise. But when? ``That is the great question,'' says
Selectman Arthur Fulman, who supports the proposal. ``I hope it
gets settled in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists are oblivious to such internal fissures in the
town's facade. Their inexorable tide has led to the creation of a
cadre of 73 licensed town guides, most of whom work with the
Chamber of Commerce. The mere idea of licensed guides would have
appalled Concordians a few decades ago. But gone are the days of
creative history. ``My daughter used to give tours at the Orchard
House,'' says Powell. ``She made a lot of it up as she went.'' No
more.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ripple was the appearance last month of a tourist
trolley plying the literary trail of homes of famous authors from
Boston through Cambridge to Concord. It will be a weekly fixture in
town for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents take its arrival in stride. Outsiders, after all,
have been showing up for a couple of centuries. So what's another
trolley?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, history.

NATO COMMANDER WARNS ON SPREAD OF WAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ As fighting proceeded along the
Albanian-Yugoslav frontier, NATO Commander Wesley K. Clark Saturday
expressed his greatest concerns yet that the conflict may intensify
beyond Yugoslavia's borders. He warned Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, that NATO is ``going to do everything it can''
to contain Yugoslav aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army
turned over a captured Serb soldier to NATO troops. A Pentagon
spokesman said he was ``not optimistic'' that the captured Serb
could be swapped for three US soldiers who were taken as prisoners
of war on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army's of the Serb soldier to NATO
reflected increasing collaboration between the guerrilla force and
the Western alliance, which had shied away from supporting the
organization because of its terrorist tactics and its goal of
independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group said they have shared reconnaissance photos
with NATO to help its bombing campaign against Serb troops, and
NATO leaders have admitted that they are in touch with at least one
rebel leader, although they have not said NATO is providing the
Kosovo force directly with arms.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army is openly recruiting in NATO
countries, which apparently have not restricted the flow of new
guerrillas to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander, said the alliance is
committed to securing the border with the northern part of Albania,
which is peppered with Kosovo Liberation Army training camps, and
which, in recent days, has come under heavy fire from Serb forces
on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the situation in the north, where
Serb agression is increasingly evident, with artillery being fired
across the border and infantry forays'' into Albania, Clark said
after meeting with officials here Saturday. ``That has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also these developments Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   --New questions surrounded the admission last week that a NATO
plane had accidentally struck a civilian convoy and killed some
refugees. When NATO confirmed that one of its pilots had
accidentally hit civillians, the military alliance also released an
audio tape from an F-16 pilot in which a bombing run was described.
The tape was reported to have been made by the pilot who had
launched the bomb that killed the civilians. But Pentagon officials
said Saturday that the tape had come from a pilot who had correctly
executed a strike on a Serbian military convoy.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO officials said that the Serbs had stepped up their
campaign of ``ethnic cleansing.'' One report said that 3,200 ethnic
Albanians had been killed. More than 100,000 refugees are believed
to be heading toward the Kosovo border, seeking shelter in one of
the crowded frontier refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   --A NATO spokesman said that aerial photos showed what appeared
to be mass graves. One photo showed that as many as 150 people
appeared to have been buried at a grave site in Izbica, according
to Brigadier General Guisseppe Marani, a NATO spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, the Albanian capital, NATO forces prepared for the
arrival of 24 Apache helicopters, as US Army soldiers amassed in a
camp inside the Tirana airport, where they are setting up
logistical support for the low-flying craft.
</P>
<P>
   Clark indicated that the operation in Albania will intensify in
the next few days, while pointing out the increased Army presence
in the military camps at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Several US senators also visited the military base Saturday,
meeting with US troops. Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska,
addressed concerns about the wait for the arrival of the Apaches,
which are supposed to begin flying to Tirana Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had to ``make sure that they have the total
support before they go into combat activity,'' Stevens said,
expressing his commitment to the operation. ``As long as we are
doing it, we've got to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, urged
Congress to approve emergency funding for US troops. ``The bottom
line here is, the mission has to prevail,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bujar Bukoshi, a former leader of the Kosovo regional
government that signed the Rambouillet, France, peace accord in
February, said for the first time that he did not expect Kosovo to
remain part of Yugoslavia. He said the peace deal is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed for peace and we got a genocide,'' Bukoshi said
during a visit to a refugee camp in Tirana. ``The only alternative
now is to stop the Serbian fascism. Almost anything should be
allowed to stop the genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he now supported the Kosovo Liberation Army,
Bukoshi, in a departure from his previous statements, said, ``Of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, the citizenry tried to go on with life
as normally as possible, with joggers taking part in a three-mile
``fun run'' through the city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Anne E. Kornblut reported from Tirana, Albania, and Michael
Kranish from Washington.

 &HT;    Rockies rock Rocker
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Tom Glavine and the Braves had the Rockies right where
they wanted them, down 4-2 in the bottom of the ninth inning at
Coors Field. But John Rocker didn't do his part, blowing his first
save opportunity of the year by allowing three runs as the Braves
fell 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Echevarria, the 25th man on the Rockies 25-man roster,
came through with a bases-loaded single to tie the game at 4 and
bring up Darryl Hamilton, who won it on a flair to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused really at the bottom line,'' Rocker said
afterward. ``That's the best stuff I've ever had. I haven't given
up three runs in an inning in probably a year and a half. ...
You're either the hero or the goat. ... I don't know. Stuff
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got one out before walking Todd Helton. He then gave up a
single to Mike Lansing who was able to turn on a 100-mph fastball.
Rocker then walked Kirt Manwaring to load the bases. He had
Echivarria 2-2 and late on his fastball but hung him a slider which
Echivarria fired into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk guys in the ninth inning, you're going to get beat,
simple as that,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We played a
terrific ballgame. We played flawless until that inning. You don't
see many real good games like that here. Usually something happens.
It did, in the ninth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The blown save spoiled the first win opportunity for Tom
Glavine, who was fighting back from his worst start since 1990 at
0-2. Glavine found his form in the most unlikeliest of places _
Coors Field. But Glavine feels a lot more comfortable here than
most. He's thrown two of the seven shutouts in the stadium's
five-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine scattered seven hits on Saturday, allowing only two
runs, striking out five and walking one. lowered his ERA from 7.11
to 5.49.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's frustrating,'' Glavine said of the no-decision.
``I guess there's nothing you can do about it. I'm more
disappointed that we lost the game as a team. No question it would
have been nice to get the first win under my belt and get going. I
felt good about what I did today. I hope it's something I can build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   With he and Rockies ace Darryl Kile swapping turns on the mound
Saturday afternoon, the game was much less about rocket shots and
tons of runs and more about about ground balls and manufacturing a
few runs.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss, the former Rockie, worked his way on base with a 3-2
double to right field to lead off the seventh inning, moved to
third on a Tom Glavine bunt and scored on an Otis Nixon flyball.
That put the Braves up 3-2 in the last inning they would have to
contend with Kile.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan jumped on Rockies reliever Jerry DiPoto his third
pitch into the game with a rocket shot to left field for his third
home run of the year putting the Braves up 4-2 in the eighth
inning.

 &HT;    Falcons feel lucky to grab Kerney
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves wasn't doing cartwheels at 5
p.m. Saturday, but if he weren't 54 years old with double-digit
surgeries to his credit, he might have tried.
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta selected Virginia defensive end Patrick Kerney in
the first round of the NFL draft, Reeves and team officials were
quite pleased they were able to get a player projected by many to
go much earlier in the round.
</P>
<P>
   Kerney, a 6-foot-5, 270-pounder who blossomed during the past
two seasons, had 15 sacks as a senior, eight as a junior and 31
tackles for a loss in his past two seasons with the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 minutes later, the Falcons traded their first-round
pick for the 2000 draft in exchange for Baltimore's second-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which did not have a second-round pick of its own then
used the 42nd pick overall to select Mississippi State tight end
Reggie Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 253-pound Kelly caught just 12 passes for 140 yards and
a touchdown last fall in his only season as a full-time starter. He
did, however, have 54 knockdown blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kerney addresses an immediate need. Starters Chuck Smith and
Lester Archambeau are the only ends on the roster who have played
in an NFL game, and both have contracts that expire after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great motor; he really brings it on every play,''
Reeves said. ``And he's a great kid with a frame to get bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed with Coach Reeves, and (defensive line
coach Bill) Kollar,'' said Kerney. ``It was nerve-wracking waiting
so long, but it's great to go to a team that is coming off a Super
Bowl. I hope to be able to compete to start right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, who had the third-to-last selection in the third
and final round Saturday, also have six selections in the final
four rounds today. They also are expected to announce that they
have reached agreement with a veteran defensive lineman, likely
former Vikings defensive end Derrick Alexander.

VARIED LOCALES KEY DRAW FOR FILMMAKERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S
SANTA CLARITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Lured by lower costs and competitive
locales, producers have been moving north to Canada in droves.
</P>
<P>
   But some, including the makers of the Woody Allen comedy ``Pick
Up the Pieces'' and the Paramount television series ``Seven Days,''
are taking far shorter trips north to a rising star in Los Angeles
County's film industry: the Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the valley's combination of lower costs, varied
environments and booming growth has helped it carve a solid niche
at a time when the local industry is beginning to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Clarita Valley is probably one of the strongest
communities in the Southland in terms of support and promotional
efforts,'' said John Grant, a Camarillo, Calif.-based location
scout. ``The area is very approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   That approachability has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's film bureau issued a record 355 film permits in
1998. Two major 1999 movies, ``Wild Wild West'' and ``Life,'' were
shot in the area, and television's ``The X-Files'' often uses
valley locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick Up the Pieces'' will begin filming next month at the
Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   At the Legacy Partners, the year-old Santa Clarita facility
where ``Seven Days'' is based, location director Jeff Botsford said
film revenue is 50 percent over projections.
</P>
<P>
   But movie boosters here are not resting on their laurels.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the specter of competition abroad and a general
slowdown at home, industry backers are pushing a new campaign using
the valley's booming housing and business market to give renewed
weight to the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   The message now is more than just a recitation of the low costs
and varied locales that have made the valley a top film spot, said
Santa Clarita Chamber of Commerce film liaison April Aston.
</P>
<P>
   The new message, she said, is Santa Clarita is a great place to
``base your project, base your company or move your entire
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the development that Newhall Land and Farming Company
has planned, there's a lot of energy going into that message,''
Aston said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry backers also are concentrating on bringing businesses
into the valley, including shops for film ``expendables'' such as
rigging, tape and camera supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clarita Valley Motion Picture General Store, a
satellite office of Burbank-based L&AMP;M Technology Group that began
selling expendables last year, was a major contributor to that
effort, Aston said.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of businesses and employees would add to the
approximately 8,000 entertainment industry workers already living
in the Santa Clarita Valley. By bringing more executives and
workers into the valley, film boosters hope they will keep
production closer to workers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of the film industry shifting and moving
elsewhere, we have the luxury of being in the center of one of the
fastest-growing communities in Los Angeles County,'' Aston said.
``That's helping us weather the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   But that expanding population is only one of many factors that
have turned the region into one of the top producers in the
entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   The area's natural environment, the element that scouts say is
its biggest draw, will remain despite any slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas that could be doubled for deserts, mountains,
creeks,'' location scout Grant said. ``There are looks you just
can't get in the Los Angeles Basin.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie ranch owner Rene Veluzat, an area native who began working
in movies in 1950, said scenes can shift from desert to lake to
suburbia, all in a matter of miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three out of four of the pictures that are written can be
filmed in the Santa Clarita Valley,'' he said. ``We have every look
imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Veluzat's popular ``Spanish town'' setting, just a short walk
from his newest small-town America set, was the site of recent
filming for a special CBS episode of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers also have been lured to Santa Clarita by the bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   Production costs in the area's stages and movie ranches are
often far lower than comparable costs in traditional studio back
lots.
</P>
<P>
   Producers who shoot here save on labor costs because Santa
Clarita is within the 30-mile zone, which can save a host of
additional costs. Outside the zone, a producer has to pay workers
for transportation, meals and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest figures from the Motion Picture
Association of America, film and entertainment companies spent $394
million in Santa Clarita in 1996, a 168 percent increase over 1992
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its varied locales and facilities, the Santa
Clarita Valley film industry is expecting to take a hit this year.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running series ``Melrose Place'' is ending this year,
and the series ``Magnificent Seven'' also is closing shop.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the threat of foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping `Seven Days' doesn't move to Canada,'' said
Aston.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the numbers I've seen say that a great number of L.A.
features are going to other countries,'' she said. ``It's going to
be a rough year.''

INVESTMENT TIPS GEARED TO BLACKS USEFUL FOR ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As a former personal finance editor for Black
Enterprise magazine, Juliette Fairley received many letters asking
for help on how to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a need for basic investment education, she wrote a book
filled with money tips from the leading financial experts in the
African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the advice in her ``Money Talks: Black Finance
Experts Talk to You About Money,'' is applicable to anyone --
regardless of race or gender -- who is new to the market. That is,
stop spending money on unnecessary luxuries and start investing
money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our children a disservice if we don't leave them
with an inheritance,'' Fairley said. ``We (also) want to have a
good retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairley has a unique view of Wall Street. In addition to her
work at Black Entertainment magazine, she's a personal finance
correspondent for a weekly business show on Black Entertainment
Network. She has contributed to the New York Times and USA Today.
Fluent in French, she was a news anchor for Agence Internationale
D'Image Televisee in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Fairley said in a recent interview that the African-American
community is not widely benefiting from a strong stock market as
much as other investors across America. While there are certainly
affluent and successful African-Americans on Wall Street, many
people in the community still are novice investors, if they're
investing at all.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is a lower income base, she said, and lack of
experience and knowledge about the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans don't make as much money,'' Fairley said.
When they have savings, ``they've worked so hard to get it, they
don't want to lose it. They see (the stock market) as gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   While growth in median income for African-Americans -- up 4.3
percent from 1995 to 1997 after adjusting for inflation -- rose
higher than the 1.9 percent for the general population,
African-American household income still lags behind all other
groups, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The median household income for African-Americans was $25,050,
compared with $45,249 for Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders,
$38,972 for whites and $26,628 for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller income is one reason fewer African-Americans own
securities.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 percent of African-Americans own market assets compared
with 20 percent of whites, said Deardra Green-Campbell, president
of D. Campbell &AMP; Co. Inc., an investment education and information
organization in Atlanta that publishes a Web site aimed at
African-Americans at www.investedmagazine.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among households earning $50,000 or more, slightly more than
half of blacks own securities, compared with 81 percent of whites,
Green-Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the income and experience disparity, investing is
possible, Fairley points out in her book, and necessary. Fairley's
book lays out simple first steps for readers to take -- really,
tips that can be used by any novice investor.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do is control spending and save more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fairley decried name-brand shopping, saying it's a
habit that's quite costly. And she pointed out that frequent trips
to the beauty salon can add up to a lot of money not saved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other recommendations made by financial advisers in
Fairley's book:
</P>
<P>
   Track expenditures to find wasteful spending. That $2.50 latte
each workday costs $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Save 10 percent to 15 percent of wages, or at least $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Put savings in a mutual fund, where it should appreciate in
value.
</P>
<P>
   Set financial goals -- whether it's for a new car, trip to
Hawaii or cushier retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Become familiar with the investment world. Read financial
publications, watch CNBC or other business news shows, and scour
the Internet for information.
</P>
<P>
   After starting an investment program, let it grow.

CASINOS HAVE NOT BEEN THE OGRES MANY PREDICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City made national headlines Thursday for its enlightened
business climate, in which health-care insurance is more readily
available for small-company workers than it is in many other U.S.
metro areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for this situation, according to The Wall
Street Journal Page 1 story, should go to the riverboat casinos.
When the gaming industry arrived here, it apparently raised the
benefits bar a couple of notches by providing health-care coverage.
Many small firms had no choice but to follow suit to survive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This helped to encourage the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce to find a way to help these small firms. The article
praised chamber President Pete Levi for teaming up with Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Kansas City several years ago to devise an
affordable health-care coverage plan that pooled the risk of many
small businesses into one program. It's called ChamberCHOICE and
covers nearly 12,000 employees and their families at more than
3,000 businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the gaming palaces arrived in Kansas City, opponents
refused to acknowledge that they would be responsible for any
positive economic contributions. There were warnings instead that
the cost of dealing with increased social pathology would more than
offset any economic benefit created by riverboats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the dire consequences haven't materialized.
Meantime, the boats not only have created thousands of good-paying
jobs, but also, as it apparently turns out, helped enhance the
fortunes of other local workers as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the overall benefit of the casinos themselves, a
scientifically rigorous analysis of the gaming industry supports
the view that both casinos and greyhound racing are indeed spurs to
economic growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Walker of Georgia College &AMP; State University and John
D. Jackson of Auburn University set out to explore two aspects of
the issue. One was whether legalized gambling generated economic
growth and, if so, was the result dependent on out-of-town
business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their analysis was published in the fall '98 issue of The Review
of Regional Studies, which is the official journal of the Southern
Regional Science Association. As a scientific exercise, their
approach depends so heavily on quantitative models and the
resulting math as to be incomprehensible to anyone untrained in
these methods. This precision, however, is what distinguishes it
from most other efforts to probe the economic merit of the gaming
business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When all the pertinent numbers were run, the two economists
concluded that both casino and greyhound racing operations create
economic growth. Moreover, they found that ``exports,'' or outsider
patronage, weren't crucial to achieving such growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What aroused their interest, they said, was the thesis of
legendary economist Joseph Schumpeter, who posited in the '30s that
providing a new good for consumers spurs economic growth. They
wanted to see if Schumpeter's thesis applied to areas involved in
the relatively recent legalized gambling boom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Walker-Jackson research and what's happening in Kansas City
are both valuable additions to the debate over the economic value
of legalized gaming. &QL;

 &HT;    Fraud suit says Pohl cheated his investors
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bill Pohl, whose land holdings will help define
the future of the U.S. 183 corridor, amassed at least $18 million
through fraudulent land deals that exploited his partners' trust in
him, according to a lawsuit in state district court.
</P>
<P>
   Using European corporations to conceal profits, the lawsuit
charges, Pohl and his associates bought land, then sold it to
investors they had solicited at prices marked up by 21 percent to
359 percent without disclosing the profit to theinvestors. Pohl,
who has been involved in about 105 limited partnerships since 1974,
created and continues to manage the five identified in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Because 985 acres acquired by the partnerships were overpriced,
the lawsuit says, citing previously confidential sales prices, the
partnerships have been unable to sell the tracts, even during the
land boom of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl says he provided investors information required by law. A
small group of frustrated investors filed the suit, Pohl says, and
it has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter mailed to his partners in April 1998, Pohl
vigorously denied the allegations, saying that a plaintiff's lawyer
had mischaracterized the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer ``has taken isolated accounting entries and removed
them from context to create allegations and accusations that are
false,'' Pohl said in the letter, which was filed as evidence in
the suit. ``His letters would lead you to believe that Gary Brown
and I have stolen from the partnerships. This is absolutely false.
Not only have we not stolen from the partnerships, we have never
deceived anyone.'' Pohl's partnershipscontrol about 5,000 acres _14
times the size of Zilker Park _ worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, giving them enormous influence over the growth of
Northwest Austin and southwest Williamson County. Pohl and his
associates also are major contributors to the elected officials who
decide when and where to build roads and extend water and sewer
service that make development possible. ``They are unbelievable,''
said Kent Taylor, a real estate agent who handles commercial land
in southern Williamson County. ``They are the major land player in
the area.'' The Bill Pohl story is about money, land and politics.
His successes and failures parallel those of the entire real estate
community, which dominated Austin's business and political scene
until high-tech entrepreneurs recently joined the party. For 25
years, Pohl has bet his and his partners' money on the power of
suburban housing prices and schools to draw the middle class and
its employers to the edge of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names Pohl as well as Pohl, Brown &AMP; Associates Inc.,
the real estate company he runs with Gary F. Brown, and several of
Pohl's partners and associates. Eleven investors, mostly from the
Austin area, filed the suit in July 1997. Since then 23 more, most
of them Belgian, have joined. The suit now involves 16 partnerships
that own 1,987 acres, almost all in Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs describe Pohl, Brown in the lawsuit as a company
``adrift without any ethical moorings,'' where profits are for
insiders, creditors are shown false data and investors are
deceived. As the suit heads toward a hearing, Pohl, Brown officials
are continuing to negotiate to sell land _ 640 acres at first, with
more possible _ in Northwest Austin and Cedar Park to PacTen
Partners,a California company.
</P>
<P>
   While Pohl is best-known for trying to bring a Double-A baseball
team to Cedar Park and for buying the 446-acre, state-owned Hog
Farm tract last year after a zoning fight with Austin, his main
business for 25 years has been real estate brokerage and investing.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl, who grew up in Austin, has persuaded about 1,200 American
and European investors to give him tens of millions of dollars for
land purchases in the Austin area and, more recently, near Dallas
and Houston, and in Florida and California. Pohl tells investors to
expect three to five times their money back and says his
partnerships usually hold land three to five years before selling,
according tothe lawsuit and confidential offering memorandums
distributed to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl, Brown gathers investors into limited partnerships _ groups
of people who pool their money to share ownership of a business or
property. Limited partnerships give investors confidentiality and
shield them from personal liability for claims against the
business, said Brian Rider, a professor who teaches law and real
estate at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas and California, unlike in most states, limited
partnerships don't have to pay franchise taxes, which corporations
and companies pay annually, Rider said. The Legislature has decided
not to tax limited partnerships because many small, family-owned
businesses use that structure, Rider said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loophole has been created for nothing that has to do with
. . . real estate,'' Rider said. ``But the real estate people are
using it.'' At least 19 of Pohl's partnerships have been through
bankruptcy. Others had land foreclosed on for not making payments,
and some were sued on allegations they failed to pay taxes or repay
loans worth millions of dollars, according to court records. The
State Securities Board gathers complaints and pursues cases of
securities fraud, including allegations such as those in the suit,
some of which would be felonies if prosecutors proved them in
criminal court. But filing a civil suit is often the quickest and
surest remedy for investors, said David Weaver, general counsel for
the securities board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise people when they do file complaints with us
that they should also seek private counsel, because the likelihood
of their recovering from our actions is just not that great,''
Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's 28-person enforcement division is in charge of
investigating and enforcing securities violations by the more than
100,000 securities agents in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A question of disclosure
</P>
<P>
   The people suing Pohl, Brown say that in a series of deals,
company officials negotiated land buys and organized limited
partnerships to make the purchases. Investors understood that Pohl
would take a standard broker's commission on that deal and even
share some of the money with other investors. Then Pohl, Brown
officials or companies controlled by Pohl, Brown bought the land
first and sold it to the partnerships without telling investors of
the intermediate deals, the plaintiffs say. Failure to disclose the
``flips,'' which made Pohl, Brown millions of dollars, breached the
company's legal responsibilities to its investors, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Farmer, an investor and longtime friend of Pohl, was an
investor in Carolville Ltd., one of the partnerships at issue in
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl drove Farmer out to look at the land, on Brushy Creek Road
where Parmer Lane now intersects it, in 1989. ``It was raw land,
agricultural land, covered with cactus and live oak trees and some
cedars,'' Farmer saidin an interview last fall. Noting the
continued lack of activity there, he said it looked ``just like it
looks today, pretty much.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer put up the $85,000 earnest money on a contract to buy the
525 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Farmer discussing the deal a few years later, Pohl
said that company officials spent about two years in ``tough
contract negotiations'' to buy the land from former Texas Attorney
General Will Wilson and Ann Seaman, whose family sold the land to
liquidate a family trust.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Pohl, Brown &AMP; Brown Inc. _ a previous name for
Pohl, Brown &AMP; Associates Inc. _ told Farmer that Carolville would
buy the land for about $9,000 an acre,Farmer said in a sworn
statement. Since Texas was in a recession and land was selling
cheaply, especially in the Austin area, Farmer said he assumed the
partnership was buying land for a good price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be one of those things that we would
buy today and six months later sell for four times what we put into
it, but I thought over five to seven years it would be a good
investment,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   What Farmer and other plaintiffs testified they didn't know was
that on June 20, 1989, just before Carolville bought the land,
Garry C. Brown _ who no longer is with the company _ bought it, as
a trustee, for less than $7,500 per acre, according to deed records
collected as part of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In records filed from 12:39 p.m. to 12:41 p.m. on June 27, 1989,
Garry C. Brown bought the 525 acres for about $3,743,000 and sold
it to the partnership for $4,698,750.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl said in an interview this month that almost all the
$955,000 price increase in Carolville was used to pay commissions
to Europeans who helped find investors for the partnership. Pohl,
Brown officials also got a commission of about 6 percent of the
purchase price from Wilson and Seaman, which is standard and was
disclosed to investors, Pohl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance went to the people who raised the money in
Europe,'' who wanted the deal structured in two parts, Pohl said.
European agents demand more than the 6 percent commissions that are
standard in the United States, Pohl said. ``You have to pay an
outrageous commission to attract it. It's just that simple,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said the intermediate sale, which the lawsuit says he
didn't discover until after the suit was filed in 1997, infuriated
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have never done another deal with him if I'd known
Carolville was bought for $3.7 million and he told everyone $4.7
million,'' Farmer said last fall. ``I would have never done another
deal with the guy at all, and I would have gotten out immediately,
and I would have taken action against him then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged with it,'' Farmer said. ``I think it's the most
asinine thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pohl said that Farmer knew of the intermediate transaction and
had received commissions himself for recruiting other people _ his
daughter, mother and some friends _ to invest, knowing the land
price was going to increase to pay European commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit now becomes part of Farmer's legacy. He killed
himself in January, after about 10 years of battling multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Alleged markups
</P>
<P>
   Carolville was not the only, and it was far from the largest,
deal in which Pohl and his associates made millions off their
partners by inflating the price of land, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other deals for 460 acres included hidden markups of $17
million, plaintiffs allege. In those sales, Pohl used third parties
he controlled to make the profits, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Documents in the suit show that two European corporations _
Madron Investments Ltd., incorporated in Gibraltar, and F.F.U.
Ltd., incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands _ sold land to Pohl,
Brown partnerships for millions of dollars more than the
corporations had paid for the land. None of the markups was
disclosed, and the money was returned to Pohl and other defendants,
the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   While Pohl denies being an owner of either Madron or F.F.U., the
plaintiffs say he runs both companies and essentially used them as
checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those deals, the plaintiffs say, Madron made $10
million, and $6.6 million ended up in Pohl, Brown's pocket later
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Madron bought 148.29 acres surrounding Lakeline Mall for $4.8
million on March 27, 1995, and sold the land to two Pohl, Brown
partnerships about 10 days later for $15 million, according to
settlement statements filed in the lawsuit and Williamson County
deed records.
</P>
<P>
   Financial statements for both corporations show that from April
to December 1995, after selling to the Pohl, Brown partnerships,
Madron paid F.F.U. $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the same period, F.F.U. paid Pohl, Brown $6.5 million and
paid thousands of dollars directly to Pohl and Brown and other
employees of the company as commissions, financial records for
F.F.U. show.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl said most of the $10 million markup went to reimburse
Madron for payments it had made to settle back taxes. The markup
also covered other expenses, including commissions for European
agents and Pohl, Brown officials, Pohl said. He structured the sale
to pass through the European companies to protect his investors'
assets from possible seizure by the local governments owed the back
taxes, Pohl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took all the cost for those parcels, plus commissions to
Europe, 6 percent for us, and that's how you get'' the price paid
by the partnerships, Pohl said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say Madron profited from buying and selling land
to Pohl, Brown partnerships and shared those profits with Pohl and
other defendants who helped set up the deals.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say that Pohl controls Madron and that Christian
Jean-Jacques Wanner is the key to understanding Pohl's relationship
to Madron.
</P>
<P>
   Wanner, a Swiss man who has done business with Pohl, Brown for
years, has signed deeds on behalf of Madron when the corporation
bought and sold hundreds of acres in Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Wanner met with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson to
discuss Madron's plans for the state-owned Hog Farm tract that
Madron had a contract to buy. And Fred C. Clark, an accountant who
does tax returns for Madron, said in a deposition that Wanner owns
Jawer Ltd., another foreign corporation. Jawer owns 99 percent of
Madron, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wanner has sworn as part of the lawsuit that he is
not an ``officer, director or employee of any Texas business or any
business which owns property in Texas.'' He knows who owns Madron,
Wanner testified, but he won't identify them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pohl and Wanner's testimony, Pohl advised Madron on
which tracts of land to buy and used F.F.U. Ltd. as a
``pass-through'' to pay commissions to Pohl, Brown &AMP; Associates and
other defendants. Pohl said the money needed to go through F.F.U.
for tax purposes, on Clark's advice. But Clark testified that he
didn't know why money flowed through F.F.U. Ltd. and that it made
no difference for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Too much commission?
</P>
<P>
   In another land purchase, according to the suit, duplicate
records were used to hide commissions a partnership paid to Pohl
and his associates without investors' knowledge. Further, the
plaintiffs say, the commissions exceed industry standards. In
November 1992, a Pohl, Brown partnership called Par 620 Ltd. bought
11.132 acres at the northwest corner of Parmer Lane and RM 620 for
$5,536,440, according to closing statements.
</P>
<P>
   Two closing statements were written for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One had two columns, ``buyer's transaction'' and ``seller's
transaction.'' The seller's column included $951,341.42 in
commissions, including $785,313.08 to Pohl, Brown and $52,666.67 to
W.B. Pohl and Associates Inc. The second statement listed only the
buyer's transaction. The commissions do not appear.
</P>
<P>
   The edited statement was distributed to limited partners, such
as Bruce Farmer's mother, Helen Farmer, and daughter, Sally Anne
Farmer, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Charles H. House, who handles Pohl, Brown's business in
California, testified that industry standards would dictatethat
commissions as high as 17 percent be disclosed to limited partners.
Real estate brokers in the Austin area say commissions can vary but
are usually from 6 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   House, who finds investors for Pohl, Brown, said in a sworn
statement he ``didn't realize there were flips. . . . And I'm not
100 percent sure there are flips, but it appears that there are.''
Nevertheless, House said last week, he and his investors would
consider the issue moot if Pohl can close a sale to California
developer PacTen Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl said he thinks the suit is motivated from frustration that
the partnerships' land hasn't sold more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad at them for filing a lawsuit,'' Pohl said. ``I
don't know if I could have invested with me at that time and the
results were delayed at that level, that I wouldn't have done
something out of frustration. And I hope it's just resolved through
land sales. That's happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   House said he believes Pohl's explanation that the price
increases paid for expenses and not, as plaintiffs allege, for
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pohl didn't pocket all the money from the price
increases _ if the money went to pay for expenses, as Pohl and
House say _ the price increases are still fraudulent under the
plaintiff's theory of the case, because they were not disclosed to
the limited partners, said Jim Hemphill, an attorney for the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say, `I did mislead you, and I did deceive you, but I
still gave you a good deal, it just wasn't as good as I told you it
was,' well, when you're a partner, that's not acceptable conduct,''
Hemphill said. ``Just because you make money doesn't mean there
wasn't fraud or misrepresentation through deceit.''

STRAWBERRY'S BEHAVIOR COULD JEOPARDIZE HIS DEAL WITH YANKS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Even if Darryl Strawberry passes the drug test
administered to him in the aftermath of his arrest Wednesday for
cocaine possession and solicitation of prostitution, he is in
jeopardy of losing his $2.5-million deal with the Yankees.
Virtually his entire salary is tied into a consulting agreement
with the team, instead of being compensation for playing baseball,
and the consulting agreement hinges on a strict behavior clause.
</P>
<P>
   That clause, some baseball officials say, will give the Yankees
great latitude in determining whether they will sever their ties
with Strawberry, who was in contact with the team on Saturday for
the first time since his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official who has seen Strawberry's contract _ a
minor league deal _ the 37-year-old outfielder is to receive only a
nominal salary for playing baseball; some minor leaguers receive
less than $2,000 per month. The remainder, perhaps more than $2.4
million, is tied into a consulting arrangement with the Yankees,
and some baseball officials believe the Yankees could void the deal
solely on the solicitation charge.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Strawberry has many other hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   If either of the urine samples he gave last week tests positive
for cocaine, Strawberry would be subject to immediate suspension by
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry, who faces a maximum of five years for possession
of cocaine and a maximum of 60 days for solicitation, arranges a
plea bargain on the cocaine charge, Major League Baseball would
view this as an admission, and Strawberry would be subject to
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   And if Strawberry is eventually convicted of solicitation, the
Yankees could void his contract on the clause contained within the
consulting arrangement _ or even on the basis of a behavior clause
within the standard minor league deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has troubles on both counts,'' said another baseball
official.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, whose arraignment has not been scheduled, called
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman on Saturday, his first
conversation with a club official after two days without
communication. Cashman would not reveal any specifics of their
conversation, although he did say that there are no plans to have
Strawberry continue his workouts at the team's minor league
facility in Tampa, Fla.

 &HT;    Air Force deeds Bergstrom to Austin as new airport site
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With two simple signatures and a lot of ceremony
Saturday, Bergstrom Air Force Base, which once symbolized Austin's
protection from foreign threats, transformed officially into a hub
of commerce and travel.
</P>
<P>
   In one of several ceremonial milestones in the weeks ahead to
celebrate the opening of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, F.
Whitten Peters, acting secretary of the Air Force, signed over the
deed to the former Air Force base, now airport site, to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``While that officially ends the presence of the Air Force on
this property, the influence on the community will endure for years
and generations to come,'' said Mayor Kirk Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was the first major event before the May 23 opening
of the new airport. Although the airport opening has been delayed
from May 2, grand opening celebrations continue as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the city named one of the last remnants of the
Air Force base, the 12,250-foot west runway, after President Lyndon
B. Johnson, who used to fly in to the base on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The east runway will bear the name of former U.S. Congressman
Jake Pickle, who pushed for the new 9,000-foot runway to allow
simultaneous landings and takeoffs at Austin's new airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Johnson runway and the Pickle runway will be running
separate but parallel,'' said Pickle, who represented Austin in
Congress for 31 years. ``I take comfort in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickle also thanked Peters for signing over the deed for the
base and making the transfer official, pointing out ``you
understand, Mr. Secretary, I wasn't suspicious of the federal
government or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who is advocating for another round of national military
base closures, lauded the $690 million airport as one of the
country's most successful base conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just a tremendous success,'' Peters said.
``It's a case study.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials have said they know of no larger
conversion from a military base to civilian airport in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   By using the former military base as a starting point in
building the new airport, city officials saved $200 million in
runway reuse and land costs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said the city also
avoided what could have been a heavy economic blow to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times I have seen that when a base closes, everything
comes down,'' she said. ``That didn't happen in Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) said travelers will
know they are in Austin when they arrive at the new airport, which
will feature work and recorded music by local artists and artisans,
a live music stage and native plants in the landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Denver without the chewed up baggage,'' Doggett
said. ``It's unique to Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one other major reminder of the former Air Force base
besides the west runway will remain at the new airport. That's the
Bergstrom name, in honor of Capt. John August Earl Bergstrom, who
was the first soldier from Travis County to die in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   LaVerne Bergstrom-Jackson said Saturday the Bergstrom family was
honored to have the new airport named after her cousin, as it was
to have the base named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the epitome of the soldier-citizen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grand opening festivities continue Wednesday when President
Clinton, with U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and
Federal Aviation Administration Chief Jane Garvey, arrive to
celebrate the airport opening. Gov. George W. Bush will join
Clinton at a small event at the airport Wednesday morning. Some
members of the public will be allowed to attend, but details of the
visit aren't expected to be made available until Monday.

PICKING QUARTERBACKS AS EASY AS 1-2-3: COUCH, MCNABB, SMITH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand by 300 words, and rewrite)   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few quarterbacks have undergone the kind of scrutiny Kentucky's
Tim Couch received this month, of everything from the way he
selected an agent to his grip on the football.
</P>
<P>
   Even the expansion Cleveland Browns, who selected Couch Saturday
with the No. 1 pick in the National Football League draft and the
first pick in the reborn franchise's history, had their doubts. But
Cleveland's thinking changed after Couch performed well in a recent
workout. After that performance, Browns officials, many of whom
worked for the San Francisco 49ers, spoke of how much Couch
reminded them of Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling that Couch could lead their franchise for the next 10
years, the Browns came to terms with him several hours before the
draft on a seven-year, $48 million contract that includes a $12.2
million signing bonus, the largest ever given to a rookie. By the
time the draft began, Cleveland's choice was the worst-kept secret
in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a great moment,'' Couch said. ``I can't tell you
how happy I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's selection of Couch was about the only thing that
went to form in a topsy-turvy, trade-crazy draft, one of the most
exciting in years. The most shocking moment came when the
Indianapolis Colts took Miami running back Edgerrin James over the
Heisman Trophy winner, Ricky Williams of Texas, with the fourth
pick.
</P>
<P>
   Two more quarterbacks were selected after Couch, making it the
first time since 1971 that quarterbacks were chosen 1-2-3 in the
draft. Philadelphia selected Donovan McNabb, the poised player from
Syracuse, and Cincinnati took Oregon's Akili Smith, whose strong
arm has reminded scouts of a young John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The last quarterbacks to go in the top three were Jim Plunkett,
Archie Manning and Dan Pastorini.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big year for quarterbacks, as five were taken in the
top 12 picks. They included Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida,
who becomes the heir apparent to Randall Cunningham in Minnesota,
and Cade McNown of UCLA, who the Chicago Bears believe is a more
athletic Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Once the top three quarterbacks were gone, things began to get
strange. Indianapolis, long thought to be interested in Williams or
defensive back Champ Bailey of Georgia, shocked just about everyone
by taking James, a slick runner whose stock rose dramatically in
recent weeks. While the Colts said they simply had James rated
higher, it was hard to believe that Williams' braids and pierced
tongue did not bother the conservative coach of the Colts, Jim
Mora.
</P>
<P>
   James' being selected before Williams led to the sort of awkward
moment that seems to have become commonplace in the draft.
Williams, who thought he was going to the Colts, expressed utter
shock on camera when his name was not called.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' decision led to several blockbuster trades that will
be remembered for years and could change the course of franchises.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Coach Mike Ditka had said he would get Williams at
any cost, and he paid a steep price. Once the Colts passed on
Williams, Ditka called the Washington Redskins and offered all of
his picks from this year's draft and two from next season _ the
Saints' picks in the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
rounds this year and first- and third-round picks in 2000. The
Redskins jumped at the deal, moving down from No. 5 to the Saints'
spot at 12 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected Indianapolis to take me, so I was surprised,''
Williams. ``But I'm glad I'm going to a place where I'm wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was concerned about carrying an franchise on
his shoulders, Williams said: ``I'm not too worried. I'm just going
to go out and play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington then made another trade. Using some of their newly
acquired picks from the Saints, and combining them with a few of
their own, the Redskins switched places in the first round with
Chicago, moving back up to No. 7. That allowed the Redskins to get
the player they wanted the entire time in Bailey, probably the best
athlete in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins, like the Saints, gave up a lot. Washington gave
Chicago the Saints' first- and third-round picks and their own
fourth- and fifth-round selections from this draft, and a
third-round selection from next year. The Redskins are so confident
that Bailey will be able to start this season that Coach Norv
Turner announced that the 11-year veteran Cris Dishman would be
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there were six trades in the first round alone. Dallas,
for example, gave Seattle its pick at No. 22 as well as a
fifth-rounder to move up two spots to No. 20 and select North
Carolina defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban. The Cowboys wanted
defensive linemen, because they may lose tackle Leon Lett for all
of next year to a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was so unimpressed with the talent remaining at No. 24
that it traded out of the first round entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Teams did not just trade draft picks. St. Louis sent quarterback
Tony Banks, who has had a disappointing career, to Baltimore for a
fifth-round pick this year and a seventh-rounder in 2000.
Meanwhile, the Ravens traded the backup quarterback Eric Zeier to
Tampa Bay for a sixth-round pick. Zeier will put pressure on the
Tampa Bay starter, Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   There were other interesting twists to the draft beyond the
dealing inside the Garden. A small group of people protested
outside the arena, claiming that the NFL was racist because a black
quarterback had never been drafted with the first overall pick.
While that held true this year, the three black quarterbacks taken
in the first round of this draft _ McNabb, Smith and Culpepper _
equaled the total number of black passers ever taken in the first
round (Doug Williams in 1978, Andre Ware in 1990 and Steve McNair
in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic falls in the draft was that of Andy
Katzenmoyer, the heralded linebacker from Ohio State, who dropped
to New England at No. 28. Team officials said privately that
Katzenmoyer, the Butkus award winner for best college linebacker,
was hurt most by a lack of foot speed. Teams also said that he was
not impressive in interviews. Ditka considered taking Katzenmoyer,
but shied away when Katzenmoyer told him that his favorite
linebacker was Brian Bosworth, a pro bust _ because he liked how
Bosworth ran out of the tunnel before games.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest curveball of the day was Cleveland's signing of
Couch before the draft began.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when it seemed the Browns might not choose
Couch because of questions about his arm strength and grip on the
ball (he held his index finger too high, causing the ball to
occasionally wobble).
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL personnel people felt that Cleveland's sometimes public
hesitation when it came to Couch was intended to give it an upper
hand in negotiations. Others felt that the Browns were genuinely
puzzled about whom to take, their top three choices being Smith,
Williams and Couch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what sold the Browns on Couch was his second workout
for them. In it, Couch showed accuracy and confidence that had not
been on display in his first workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That workout pushed us over the top,'' said Carmen Policy, the
former San Francisco executive who is now president of the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland officials had contacted the agents for all three
players, but within the last 48 hours the Browns had concentrated
their efforts on Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the Browns and Couch's agent, Tom Condon, heated
up beginning around 9 p.m. on Friday and did not conclude until
around 3 on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not tolerate any disruption of his focus,'' said
Policy when asked why it was so important to sign Couch early. ``We
needed our leader signed early and we wanted that to send a message
to anyone who was going to be part of this team.''

 &HT;    At heart of O'Hair case: Riddle of David Waters
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi and Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At 17, David Roland Waters and three friends
beat another youth to death for not letting them borrow his car.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, a year out of prison, Waters beat his mother with a
broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, who once described his youth as uneventful and his
criminal record as ``my brush with the law years ago,'' is now
sitting in jail in San Marcos _ apparently the focus in the
disappearance and perhaps death of world-famous atheist Madalyn
O'Hair. O'Hair and two family members disappeared from Austin in
1995, just three months after Waters pleaded guilty to stealing
$54,415 from O'Hair's American Atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Waters stayed out of jail by agreeing to repay the money, and
later got the restitution reduced to $15,000 by giving police
evidence that he said would help them find the O'Hairs. ``The
police thought they were about to find them'' with Waters' help two
years ago, said Rosemary Lehmberg, first assistant in the Travis
County district attorney's office. ``It's our impression now that
he duped everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, although authorities have not charged him in the O'Hair
disappearance, his attorney Patrick Ganne says federal agents are
trying to tie his client to the suspected deaths of O'Hair, her
son, Jon Garth Murray, and the granddaughter she adopted as her
daughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair. Also missing: $500,000 in gold
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investigators pore over Waters' criminal files in Travis
County and beyond, the question is: Could a high-school dropout who
spent more than a quarter of his life behind bars mastermind a
high-profile killing for a half-million dollars and the elaborate
plot to cover it up? If so, why would Waters, having lost his
longtime girlfriend and apparently living like a pauper, choose to
stay in Austin, writing a book about the O'Hairs' disappearance as
authorities closed in?
</P>
<P>
   Last month, seven-time felon Gary P. Karr, who once served time
with Waters, confessed to being an accomplice in multiple murders
in Texas, according to the FBI. Based on Karr's information,
federal agents searched a Hill Country ranch Easter weekend, but
turned up nothing, according to sources. Last month, federal agents
searched Waters' apartment and charged him with possession of
ammunition, a crime for a felon. When federal agents knocked on
Waters' apartment last month, he was on the verge of being evicted
for not paying rent. He had lost his longtime girlfriend to a
neighbor. He was riding the bus to his job at a pet shop because
his broken-down red Camaro wouldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not appear to be the guy who made the big score,''
said David Travis, a former co-worker at American Atheists.
Besides, Travis said, ``You don't kill someone and write a book
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the line
</P>
<P>
   Waters' early crimes were more thoughtless acts than elaborate
schemes requiring smarts.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager always in trouble with the law, Waters was a regular
in the Illinois reform school system and a perpetual runaway. By
his midteens, Waters had been caught twice breaking the curfew in
Peoria, Ill., once for public drunkenness and once for burglarizing
a woman's house with four of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   One December night in 1964, Waters, 17, crossed from
misdemeanors to murder. He and three of his teen-age friends caught
a ride with 16-year-old David Gibbs, who wore Buddy Holly glasses
and a flattop haircut. The four soon got into an argument with
Gibbs, first about girls, then about borrowing his car. Then,
according to a 1964 article in the Peoria Journal-Star, the boys
pulled Gibbs from the driver's seat and a fight began. It spilled
over into the road, where the four-on-one beating turned bloody and
brutal. Waters and the other three took turns hitting Gibbs with a
club fashioned from a broken fence post, according to their
confessions. Police later found a blood trail leading across the
road and tattered pieces of Gibbs' plaid shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who posed for a newspaper photo wearing the collar of
his jailhouse jumpsuit up and a cigarette dangling from his mouth,
was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for the murder. He served
12 before being paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Just more than a year out of prison, Waters was convicted of his
second felony _ aggravated battery for attacking his mother with a
broomstick. He also urinated on her face. Waters spent another year
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Valentine's Day 1980, the man with the violent past
became a victim of random violence. His first wife, ``Mari'' Anne
Budde Waters, was murdered while visiting a friend in Danville,
Ill. Waters' wife and her friend, Cheryl Geld, had gone to a male
strip club. When Geld's boyfriend found out, he flew into a jealous
rage and stabbed them both to death. The killer is still on death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Waters later remarried, but the marriage lasted only two years
before the couple divorced, citing irreconcilable differences.
</P>
<P>
   World of Madalyn O'Hair
</P>
<P>
   Rootless, Waters moved from place to place and crossed paths
with the law again in 1985, when he forged a name to a $5,000
counterfeit check and was sentenced to four more years in prison.
After his release, Waters moved to Florida, where he was convicted
of driving under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Waters, looking for a fresh start, picked
out Austin from a tourism brochure.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1993 he answered a classified ad for a typesetter at
$7 an hour. The ad warned: ``Religious persons may feel
uncomfortable.'' He omitted his criminal record from the
application and was hired at the American Atheists' national
headquarters in Northeast Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Waters entered the world of Madalyn O'Hair, who by many accounts
was secretive, paranoid, short-tempered and always cursing. She
lived and worked with her son, Jon Murray, and granddaughter, Robin
Murray-O'Hair, whom she had adopted as her daughter. She trusted no
one else at the Austin headquarters. From that fenced office
building, the aging O'Hair oversaw a small work force of three to
seven people producing videos, magazines and newsletters and
soliciting money.
</P>
<P>
   Water's co-workers, Travis and Derek Nalls, describe the ex-con
as likable, hard-working, in love with his girlfriend but saying
nothing about his criminal past. In the next 14 months, Waters
worked his way up to office manager at a time the office was under
siege because of an ongoing legal battle in California.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair had tried to claim the estate of an eccentric millionaire
who had bought the atheist magazine The Truth Seeker. The estate
countersued, claiming the O'Hairs had conspired to steal millions
from the estate. When it looked as if they might lose, the O'Hairs
began hiding money, paintings and even the organization's
collection of books on atheism, according to former employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even told us employees not to leave anything valuable in
our desks, because we might come to work someday and the doors
would be padlocked,'' Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this time, Waters contends, that Jon Murray induced
him to divert money from the atheist organization to the O'Hairs.
He said his cut was $15,000. In his unpublished manuscript, Waters
writes that the O'Hairs double-crossed him.
</P>
<P>
   While the O'Hairs were in San Diego fighting the lawsuit, Waters
wrote, he was stealing money from the atheist organization under
Jon Murray's orders. When the O'Hairs won a standoff in the
California trial, they returned to Austin and accused Waters of
theft. Waters was already gone, leaving behind a letter of
resignation. He later wrote that he went to California to visit a
sister. Within three weeks, however, he returned to Austin to turn
himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Travis said he was mystified by Waters' return: ``I think he did
it for his girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters faced up to 99 years in prison as an habitual criminal.
Citing his long, violent history, Travis County's pre-sentencing
investigators recommended imprisonment. Yet prosecutor Lehmberg
said O'Hair wanted Waters to repay the money instead of going to
prison. She said the O'Hairs also worried that a jury would be
biased against them because of their notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors offered Waters a deal: He pleaded guilty to theft
and the habitual criminal charge. He agreed to repay the $54,415
over 10 years. His sentence was deferred and he faced up to 99
years in prison if he did not keep his end of the deal, Lehmberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Waters' history, Lehmberg said it was improbable he could
repay the money, but added: ``It's not uncommon with people, even
with violent backgrounds, to get deferred adjudication at the
victim's request.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, O'Hair feared Waters enough to request a restraining
order to keep him from her family, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Waters pleaded guilty, the O'Hair family
disappeared from their Northwest Austin home. They left their
breakfast dishes, O'Hair's diabetic medication and three dogs. They
also left a note on the American Atheists' headquarters doors,
telling employees the office was closed because they were leaving
to deal with an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the next month, the O'Hairs stayed in touch by cell phone
from San Antonio. Someone purporting to be Jon Murray sold his
Mercedes at a motel parking lot. The buyer said the man who sold
him the car got into a pickup with two people he now recognizes as
Jon Murray and Robin Murray- O'Hair. A San Antonio jeweler
converted $500,000 into gold coins for Jon Murray, who came alone
to a San Antonio bank to claim the money. But he never returned for
$100,000 more in coins. Instead, on Sept. 29, Murray made his last
cell phone call. No one has claimed to have heard from the three
since.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance prompted some intense but brief media
speculation about whether the O'Hairs were victims of foul play or
had fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, along with other former O'Hair employees, began offering
opinions. Unlike the others, Waters claimed to have documents, such
as credit card receipts, that would lead the police to them. He
traded that information for prosecutors lowering his restitution to
$15,000. He also began a book.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, Waters called on Harry Preston, a
longtime writer of books, plays and scripts, living in Garland.
Over the course of a weekend, Waters told his story and showed
Preston an outline and his notes from documents he said he stole
from the atheist headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was charming, very pleasant and intelligent,'' Preston
said. ``Don't ever sell David Waters short. He's no dummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters was having trouble paying restitution for the theft from
the O'Hairs, risking prison. Yet he had a $2,500 money order from
Illinois _ Preston said he believed it was from Waters' brother _
for the first half of Preston's fee.
</P>
<P>
   Preston said he believed Waters had a simple motive for the
book: money. ``This woman had disappeared,'' Preston said. ``He
thinks he has the inside scoop, and he's thinking, 'Let's write a
book and make a million dollars.' '' Preston wrote a 217-page
manuscript, ``Good Gawd, Madalyn! The Not-So-Sudden Disappearance
of Madalyn Murray-O'Hair,'' but Waters ignored the author's demands
for the rest of his fee.
</P>
<P>
   A break
</P>
<P>
   By January 1999, Dallas investigators got a break in a murder
case. For three years, a corpse with its head and hands severed had
gone unidentified. It was found along the Trinity River in Dallas
County just three days after the O'Hairs were last heard from, but
there was no reason at the time to believe it was connected to
their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Then, acting on a tip, authorities identified the corpse with a
DNA test as Danny Fry, a friend of Waters who was visiting him in
Austin at the time the O'Hairs disappeared. Authorities began
looking at Karr and Waters.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring Preston's calls for about a year and half, Waters
suddenly phoned the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called a couple of months ago all sweetie-pie,'' Preston
said last week. ``He wanted me to pursue marketing the book. He
confessed to me he was broke and needed some money.''
</P>
<P>
   No publisher had expressed an interest, Preston said, until
after news of Waters' arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Preston said he is left wondering to what extent Waters was
involved. ``I'm in no position to accuse anyone,'' Preston said.
``But this new wrinkle may change the title to, `Who Murdered
Madalyn Murray O'Hair?' ''

KINGS READY TO BID FORUM ADIEU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It never had the heritage of Maple Leaf Gardens. It never had
the grandeur of the old Montreal Forum. And it never had the
history of grand old hockey palaces such as Boston Garden, Chicago
Stadium, the Detroit Olympia and the old Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Los Angeles Kings, who will play what almost
certainly will be their final regular-season game there today
against the St. Louis Blues, the Forum has been home.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Kings prepare to move next season to the palatial
Staples Center, there are few tears in the organization for the
building that is about to be vacated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this building conjures up the same images for
the Kings that Maple Leaf Gardens did for Toronto,'' Kings
president Tim Leiweke said. ``I'll miss this building, but probably
only for a week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor has spent his entire 22-year
professional life at the Forum, but when asked his feelings about
closing its doors, he said, ``I'm looking forward to Staples
Center. The Forum has been a good home, but it's time to move on.
I'm not overly sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1,314 regular-season and playoff games at the Forum, the
Kings are 622-511-181. And while they never won a Stanley Cup, they
did have their moments.
</P>
<P>
   From the early to late 1970s, the Forum was home to teams
backstopped by Rogie Vachon. From the late 1970s to the middle
1980s, Marcel Dionne's high-scoring teams moved in. And the Forum
was the home from 1988-96 for the legendary Wayne Gretzky, who
coincidentally concludes his NHL run today in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There was Butch Goring's overtime goal that forced a seventh
playoff game in 1976 against Boston. There was the ``Miracle on
Manchester'' six years later in which the Kings rallied from a 5-0
deficit to beat a young Edmonton Oilers team in a first-round game
on an overtime goal by Daryl Evans.
</P>
<P>
   There was Mike Krushelnyski's double-overtime series-clincher
against Calgary in 1990. There was the epic run to the Stanley Cup
Finals in 1993. And a year later, there was Gretzky scoring the
record 802nd goal of his NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are expected to play a couple of preseason games at
the Forum next season, which is why today's closing ceremonies at
the building will be minimal. The Kings also have reserved
early-season dates at the Forum next season, just in case the
Staples Center isn't ready in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You honor the tradition, the past, the great moments that
occurred here,'' Leiweke said of the Forum. ``But I think the new
building will be great for the Kings, the Lakers, the Clippers and
the city of Los Angeles.''

TEXAN SEES MISERY OF REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>
 By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Former Fort Worth Mayor Hugh Parmer, just
back from a six-day tour of Albanian refugee camps in the war-torn
Balkans, said he heard repeated stories of murder and rape and saw
tears in the eyes of everyone who crossed into friendly territory.
</P>
<P>
   There are few expressions of hope that the war will soon be over
for the thousands of refugees fleeing Serbian forces, Parmer said
Saturday in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to two young women, well-dressed, middle class, early
30s ... who looked like they could have come from Fort Worth, but
with tears running down their faces as they pointed back over the
border, saying: `They took everything we had, our money, our
jewelry, our documents, everything except our suitcase,' '' Parmer
said.
</P>

   Parmer lives in Washington, where he is assistant administrator
for humanitarian response at the Agency for International
Development. He toured refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania, and
returned to Washington on Thursday to report on the progress of
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer arrived in Fort Worth yesterday to attend the 87th
birthday party tomorrow for his father, Quay Parmer.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are particularly deplorable at one Albanian camp,
Parmer said. ``There were at least 20,000 people just living in the
open: no tents, no roofs, maybe just sheets of plastic draped over
their wagons,'' he said. While there, Parmer said, ``I got a lot of
stories of murders, rapes, family members shot down in front of the
eyes of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmer said he watched as scores of Kosovo residents stepped
from their homeland into Albania. ``Every person began to weep when
they walked across the border,'' he said. ``All I could do is shake
their hand and say, `It's OK. You're safe now.' ''

   UNDATED: stolen the money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The only facts that existed were damning,'' Zindler said.
``The theory that they were extorted and bumped off sounded like a
cheap dime store novel. Some turned against Madalyn, and
(newspaper) articles assumed the three of them were sunning
themselves on a tropical island.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Johnson, who replaced Jon Garth Murray as president of
American Atheists, said that at first, she never doubted that the
family would return. Even now, when Johnson knows they probably
won't, she refuses to give any substance to news accounts until
there is irrefutable evidence about their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me the latest nonsense,'' said Johnson, a New
Jersey mother of two who has spoken at the White House and appeared
before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on behalf of the atheist
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an atheist, so show me the evidence. People are always
coming up to me with suppositions and maybes. The worst thing is
not knowing. And what's really upsetting is that people inside and
out of the organization who thought the worst of the O'Hairs are
strangely silent right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Madalyn Murray O'Hair earned her spurs as an atheist during the
early 1960s when she campaigned relentlessly against school prayer.
Her case, Abington Township School District vs. Schempp, was one of
three involving school prayer heard by the Supreme Court in 1962
and '63, said Rob Boston of Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was personally courageous for her to take her case on,''
Boston said, ``but a myth grew up around her that she promoted,
that she single-handedly removed religion from public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Zindler said that after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of
O'Hair on June 17, 1963, she could no longer continue to live in
Baltimore with her two young sons. People picketed and harassed
O'Hair, Zindler said. There were acts of vandalism at her home,
including the crucifixion of a pet cat.
</P>
<P>
   He said O'Hair had confrontations with the police and suffered a
broken wrist. She decided to flee when she was charged with
assaulting 16 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   That began an odyssey that took O'Hair to Hawaii, Mexico and
finally to Texas. According to Zindler, Gov. John Connally decided
against extraditing her to Maryland after hearing about the assault
charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was a refuge for O'Hair. It was a growing university town
with a liberal reputation during the anti-war period of the 1960s
and early '70s. O'Hair conducted her religious war with zeal,
filing dozens of lawsuits in an attempt to remove references to God
in public places or from public documents.
</P>
<P>
   When she received a notice for jury duty, she ceremonially
burned the summons because jurors would have to take an oath under
God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman was a pioneer,'' said American Atheists spokesman
Ron Barrier, host of The Atheist Viewpoint, a weekly cable
television program. ``What Madalyn accomplished was not banning God
or prayer, but making public schools a level playing field for all
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Hair did not make these points in a cool and reasoned
manner. She could whip the masses into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Altoona, (Pa.) we had one of the first shock jock late
afternoon talk shows, and the host would have her on a lot,''
Boston said. ``People would call in and scream at her.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Hair would scream back. ``She used vulgarity that you
couldn't imagine,'' Harrington said. ``She was filled with hatred.
The debates we had around the country were like pep rallies. I was
taking on the meanest woman in America, and you don't sit back and
be a gentleman with her. You launch combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus would have targeted her,'' Harrington said. ``It would
have been a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Zindler recalled the time O'Hair was giving a lecture at the
University of Texas at Austin and an incensed young woman shoved a
cream pie filled with needles and pins in her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was personally afraid many times,'' said Ole
Anthony of the Trinity Foundation in Dallas, which monitors
television ministries and evangelists ``But she loved to play the
persecution card. She was always a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, who kept up a correspondence with O'Hair, said she knew
the Scriptures better than most preachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the core of her being I think she wanted to believe in
God,'' Anthony said. ``But she had so much bitterness about how the
Christian community treated her. She did everything she could to be
a thorn in the side of the faith community.''
</P>
<P>
   Time did not mellow her, although John Garth Murray and board
members began to play a more prominent role in American Atheists.
</P>
<P>
   For William Murray, who lost his mother, brother and biological
daughter, Robin Murray O'Hair, in the tragedy, time has not healed
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family never goes away,'' said Murray, whose
organization, the Religious Freedom Coalition, is based in
Washngton, D.C. ``The best you can do is hope not to transfer this
dysfunctional behavior to your kids or grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does it end for me? I would have to change my name and
open an ice cream stand in Key West, Florida. But the memories
never go away.'' &QL;

NEW LEADS RESURRECT MEMORIES OF O'HAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was a fiery leader with an acid tongue and an insatiable
appetite for the spotlight. Madalyn Murray O'Hair was a devout
atheist and outspoken advocate of the separation of church and
state who incited audiences during public debates by tearing pages
from the Bible and laughing as she tossed them into the air.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair founded American Atheists in 1963 and delighted in being
known as ``the most hated woman in America.'' She filed one of the
lawsuits that led to the U.S. Supreme Court's ban on prayer in
public schools, and she tried to have the words ``In God We Trust''
removed from U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   So when O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and adopted daughter
Robin Murray O'Hair vanished from their Austin home in August of
1995, it created a mystery worthy of the X-Files.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought that the three had been kidnapped; others,
including some followers, thought that they absconded with the
atheist organization's trust fund. Knowing O'Hair, some suspected
an elaborate publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair was 76 years old and in failing health. Three dogs,
O'Hair's diabetes medication and unwashed breakfast dishes were
left behind in the house. Although there were no signs of forced
entry or a struggle, it did not look as if the family's departure
that morning was planned.
</P>
<P>
   Little progress was made on the case for 31/2 years. Then, late
last month, federal authorities arrested two felons on firearms
charges. One had previously worked for O'Hair, and the other
volunteered information about four homicides in Texas that may
finally provide clues to unraveling the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The latest twists put Madalyn Murray O'Hair back in the news and
inflamed passions among family, colleagues and foes reminiscent of
the days when she was at the forefront of the atheist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Her estranged son, William J. Murray, said the recent
developments were long overdue. He has blamed the Austin police for
dragging their feet, saying they resented his mother for her
constant criticism of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she was brutal with everyone,'' said Murray, 52, who
rejected his mother's atheist beliefs and became a Christian. ``She
could buy a package of gum, and by the time she was done, the
teen-age clerk in the convenience store would feel like dirt. But
it doesn't mean you turn your back on a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Austin Police Department said the case is
still open and the investigation continues. ``We've pursued every
lead that's come in,'' said public information officer Kevin
Buchman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, more than a year ago, Murray began lobbying elected
leaders for help. He wrote and spoke to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, Sen. Phil Gramm and Gov. George W. Bush. ``My letter to
Governor Bush said that it doesn't matter that these folks are
opposed to what you and I believe,'' Murray said. ``They should
have equal protection under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray credited Armey with prompting the Department of Justice
and the FBI to look deeper into the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears likely that the the three were victims of foul
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it was a prank and she was going after
attention,'' said the Rev. Bob Harrington, a 71-year-old minister
who traveled across the country with O'Hair during the mid-1970s in
a series of 38 raucous religious debates. They also appeared
together on the debut of the Phil Donohue Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept expecting to hear from her,'' said Harrington, who now
lives in Mansfield. ``I thought she must have gotten hemmed up in
some situation and didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I found out what she left behind in the house, it
looked like an abduction, a Jimmy Hoffa-type of elimination. She
wouldn't have been able to keep silent for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local authorities in Texas and Michigan are
investigating whether O'Hair's former office manager and his
associate, both convicted felons, are responsible for kidnapping
and murdering the family members and stealing more than $500,000 in
gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   David Waters, 52, the former office manager who was found guilty
of stealing $54,000 from American Atheists accounts several months
before O'Hair's disappearance, is in custody in Austin, while Gary
Karr, 50, is incarcerated in Detroit. They are being held in
connection with the possession of firearms, which is illegal for
felons.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, however, piqued the interest of authorities when he told
an FBI investigator about unsolved homicides in Texas and missing
gold coins. Karr did not identify the victims by name, though, and
has not confessed to having any role in the disappearance. Waters
says he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's story prompted federal agents to search a 5,000-acre
ranch outside San Antonio over Easter weekend, presumably in search
of the bodies. Federal officials will not disclose whether anything
was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been any new developments since the search,''
said Darren Holmes, a spokesperson for the FBI's San Antonio
office. ``The investigation is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mystery was the slaying of Waters' friend Danny
Fry, whose dismembered body was found on the banks of the Trinity
River near Dallas on Oct. 2, 1995. No one has been charged in Fry's
death.
</P>
<P>
   William Murray believes that federal agents have his family's
killers in custody, although they may never get a confession or
find the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, some of O'Hair's admirers and adversaries believe that if
recent reports are true, she would be vindicated. At the time of
her disappearance, news accounts said that O'Hair was having
financial difficulties and owed the Internal Revenue Service as
much as $750,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The family had disappeared with the gold coins and had access to
a trust fund in New Zealand. For a month, Jon Garth Murray remained
in contact with American Atheists, reassuring members that his
family was on a business trip. No one knows whether he was making
the telephone calls under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Then all contact ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zindler, editor of American Atheist Magazine and a
longtime O'Hair associate, said a fairly sizable minority of
atheists thought that the family had stolen the money. MORE &QL;

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Bill Yardley emerged from coronary artery
bypass surgery last month changed in ways he could never have
imagined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His belly was stuffed tight with machinery. A power cord emerged
from an incision in his side. And a rhythmic, whooshing sound like
windshield wipers radiated from his body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When he woke up, he said, `What in the world did they do to
me?' '' recalled his wife, Joyce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardley's surgery had failed. But the Kearney, Mo., man was
saved on the operating table by a 2 1/2-pound pump that surgeons
implanted below his ribs. The pump was designed to work in tandem
with his flagging heart until a new heart could be found for a
transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardley, 57, received a heart transplant April 14 at St. Luke's
Hospital, becoming the first patient to go from an internal
heart-assist pump to a heart transplant at a Kansas City, Mo.,
hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amazing journeys from near death to technological rescue, much
like Yardley's, are being played out with growing frequency around
the country as doctors use assist pumps to keep patients alive
until hearts for transplants become available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the pumps have the potential to save the lives of
thousands of people with failing hearts who don't qualify medically
for a heart transplant or who couldn't survive the often lengthy
wait for a new heart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 patients in the United States have received the two
most common assist pumps, the HeartMate that Yardley received, and
the similar Novacor. Roughly 70 percent of them have received
successful heart transplants. Smaller, quieter pumps are being
developed experimentally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some pumps, like the HeartMate, are implanted entirely within
the body, except for an air vent and a power cord that attaches to
a bedside power supply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pumps also can be used with rechargeable batteries, allowing
patients to return home from the hospital, drive, shop, or even
ride a bicycle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology is advancing so rapidly that doctors expect pumps
to be implanted permanently in patients as an alternative to heart
transplants within a few years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This device will be a dinosaur,'' predicted St. Luke's heart
transplant surgeon Greg Muehlebach. ``We'll be looking back and
laughing at putting a temporary device in people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease runs in Bill Yardley's family. His mother died of
a heart attack. Two brothers have had bypass surgery. His sisters
have high cholesterol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At age 40, what he thought was a bad bout of indigestion turned
out to be a heart attack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove myself to the hospital and smoked my last cigarette,''
said Yardley, a retired Hallmark maintenance technician. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, Yardley had a stiff back. He assumed his
muscles were sore from working on a friend's car the day before,
but his wife thought differently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of knew he was having another one (heart attack).
He wouldn't go. I had to beg him,'' Joyce Yardley said. She drove
him to the emergency room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The damage to Yardley's heart was so severe, doctors put him on
the transplant waiting list. It was a poignant moment. The
Yardleys' 20-year-old son, Craig, died in an auto accident in 1986.
They donated his heart and other organs for transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his doctor's approval, Yardley went off the transplant list
after six months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I didn't like was being tethered, having to stay too
close (to the hospital),'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Yardley's condition deteriorated. Short of breath after
climbing a small hill, he went to St. Luke's for an evaluation.
Doctors decided to try quadruple-bypass surgery as a last-shot
alternative to a heart transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They would never have attempted the risky operation, Muehlebach
said, if the assist pump hadn't been available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if (surgery) failed we had this device as a backup,''
he said. ``It would be foolish to have taken a patient like this to
the operating room without it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The HeartMate is about the size and shape of a hair dryer. Its
job is to take over the pumping action of the left side of the
heart, the side most likely to fail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through a tube that enters a heart pumping chamber called the
left ventricle, the HeartMate draws blood out and propels it into
the aorta, the main artery supplying oxygenated blood to the body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the pump operates, the right side of the heart pumps
independently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with other medical devices, the pumps aren't risk-free.
Infection is always a possibility. Doctors say that early
HeartMates were prone to mechanical breakdown and that patients
with early Novacor pumps frequently developed blood clots that
could lead to stroke. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hosenpud, a researcher with Medical College of
Wisconsin, found that patients who had been on assist pumps were
twice as likely to die within a year of receiving a transplant as
were other heart recipients. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hosenpud thinks the survival rates have been improving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten smarter and the devices have gotten better,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, patients were rushed from assist pumps to heart
transplants as quickly as possible. That's no longer the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now it's better to keep the patient on the device a
month or two before going to a transplant. It gets them in better
shape,'' Hosenpud said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, patients have recovered so markedly that they can
be weaned off the device without a transplant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These pumps restored them to good health,'' said O.H. Frazier,
a transplant surgeon at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, who
has seen three patients with the pumps, known as left ventricular
assist devices, become well enough to get off the heart transplant
list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - MORE -
</P>
<P>
   Despite their ability to save lives, the assist devices have the
potential to create serious ethical issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance plans cover the devices, but the pumps are
expensive. The HeartMate, for example, costs about $50,000 and
can't be reused on another patient. Its implantation requires a
highly trained team of surgeons, cardiologists and nurses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although St. Luke's cares for many uninsured heart surgery
patients, Muehlebach wasn't certain whether these patients would be
offered HeartMates except in life-threatening emergencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in time we may say yes,'' he said. ``But the
main thing early on, we have to make this (the program) financially
viable for it to work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each patient receiving the device adds to the number of people
on the waiting list for heart transplants. But the number of hearts
available for transplant is not increasing appreciably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember you're taking that heart from someone
else'' by giving it to someone with the device, Hosenpud said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The longer waiting times for heart transplants have helped
demonstrate how durable the devices can be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two American patients who have been hard to match to a donor
heart have been living with Novacor pumps for more than two years.
In Europe, two patients have been on the pumps for more than three
years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At several medical centers, studies are under way to see if
patients can be given the devices indefinitely, as an alternative
to heart transplantation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the question, `Are we creating more patients for heart
transplant?' isn't an issue anymore,'' said University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center surgeon Robert Kormos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kormos foresees the assist devices being used as a first, rather
than last, resort for people with failing hearts: ``Put it in, live
with it, and then down the road give the patient a transplant.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the March 9 surgery that gave him the HeartMate, Yardley
spent five weeks at St. Luke's Hospital, growing stronger. With his
pump hooked to a pair of batteries he wore in a fanny pack, he
started taking regular walks with his wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most annoying problem was the inescapable whoosh of the
machine that kept him awake at night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was lying down, it sounded like it was echoing behind
me,'' he said. ``I never did become accustomed to it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His doctors were concerned about a bowel obstruction caused by
the pump wedged inside him. On April 13, doctors moved Yardley to
priority status on the transplant list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, as the Yardleys were walking through the hospital
corridors, transplant coordinator Nancy Long gave them that news. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stunned and overjoyed, Joyce Yardley engulfed every nurse she
could reach with a bear hug. Tears filled her eyes. She grabbed her
husband. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is good, isn't he, honey?'' she said. She was
smiling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Yardley now at the top of the transplant list, the couple
wanted to know how long he was likely to wait for a new heart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked and asked (doctors and nurses),'' he said. ``One said
days. One said weeks. One said months.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About four hours after Yardley learned that he had been bumped
to the top of the waiting list, Long made a return visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you planning to do tonight?'' she asked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing I always do. Nothing,'' he replied. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have something more for you to do,'' she told him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., Yardley was in the operating room. Five hours later,
he had a new heart beating in his chest. The HeartMate was gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How have things changed? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardley answered April 15 from his bed in the intensive-care
unit: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet. And I can sleep.'' &QL;

`CYBERWAR' PRODUCING UNPRECEDENTED FLOW OF INFORMATION _ GOOD AND
BAD

<P>
   With democracy comes the right to choose whom to believe. On the
wide-open Web, that's not always a good thing, some say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web does a lot of things well, but covering a war is not
one of them,'' said John Katz, online columnist for the Freedom
Forum. ``Anyone who spends any time surfing knows how easy it is to
get bad information and how quickly it travels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see who's issuing a report. I want to know they're
accountable for that report, especially in wartime. The stakes are
way too high. If a story hits the Internet that someone's been
assassinated or troops are moving across the border, you'd better
have it right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   War on the Web is nothing if not a study in conflicting stories.
Consider the reports available on various Web pages April 14, when
a NATO pilot mistakenly bombed a convoy of ethnic Albanian refugees
heading out of Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosova Refugees Say Serbs Attacked Convoy,'' declared a
headline, using the Albanian spelling of Kosovo. It was put out by
the Kosova Crisis Center at www.alb-net.com, sponsored by a human
rights group sympathetic to the plight of ethnic Albanians.
``Bodies Lie on Kosova Road; As Usual Serbs Blame NATO.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serb-controlled Radio Yugoslavia's Web site at
www.beograd.com/radioyu did blame NATO, this way: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Several groups of Albanians who, after being assured by state
bodies of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that they
would be safe in their homes, were returning from the border
crossings (when) NATO planes acted a number of times, veritably
massacring the refugees. ... The aggressors obviously knew well who
was at issue, since civilian vehicles could in no way be `mistaken'
for military ones.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States Information Agency at www.usia.gov weighed in
April 14 with its own report, which quoted a Pentagon spokesman as
saying, ``We're quite sure that we only hit military vehicles.''
The next day NATO spokesman Jamie Shea acknowledged that the pilot
made a mistake. The lead vehicle, Shea said, ``we now believe (was)
a civilian vehicle.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Misinformation _ by intent or by mistake _ has long gone with
the turbulent territory of war, experts point out. But the dangers
become more acute in a medium as instant and unmonitored as the
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous situation when you have so many people
asking, `Whom do we trust?' and searching out information wherever
they can find it,'' said social psychologist Pratkanis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Internet, you also have the option of using
direct-response tactics. Some of these special-interest sites have
links that allow you to e-mail President Clinton. That's one way of
committing you to their team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many observers doubt that propaganda on the Web has affected
American attitudes about Kosovo. Opinion polls have been relatively
steady since NATO launched its campaign. Katz noted, ``The Web is
still being used for e-trading stocks and buying books more than
anything else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if the fighting escalates to all-out war, U.S. authorities
probably will look to the Web in their quest to control
information, said Gregory Black, who teaches history and
communications at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to communicate with the enemy in a state of war _
that's a problem,'' said Black, co-author of ``Hollywood Goes to
War: How Politics, Profits and Propaganda Shaped World War II
Movies.'' ``This ability of any of us to log on to Serbian Web
sites is unprecedented. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How would democracies deal with that in a total war? When all
you need is a modem and a phone line _ how does (a government)
knock that out?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government is trying, as a visit to www.b92.net
will confirm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The independent voice of Radio B-92, a station in Belgrade, was
silenced on April 2 after building a reputation for attacking the
policies of President Slobodan Milosevic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its Web site, however, is still accessible. Though it no longer
reports the news in English, the site does bear a defiant message
aimed at the Yugoslav government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Struggle Continues. We Shall Never Surrender.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sasa Mirkovic, the station director who wrote it, has been
replaced by a Milosevic minion. &QL;

   Some people are calling the Kosovo conflict the first
``cyberwar.'' Computer keyboards and phone lines everywhere make up
the arsenal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Help us stop bombing of Yugoslavia!'' urges the home page of
the Serbian Unity Congress, at www.suc.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or call up www.alb-net.com and click through photographs of
ethnic Albanians shot dead by the Serb ``monsters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are times when Americans can learn a lot about war by just
logging on. It makes many experts nervous. After all, never before
have average people had such instant access to information spread
by groups representing all angles of a conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The war strategists should be worried about it, if they aren't
yet,'' said Anthony Pratkanis, professor of psychology at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of ``Age of
Propaganda: The Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion.'' ``What
you're seeing now is just the first round of what will become an
important, highly sophisticated tool in the age-old tradition of
wartime propaganda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The look, feel and persuasiveness of these Web sites _ all
these will develop into something slicker and more subtle.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Browsers can pick their propaganda: www.albanian.com presents
one side of the argument; www.kosovo.net presents another side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who goes by ``Big Steve'' prefers the chat room at
www.NATO.org _ which has nothing to do with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. On this privately owned Web site, Big Steve
and Internet surfers from all parts of the world gather to discuss
_ and cuss _ the war. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Go Home Stupid Repulsive Americans,'' wrote a woman from
Athens, Greece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other dispatches from the cyberwar are sadly compelling, such as
this e-mail sent April 7 by an unknown woman in Yugoslavia: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing day fifteen. Today in the tram in Belgrade I saw a
woman with the button: Clinton's face with Hitler's moustache ...
. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are leaving Belgrade slowly, 5 buses a day go to
Budapest. Four of our friends have already gone. One wonders if
democracy can be installed with bombs and fear? Fear is the best
emotion to control the mind ... fear of crossing bridges, fear of
sirens, fear of every sound, evening, fire in the night sky.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One problem, observers say, is that it's anyone's guess whether
her e-mail is legitimate or the lies of a Serb official hoping to
bend American opinion. Human rights groups that disseminate such
material tend to keep the authors anonymous, ostensibly to keep
them safe from reprisals in their homeland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tactical maneuvers on the Web already have distinguished the
Kosovo conflict from wars of the past. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month, just as the bombings commenced, Belgrade hackers
temporarily disabled NATO's main Web site by clogging it with more
empty messages than it could handle. And all around the globe,
pro-Serbian groups reportedly have dumped unsolicited mail _
``spam,'' in Web jargon _ into the in-boxes of more than 10,000
Internet users. The Wall Street Journal recently dubbed this
offensive ``Yugospam.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Web enthusiasts such as Shari Steele say, the
Internet also has provided a vital outlet for persecuted Kosovars
and journalists looking to communicate to the free world from a
region policed by Yugoslav censors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft Corp.'s online magazine Slate offers
``Secret Dispatches from Belgrade.'' An anonymous correspondent
reports daily on alleged Serb atrocities as well as the civilian
suffering inflicted by NATO bombs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful thing to have all this information and raw
data available to people interested in knowing what's really going
on,'' said Steele, director of legal services for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation. ``That's the essence of democracy.'' &QL;

THREE-CAR GARAGES AREN'T JUST FOR EASY STREET ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's been nearly three years since the Miller
family parked two vehicles in the two-car garage attached to their
house in south Overland Park, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, John Miller's pickup truck has been crowded out by
the pile of toys that sits in the middle of the garage, which is
also used to store bicycles, lawn equipment and freezer. The only
room left is for Stephanie Miller's minivan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the space crunch is about to end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Millers are building a house with a three-car garage just a
few blocks away in the same subdivision, Hampton Place. They hope
to move in by August. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband would always say how it would be nice to have a
three-car garage, and I said no,'' Stephanie Miller said. ``But to
me, now a three-car garage is more practical.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, an increasing number of homes are being built with
three-car garages, and the Kansas City, Mo., area is outpacing the
trend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Kansas City six months ago, and every home I saw had
a three-car garage,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research
for the National Association of Home Builders. ``And I'm talking
about average homes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once a luxury for the wealthy, three-car garages have become an
option in the Kansas City area in new homes priced at $150,000 and
lower. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They see it as a necessity, not a luxury,'' said Bonni Spence,
a community manager for the Crystal Park subdivision in Shawnee,
Kan. ``It's a mind-set.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to statistics from the National Association
of Home Builders, 16 percent of new homes in the United States were
built with a three-car or larger garage. That's up from 10 percent
at the start of the decade, but it pales in comparison with the
latest figures from the Kansas City area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sams, Kansas City supervisor of residential plan review,
estimates that 40 percent to 50 percent of the 1,200-plus
single-family building permits Kansas City, Mo., issued last year
included a three-car garage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Overland Park, city figures show that 58 percent of the
nearly 1,300 permits the city issued last year included garages
built for three or more cars. That's up from 36 percent in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Lee's Summit, Mo., 54 percent of the 994 single-family home
permits issued since the beginning of 1998 included three-car or
larger garages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue Springs, Mo., builder Tom Woods' two companies have
constructed three-car garages on houses priced in the $120,000
range and seen other builders do the same on $90,000 homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Kansas City area, Ahluwalia said, three-car garages
are most popular in California, Oregon, Texas and Washington state.
West Coast soil isn't good for digging basements, he said, so
larger garages provide storage space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City and Texas, larger lots make the bigger garages
possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what else is fueling the trend? Three-car families and large
sport-utility vehicles are only part of the answer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of hiring out a storage unit someplace, they're adding
another garage to put their kids' toys and bikes,'' said
residential architect Bruce Beatty, owner of Team 3 Architects in
Leawood, Kan. ``They don't use them for cars. The third bay is just
for stuff.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And ``stuff'' can mean anything from a riding mower to sports
equipment to boxes of old clothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than three people with three cars, it's two people with
two cars and a boat or motorcycle,'' said Larry Galbreath, whose
company builds patio homes, or villas, in Olathe, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, few people had any interest in putting
three-car garages on patio homes, which are built on narrower lots
with less lawn. Now, he said, about 40 percent of buyers want
them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Mike and Jean DeFabis moved from a patio home with a
two-car garage to a new one across the street with a three-car
garage. Now there's plenty of room for their two sport-utility
vehicles, a new Jaguar and storage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever move again, even if we don't have three cars, we'll
still have a three-car garage,'' Mike DeFabis said. ``It's
inexpensive space. ... It's not like adding living space. It's just
handier to keep stuff.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A three-car garage typically costs $7,500 to $10,000 more than a
two-car garage. Even if people say they prefer a two-car garage on
their new home, real estate agents are recommending the three-car
option to enhance resale value. More homes built on a speculative
basis are being equipped with three-car garages, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond five years ago, three-car was a nice thing and made it
sell quicker, but it wasn't a factor,'' said Darrel Hunter, project
manager for Hampton Place. ``Today, I think it is.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backyard sheds are a common remedy for storage problems in older
neighborhoods, but many newer developments don't allow them. Many
developments also prohibit parking on the street, and a few even
have rules against parking on the driveway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves a three-car garage as the only option for some
people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, what three-car garage owners gain in space, they often
lose in aesthetics, ending up with a place that looks like a garage
with an attached house, rather than the other way around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you end up with too much garage, you don't have as much
curb appeal,'' said Ora Reynolds, general manager of residential
development with Hunt Midwest, which is developing in suburbs north
of Kansas City, Mo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Larger homes built on larger lots can hide three-car garages
with side entry, an option not available on smaller lots. To keep
the garage from being a dominant feature, architects often set one
bay back from the two others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As a designer, the big trick is to make it not look like a
garage, so we work hard on that,'' Beatty said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another option is the tandem garage, with one regular bay and
one extra-deep bay long enough to hold two cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County, Kan., developer Darol Rodrock said some of his
customers were omitting formal living or dining rooms so they would
have room for three-car garages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The extra storage area is that big an issue to some people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just easier to have more space,'' Stephanie Miller said.
``It's just neater and cleaner.'' &QL;

EVEN FAMED SON `WEARY WILLIE' WOULD SMILE AT THE WAY TOWN HAS
ENDURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON, Mo. _ A recent fire here not surprisingly caused some
people to recall one of history's most famous news photographs: A
shot of the 1944 Hartford, Conn., circus fire that killed 168
persons, many of them children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the background the big top burns; in the foreground a running
clown vainly carries a bucket of water. It was sad-faced ``Weary
Willie,'' the nom de plume of the most famous clown of them all:
Emmett Kelly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now why would people hereabouts recall that, especially since
the fire in this town of 2,500 people April 5 was a nightmare that
destroyed five businesses and damaged two others. Still-standing
and blackened walls make Grand and Pine streets look like they'd
been bombed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, for starters, Houston is Emmett Kelly's hometown. And of a
more pressing matter, ``bring in the clowns'' is taken literally
here. The most destructive fire here in 50 years happened less than
a month before hundreds of people decked out in big shoes, baggy
pants, bulbous red noses and greasepaint were scheduled to descend
on Houston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first weekend in May _ meaning April 30 to May 2 _ this seat
of Texas County becomes a clown mecca with its Emmett Kelly
Festival, an annual event now in its 12th year of honoring
Houston's most famous son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The festival will still be held downtown, said Mark Forbes, a
druggist with the organizing committee who's been fielding calls
from concerned clowns and clown lovers from all over the Middle
West. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 people should show up, he said, including hundreds
and hundreds of people who love clowning to the point of wearing
clown outfits, painting their faces, taking pratfalls and doing
what clowns do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have it cleaned up,'' he said. ``But this year will be
better than ever. Emmett wouldn't have let something like this stop
him. Neither will we.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, born in Sedan, Kan., but raised from the age of 6 on a
hardscrabble farm near here, became America's most famous clown
with his woeful, joyless face; tattered outfit; and his cachet act:
trying to sweep away the spotlight with his broom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As ``Weary Willie,'' the one clown under the big top who didn't
paint a smile on his face, Kelly spent years with the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus, appeared in movies that
included ``The Greatest Show on Earth,'' did stints on television
and in nightclubs, and made commercials for Coca-Cola and Kodak.
Kelly died in 1979, at age 80. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoses, not buckets as in the Connecticut circus blaze, were used
on the Houston fire, which destroyed a video store, restaurant,
gift shop, realty company and the Houston area Chamber of Commerce
office. An electrical defect has tentatively been listed as the
cause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early reports said a large amount of Kelly's clown memorabilia,
stored in the chamber office, had been lost. Forbes, however, said
the Kelly holdings, thus the losses, were minimal _ mainly
autographed photographs, old newspapers and some commercially
available Weary Willie dolls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' Forbes said. ``We'd been negotiating with
Emmett's widow, Evie Kelly Lentz, about borrowing some of his stuff
to put on display. But that had been on the back burner. So we
didn't have anything real valuable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Forbes added, the lack of mementos shows how the
festival here has evolved over its dozen years. Rather than have a
static display of items from Kelly's career, the focus has shifted
to attracting people who love clowning; conducting clown schools
and seminars led by visiting, professional clowns; holding parades
and kid circuses; and letting those attending be what they love _
clowns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Come down here for the festival,'' said Forbes. ``There'll be
clowns all over.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, not everyone here has always had the name Emmett Kelly on
his or her lips despite the fact Kelly was a local boy who had
traveled the world, met all sorts of famous people, and whose
countenance was known to millions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard of him until they started this festival,'' said
Willard Davis, 84. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Watson, 87, knew the Kellys, who farmed four miles east of
here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't about to be a farmer, not down here with all these
rocks,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The memory here is that Kelly took off for Kansas City, Mo., to
be a cartoonist and worked at the same company as a fellow from
Marceline, Mo., named Walt Disney. It was there that he sketched
the first likeness of the sad-faced clown that was to become his
trademark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's first professional performance was here at the Old
Settler's Reunion in the 1920s, where he performed what was called
a ``chalk talk,'' writing somebody's name on a blackboard in
script, then adding to and filling in those lines until what
emerged was a landscape or a mountain scene or some other picture
that would fairly dazzle the audience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he became a trapeze artist,'' said Bob Davis, whose
father knew Kelly well. ``In the circus in those days lots of
performers did double duty. So Emmett was also a clown.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Weary Willie motif was perfect for the time _ the 1930s and
the Depression. Kelly was every man, every hobo, every working
stiff down on his luck. Plus, said Kathryn O'Dell of the
International Clown Hall of Fame in Milwaukee, Kelly knew the value
of promotion. Weary Willie was an odd duck in the world of
clowning, O'Dell said, and Kelly played his character for all it
was worth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelly never forgot his roots, coming back to Houston
several times over the years, wearing his clown outfit, posing with
local kids, and pleased as punch when a local park was named after
him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said there was already talk of clearing the burned-out
area and turning it into a park where the festival can become
bigger and better. Next year's show, he said, will be dubbed EK2K
or Emmett Kelly 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This town has taken some hard knocks over the past few
years,'' he said. ``We lost our shoe company and that was 450 jobs.
We're losing our blue-jean plant and that's 300 more. The only
thing on the horizon is the new maximum-security prison (South
Central Correctional facility, with 1,596 beds and 400 jobs) up at
Licking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So the festival helps. We know one thing _ clowns will never
go out of style. They bring people in, and that's what we need.'' &QL;

ELIZABETH DOLE TURNS ON THE TOUGH TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, Elizabeth Dole is talking tough. Listen to what she
said last week: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a war; we must win it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing needs to be escalated.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If indeed ground troops are needed ... so be it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's gotten into Dole, who has developed a well-earned
reputation for avoiding tough stands? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Dole's burgeoning campaign for the White House already
is in trouble precisely because she's perceived as mushy on the
issues. And that could prove devastating for a candidate who's
never held public office before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Dole set out to prove her mettle in the
foreign-policy arena and earn another look from campaign donors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what took her to the U.S. Naval Academy, where she
delivered an address titled ``Hawkish World View.'' And that's what
took her on a well-publicized trip to the Balkans, where she was
seen posing with refugees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole already is far behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the
all-important money battle. According to reports last week, Bush
had $6.8 million on hand, while Dole had only a fraction of that _
just $578,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole is hardly alone among GOP candidates who trail Bush by
millions of dollars. But she knows she's got to find ways to close
that gap or the race will be declared over by the Fourth of July. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking on the tough issues is the way for her to do that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former pro jocks are weighing in for Democrat Bill Bradley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those same campaign reports last week showed that former New
York Knicks players Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere and Phil Jackson
had given to their former teammate. So has Michael Jordan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's chief competitor, Vice President Al Gore, had the
Hollywood crowd, with actors Kate Capshaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Kevin
Costner and Michael Douglas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Topeka, Kan., the buzz is that Gov. Bill Graves is
squandering his political capital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who was elected with a record 73 percent of the vote in
November can brag of few accomplishments this session. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Graves' problems begin with a Legislature that's vastly
different from any he faced in his first term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who until this year displayed an abnormal fealty to
Graves, suddenly look like tough guys. Instead of cooperating,
they're angling, scheming, seeking political advantage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans, who suffered serious setbacks in last
year's elections, are pushing their agenda as if they still run the
world. They're teaming up with Democrats to forge a working
majority in the House that's left Graves and his fellow moderates
on the sidelines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Graves has become just another governor with the
daunting task of overseeing a three-party, coalition-style
government of Democrats, conservative Republicans and moderate
Republicans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a mess. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can Graves get on top of this situation or will he be consumed
by it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out in the veto session beginning April 28. If Graves
manages to get a major highway bill passed this year, you can
conclude that the governor can still get it done. A lot of
lawmakers agree that the session's fate rests on that one issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the governor falls short, the conclusion will be that Graves
has been seriously marginalized. Record re-election or not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if that happens, the governor will have to take a hard look
at his laid-back approach. The times may demand a firmer,
grab-'em-by-the-collar style that the governor finds so
distasteful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking a look: Kansas City (Mo.) Councilwoman Teresa Loar, a
Republican, is considering a run for Congress next year against
Democrat Pat Danner. &QL;

THE RIGHT TIME TO STEP BACK A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Out of the darkness the tireless waves wash in,
phosphorescing as they curl and expire on the sand. The tide is
rising, and the water's whisper tells of morning soon to come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's one figure on the beach, barely visible. It's a woman
alone, in a folding chair, facing outward to the gulf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sky starts to lighten. A chirruping of birds begins. The
last star goes out, and the ghost-pale moon rides low. Somewhere
voices can be heard, and a rustle of laughter. It is a curious hour
for laughing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A jogger goes past, leaving the print of his bare feet to be
taken by the incoming sea. And after him, three pelicans gliding in
low formation a dozen yards offshore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then a squad of sandpipers comes patrolling at the edge of the
foam, with one strutting gull among them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is full light, now. And the woman in the folding beach chair
still has not moved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what she is thinking. Maybe this is the end of her stay
in a place she has loved, and she has come out early to watch the
day begin. If so, she must be thinking of the amazing quickness of
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a consideration that, beyond a certain point in life,
occupies us all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago this week, with my wife and our two daughters,
who were little children then, I had just returned from a sojourn
on an island an hour north from here along the coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I sat down, then, to write the first of these columns that have
been my labor and my devotion for nearly half my career as a
journalist. The sounds and smells of the salt shore still were with
me, and it occurred that the work to which I'd set myself was a
good deal like beachcombing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The column, I said, would have no agenda, no ax to grind. Like
any beachcomber, I meant to take whatever came to hand. My only
plan was to examine, with curious eye and honest heart, some of the
commonplaces and oddities cast up on the beaches of all our years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the good days, that's what these pieces have been about: the
joys and cares and devotions we all know, that light our lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The managing editor of the paper then was Mike Waller, gone on
now to be publisher of The Baltimore Sun. I promised Mike I would
write the column for two years. Instead it has been 20 _ three
columns a week, some 2,600 in all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has governed my life and my thoughts more completely than
ever I imagined work could. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were days when I thought another piece would never come.
And other stretches of weeks, sometimes, when the writing was so
easy it seemed almost like stealing. At its best, it has been like
an extended conversation with more friends than anyone could
reasonably hope to have. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there are new places in this world I yet mean to see, and
ones I've loved that I intend to see again. And other writing to
do. And bird dogs to follow, with a new pup coming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To stop writing the column entirely would be, for me,
unimaginable. It is the right time, though, to step back just a
bit. So beginning today, these essays will appear once a week, on
Sundays, in this same section of the paper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What I said 20 years ago was: Let's go down where the sandpipers
run, and see what we find there and what, if anything, can be made
of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, we'll still be working that same stretch of shore together
_ just a bit less often. &QL;

BOXCAR WILLIE REMEMBERED AS A PERFORMER FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. _ For every show, Boxcar Willie would dust off his
worn overalls and sing train songs such as ``Wabash Cannonball''
for the umpteenth time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations didn't play his music. He didn't make videos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But friends and fans say Boxcar Willie was a Branson pioneer,
creating a model for living and performing in this live-music
center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was the first big-name outside entertainer to live in Branson
year-round. He was the first outside performer to own his theater.
And he encouraged others to follow his example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 900 packed his theater again Saturday for the country
legend's funeral. Boxcar Willie, whose real name was Lecil Martin,
died Monday at 67 after a three-year bout with leukemia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as he clung to his overalls during his 12-year run, Branson
reached for the glitz: opening an IMAX theater, welcoming Donald
Trump's Miss USA pageant and building a modern airport for
corporate customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Branson changed, Boxcar Willie went from an outsider with new
ideas to a charming anachronism who fit right in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if there's any doubt whether Branson's heart lies with the
Boxcar Willies or the Trumps of the world, remember this: The
world's most famous hobo is the only Branson performer to have a
street here named for him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend to everybody,'' said Mayor Lou Schaefer, who
had delivered a tearful tribute at a city meeting Monday. ``He
didn't act like an entertainer. He treated people like a neighbor
would.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boxcar Willie opened in Branson in 1987 on the heels of
worldwide success. Since developing his hobo persona, he had
performed for sold-out crowds and had been inducted into the Grand
Ole Opry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Branson was still small-time. The town ``was a few theaters and
some go-kart tracks,'' recalled Larry Martin, Boxcar Willie's son.
A few local entertainers, and the occasional big name, such as Roy
Clark, performed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martin said some questioned Boxcar Willie's motives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't realize was that he was as much a vagabond as
the hobos in his sorrowful train songs. He played almost 300 dates
a year after hitting it big in the 1970s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Branson, with its sprawling countryside, reminded Boxcar Willie
of the rural Texas of his youth. Right away, he immersed himself in
the community. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Taney County Child Welfare Board, raising
thousands of dollars for needy children. While other entertainers
would say they were too tired to attend charity events, Boxcar
Willie never said no, Schaefer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He once brought a microphone and a speaker to a Highway
Department meeting to protest a proposed highway bypass. He was
ejected after arguing with transportation officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boxcar Willie criticized performers who worked in Branson in the
summer but had little use for the community the rest of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they made a livelihood out of Branson, he thought they
should give back,'' Martin said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mourners Saturday, such as Jim Stafford, Yakov
Smirnoff and Andy Williams, had followed Boxcar Willie's example
and had moved to Branson. They shared warm memories of the singer
and watched video clips of songs such as ``I've Seen It All From a
Boxcar Door'' that highlighted the 45-minute service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same entertainers had helped usher in a growth in
entertainment that Boxcar Willie welcomed as a way to bring jobs
and expand audiences. By 1993, the town boasted more than two dozen
theaters and 5.6 million tourists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the audiences grew, so did the theaters. Some became posh
venues with opulent lobbies, thousands of seats and special
effects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boxcar Willie tried to relate to his fans. He remembered some
names even years between visits. Tom and Esther Rice of
Reynoldsburg, Ohio, were proud when he displayed one of their
letters in his theater lobby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He always made his fans feel special,'' Esther Rice said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Branson grew, other acts became more Hollywood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shows added shapely dancers in sequined costumes. Other singers,
such as Wayne Newton, dripped with Vegas smoothness. The soap-opera
star who was host of the Miss USA pageant laced the show with
double-entendres. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fans sitting in one of the 900 faded blue seats in the Boxcar
Willie Theater would see Boxcar Willie and his guitar. That was
enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One colleague remembered Boxcar Willie humbly telling fans: ``I
don't have any smoke machine or fireworks, but here are the fire
exits anyway.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Above the theater entrance, the straight-laced singer hung a
sign: ``Obscene and Profane Shirts, Hats, Etc. Prohibited.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the word `integrity' because he stayed true to his
music. He didn't try to change with the style,'' said Sheila
Dutton, whose family is performing at Boxcar Willie's theater this
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The son of a railroad man never had a hit single, but audiences
kept coming back. Martin confided that his father sometimes felt
confined by the hobo image. Sometimes, he wished he could take to
the stage in a nice suit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what the fans wanted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Boxcar Willie kept singing the train songs that hearkened
back to Branson's own humble beginnings and forged a bond with
longtime residents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Siegrist, a retired farmer from Shell Knob, Mo., drove 30
miles Wednesday afternoon to pay tribute to one of his favorite
singers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of favorites: Shoji, the Welks. But there was
something different about Box,'' Siegrist said, standing below the
theater marquee. ``I could relate to him. He seemed like one of
us.'' &QL; 
Boxcar Willie
</P>
<P>
   Real name: Lecil Martin &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born: 1931 in Sterrett, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Background: After 22 years in the Air Force, Boxcar Willie
created his hobo persona in the 1970s. In 1981, he became the 60th
member of the Grand Ole Opry. He had 15 gold albums and four
platinum albums in a decade. He moved to Branson, Mo., in 1987,
where he built a theater, a railroad museum and two motels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paying respects: The family suggests memorials to the American
Cancer Society c/o Greenlawn Funeral Home, Branson, Mo. &QL;

FOR LAKERS: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Dennis Rodman still wants another ring, he'll have to grow a
third nipple.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count him out.
</P>
<P>
   But only time will tell if Friday's cut can become a Laker title
waive, so all we can do is chase this odyssey all the way back to
Thursday's fateful practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't know where the voice was coming from, but it
mouthed the following alibi for ``Shoeless'' Dennis'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Just schedule it, and he will come ... eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The response:
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice of a sportswriter taking cuts in the buffet line? No,
try rookie Lakers coach Kurt Rambis, who shamelessly was shoved
into the predicament of dealing with The Worm and ``No-Show Time.''
</P>
<P>
   This last straw (or was it a swizzle stick?) was Rodman's tardy,
barefoot arrival for Thursday's workout. It was preceded by similar
practice sins, playing-time pouting, alleged elbow gloom and that
Electra-fying trip to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling problem? That would belong to Lakers owner Jerry Buss,
the misguided advocate of a player whose subsequent behavior
demonstrated a grotesque lack of respect for his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And when the cuttin' was done, Rodman accused his suddenly
ex-teammates of not knowing how to win. He's right. But Rodman was
a dandy example. Oh, Dennis certainly knows how to win - attach
himself to a team with great players, stay in shape by maintaining
a 2-to-1 Stair-Master/tavern ratio, and selfishly avoid the
vagaries of team defense for the sake of rebounding stats.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, he joined a crowd with skewed priorities. The
posturing Lakers don't need to hire Shoeless Dennis for lessons on
how to play with passion.
</P>
<P>
   They can study the frequently overmatched Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   So ... what happens to Rodman? Well, several Laker big shots
accused him of being a genius, and that assessment could be on the
money. Sure, Rodman is about to lose a Carl's Jr. spot that shows
almost as much bun as he offered on the cover of his book.
</P>
<P>
   But this Laker banishment could render him even more notorious
... and marketable. Rodman will land on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes, again, will be optional.
</P>
<P>
   A DESERT FLOWER
</P>
<P>
   Early returns from the Desert Classic pre-draft camp in Tempe
reveal that several talent watchdogs are campaigning for Xavier
small forward James Posey.
</P>
<P>
   Posey goes 6-foot-8, runs like a deer, jump likes the same
running deer when it approaches a fallen tree or something, and has
the energy of a deer that has mistaken coffee beans for pinon nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rising Clipper hero Tyrone Nesby was one of the stars
of last year's Desert Classic and didn't get drafted. Regardless of
how stupid some NBA personnel regulars remain, Posey's name will be
called in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Desert Classic also was the scene for the unveiling of agent
Bill Duffy's mystery client, Menk Batear. Duffy, who represents
Michael Olowokandi, last year's No. 1 pick, went all the way to
China to land the 6-10, 270-pound Menk (pronounced ``Monk'').
</P>
<P>
   STAR-CROSSED BLAZERS
</P>
<P>
   As we underscored in this space a few weeks ago, Portland's
active roster has nine lottery picks who weren't originally drafted
by front-office sharpie Bob Whitsitt.
</P>
<P>
   They also have zero players on their active roster who have made
an appearance in an NBA All-Star Game. Yet. A playoff problem?
Shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it might be if you believe championships are traced to the
presence of Hall of Fame players. Bulls? Jordan and Pippen.
Rockets? Olajuwon and Drexler. Pistons? Thomas. Lakers? Please.
76ers? Dr. J and Moses. Celtics? We don't have enough space.
</P>
<P>
   The last team to win an NBA title without a Hall of Fame lock?
The Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics became champs 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   NO THIRD-STRING MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Former Compton playground, John Muir High (Pasadena) and Kansas
University star Jacque Vaughn has become the Maytag repairman of
NBA point guards.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year pro, who rides the Utah Jazz bench as insurance
for John Stockton and Howard Eisley, still believes his time will
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot,'' Vaughn said of practice wars with
Stockton, ``and I have to look at it that way. But I have to be
concerned about my future when I see guys I've done well against
getting opportunities with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I can do. I just have to be patient and ready when
I get my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Four years after steering UCLA's NCAA championship drive, former
Poly High star Tyus Edney finds himself back in a final four.
Edney, who was drafted by the Sacramento Kings in the second round
of the 1995 NBA Draft, now plays point guard for Zalgiris Kaunus, a
pro team based in Lithuania. Zalgiris has qualified for the
semifinal round of the European Championships. Its center happens
to be George Zidek, Edney's teammate and roommate at UCLA. ... How
silly can some coaches be in attempting to gain an advantage? Well
Miami's Pat Riley does not allow opposing players to use the Heat's
weight room at Miami Arena. Toronto's Butch Carter has a similar
policy. As strategy, that's pretty weak. Several teams counter by
banning the Heat and Raptors from their facilities. ... Don Nelson
really made a smooth move by dealing Dallas' next first-round pick
(a lottery biggie) just to acquire point guard Steve Nash, who
ranks last among his starting peers in field-goal percentage and is
24th in assists. ... If Allen Iverson really needs endorsements,
his crossover dribble could make him a natural as
chamber-of-commerce shill for Palm Springs. ... Their popularity
with NBC won't make the Lakers champions, but it could get them
syndicated.

HEAR THAT SOUND: IT'S SONICS FALLING DOWN, GOING BOOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Warning: This column has been designated a
Rodman-free zone, a subject that is already tired but will no doubt
be further regurgitated by too many newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean we won't be discussing mental problems.
Namely, the Seattle SchizoSonics, a team that has nice-guy coach
Paul Westphal exhibiting unusual behavior and thinking he should
have waited another season before coaching again. It's so bad
lately in Seattle that Jelani McCoy is viewed as a pleasant
surprise and booster of team morale.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Schizos have a 7-6 record against the top five
teams in the Western Conference _ which is more than respectable _
but are just 6-13 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics used to be just another team who's chance at winning
an NBA title had vanished. But their problems are much deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they beat the Sacramento Kings in overtime 99-98 and
celebrated more than a team that evened its record at 19-19 should
have.
</P>
<P>
   The normally laid-back Westphal blew a kiss to the crowd as he
ran off the court, upset over the Kings fans' treatment of former
center Olden Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our biggest win,'' Westphal said. ``No question.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night, the Sonics went out and got blown off the court
in an embarrassing 30-point loss to the Nets in Seattle. Then there
was the NBA record-low of 19 rebounds they had in a loss to Phoenix
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many (rebounds) did we have?'' asked point guard Gary
Payton. ``Two?''
</P>
<P>
   With such a record of underachievement, the Sonics are starting
to panic. There is speculation that Payton will be traded this
summer because he is under contract until 2003 and still considered
the best defensive player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the Sonics are just an old team. Forward Vin
Baker is the only impact player under 30, and he becomes a free
agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Some hard choices lay ahead, and it's unclear if GM Wally Walker
has the know-how to rebuild the Sonics, especially if you listen to
George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you feel better about the Lakers already?
</P>
<P>
   And then we have the Knicks: Also known as Team Free Fall, it's
become a three-ring circus because of the different cliques within
the team.
</P>
<P>
   There's the three newcomers _ Marcus Camby, Latrell Sprewell and
Kurt Thomas _ who have all come from losing programs and seem to be
indifferent about the team's fortunes. After a recent loss to
Indiana, while guard Chris Childs was complaining about some
teammates not caring enough about losing, the three amigos were in
the background laughing, sharing a private joke.
</P>
<P>
   The next clique is known as the God squad, led by Charlie Ward
and Allan Houston. Teammates believe they take losses too easily
because they often say it is ``God's will'' and ``everything will
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a third group, known as the warriors, led by
Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson. They will do anything to win, even
playing with injuries that could, if they aggravate them, cost
significant time. Ewing has tendinitis in his left Achilles' tendon
and Johnson has battled a right knee sprain.
</P>
<P>
   All three groups seem to be pulling in different directions,
which is why this team will have to scramble to make the playoffs.
If they don't, it means good-bye not only to coach Jeff Van Gundy,
but probably to GM Ernie Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge of the Mailman?: Phoenix center Luc Longley believes
Utah's Karl Malone was out to hurt him when Malone crashed into the
Aussie center last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Longley hyperextended his left knee and said Malone was trying
to even the score after losing two NBA titles to Longley when he
was with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked pretty bloody flagrant to me,'' Longley said. ``It
looked like he went for my knee, and that's weak. I'm just amazed
that someone would do that. He had a smile on his face when he was
going back down the court. I looked at that on the video and I was
amazed. We all make our living with our bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   All business: The Pacers got booed off their floor after losing
at home to Charlotte and have decided to get serious. They dropped
their pre-game ritual, in which each player had their own dance
step during introductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much took away our privilege of doing things with
flair,'' guard Mark Jackson said. ``That has nothing to do with
winning or losing, but that's something that was a privilege
because we were an elite team. We've gotten away from playing like
that, though, so until we show we're there again, we've put it on
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tour of duty: Former NBA players Connie Hawkins, Charlie Scott
and Dwayne ``Pearl'' Washington are in Bosnia this week for
basketball instructional clinics and visits with NATO troops. Next
week, Artis Gilmore, Dan Roundfield and Randy Smith will give
similar clinics in the war-torn country.

WIDE RECEIVER GARNER INJURES KNEE IN SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's defense dominated its second scrimmage of
the spring Saturday, but the Trojans might have lost another player
to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Troy Garner of Notre Dame High possibly damaged
the ligaments in his left knee during the 74-play scrimmage. He
will be examined today, and USC coach Paul Hackett feared the
injury was potentially season-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' Hackett said. ``Nobody touched him.
It's so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans lost middle linebacker Mike Pollard last week after
he tore knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Hackett was pleased with the defense Saturday. Free
safety Darnell Lacy had the play of the game, intercepting a pass
and returning it 75 yards for a touchdown. Senior safety Frank
Carter had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman linebacker Armand Holland had a team-high 10 tackles
and sophomore linebacker Henry Wallace particularly impressed
Hacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wallace) is just a huge improvement from where he was,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong performance: Offensively, USC was led by sophomore
tailback Frank Strong, who had 75 yards in six carries. Petros
Papadakis had 40 yards in nine carries with two touchdowns. Chad
Morton had 20 yards in eight carries.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Palmer, who has been bothered by a groin pull, completed
9 of 14 passes for 57 yards and one interception. Mike Van
Raaphorst completed 11 of 15 for 107 yards with an interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Bobby DeMars of Westlake did not play, bothered by
a torn abdominal muscle. He will be examined next week before a
decision is made on whether he will participate in USC's final
three practices.

REAL GLAUS HAS ARRIVED FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was only a matter of time before Anaheim
Angels third baseman Troy Glaus started showing the hitting skills
that prompted Anaheim to make the former UCLA Bruin its first-round
pick (third overall) in the 1997 June free-agent draft.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had a sensational year in the minors last season, but in
48 games with the Angels he struggled. Known for his power, he
belted only one home run and finished the season hitting .218.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have seen a different Glaus this season. He's among
the American League leaders in several categories. He's tied for
second in average (.462), tied for ninth in RBI (10), tied for
first in multiple-hit games (6), tied for fourth in runs scored
(11) and tied for first in hits (18).
</P>
<P>
   He was 3 for 3 on Friday night against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came in here last season we didn't see the Troy Glaus
we knew we had because he was tired,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``There was a lot of things that went into last season but I
can tell you he's using the whole field now.
</P>
<P>
   ``All everyone talked about last year was the power and how he
appeared to want to hit homers. Right now all he wants to do is hit
the ball hard and he knows the homers will come. Another thing is
he's fresher and he feels good, which always makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping Hasegawa: Collins also talked about struggling reliever
Shigetoshi Hasegawa. He gave up a three-run homer in the ninth
Friday against Seattle, but the Angels had a comfortable 9-2
cushion and held on for a 9-5 victory. Hasegawa is without a save
in five appearances and has a 6.75 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the Japanese pitchers, there is always a hesitation
and a pause,'' Collins said. ``He's rushing through his (motion)
and that's not how he usually pitches. He'll be fine. Next time
we'll slow him down and look at the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: In their past eight games (heading into
Saturday), the Angels were batting .346 with 27 doubles, one
triple, nine home runs (two grand slams) and 56 RBI. The club
averaged 7.8 runs per game during that span.

PREPARING TO SURVIVE AVALANCHE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Colo. Ore., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By DEBORAH JONES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHISTLER, British Columbia _ Record snowfalls this year
contributed to disastrous slides in North America and Europe, and
avalanche centers continued to report fatalities such as a skier
buried and killed near Ophir, Colo., on April 7. Now, even as
warmth creeps up to the high Alpine, avalanche risk continues for
spring and summer adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger doesn't ever go away; you can get caught in a slide
in the high mountains in August,'' said Tom Kimbrough, an avalanche
forecaster with the U.S. Forest Service at the Utah Avalanche
Forecast Center. Last summer, two climbers were killed in separate
incidents in May and June on Mount Hood, Ore., and Mount Rainier,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Most fatal avalanches are set off by the victim or companions,
and risk management can mean the difference between life and death.
With that in mind, because my family spends all of its free time in
the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, I signed up with my
11-year-old son, Gavin, for a free one-day avalanche tour here at
Whistler.
</P>
<P>
   We met Roger Sarrasin, a back-country guide and volunteer safety
instructor, at the base of Blackcomb Mountain and boarded a chair
lift. Immediately, we were enveloped by a veil of feathery
snowflakes, and our instruction began. ``See the arms on the
snowflakes?'' Sarrasin asked. Arms form more stable bonds with old
snow than sphere-shaped flakes known as sugar snow, Sarrasin
explained. On the ground, however, snow changes constantly,
affected by wind, humidity, pressure and temperature, while the
snow pack differs at different elevations and on lee and windward
slope sides. All factors _ with gravity _ determine whether a
person's weight will cause a slide.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 minutes into the tour, I realized that avalanche risk is
less a science than an art, and I knew I would never remember all
the variables. I was relieved when Sarrasin suggested a ski run.
</P>
<P>
   When we alighted on a ridge to plan our next euphoric dash,
Sarrasin sobered us up by pointing out a slope above a chair lift
which, he explained, is one of untold hundreds of avalanche runs at
the Whistler ski resort. But not to worry, he assured us. Only in
the back country or out of resort boundaries is there high risk,
because North American resorts use bombs to start controlled slides
and eliminate rogue avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we heard the patrollers far above. The booms echoed off
the peaks and reverberated down the valley, and I looked at my son
and briefly wondered at the lunacy of a sport that requires bombs
for safety. Then, we were off again, momentarily forgetting that
slides kill more North Americans than any other natural hazard,
including hurricanes and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Those most at risk are snowmobilers, like the seven riders
killed in two separate avalanches in Alaska in recent weeks. New
technology and the fact that riders travel far and fast over
differing terrain equal risk, Kimbrough said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarders riding outside resort boundaries are often caught
in slides but perish less often, perhaps because they stay close to
resort areas where rescue is likely. While back-country skiers die
each year, as a group they have educated themselves well, Kimbrough
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's very difficult while skiing rare fresh powder to turn the
mind from play to education, but Sarrasin persisted, dispensing
wisdom between runs. Even an avalanche two inches deep can kill you
because it can sweep you into a tree or off a cliff, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   When snow slides, the bonds between the layers dissolve and the
snow behaves much like liquid water. If caught, he advised, try to
escape to the side; failing that, shed heavy gear and swim upward;
almost nobody buried deeper than six feet survives.
</P>
<P>
   When an avalanche stops, the snow sets like concrete so quickly,
and so hard, that a victim can rarely put a hand over his mouth to
form an air pocket. I tested this theory, trying in vain to chip at
a refrigerator-size chunk of avalanche debris. It was so hard and
tomblike that the ``Star Wars'' character Han Solo came to mind,
frozen into a solid block.
</P>
<P>
   Once buried, a victim's only chance is to be located and dug out
_ before suffocation _ by the trained and well-equipped buddies
everyone should travel with, each carrying a locator transmitter
and receiver strapped around the chest and a collapsible probe and
shovel in a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention is the key, of course, and to estimate risk, digging
snow pits is recommended _ an arduous, repetitive task, because
information gathered in one pit may not apply a stone's throw away
or an hour later. The pit should be deep enough to stand in, then
skis or a saw is used to carve a straight-sided column from one
side.
</P>
<P>
   As Sarrasin created a column, I was startled to see clearly
defined layers, each deposited from a storm, emerge; throughout
them lurked layers of unstable sugar snow. Risk is measured by the
pressure needed to shatter the column, and as Sarrasin tapped
lightly with his shovel, his column fractured into precise slabs.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined a slab the size of an entire slope racing down a
mountain at top avalanche speed of 120 miles an hour _ and
understood why injuries kill 20 percent of avalanche victims (the
rest suffocate).
</P>
<P>
   This past winter, freakish slides in France, Italy, Switzerland
and Austria had killed more than 70 people at midwinter (some in
buildings swept away by snow). Since last fall (avalanche season is
measured for one year starting each October), 43 North Americans
have died, compared with 46 the previous season and 35 in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche bulletins are now issued in each state and province,
and courses are organized by avalanche centers in the United States
and Canada. Two Web sites _ www.csac.org and www.avalanche.org _
have also been set up. &QL;

COWBOYS AGAIN DRAFT CAROLINA END WITH FIRST CHOICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ With their first selection in the 1999 NFL
Draft, the Cowboys picked. ... a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It should.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time in the past six years, the Cowboys made a
move to upgrade their pass rush with their first pick in the draft
_ choosing North Carolina defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban with the
20th pick yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike past years when the choice of an end was based
solely on need, picking the 6-foot-3, 281-pound Ekuban, a native of
Ghana, can be credited to the best-player-available philosophy that
typified all of the Cowboys selections yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys took offensive linemen Solomon Page of West Virginia
in the second round and Texas A&AMP;M All-America linebacker Dat Nguyen
in the third round. Earlier in the day, the Cowboys signed
free-agent linebacker Quentin Coryatt to a three-year contract and
restructured the contract of fullback Daryl Johnston to lower his
salary and allow him to remain with team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the best athletes available,'' Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones said. ``It was unique the way it fell. What we did in the
free agency with Quentin and receiver Raghib Ismail and center Mark
Stepnoski allowed us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the uncertain status of defensive tackle Leon Lett
did not affect the team's draft picks. According to a source, Lett,
a member of stage three of the league's substance-abuse program,
has violated the NFL's drug policy again and faces an indefinite
ban from the league.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team actively tried to move up in the draft. A
source said the Cowboys made calls to the Vikings at 11, the Bears
at 12, the Steelers at 13, the Chiefs at 14, the Buccaneers at 15
and the Titans at 16 with the idea of taking either Louisiana Tech
receiver Troy Edwards, Louisiana State defensive tackle Anthony
McFarland or Florida outside linebacker Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cowboys found no takers for their offer of the 22nd
pick in first round and a second-round pick because ``many of those
teams liked their draft position or wanted the same players'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Steelers took Edwards, the Buccaneers took
McFarland and the Titans took Kearse, the Cowboys made a move with
Seattle to move up two spots to get Ekuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very high on our board,'' Jones said. ``He was the last
first-round defensive player left on our board.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey echoed Jones, saying ``he was the best
player available and we were fortunate to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Cowboys loaded up on defensive ends with the
first pick in the past _ Shante Carver in 1994, Kavika Pittman in
1996 and Greg Ellis in 1998 _ had no bearing on their decision to
choose Ekuban, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo said improving the Cowboys'
pass rush is a must, and the speedy Ekuban gives them a chance to
do that. Carver is no longer with the team. Pittman and Ellis
combined for nine sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more pressure on the passer,'' Campo said. ``This is
another possibility for someone to come in and play. This young man
brings a speed dimension to the game. We are excited to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban has only played defensive end the past two seasons after
playing tight end as a freshman and sophomore. However, the speed
and athletic ability he showed this past season when he led the Tar
Heels with 12 sacks was impressive enough for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement goes both ways.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones called to ask Ekuban if he was ``ready to wear a star
on his helmet'' his response was barely audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family just jumped up and down,'' said Ekuban, whose dad is
a official with the Senegalese embassy in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was yelling and screaming. The Cowboys couldn't hear
me talk. I was in shock. I am very happy to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban is also happy to be on the same team again with Ellis,
last season's top pick who also went to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, who said Ellis helped him in his move to defensive end
two seasons ago, will again be looking to Ellis for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being with Greg at Carolina was beneficial to me,'' Ekuban
said. ``It helped me mature and learn the defensive end position. I
know he'll do the same for me with the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban's presence, however, also prompts a position switch for
Ellis. He is one of several options the Cowboys are considering to
help improve their depth at defensive tackle. Campo said Ellis and
Michael Myers, who played end as a rookie last season, both have
the ability to play tackle.

TORONTO BEATS NEW YORK, 93-90  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Wallace used to be a Knick. John Thomas and Doug
Christie, too. Did we mention Charles Oakley, the manual laborer
who outfoxed and outboxed his former team Saturday night?
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors have essentially become Vince Carter and New
York North, a scintillating rookie sandwiched between a bunch of
former Knicks who still get up for the team that did not want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human emotion to play well against the team that sent you
away,'' Thomas said after he combined with Oakley, Christie and
Wallace 40 points, 19 rebounds and 11 assists in Toronto's 93-90
victory at Madison Square Garden. ``There's nothing personal, but
you naturally get up more for a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Oakley appreciation column can wait for another day.
Frankly, the way he knocked down all five of his shots and snatched
the game's key rebound from the player for whom he was traded,
Marcus Camby, in the final seconds was proof that Oakley may have
more than a year or two left in his hallmark career.
</P>
<P>
   Who cannot wait are the Knicks, a team that might miss the
playoffs for the first time since Hubie Brown and Bob Hill could
not fix things in 1987. If you have followed this team for long, it
must be unfathomable to see them unable to stop the other team from
scoring when they need the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Knicks consistently chipped paint off the rim
during the Riley era, they always could dig in, get nasty and put
their behinds on the opposing players. They gave up 12 offensive
rebounds Saturday night to a team that had lost its last six games.
Oakley is impossible to keep off the glass, but when you can't
block out Christie, there is a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Knicks lately is like watching some saucy Fox
special, like ``Amazing Car Chases'' or the ``World's Most
Incredibly Bad Defensive Teams.'' It's chaotic, exciting. But the
ending is always bad.
</P>
<P>
   The other night against the Wizards, the Knicks had a 5-point
lead in regulation and a 3-point lead late in overtime. And lost.
They also led Detroit by 9 points in the fourth quarter of Friday
night's loss on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry problems are clear, and Oakley was at least honest
enough to acknowledge them before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to win, but they have to understand that this game
is not an individual game,'' Oakley said, ``just because the g.m.
thinks they can get a guy that is talented. But is he talented
enough to play in the system that's already here? It's hard to get
guys to compliment other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not just taking yet another potshot at Ernie Grunfeld,
the Knicks president who traded Oakley last June. Oakley was also
doing what he always did best in New York: giving you the plain,
unadulterated truth about the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have to do what Jeff wants to do,'' Oakley said of Knicks
Coach Jeff Van Gundy. He also said the club's chemistry problems
have less to do with Camby and more to do with Latrell Sprewell,
the team's No. 1 off-season gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprewell is a good player, but he's not really for this
team,'' Oakley said. ``This team is more half-court and Sprewell
wants to get out on the break. He's not an East Coast player.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what now? ``The pieces to the puzzle don't fit? You buy
another puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was part of the mix two years ago. Cocksure and playful
to a fault, he became a little too large for even his obscenely
baggy britches as a rookie out of Syracuse. But there he was
Saturday night, giving Larry Johnson an earful after scoring on
him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the third quarter, Wallace had Sprewell
plastered to him on the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Facing up the smaller defender, the 6-foot-9-inch Wallace used
two shot fakes before going around Sprewell on the right baseline
and dunking hard. Do you know how much the Knicks could use that
kind of low-post scorer at this point?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has emerged as a decent garbage man as a reserve.
Christie still takes too many circus shots. Not all of these former
Knicks would fit into the current team's scheme. There is no reason
to think that any of them, save Oakley, could send this
slumping-again franchise into the playoffs on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something oddly appropriate about a team that was
supposed to be bound for the lottery picking the Knicks apart in a
regular-season game of major consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy, no? Oakley was said to be exiled to Toronto six months
ago, his proud career expected to die north of the border in some
National Basketball Association outpost.
</P>
<P>
   He and his team looked very much alive Saturday night. Maybe he
got out of here just in time.

RANGERS CAN'T MAKE THEIR PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Just when the Rangers thought they were headed
in the right direction, they run into the Oakland Athletics and
fall flat on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Poor starting pitching and a stagnant offense have led to two
consecutive trouncings, the latest coming yesterday in a 11-3 loss
to the Athletics at Network Associates Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle came the day after the Athletics dumped the Rangers,
8-2, in the first of a three-game series. The Rangers have one game
left to salvage something against the A's; otherwise, they nullify
their uplifting three-game sweep of the Seattle Mariners at the
start of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we wanted to come in here and play well, and
obviously we haven't,'' left fielder Rusty Greer said. ``Coming out
of Seattle I think everybody was looking for us to get into one of
those rolls. But you've got to hand it to the A's. They've played
great baseball and beat us two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitching remains an underlying cause when the Rangers
begin to stumble. The Athletics hammered Aaron Sele for six runs in
four innings on Friday and Mark Clark gave up five runs in five
innings yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Four came in the first inning when Clark gave up a two-run homer
to Jason Giambi and a two-run double to Mike Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is 0-2 with a 10.68 ERA in three starts for the Rangers,
and has yet to pitch past the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's frustrating,'' Clark said. ``Even though I gave up
four runs in the first inning, I thought I threw the ball better
than I did in my first two outings. But, on this ballclub, if you
go out and do your job and keep us in the game, with this offense
you're going to win a lot of ballgames. I haven't done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been one of my strengths over the past few years,
pitching deep into the game, the sixth, seventh and eighth inning.
I haven't done that here and it's frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Rangers' pitching problems can be traced to the
rotation. Rafael Palmeiro made it a 5-3 ballgame with a two-run
homer in the sixth off Oakland starter Jimmy Haynes, but the
Athletics scored three runs in the bottom of the inning against
reliever Mike Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada started the rally with a bunt hit past Munoz and
then Tony Phillips hit a roller down the first baseline. Munoz
started to let it go foul, then decided it wouldn't and tried to
make a play. Instead he threw wildly to first, allowing Tejada to
race to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have let that swinging bunt go foul,'' Munoz
said. ``Worst-case scenario is they have runners on first and
second, best-case scenario is it rolls foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The inning unraveled from there as Scott Spiezio doubled into
the left-field corner for two runs and scored on Giambi's single to
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the inning right there,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``We score two to get back in the game and in the bottom of the
sixth we give up three. That's a very important inning for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense rolled over after that as Haynes and
reliever Buddy Groom combined to retire the last nine hitters they
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys played us tough last year,'' third baseman Todd
Zeile said. ``They put a lot of runs up and for whatever reason, we
haven't countered with many.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy \RHaynes\S did a good job but I don't know how many
line outs we had. At the opposite end of the spectrum, they hit a
couple of balls off the end of the bat that fell in and some balls
that found some holes. Things are going right for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been sort of erratic for us,'' Zeile said. ``We
haven't been consistent, that's what you look for more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially after all the fun they had in Seattle.

DRAFT PICKS NOT BOLD, BUT FREE AGENTS LOOK QUITE SHARP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ With customary draft-day fluff and puff, Cowboys
coaches and hierarchy gave us their best ``we couldn't believe he
was still there'' song-and-dance yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just them. It happens every April for all NFL
clubs. The reality of October and November is often harsh on
rookies, but for this weekend each draft pick is a ``player.''
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, however, this particular draft was unlike any
other, because as coach Chan Gailey said yesterday, ``we had a good
draft before the draft even started.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the 1999 season is concerned, somebody named Ebenezer
Ekuban, somebody named Solomon Page, and a real somebody named Dat
Nguyen _ Dallas' 1-2-3 picks _ could have little if any impact on
success or failure. Although do watch that Nguyen kid.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey was making reference to the team's success in free
agency last week. The Cowboys are very proud, and rightfully so, of
a free-agency class that was completed when linebacker Quentin
Coryatt was added yesterday. He joins receiver Rocket Ismail and
center Mark Stepnoski. All three address immediate club needs.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones continued his ``win now'' mission, but did so with a
new plan _ this is by far Jones' boldest plunge into free agency.
</P>
<P>
   If it had only ended there yesterday _ with the draft and the
free agents. But also looming large over Valley Ranch was the Leon
Lett cloud. If another substance-abuse suspension is coming for
Lett, the defensive line is even more miserable than last season,
and last season was not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Jones has a personal credibility issue to settle.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't draft Randy Moss last April due to character flaws,
then you can't keep Leon Lett around Valley Ranch. No Moss. No
Lett.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking of song and dance, everyone connected with the
Cowboys was doing just that yesterday on the subject of Lett. A
suspension of some sort appears to be coming, but will it be four
games or a season?
</P>
<P>
   Jones was trying to distance himself yesterday from the Moss
case being compared to the Lett case. But it's a thin line for
Jerry to be grabbing a solid toe hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Moss was such a high-profile issue,'' he said of the '98
draft controversy. ``As an organization, we were much more under
the scope than we are now. I viewed it \Rthe decision not to draft
Moss\S as a test on whether I could avoid the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones wasn't comparing Moss to the devil, but instead, his own
temptation to draft him while in the midst of a
clean-up-the-Cowboys campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what the Cowboys think was a major off-season team
upgrade due to the free agents, could have been seriously
undermined by Lett and his wandering nose. And Jones will also have
this Moss double standard issue to battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys already had second-guessers galore yesterday,, but
those would have been on football talent issues, not credibility
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Their draft will be knocked for a lack of boldness, but repeated
attempts to trade up in the first round were stonewalled by teams
that didn't want to deal, or demanded a ransom of extra picks to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cowboys stuck to a take-the-best-player-available
philosophy. In the long run, that's usually the best way.
</P>
<P>
   But even the free-agency class is being questioned nationally _
not Stepnoski or Coryatt _ which leaves Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   For any local doubters on Rocket, my suggestion is this:
</P>
<P>
   Trust in Gailey, which also gives us the right to turn on Chan
if Ismail turns out to be the second coming of Anthony Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But at the position of wide receiver in the NFL, the benefit of
the doubt can be afforded Mr. Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Ernie Mills is one reason. And Patrick Jeffers, to name a
second effective receiver who came out of nowhere last season for
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And before that, Yancey Thigpen in Pittsburgh, along with Andre
Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   Judging Ismail's value is a tough read. Some teams with speed
receiver needs, such as the Dolphins, never gave him a sniff this
spring. Carolina, however, did want him back and was apparently
ready to match any money Jones offered.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rocket made it known he wanted to come to Dallas and be
a catcher for Troy Aikman, the Cowboys considered Ismail priority
No. 1 in free agency. This, of course, was based on the Gailey
factor in judging and developing receivers who have previously
underachieved, which certainly means Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Between the draft, the free agents and another Lett mess, it was
a busy Saturday at Valley Ranch. And until the Lett question is
answered, and until Rocket takes the field, it's impossible to say
if a better team did emerge, even if the football signals are
rather positive.

KRONE MAKING FAREWELL RIDE TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ At Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie today,
one superstar bids farewell to the winner's circle while another
tries to get back in it.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone will make what she insists is the final ride of her
legendary 18-year career when she takes the track with Desert Demon
in the $300,000 Lone Star Park Derby.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before that, Real Quiet will become the first Kentucky
Derby winner to compete at a Texas track when he runs in the
$250,000 Texas Mile under jockey Gary Stevens. The appearance of
the 4-year-old colt is an occasion, but he hasn't won since the
Preakness Stakes 11 months ago, recording two second-place
finishes, including a heartbreaking defeat by a nose in the Belmont
Stakes that cost him a Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The eventful afternoon _ which Lone Star general manager Corey
Johnsen has called the greatest in Texas racing history _ begins at
1:35 p.m. with the first of 11 live races.
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Star Derby will be televised on ESPN from 5-6 p.m. The
Texas Mile _ the state's first graded stakes _ can be seen on a
tape-delay on ESPN2 at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, 36, has refused recent interview requests. But at a news
conference in New York last week, she said she is retiring to
pursue other interests, including a college degree, and because of
the numerous injuries she has suffered in recent years. Her only
previous appearance at Lone Star was last June, when she finished
second to Shane Sellers in the, Krone had ridden 3,543 winners from
20,472 mounts and accumulated purse earnings of $81.1 million. Her
biggest victory was aboard Colonial Affair in the 1993 Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Real Quiet's most notorious defeat was in last
year's Belmont, when Victory Gallop and Stevens nipped him by a
nose to rob him of the $5 million bonus offered by Visa for a
Triple Crown sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet has run only once since then, finishing second by a
half-length to Precocity in the New Orleans Handicap on March 7.
Seven horses will face him in the Texas Mile, including
Littlebitlively, who defeated Anet to win last year's running. Like
Anet, Real Quiet is trained by Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens will be riding Real Quiet for the first time in a race,
although he has been on him in workouts. In Real Quiet's past eight
races, the mount belonged to Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's awesome,'' Stevens said. ``Having worked him a couple of
times, now I understand how fortunate I was to beat him in the
Belmont last year.''
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet wins today, Stevens says not to expect a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the colt's habit of ``fooling around'' when he
makes the lead too quickly, Stevens said, ``I'm going to be very
content to have a target in front of me until very deep in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Mercury, also trained by Baffert and ridden by Stevens, is
the early favorite in the Lone Star Derby. The 11/16 mile race is
run only two weeks prior to the Kentucky Derby and isn't a graded
stakes, so it is unlikely to produce a starter at Churchill Downs.

EKUBAN OVERCOMES INEXPERIENCE WITH ATHLETIC ABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ebenezer Ekuban did not start playing organized
football until his junior year in high school and has played just
21 games as a defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   This inexperience did not stop him from becoming, according to
many draft experts, the top-rated player at his position. And it
did not stop the Cowboys from taking the Ghana native with their
first pick in yesterday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man brings a speed dimension to the game,'' Cowboys
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``We've heard nothing from
anybody in the media other than we can't rush the passer. So now
we're going to give ourselves a chance to rush the passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the ``Ghana Piranha,'' Ekuban (6-foot-3, 281 pounds)
is an extremely athletic lineman with high intensity, according to
scouting services such as Mel Kiper Jr.'s and Ourlads', both of
whom rated Ekuban as the best defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting by a 4.63-second time in the 40-yard dash, he was
recruited by North Carolina to play tight end, but was moved to
defensive end before the start of the 1997 season by Mack Brown,
then the Tar Heels' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Ekuban was drafted by the Cowboys, Brown, now the
coach at Texas, called Ekuban at his father's home in Washington,
D.C., to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a proud day for him,'' Brown said. ``I told Ebenezer that
if he would switch to defensive end, he would play in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, who moved with his family from Ghana when he was 7,
caught six passes in two years as a Tar Heels tight end. He started
twice as a defensive end in 1997, and then had a breakout year in
1998, registering 96 tackles, including a school-record 23 behind
the line of scrimmage, seven sacks, and four pass deflections.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban wowed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January with his
athleticism and his speed as a pass rusher. In fact, Cowboys line
coach Jim Bates said Ekuban is faster off the corners than Greg
Ellis, the Cowboys' 1998 first-round pick who started in front of
Ekuban at North Carolina in 1997. Until he becomes a more
accomplished player, however, Ekuban will join the Cowboys as a
backup behind Ellis and Kavika Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come in here and he'll show what he can do, and his
playing time will be determined by how he shows,'' coach Chan
Gailey said of Ekuban. ``He's obviously going to be on the field
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ekuban: ``It was great playing with Greg, and I'm glad I
get to play with him again because he really helped me mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban is expected to be in Dallas today for a noon news
conference. As he packed his belongings before boarding team owner
Jerry Jones' private jet, Ekuban expressed his elation with his new
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few minutes before they drafted me, they called and said,
`Are you ready to have a star on your head?' '' Ekuban said. ``I
just couldn't believe it. I was excited. My family was jumping up
and yelling so loud that when the Cowboys called me, they couldn't
hear what I was saying.''

HOW CLINTON, DISTRACTED BY SCANDAL, ENTERED BALKAN WAR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS LEAD TAKE for rewrite and info about Tenet)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO and ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, President Clinton's top aides met in the Situation
Room in the White House basement to hear a fateful new plan for an
autonomous Kosovo from Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state.
NATO, she urged, should use the threat of air strikes on Yugoslavia
to force a peace agreement to be monitored by the alliance's ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who had other matters on his mind, was not there.
His lawyers were starting their arguments on the Senate floor
against his removal from office. That night, he was to deliver his
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5,000 miles away, in Belgrade, Gen. Wesley Clark, the
NATO commander, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, chairman of the NATO
military council, were sitting with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia. They came brandishing a plastic portfolio of color
photographs documenting a massacre of Albanians three days earlier
by Serbian security forces in the Kosovo town of Racak. They also
came with threats of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   This was far from their first encounter with the Serbian leader,
but this time, they recalled, they found a newly hardened man with
a bunker mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a massacre,'' Milosevic shouted. ``This was
staged. These people are terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clark warned him that NATO would ``start telling me to move
aircraft,'' Milosevic appeared infuriated by the prospect of
bombings. He called the general a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 19 is already seen as a pivotal day in the Clinton
presidency. But it may turn out to be so less for the Senate
impeachment hearings and State of the Union address than for the
moves toward war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo would have presented a daunting foreign policy challenge
even to a president whose powers of persuasion and moral authority
had not been damaged by a year of sex scandal and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the president's decisions on Kosovo would
have been any different if he had not been distracted by his own
political and legal problems. But it is clear that his troubles
gave him less maneuvering room to make his decisions. Diplomacy
that came to rely heavily on military threats reduced the wiggle
room even further.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous year, sharp criticism and questioning of
Clinton's motives arose each time he did take military action, as
with the strikes in December against Iraq when the House was poised
to vote on his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton is facing mounting criticism for not having acted
earlier or more decisively on Kosovo. His critics say that had he
done so, Milosevic would not have been able to move troops and
equipment into Kosovo and carry out the massive ``ethnic
cleansing'' of the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the president viewed the situation, there were only ``a bunch
of bad options'' confronting him, he said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the NATO allies hoped, even assumed, that they were
dealing with the Milosevic who negotiated the Bosnian peace at
Dayton, Ohio, the man who lied and manipulated and ranted in
all-night, Scotch-laden negotiations and then cut a deal in the
morning when he saw that it was in his interest. Instead, they were
dealing with the Milosevic of Belgrade, who was willing to employ
mass murder to assure his continued dominance of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, predicted in
congressional testimony in February that there would be a major
spring offensive by the Serbs in Kosovo and huge refugee flows. But
intelligence assessments presented to Clinton about how Milosevic
would respond to NATO threats of military force were vague. These
reports included speculation that the Yugoslav leader would back
down in the face of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   One interagency intelligence report coordinated by the CIA in
January 1999, for example, concluded that ``Milosevic doesn't want
a war he can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After enough of a defense to sustain his honor and assuage his
backers, he will quickly sue for peace,'' the assessment went on.
Another interagency report in February stated: ``He doesn't believe
NATO is going to bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by such assessments and his advisers, the president
pressed ahead with a strategy of threats coupled with negotiations,
gambling that Milosevic would back down. These threats quickly
became a test of NATO's credibility, with the added onus of the
alliance's looming 50th anniversary, which is to be observed next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, former Sen. Bob Dole went to Kosovo to gather
facts for an international refugee group of which he is chairman.
On his return, he reported his findings to Clinton. Afterward,
Clinton sat with him alone in the Oval Office and asked for his
help in lobbying his former Senate colleagues to vote against
conviction in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dole said he thought ``a lot of attention was
diverted'' from Yugoslavia and other foreign policy issues by the
impeachment. It was ``all consuming,'' he added, and Kosovo ``may
have been one of the casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Yugoslavia fell apart in 1991, Kosovo _ with its
90 percent ethnic Albanian population, and a Serbian minority that
held its land sacred _ was viewed as a place from which a wider war
could erupt. The Bush administration, which had adopted a hands-off
policy on the killings in Croatia and Bosnia, warned Milosevic on
Dec. 29, 1992, that the United States was prepared to take
unilateral military action if the Serbs sparked a conflict in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration reiterated the warning weeks after
the inauguration. Three years later, when the administration
convened the conference in Dayton to end the Bosnia war, Kosovo was
not on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia was then the emergency, and it had to be stopped,''
said Richard Holbrooke, the American envoy who negotiated the
agreement at Dayton, in an interview. ``Otherwise, there would have
been a real risk that Bosnia would merge with Kosovo into a huge
firestorm that would destabilize the whole region.'' Over the next
two years, younger, more confrontational ethnic Albanians began to
build a ragtag army, supplied with weapons from neighboring Albania
and financed largely by the Albanian diaspora in Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   They faced serious obstacles. Milosevic, who had risen to power
on the cause of protecting Kosovo's minority Serbs, took away
Kosovo's broad autonomy in 1989 and was unlikely to give it back
without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The killing in Kosovo began in earnest in February 1998, when
the Serbs retaliated for rebel attacks on policemen with brutal
operations of their own in the Drenica area. Members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and their families were slain.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sent Robert Gelbard, its envoy to the region,
to confront Milosevic with horrific photographs of death and
mutilation. A veteran State Department official respected for his
tenacity but known for his temper, Gelbard had experience in Bosnia
and Croatia. But he did not have much of a personal relationship
with the Serbian leader, whom he castigated in unusually blunt
language.
</P>
<P>
   End new lead. Pick up 2NDTAKE, beginning: The Drenica killings,
x x x, and continue as sent.

JETS USE THEIR 2 PICKS TO TRY TO STRENGTHEN OFFENSIVE LINE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets twiddled their thumbs for almost
eight hours in Saturday's draft _ their first pick was the 57th
over all, late in the second round _ but discovered when it was
their turn that their most highly rated guard was still available.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' choice was Randy Thomas of Mississippi State, a
6-foot-3-inch, 306-pounder, and Coach Bill Parcells immediately
said that he would try Thomas at right guard. And with their next
pick, in the third round at No. 90 over all, the Jets picked
another lineman they will try at guard, David Loverne, who played
left tackle at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was the first pure guard chosen in the draft. Guard was
the position where the Jets had a sudden great need because they do
not have a starter at either spot. They recently cut Todd Burger
and are proceeding as if the free-agent right guard Matt O'Dwyer
will not return.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells described Thomas, who did not play organized football
until 10th grade, as more gifted athletically than the other highly
rated guards, Doug Brzezinski of Boston College and Brandon
Burlsworth of Arkansas. Their technique is considered better than
Thomas', who was a junior college transfer and played two seasons
at Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletically, he's far superior to them,'' said Parcells, who
lauded Thomas' ability to pull. ``He plays as if he knows what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Loverne, who is 6-2{ and 292 pounds, will be shifted to left
guard. He is considered highly athletic and a solid pass protector.
``I'm pretty sure he'll compete strongly for this job,'' Parcells
said. ``Every time he was challenged, he responded.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the lowest the Jets have taken their first pick of the
draft _ one notch below last year, when they chose defensive
lineman Dorian Boose at No. 56. The Jets lost this year's
first-round selection as part of reparations to the Patriots in the
deal that made Parcells the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the Steelers, who had the 59th pick, had been eager
to draft him, keeping him on the telephone during the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited and waited, thinking about New York,'' Thomas said.
``Then I said: `I guess I'll be a Jet. I guess I'm at home now.'
They needed a right guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said: ``You never know where an offensive lineman is
going to fit in. You know athletically he has the ability to fit
in. We need to find out where he is technically. Hopefully, he'll
be far enough long to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   One draft publication, GM jr, described Thomas as ``among the
best athletes of all the offensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have had mixed success with Parcells' first two Jets
drafts, in which Dick Haley played the lead role in organizing the
selections. Of their 23 picks, 14 remain with the club. One is a
starter on offense _ last year's fourth-round pick, tackle Jason
Fabini _ and one on defense _ lineman Jason Ferguson, the last pick
of the Jets' 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Leon Johnson, one of the best third-down backs
and kick returners in recent Jets history, and Dedric Ward, the
deep threat receiver and kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker James Farrior, Parcells' first pick in his first
draft in 1997, was demoted to a backup last year. And free safety
Kevin Williams, who began last season as a rookie starter, was also
benched and will now try playing cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Two players who missed last year with injuries will get serious
looks this summer: linebacker Casey Dailey and defensive lineman
Terry Day. Doug Karczewski, a rookie guard last season, may be
given a shot at starting.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

LINCOLN LOVERS LINK UP AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Illinois may be the Land of Lincoln, but the
spirit of the nation's 16th president was alive and well Saturday
in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, where the Association of
Lincoln Presenters held its annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   They were quite a sight as they traveled around the city in a
yellow school bus, 33 grown men dressed in stovepipe hats and black
tails, and sporting scraggly beards but no moustache.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't just dress like Lincoln, they think they
!ital!are!off! Lincoln,'' said H.M. Wammack, a Glendale, Calif.,
man who was thrilled to be acting as the local host for the fifth
annual event.
</P>
<P>
   The convention included a banquet at the Burbank Hilton on
Friday night, a Mary Todd Lincoln morning tea for the Lincoln wives
on Saturday and a visit to the Court of Liberty at Forest Lawn
Memorial-Park, Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincolns come from all over the nation and from all walks of
life. Among the group there is a Christmas tree farmer, a life
insurance salesman, a dentist, a trucker, an English teacher, a
social worker and an appliance dealer. What they all have in common
is a genuine love of Lincoln and of getting together with other
Lincoln presenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about admiration for Lincoln and a recognition that he is
America's finest person,'' said the group's president, Dan Bassuk,
of White House, N.J. Bassuk founded the group in 1991 and is
credited with first ``linking up the Lincolns.'' &UR;  &LR; The group has a
national membership of 113 Lincolns and 30 Mary Todd Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincolns at the convention were all complete hams, each
jockeying to show off his Lincoln skills and aggressively handing
out business cards. While some perform as Lincoln for free, most
charge an appearance fee ranging from as low as $50 to $600 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Although the convention is not cutthroat like an annual Lincoln
look-alike contest in Kentucky, there was definitely an
undercurrent of competitiveness among the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real one,'' insisted Jim Rubin of Prosperity, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to prove his authenticity, Rubin took off his top
hat and claimed that a mark behind his left ear is actually a
bullet wound that has completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else can show you the hole in the head,'' Rubin said.
``I was shot, but I'm OK. Don't worry about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Abe Clymer of Vandalia, Ill., has been portraying Lincoln since
he was recruited to play the 16th president in a high school play
because he looked so much like him. His real first name is Louis,
but ever since then he's been ``Abe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gone by Louis for 50 years,'' Clymer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has visited about 23 schools since Feb. 1 of this year.
The high season for Lincoln presenters surrounds the Presidents Day
holiday, although many work throughout the year at Civil War
re-enactments and for history groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``School these days is too much about computers. As Lincoln, you
bring history alive, and the schoolchildren learn from you,'' said
Rubin, 67. ``If you keep a second-grader's attention for 20
minutes, somebody has got to give you a pat on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other Lincolns, Rubin said he got started
because so many people remarked to him that he resembled the
president. Rubin, who came in third place in a 1998 look-alike
contest, said he comes to the convention to pick up tips from the
other Lincolns and to spend time with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learn from each other,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey resident Gordon Vincent taught dentistry for 47 years
before retiring and becoming a Lincoln presenter. He is in high
demand not only at schools, but among women's clubs, historical
societies, civic groups and Republican organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one extreme, there's the women's clubs who just want to be
entertained. They don't care if you're Lincoln or Gypsy Rose Lee,''
Vincent said. ``Then there are the history groups that are really
into Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   To him it makes perfect sense to get together each year in a
different location across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, the reason all these men are good
people is because Lincoln was a good person,'' Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   Wammack, the Glendale resident, is a life insurance salesman who
each year around Presidents Day spends his time presenting Lincoln
to local schoolchildren at the Court of Liberty at Forest Lawn's
cemetery in the Hollywood Hills above Burbank. After Forest Lawn
officials heard Wammack had given a reading of a Lincoln speech at
a Kiwanis Club meeting, they recruited him to portray Lincoln at
their Court of Liberty events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there, and they told me the head of cosmetology at
Forest Lawn was going to make me up, but unlike most people I was
still standing up rather than lying down,'' Wammack said.
</P>
<P>
   John Kendall, a substitute teacher from Laguna Hills, first was
Lincoln at Halloween and later agreed to appear as Lincoln for his
daughter's kindergarten class.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really thought I was Lincoln,'' said Kendall, who at 44
was one of the younger Lincolns in attendance. ``Then the other
teachers asked me to do it for their classes. My wife and I
thought, hey, maybe we have something here. I've been in business
ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln is the most often portrayed U.S. president, but Kendall
said it's not just because he gave memorable speeches or was such a
great leader.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Vincent of Santa Rosa came to the convention as the
plainclothes companion of her husband, a Lincoln presenter named
Roger Vincent. Regardless of whether you dress like Mary Todd
Lincoln or not, February is quite a month for a Lincoln presenter's
wife because of all the work surrounding Presidents Day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In February, we are all married to a different man,'' Vincent
said. ``In February, it's hard to tell Roger Vincent from the Roger
Vincent playing Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Peck of San Diego was a plainclothes Lincoln presenter's
wife for years before she finally relented and started presenting
the first lady alongside her husband, William.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to go to period ball, and of course I wasn't going
to let him go with any of those other hussies,'' Peck said, partly
in character.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's a true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is the original Lincoln,'' Peck said. ``The others
are just impostors.''
