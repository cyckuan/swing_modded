A'S SUCCESSFUL AT FINDING GEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's absolutely no secret that small-market franchises must be
creative if they are to try to compete with the big-spenders, who
readily dole out wads of cash to lure big-name free agents to their
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Need a solid outfielder capable of driving in 100 runs and
hitting 25 home runs? No problem if you're the Atlanta Braves.
Simply agree to pay  &UR; Brian Jordan $40 million for five years, and
he's yours. A first baseman comes on the market, and you need one.
If you're the Anaheim Angels, you shell out $80 million and voila!
 &UR; Mo Vaughn magically appears.
</P>
<P>
   But those scenarios are little more than a fantasy for the
majority of clubs. For some general managers, getting a date with
Selma Hayek might occur before they can spend that kind of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But out in Oakland, the Athletics have taken a different
approach to finding missing cogs. The Athletics have been among the
trendsetters when it comes to sifting through the six-year free
agent pale and finding hidden gems.
</P>
<P>
   Once a player has put in six professional seasons (even at the
minor league level), he is eligible to become a free agent. The A's
have definitely discovered very usable refuse that other
organizations had no use for.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, whose $23 million payroll this season ranks 27th out of
30 clubs, was on the six-year free agent bandwagon well before most
others were as deeply involved in the practice. The A's have reaped
the benefits, finding such capable big leaguers as designated
hitter
 &UR; Geronimo Berroa, outfielder  &UR; Matt Stairs, third baseman  &UR; Olmedo
Saenz, shortstop  &UR; Rafael Bournigal, and pitchers  &UR; Billy Taylor,
 &UR; Gil Heredia,
 &UR; Mike Oquist and  &UR; Buddy Groom.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound more like a trash list of players, but ask around
the majors and few would not applaud the finds Oakland has made
while dredging through the list of six-year minor league free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   In Stairs, the A's found someone capable of hitting 26 home runs
and driving in 89 runs per season, which Stairs has averaged the
past two season. Already, he had 14 home runs and 42 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Berroa, no longer with the A's, averaged 28 home runs and 93
RBIs over a three-year span from 1995-'97. Taylor, the A's closer
who spent 14 seasons in the minors before making his big-league
debut at age 32 in 1994, saved 73 games the past three years and
already has 16 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our lifeblood,'' said General Manager  &UR; Billy Beane,
considered one of the brightest up-and-coming minds in the game.
``It's the only area where we can compete with other clubs, where
finances aren't the rule of thumb because we're all paying around
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes comes down to evaluation and opportunity. We think we
can evaluate with other people in the league. We definitely think
we've got a good group of scouts and baseball people and take pride
in that one area of finding the six-year minor leaguers. It's our
form of guerilla warfare.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
One season after finishing in last place in their division, the
Diamondbacks find themselves in first place in the NL West. Only
five times in the history of the game has a club finished in last
place one season and first the next. Who are they? A hint, all five
accomplished the feat during the 1990s. &QL; 
A New York state of mind &QL; 
In a scene directly from ``X-Files,'' the two New York clubs seem
to have magically been transposed at some point.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees, known for decades as the Bronx Zoo, where
problems arise from virtually nothing, seem at peace with each
other and Boss  &UR; George Steinbrenner, the same cannot be said for
the club that plays across the Triboro Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have taken on the look of the Queens Asylum, where
anything can happen at any moment. It all started 10 days ago when
it was learned that Mets outfielders  &UR; Bobby Bonilla and  &UR; Brian
McRae were each placed on irrevocable waivers, meaning that if they
were claimed, the Mets would lose them for just the $20,000 waiver
price.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, three coaches were fired, including the innocent
bullpen coach,  &UR; Randy Niemann. Two days later, Manager  &UR; Bobby
Valentine goes on the Mets radio broadcast and blasts a pair of New
York baseball writers, accusing them of working together, a strong
no-no among competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Valentine tells Bonilla he was going to begin
using a four-man outfield rotation and that he was not one of the
four. Bonilla then made himself unavailable to pinch-hit the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rest the next day (we're now up to Wednesday if
you're trying to keep up) when Valentine and one of the reporters
got into a heated argument in the dugout before a game, loudly
calling each other liars.
</P>
<P>
   That same afternoon, Valentine and Bonilla started screaming at
each other in the dugout, with Valentine telling Bonilla he would
``rather have one of my coaches play the outfield,'' after Bonilla
volunteered for the duty. Bonilla refused to take batting practice
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Valentine was ejected from Wednesday night's game but
managed to re-appear in the dugout wearing some cheesy disguise
that included a fake mustache, a fake hat and a hat. The NL
suspended him for two games and fined him $5,000 for that one.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, though, the Mets snapped an eight-game losing
streak and entered their weekend series against Boston riding a
four-game winning streak. Go figure. &QL; 
Soup's on &QL; 
His career didn't quite pan out the way he envisioned while with
the Diamondbacks, but former starter  &UR; Jeff Suppan seems to have
found a nice home in Kansas City, where his 3.32 ERA ranks
secondbest among Royals starters and sixth-best in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan was bounced out of Boston, his original club, when the
Red Sox exposed him in the expansion draft. The Diamondbacks
selected Suppan with their second pick (the third overall) in
November 1997 and immediately placed him in their original
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players today, you're going to be moving around,'' Suppan
said. ``As a young player, in your first organization, you think
you're going to be with them forever. But every step along the way
has helped me out, and I'm grateful these teams have given me an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suppan seemed to have trouble adjusting to life in the
National League, where fastball pitchers thrive and those who rely
mostly on breaking balls don't. Suppan won only once for Arizona
and eventually was shipped to Triple-A Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan may have a 3-4 record, but he has managed to cut down on
his walks significantly, issuing 21 in 78 innings. He has become a
dependable member of Kansas City's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt like Soupy was my dark horse,'' Royals
Manager
 &UR; Tony Muser said. ``I liked him when we had him last year in
September. I felt he had good mound presence. I felt he had a good
arm.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
The 1991 Atlanta Braves and Minnesota Twins began a trend that has
some purists' stomachs turning in all sorts of directions. Two
years later, in 1993, Philadelphia also turned the trick. The 1997
San Francisco Giants followed suit, and last year San Diego did the
same. Incidently, the Padres finished in first place in 1996, last
in '97, first in '98 and currently are last in '99. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; It's all about having fun, and that's what they doing in
 &UR; Cheeseville: With Miller Park set to open next spring in Milwaukee,
the Brewers discovered they will have about 300 obstructed-view
seats in the upper deck behind home plate because of the mechanical
pivot needed to open and close the roof. They will sell for $1 the
day of games and are called, ``Uecker Seats,'' honoring longtime
broadcaster
 &UR; Bob Uecker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Further unmasking of Mr. Turn It On For The TV
 &UR; cameras: Now that  &UR; Pedro Martinez is 11-2 with a 2.16 ERA, let's
remember that it was  &UR; Tommy Lasorda who insisted to Dodgers
executives that Martinez never could be a successful starter in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Wilbur Wood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That's it! No more 90210 re-runs: Florida pitcher
 &UR; Alex Fernandez, who is limited to around 80 pitches per start while
he recovers from rotator cuff surgery, was so frustrated after his
last outing that he fired a weighted batting donut through one of
the four TVs in the Marlins clubhouse. Total bill: Around $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And while you're at it, stop calling at dinner time
 &UR; every night: Not to be outdone, Oakland's  &UR; Kenny Rogers ripped out
a pair of phones out of the wall in the visitors clubhouse at 3Com
Park last week and did a little more damage on his way out. Total
bill: $1,700. To which Rogers said, ``I'll get my own estimate.'' &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
While Seattle's  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. and Tampa Bay's  &UR; Jose Canseco wage
a battle for the majors' home run lead, a more interesting race is
taking shape within Seattle's ranks, where Griffey had 23 home runs
entering the weekend series and pitcher  &UR; Jeff Fassero had allowed
23 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see San Diego owner
 &UR; John Moores in the Valley very soon. The 1998 National League
championship ring for current Diamondbacks center fielder  &UR; Steve
Finley is in Moores' possession, and he plans to personally deliver
it to Finley, a close friend. Moores will do the same for  &UR; Ken
Caminiti, now with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Believing he was going to return to his 1997 ways,
 &UR; Willie Blair was tickled when he returned to Detroit over the
winter. He now has been banished from the rotation to long relief,
where he served up home runs to Pittsburgh's  &UR; Jose Guillen and
 &UR; Brant Brown in the same outing. The two had combined for one home
run in their previous 209 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   After 1,138 games in the American League without ever being
ejected, Texas right fielder  &UR; Juan Gonzalez was ejected for arguing
home plate umpire  &UR; Wally Bell's strike zone during an interleague
game last week. Bell is an NL umpire. It was Gonzalez's 21st
interleague game.
</P>
<P>
   Now that one-third of the season is behind us, let's re-examine
Houston's trade with Seattle last summer for  &UR; Randy Johnson.
Johnson is 8-2 for the Diamondbacks and looks like he has returned
to being the most dominant pitcher in the game. The duo of  &UR; Freddie
Garcia and  &UR; John Halama entered the weekend a combined 11-4. It
appears only Houston lost out on this deal.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 27 smallest crowds in the 339-game history of Coors
Field, 16 of them have been this season, and the Colorado Rockies
have 57 more home dates to be played. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Cleveland, which never has been shy to sign pitchers who seem all
but done to help provide depth, is kicking around the idea of going
after  &UR; Tom Candiotti, who was designated for assignment by Oakland
last week. The Indians, though, will wait until Candiotti comes
cheaper, after the 10-day waiver period ends.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, which is struggling worse than anyone in the majors,
is ready to listen to offers for starter  &UR; Scott Erickson, who was
1-8 entering the weekend. Count Philadelphia among the more
interested parties in this one. Money, however, might be an
obstacle. Erickson signed a five-year, $35 million deal over the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, with a sudden surplus in money since
 &UR; Jeff King's surprise retirement, may no longer be actively shopping
 &UR; Kevin Appier (although they will continue to listen to offers). In
addition, the Royals actually may be in the market for a first
baseman, preferably one with strong defensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego and Seattle talked last week about the possibility of
the Padres sending  &UR; Donne Wall or  &UR; Dan Micelli to the Mariners.
Seattle continues to look for bullpen help. San Diego is willing to
listen to an offer for at least one of the two middle relievers.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Detroit right-hander  &UR; Seth
 &UR; Greisinger, out all season because of an elbow injury, is leaning
toward finally accepting surgery to repair his problem. Greisinger,
who awed hitters last year, may decide by Monday. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandLookie, here: &UR; Steve Karsay has emerged as the Tribe's
best pitcher.  &QL; 
2. AtlantaEven with some problems, the Braves remain the class of
the NL.  &QL; 
3. TexasThe Power Rangers are hitting, but it's the pitching
carrying these boys.  &QL; 
4. Houston &UR; Jeff Bagwell in Chicago (AL and NL): Six HRs, 14 RBIs in
five games.  &QL; 
5. NY YankeesCame into the weekend with a losing record in their
previous 27 games.  &QL; 
6. BostonWatched its AL East lead evaporate as  &UR; Pedro Martinez got
hammered.  &QL; 
7. Chicago Cubs &UR; Rick Aguilera may get closer's money, but
 &UR; Terry &UR; Adams has the title.  &QL; 
8. ArizonaIf the D-Backs are going to be taken seriously, they must
fix the bullpen.  &QL; 
9. San FranciscoThe sleeping Giants just got back their best
player,  &UR; Barry Bonds. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. BaltimoreFurther proof that throwing money at problems isn't a
cure-all.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaTwins are 1-7 on Sundays. They're 20-30 the rest of
the week.  &QL; 
28. MontrealBeat up on former Expo  &UR; Pedro Martinez in the worst
way.  &QL; 
27. FloridaMarlins entered the weekend with a 17-15 record since
May 6.  &QL; 
26. Kansas CityIf only Royals hitters could face St. Louis'
pitching all the time.  &QL; 
25. Tampa Bay &UR; Wilson Alvarez ripped off his jersey and stomped on
it . . . in the dugout.  &QL; 
24. San DiegoPadres remain the only club without a three-game
winning streak.  &QL; 
23. MilwaukeeThe locals are calling for Manager  &UR; Phil Garner to be
dumped. He may be.  &QL; 
22. Toronto &UR; Jim Fregosi and  &UR; Carlos Delgado have a small feud going
over leadership. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Cincinnati Reds: The Reds' longest trip in 10 years resulted in a
9-3 record. While the four-city trip took them through Florida, a
then-struggling New York Mets club, Kansas City and Minnesota
shouldn't matter because victories still count. More amazing, the
Reds are doing their damage out of the bullpen. Starters are
averaging just under 5 innings per outing, the lowest mark in the
NL. The bullpen's 15 victories are tied for the most with Texas and
the Cubs. In their last 35 games entering the weekend series
against Cleveland, Reds relievers were a combined 12-0 with 10
saves in 12 chances. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Los Angeles Dodgers: Our favorite whipping boys (although the
Orioles are a close second) continue to underachieve. ``This team
should not be a .500 ballclub,'' said injured shortstop  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Grudzielanek, who broke his right hand on June 1 when he punched a
wall out of frustration. ``On paper, I think we're one of the best
teams around, hands down.'' Of course, it takes action, not paper
to compete for a playoff spot and the Dodgers aren't very good at
holding up that end of the bargain. Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson has
managed to lift topsy-turvy clubs before, as evidenced with the
Mets and Orioles. Is he capable of doing it again? &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
The San Diego Padres called up infielder  &UR; David Newhan from their
Triple-A affiliate in Las Vegas last week. Upon his arrival, Newhan
was asked if he had any idea that he was going to be summoned.
``You read stuff in the papers, but you can't trust what those guys
write,'' he said. Newhan's father is  &UR; Ross Newhan, longtime
baseball columnist for the ``Los Angeles Times.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Pittsburgh's  &UR; Mike Williams was little more than a journeyman two
years ago. Now he has become one of the most reliable closers in
the majors. While he does not possess the 95 mph fastball that most
officials want for their closer, Williams does have a wicked slider
that paralyzes batters. ``I don't even really consider myself a
closer,'' Williams said. ``I just happen to be the guy who is being
asked to get some outs in the ninth inning. Fortunately,
(Manager) &UR; Gene Lamont keeps asking me to do the job and I keep
getting it done.'' Maybe so, but Williams, according to several
scouts, is the real thing. &QL;

PUNCHLESS RED SOX TAKE IT ON THE CHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He struck out twice in a game for only the third time
this season, after striking out just seven times in his previous 23
games.
</P>
<P>
   He hit into a double play for just the fifth time this season.
And it was the first time in 1999 he's whiffed and hit into a
double play in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   By anyone's criteria, it was a lousy afternoon. By the exacting
standards Nomar Garciaparra has set for himself, it was a
five-alarm fire, a nationally televised exercise in futility that
mocked the promotional print ad the Fox Network ran before this 4-2
loss to &UR;  &LR; the Mets, one in which Garciaparra's face was superimposed
on the body of a prizefighter exchanging punches with Mets slugger
Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, while Garciaparra and the rest of the struggling
Boston hitters (.211 average and 28 runs in 10 games this month)
offered little more than a baseball version of the rope-a-dope, the
Mets threw all the body punches in sending the Sox to their sixth
loss in seven games and seventh in their last nine. Solo home runs
by Benny ``And The Mets'' Agbayani and Robin Ventura off Sox
starter Pat Rapp and another by John Olerud off reliever Mark
Guthrie accounted for three of their runs.
</P>
<P>
   When Garciaparra falters, especially the day after he had just
one infield hit in six at-bats against the Mets, the inclination is
to search for a cause-and-effect explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt? Nope, at least nothing beyond the aches that are part of
his daily routine, and certainly nothing as obvious as the strained
groin and bad knee with which John Valentin is trying to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tired? Wouldn't be surprised, manager Jimy Williams said, given
that (1) it takes an act of God to keep Garciaparra out of the
lineup, and (2) the Sox were back at the ballpark Saturday morning
about 10 hours after winning in 12 innings the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired? Yeah, I'm tired, but it's part of the game,'' said
Garciaparra, who has just three hits in his last 17 at-bats, has
not homered in his last 11 games, and has just three RBIs in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never ask (for a day off). I don't make that decision. I
prepare myself day in and day out to play. It's my job to get ready
to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox didn't advance a runner to second base until the sixth
inning, and then only because Mets starter Al Leiter made a bad
throw on an easy force play.
</P>
<P>
   Only once all afternoon did they have more than one hit in an
inning. That was in the seventh, when Troy O'Leary had their only
extra-base hit, a double sandwiched between singles by Damon Buford
and Creighton Gubanich, and the Sox scored both of their runs to
draw within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis then worked Leiter for a full-count walk, but Jason
Varitek, pinch hitting for Rapp, popped out weakly on a
``foshball,'' a pitch Leiter has only recently taken to throwing,
one he describes as a batting-practice fastball that throws
righthanded hitters off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman walked and stole second with Garciaparra at the
plate in the eighth, but Mets reliever Armando Benitez fanned
Garciaparra with a split-fingered fastball and Mike Stanley flied
to left.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud took Guthrie deep in the bottom of the inning to make it
4-2. O'Leary hit a broken-bat single with one out in the ninth, but
Mets closer John Franco, beaten by the Sox Friday, closed them out
for his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra shook his head when asked if he were trying to do
too much in the absence of any sustained attack by the rest of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling myself,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to get
some hits, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on myself, battling myself to feel comfortable. I
hit a couple hard, but right at people. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   A reshuffling of the lineup isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hit the pitcher eighth, I'm not going to do
that,'' said Williams, invoking the strategy employed on occasion
by Cardinals manager Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just keep playing hard, and good things are going to
happen. We get pitching like that, we're going to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who beat Franco with a single Friday in the 12th but
has just one RBI in eight games, also suggested the Sox can't dwell
on their recent failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have short memories,'' he said. ``That's the only
way to do it.''

TYPICAL NEW YORK NIGHTMARE FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gotham always has been tough on the Red Sox. Boston
baseball horrors in Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium are part of
hardball lore, and this weekend the Sox have endured new pain and
torture.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen had a team party on Long Island Thursday and
sustained a five-stitch cut on his foot that put him back on the
disabled list. On Friday, ace closer Flash Gordon may have blown
out his pitching elbow on the Shea mound. Saturday, Boston's popgun
attack produced almost nothing in a 4-2 loss to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   In the losers' locker room Saturday afternoon, someone asked Sox
first baseman Mike Stanley if he needed anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tourniquet,'' said Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo. Time to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Let's try not to be negative. Take a look at the non-first-place
teams in the American League and it's easy to project the
pitching-propelled Red Sox ahead of Seattle, Chicago, Oakland,
Anaheim, and Toronto for the coveted wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, it's also easy to see that the Sox need help.
This week of National League ball has seen them lose their
three-week grip on the top rung of the AL East. They have lost six
of seven and Sunday they'll trot out Mark Portugal, followed by Jin
Ho Cho Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The slow bleed has seen them lose Juan Pena, Saberhagen, and
Gordon (soon) to the disabled list. There is no way to minimize the
seriousness of the Gordon situation. If he has ripped his pitching
elbow, go ahead and make those plans for October. In the meantime,
Tim Wakefield is the new closer, which only further dents the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Remember three and four weeks ago when the Sox seemed to have
too much pitching? Fans wondered, ``What are we gonna do with all
these starters? Maybe we should trade a couple for a power
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, right now, in the spirit of ``Spahn and Sain and two days
of rain,'' the Sox are looking at ``Pedro and Rose and . . . who
knows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as too much pitching,'' said Sox
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``We're just fortunate that we're
15-16 deep. Every spring we tell them all that if they don't come
north as one of the first 11 pitchers, they'll have plenty of
chances during the season. And it always works out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the hitting, not the pitching, that is killing the Red
Sox. Saturday's lineup featured a five-through-nine murderers row
of Damon Buford, Troy O'Leary, Creighton Gubanich, Darren Lewis,
and Pat Rapp. The Sox have hit only 57 homers, which puts them 12th
in the American League. Make sure to bring those ``Mo Who?''
T-shirts to Fenway Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep swinging, keep playing,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``What can I do? Hell, I couldn't hit when I played. I'm not going
to hit the pitcher eighth. We hit some balls good today that were
caught. If we keep playing like that, we're going to win some
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, a veteran of slumps past, said, ``That's the good thing
about Jimy. He keeps things positive. We need to stay as positive
as we can in light of what's going on. We just got our butts kicked
in Montreal, but he keeps us positive about the things that we're
doing right. For a while we were scoring runs and getting the big
hit with runners in scoring position. Now we're struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin and Darren Lewis are at .257. Trot Nixon is
hitting .226 and has 12 RBIs in 137 at-bats. Jason Varitek is at
.241. Jose Offerman has cooled off, and even Nomar Garciaparra (3
for 17) is suddenly struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to score runs as it is,'' said Lewis, another
veteran. ``But now when we do hit the ball hard it seems like it's
going at someone or they're making spectacular plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimywocky must have been afraid to turn his guys loose on the
town Saturday night. The city that doesn't sleep is a madhouse this
weekend. The Knicks have taken over the Apple, and the manager of
the Mets appears to be losing his mind. (Come to think of it, when
Bobby ``Master of Disguise'' Valentine serves his two-game
suspension, how will we know he's not really in the dugout? Maybe
next time he'll put on blackface and pretend he's Mookie Wilson.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Mookie, here's one last nugget from New York. On
Thursday, the same day Saberhagen was walking on busted glass at a
team party, Bill Buckner and Mookie did a signing at the Roosevelt
Field Shopping Center in Garden City, N.Y. For $25 you could get
Bill and Mookie to sign a photo of the infamous grounder. The photo
is dubbed, ``The boot,'' and the newspaper ad touted this item as a
``Great Gift for Father's Day!''
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. Blood on the floor of the Saberhagen mansion. Flash flown
home for an MRI. No power. A raft of disabled pitchers. And
baseball's apocalyptic error selling as a Father's Day item.
</P>
<P>
   Only in New York. Can we all please leave now?

CHANCES SLIM THAT ARMSTRONG WILL SLIP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Everybody here has been talking about the
newest Patriot, a 295-pound left tackle. Pete Carroll talks about
him. Bobby Grier talks about him. Players talk about him. I don't
blame any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Some rotund tackles don't surprise you when they say, ``I'm an
offensive lineman.'' Well, you should see the new guy. He's got
that Muscle Magazine cover boy look about him. He was wearing a
T-shirt Saturday. His chest bulged out of the thing so much that
you swore there were steel drums hidden beneath his skin. The new
guy looks good.
</P>
<P>
   Foxboro Stadium is no different from most offices and schools in
the country: The new employee or student comes and the gossip
starts. Same here. The gossip _ not at all mean-spirited _ has been
about the new man's weight. How much has he lost?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say 10, some say 25, some say 50,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's the truth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man's name is Bruce Armstrong. He is 33 years old. He plays
left tackle, the NFL's Secret Service position. The quarterback is
the president and the left tackle, usually protecting his
blindside, has got to see what the QB doesn't. That's what the new
guy, Armstrong, will have to do this season when he protects Drew
Bledsoe and . . .
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You say Armstrong is not new? You haven't been
paying attention to the Patriots and their weekend minicamp. It's
not often that a photograph causes me to do a triple take, but
that's exactly what I did when I saw Armstrong in Saturday's Globe.
I stared at it for several seconds wondering, ``Is that really
him?'' And then I had to drive here to see the new guy for myself.
I'm not saying that he looked bad last year, but he certainly
didn't look like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always lifted weights like a football player,'' Armstrong
explained. So when he went home to Alpharetta, Ga., he decided to
change the plan that had worked for more than 10 years. ``I lifted
weights like I was a bodybuilder.''
</P>
<P>
   It obviously worked. That's why the gossip is in place.
Armstrong looks as if he had a makeover. One of the changes he made
as Armstrong The Bodybuilder was to increase the repetitions in his
weightlifting. It's the repetitions that bring about the muscle
tone. As for Armstrong The Football Player, last season was one in
which people said things about him that he has rarely heard in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells once said that football is not cumbersome for
Armstrong because he ``gets it.'' He is one of the most intelligent
men on the team and has been one of its most eloquent spokesmen
since coming into the league in 1987. But last season there were
whispers that he looked old. There was talk that he needed to be
moved to the right side of the line to make room for a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the talk seemed to ignore the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played hurt last year,'' Carroll said. ``Remember? He had
that big, plastic cast on his leg. There was that whole controversy
in training camp on whether he should play or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong played with a stress fracture for all 16 games. He
also was bothered by a pulled groin. Because of his injuries and
the injuries to many of his teammates, is it fair to say that
Armstrong should be a regular attendee of Johnny Parker's offseason
strength and conditioning program? Armstrong says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great relationship with Johnny Parker,'' he said. He
added, ``I know my body.'' He is a veteran who has been to the
Super Bowl and Pro Bowl. He has survived the days of Patriot chaos,
survived the days of Parcells, and is now going into his third
season with Carroll. He said no one had to tell him to lose weight
and tone his body; he just did it. You'd have to say he has good
timing. Here's why: He will be part of a unit that is now the
team's biggest question mark.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds strange to say about the Patriots' offense. It's
always been assumed that offense is the team's strength. But there
is a rookie center who may start in place of the departed Dave
Wohlabaugh. Robert Edwards is out for the year, so two backs who
weren't here last season _ Kevin Faulk and Lamont Warren _ will
compete for his vacated job. The offensive line coach took another
job. And before he did, Paul Boudreau found himself shuffling and
reshuffling the line to find a combination he liked. Terry Glenn is
injury-prone. And then there is Armstrong, a man who is coming off
a season in which he was called fat and slow.
</P>
<P>
   He is asked if the team, as constructed, can be one of the top
ones in the league. ``Oh yeah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke those words, he began to walk in another direction.
You got the sense that there was a place Armstrong needed to be. He
walked and the questions kept coming, about the team's chances,
about what a good leader should be, about Parker and his program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was a question about the specifics of his workout
in Georgia. Really, the queen of weight-loss infomercials, Susan
Powter, has nothing on Armstrong. If he can make such a noticeable
difference by losing 12 pounds, maybe he's the one who needs to be
teaching people about proper dieting and exercise. Did he also do
Tae Bo at home? What's his secret?
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he also changed his weightlifting technique. But
he didn't have time to get into specifics. ``I have to go in
here,'' he said, pointing to a door. It was the weight room.

PACERS DISAPPOINTED, THEN DISAPPEARED 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So much for that Utah-Indiana final.
</P>
<P>
   One half of it fell a while back. The other went unceremoniously
in the early morning hours Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks exposed the Pacers for what they are _ a team bereft
of athleticism that relied on experience and precision to win. The
Knicks disrupted that routine and Indiana had no Plan B. In the
end, the Pacers had no answer for the acrobatics of Marcus Camby or
Latrell Sprewell and, in the series-closing game, were outshot,
33-9, at the free throw line by a team without a legitimate inside
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Frauds? Well, you can make a case for them failing to meet their
own lofty expectations. You can probably fault them for taking the
Knicks lightly _ what other reason for all those no-shows during
the series? _ and for buying into all those nice things written
about them. You can certainly fault them for inexcusable lapses,
such as Camby's giant keep-alive in Game 3 with three Pacers
standing by idly. (Sprewell did the same thing in Game 6, although
the Knicks didn't capitalize.) And did we mention that the Knicks
won three big jump balls in Game 6, including one when Chris Childs
got the tip over Dale Davis?
</P>
<P>
   It's almost as if the Pacers felt they were entitled to move on
simply because of who they were and what they had done. That
doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. It hurts,'' said Antonio Davis. ``I think it's
tougher because we put so much pressure on ourselves to win. It's
like we beat ourselves, more than any opponent beat us. Hopefully,
we can learn from this and become a better team and better
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers aren't the first favorite to get floored by a hot
team and won't be the last. But this one has to hurt a lot, much
more than last year, when they extended the Bulls to seven games.
They were the noble pretenders in that series, catching people by
surprise and shaped in the all-business image of their rookie
coach. They were the Munich '38 Pacers in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird kept waiting for players to deliver and he's still
waiting. He has to take his share of the blame; why did he have to
wait at all? Why couldn't they deal with Camby; he's not the first
athletic big man they've faced and they have some big guys
themselves. You just didn't see that same, passioned, now-or-never
look the team had last year. But, then again, Bird wasn't the one
bricking all those open jumpers and not boxing out.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller was a monumental disappointment. He turned into
Todd Day in Game 6 after a vastly overrated 30-point effort in a
Game 5 loss. (Contrast that with the absolutely macho 32 delivered
by Allan Houston in winning Game 6.) He has to wonder how many more
opportunities he's going to get with this unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Miller said, ``because I definitely feel I
let our franchise down. Really, our state. They've been riding my
back as well. For me to come up so short in such a crucial time is
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits? Where was he for most of the series? Chris Mullin? He
had a great Game 4 but was nearly invisible in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   All through this season, the Pacers showed signs that they
weren't the same as last year. They were 10-10 in games decided by
4 or fewer points, with a third of their losses, 6 of 17, by 1
point. They supposedly had settled down and gotten their Second
Season faces on with sweeps of Milwaukee and Philadelphia, two
happy-to-be-here teams. Then they gave away Game 1 to the Knicks,
blew a 17-point lead in Game 2 before winning on two questionable
calls, and regurgitated a 14-point lead in losing Game 5 at home
after tying the series. They were awful in the fourth quarter, the
time when experienced, savvy, structured teams are supposed to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers thought they had the right mix. They still think they
do. The players feel the better team lost. They're still in denial,
which is understandable. They have a whole summer to figure it out,
one that begins with them having to watch the Knicks and Spurs
battle for the crown they thought was custom-fitted for them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder what is going on with the Celtics and Ron
Mercer. This cannot be a money thing; the Celtics aren't the
Florida Marlins. When Rick Pitino talks about his ``budget,'' he
neglects to note that he's already far over it anyway. If he's so
concerned about money and Mercer, why was he so quick to re-sign
Walter McCarty for $2.8 million per year? There may be an honest
difference of opinion about what Mercer is worth, which would
hardly be an NBA first. That's what negotiations are all about. It
can't be about Mercer's viability as a contributor; he's a very
nice piece of the puzzle (to borrow a phrase from M.L. Carr). But
with the Celtics entertaining trade offers and Pitino saying he
can't get in touch with Mercer's agent, well, you can see where
this is all going. So can Tevester Scott, who represents Mercer.
``It's propaganda,'' he said. ``I've talked several times to
(Boston general manager) Chris Wallace. You start feeding the media
like that and I wonder, what's your reason?'' Scott is well aware
that he and No Limit, the agency handling Mercer, are making their
NBA debut and people are watching. He is aware of the rules that
prevent negotiations before July 1. That includes faxing contract
proposals. ``I don't know what they expect me to do,'' Scott said.
``I mean, how far can you go? Not very far. We're new and people
are waiting for us to slip up. I won't. I know the rules.''
Regarding Mercer, Scott said, ``Ron has no problem with the city of
Boston or the fans. (He never mentioned Pitino.) I have to go for
the best deal I can get. I can't base that on what the Celtics are
saying. The only thing Ron's worried about is if Boston is willing
to step up to the table. He wants the best situation for him.'' The
real fear among the Celtics has to be that Mercer will leave. As
Kevin McHale noted, that should only be a fear if there are three
teams lined up to pay him what the Celtics won't. That doesn't seem
to be the case, although Chicago GM Jerry Krause likes him a lot
and could have a hefty stash to spend next summer. But this is not
new; the Celtics have been discussing a Mercer trade for a while.
They can't move him alone because his salary is artificially small
(by NBA standards), which is why he's being coupled with Kenny
Anderson. It's really something. Two years ago, Pitino stood at a
podium at the FleetCenter and announced he had his backcourt of the
future. Chauncey Billups lasted five months. It doesn't seem as
though Mercer is going to stick around a whole lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy on his role: ``I'm just thankful that I'm part of
a team that's still playing. Whatever small part I play in it, I
take seriously, try to do the best job I can. Like I said before
about criticism, if you're paralyzed by thoughts that you may be
criticized for something, you will never be the risk-taker you need
to be as a coach and leader. Risk-taking is part of it. If it
doesn't work out, you accept responsibility for it not working
out.'' . . . Last Thursday was Fan Appreciation Day at the Delta
Center for Karl Malone. About 20,000 fans showed up to pay homage
to the Mailman as well as to get a tour of the Jazz locker room and
see Malone's five Harley-Davidsons on display. Malone signed only a
few autographs; he mostly mingled and schmoozed. He also brought
some of his classic car collection and memorabilia, including his
two MVP trophies . . . Speaking of the Jazz, owner Larry Miller
says it's his gut feeling that Malone, John Stockton, and Jeff
Hornacek will be back. They're all free agents, as is Shandon
Anderson, who is certain to draw attention. We may never know
whether this past season benefited anyone, but the Jazz had to be
viewed, in the end, as something out of the first half-hour of
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Including the playoffs, Utah lost 11 of
its last 21 games. It got almost nothing from Greg Ostertag in the
playoffs. Very early in Game 6 against Portland, Utah's last game,
coach Jerry Sloan turned to his staff and said, ``Karl is dead.''
Malone certainly didn't have it that night; he was 3 of 16 from the
field. Later, Sloan said this past season was the worst he's ever
experienced, which says a lot since he was fired in Chicago in 1982
. . . Tim Hardaway broke a silence of sorts after the Heat's
disappointing playoff collapse to the Knicks and told Ira Winderman
of the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel that there wasn't the usual
``togetherness'' on this year's squad. ``There wasn't that
camaraderie. Everybody was scared to talk to one another,'' he
said. ``I probably spoke too much and that's what probably got me
and Pat (Riley) off (track). I told him it was my fault. I
shouldn't have said those things . . . I had a bad season. I had a
bad year.'' Asked about being traded, Hardaway said, ``If a team
lets me go, like the Golden State Warriors did, it would be a big
mistake.'' He turns 33 Sept. 1 . . . In each of the last seven
seasons, Scottie Pippen was All-NBA on either the first, second, or
third team. This year, he managed a single vote, same as Smits. We
can already imagine the trade rumors sending him to the Lakers if
Phil Jackson takes over. (A re-signed Glen Rice and others?)
Meanwhile, all but five teams had at least one player receive a
vote for the All-NBA teams. Those five were the Celtics, Clippers,
Warriors, Bulls, and, if you can believe it, the Knicks. When was
the last time a team was in the Finals without having one player
get one mention for an all-pro team? . . . Shaquille O'Neal and the
triple-post offense? We may look forward to that with Jackson's
return. Jackson is understandably intrigued by the Lakers, but will
he be Big Chief Triangle again with the game's most dominating
low-post presence on his roster? ``It's a very hard offense to
learn,'' said the Pistons' Jud Buechler. ``You have to be patient
but it's worth it because everyone is involved, everyone touches
the ball, you feel like you're doing something. The rest of the NBA
is all standing around.'' Adds Chicago's Krause, ``You have to have
a high basketball IQ to play it.'' If he does anything with the
Lakers, Jackson would be bucking the trend of the last several
coaches to win NBA titles and move elsewhere. The only one who has
had much success is Riley. Chuck Daly had a couple playoff
appearances with New Jersey and Bill Fitch got the Rockets to the
Finals in 1986 . . . Shaq, meanwhile, was the runaway scoring
leader based on 48-minute projections. The self-proclaimed Superman
averaged 36.3 points, 5.1 more than Allen Iverson, the actual
scoring leader. The rebounding leader? None other than the Nuggets'
Danny Fortson, who projected a haul of 19.7 a game. No Celtic
placed in the top 10 in any of the significant categories. But
Antoine Walker was seventh in shots attempted, which comes as no
surprise.

THERE WAS NO NEED TO REVISIT KATZENMOYER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In the old days, before computers, there
used to be an expression in the newspaper business. A street
reporter would scurry around town gathering facts, then call the
office and bellow in dramatic fashion from a pay phone, ``Give me
rewrite!''
</P>
<P>
   On the phone would come a desk editor who had a way with words
to take the facts and rewrite them, turning the reporter's
information into a story. This procedure usually was used when time
was of the essence and news was being broken.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Sports Illustrated took the expression
literally. For purposes only the magazine's editors truly know
(although I have my suspicions), they chose to rewrite a year-old
story about the educational follies of Patriots No. 1 draft choice
Andy Katzenmoyer at Ohio State and try to sell it as ``news.''
</P>
<P>
   When they wrote about Katzenmoyer last fall, it was a story of
great impact, making obvious that Katzenmoyer's only connections to
Ohio State were at the football stadium and in the cafeteria. It
made obvious that his academic standing was a joke and he was to
play that fall only through the oddest of summer school work, a
class load that included ``golf'' and ``AIDS awareness'' for
credit; the final exam for the latter was putting a condom on a
piece of fruit without damaging either. If such courses are the aim
of a college education, perhaps we should close the colleges.
</P>
<P>
   SI's point was that Katzenmoyer should no more be occupying a
seat in a college classroom than a potted plant should. It was
hardly a revelation, however, since anyone who has paid any
attention to big-time college athletics understands that the
Katzenmoyers are becoming the rule in high-profile football and
basketball programs rather than the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a valid story, showing how an All-America
linebacker could be kept alive for athletic purposes while making
little or no progress toward an academic degree. To their credit,
neither Katzenmoyer nor his family tried to argue that he was a
student-athlete. They all acknowledged he had gone to Ohio State to
play football and hopefully learn enough about his trade to earn a
place in the NFL, which he did this spring when the Patriots made
him the second of their two first-round selections. To that extent,
at least, his OSU ``education'' served him well.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Katzenmoyer did to deserve a second story on the
same subject is difficult to fathom. The ``new'' SI story reveals
nothing new about his academic woes. It does not make new charges
of further educational fraud. It does not point to new classes in
which he was taken care of by Ohio State's alleged educators, only
old ones we already knew about. It does nothing but use Katzenmoyer
to get some cheap publicity _ the same thing, frankly, that Ohio
State did with him the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an effort to exonerate Katzenmoyer for his shameful
academic efforts. Clearly he did little or nothing to advance
himself off the football field. He has already paid a price for
that in bad publicity that he admits hurt him and his family and
for which he recognizes his own culpability. If his football career
is a failure, he will continue to pay for the decisions he made.
</P>
<P>
   But while the shame last year was Katzenmoyer's when SI wrote
the story, the shame this time is the magazine's. The supposed
``revelation'' that the university received at least two letters
last August complaining of the special treatment Katzenmoyer
received was the excuse to rewrite a story that had already made
headlines once.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent in those headlines was the name of Sports Illustrated,
a magazine that finds itself locked in a circulation battle with
the upstart ESPN Magazine _ much more of a battle than it
originally expected. If this is SI's response to that, shame on it.
</P>
<P>
   If it was simply an effort to racially balance a much larger
article about educational shenanigans at the University of
Minnesota involving a black basketball coach, black players, and a
white tutor who allegedly wrote papers for money to keep them
eligible, shame on SI as well.
</P>
<P>
   And if it was just a cheap shot, a second bite at the same
apple, shame on SI all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer is far from the only college athlete to march
through his education in this way, and there's enough shame in that
to go around, including plenty for the media.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who tries to argue the Katzenmoyer story is the exception
simply doesn't know what's going on or has spent far less time than
I have trying to have conversations with some of these athletes
after they've allegedly spent 2-5 years at some of our biggest and
best universities. Too many of them would need the help of Lewis
and Clark to find the campus library.
</P>
<P>
   This is the main reason I have little interest any more in
big-time college sports. It is a cesspool of lies, deceit, and
corruption at least as deep as anything I've found in the seamy
world of prizefighting, which at least doesn't claim to be anything
more than a money-making enterprise. This is not meant to demean
the many student-athletes who really are both. It is just to point
out that too many of them are on the track team or the volleyball
squad while too many others in revenue-producing programs (read:
football and basketball) are like Katzenmoyer or his former
teammate, Damon Moore, who is quoted in the SI story as having had
a similar summer school experience to stay eligible before entering
the NFL this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Football is the only sport without a minor league system. To a
lesser extent, basketball suffers the same problem, and the
colleges have chosen to fill that vacuum. I venture to say that if
there were a true minor league NFL system, Katzenmoyer, Moore, and
a lot of other people would never have set foot on a college
campus.
</P>
<P>
   If it were possible to go from high school to the NFL, as some
unusually talented and physically advanced basketball players can
do, they'd do that as well. But no high school football player is
physically ready to be hit by Reggie White or Tony Boselli at 18.
</P>
<P>
   So they go to college and the fraud begins. To expose it is
fine, but the media turn a blind eye to the fraud each fall
Saturday and winter weekend when the Ohio States go out to play the
Minnesotas or the Florida States do battle with the Miamis.
</P>

   We in the media glorify what we know is a fraud upon academia
and the public and then, to purge our own guilt, from time to time
expose the fraud as if we are surprised. We do this for a few weeks
until some kid gets publicly flogged or some college ends up on
probation, and then business returns to normal.

   If that's what it takes for some editors to sleep at night, so
be it, but to nail Andy Katzenmoyer twice for the same offense
would be a 15-yard penalty on the football field. It's called
piling on.

   Right now, agent Rocky Arceneaux has bigger things to worry
about than the contract status of his client Marshall Faulk with
the St. Louis Rams. It seems a condo owned by Arceneaux was
recently raided by St. Louis police, who claimed a high-priced
escort service was being run out of the place. When the police got
there, whom did they stumble upon but St. Louis Cardinals
outfielder Ray Lankford? And while they were casing the joint, in
walked 300-plus-pound Rams offensive tackle Orlando Pace, which
only goes to show that it can pay to sleep late. It was 5 a.m. when
Pace walked in, claiming to know nothing about the alleged
prostitution ring. Lankford claimed the same, and both were
released because of lack of evidence, but Lankford was found to be
in possession of the following: keys to the place, several packages
of condoms, lubricants, and an empty 50 mg bottle of Viagra. Two
men were arrested for running the operation, which came to the
police's attention after they took out a want ad in a weekly paper
seeking ``beautfiul young ladies as exotic dancers and lingerie
models who want to make a lot of money. Our clients are pro
athletes and corporate executives, so you must have class, be
talented and dependable.'' Right . . . The fact Pace obviously has
some discretionary income may explain why he did not do enough
workouts to earn a $50,000 bonus this offseason. ``An extra $50,000
to a guy like Pace is just a tax problem,'' said an NFC insider . .
. Here's what the NFL has become. Former Cleveland Browns defensive
backs Frank Minniefield and Hanford Dixon claimed they should get a
piece of the revived team's licensing revenue for the nickname
``Dawg Pound,'' which they coined for the rowdy end zone fans at
the old Municipal Stadium. But the NFL says it holds all the
licensing rights, even though it acknowledges that Minniefield and
Dixon came up with the idea. Whatever happened to intellectual
property, lowbrow as this type might be? According to the league,
once the term became associated with the Browns, the NFL owned it.
Since the NFL put a trademark on it, Dixon and Minniefield are out
of luck, but are you telling me the NFL couldn't throw the
ex-players who came up with the idea a nickel, a shirt, or
something? . . . Let's give Arizona general manager Bob Ferguson a
standing ovation. When Ferguson was told that young defensive
tackle Mark Smith would not attend a minicamp because of a contract
dispute, he said, ``He ought to look around and see what they're
paying at McDonald's.'' Smith and his agent, Gil Thompson, were
outraged, and Thompson said Smith wanted to be traded. Ferguson
wrote a letter of apology Monday and has since said his remarks
were ``unprofessional.'' Maybe so, but that doesn't mean they
weren't accurate. Like many teams, the Cardinals are having salary
cap problems. Despite being $1.5 million under the cap at the
moment, they have to unload another $3 million to cover their
rookie pool expenses. At the same time, Smith is demanding a
one-year, $1 million contract, refusing to sign the $325,000
minimum tender offer made to him as a third-year pro. Considering
that, Ferguson may have picked the wrong job. You have to know how
to make change at McDonald's.

   Although he has twice said he is not mentally ready to come back
to pro football, quarterback Mark Rypien spoke with Chargers line
coach Joe Bugel last week and said he was leaving the door open.
Rypien sat out last season to spend time with his ailing son, but
Chargers GM Bobby Beathard hoped to bring him in to help struggling
Ryan Leaf. San Diego has Jim Harbaugh as the designated starter but
might take a flyer on Rypien as a veteran backup. Here's a quote
that sums up the Charger veterans' point of view on Leaf, who
missed the opening of last week's minicamp to play in a golf
tournament. ``Youth is one thing, ignorance is another,''
linebacker Lew Bush said. ``He's got to wake up. It's not funny. It
ain't no joke. This is our livelihood. You've got to be
professional about it and right now, up to this point, he hasn't
been.'' The thing that most bothers new Charger coach Mike Riley
and Beathard is that Leaf lied to them about his whereabouts last
month after he vanished for a week. Leaf claimed he was working
with a personal trainer in Orange County, Calif., but the trainer
said he hadn't seen Leaf in a year. Then he was told by the club to
tell the media the truth if asked about the incident because there
was a videotape of him telling a reporter he was working out with
the trainer. Instead, Leaf lied again, telling reporters there had
been a miscommunication between him and the club. Considering how
Leaf acted last year, considering how he played (2 TD passes and 15
interceptions), considering that he has been caught lying this year
to his coach, his teammates, his general manager, and the local
media, one can only wonder one thing. Who changes his diapers? . .
. The Patriots made a small move in their scouting staff, firing
Edwin Bailey, who covered the Southeast, and replacing him with
Jason Licht. Licht worked the past two seasons for National
Combine, one of two scouting services used by many NFL teams. He
was assigned to the Carolina Panthers . . . The Patriots are
bringing in ex-Ravens receiver Michael Jackson for a look this week
but they can't sign him unless they continue to cut veterans to
make salary cap room. Jackson led the NFL in TD receptions in 1996
with 14 but he has been hurt the past two years and was considered
damaged goods in Baltimore, so much so that the Ravens chose to
sign Webster Slaughter to a one-year, minimum-salary deal
($400,000). The 34-year-old Slaughter was out of the NFL in 1997
and spent much of last year languishing on the sidelines in San
Diego, where he caught only eight passes and broke his finger in
November . . . Pete Carroll continues to keep his eye on ex-Redskin
running back Terry Allen, but until Allen brings down his contract
demands a lot closer to the NFL minimum for a nine-year veteran
he'll remain unemployed. The real place New England should be
looking is Miami, which has 10 backs and one ball. No way they all
survive, and any one of the top half-dozen is better than anyone on
New England's present roster . . . Pro Bowl cornerback Ty Law
continues to work as hard as anyone on the Patriot roster. After
the final minicamp ends Tuesday, he will take a few days to rest
and then head for St. Louis to continue workouts with top Olympic
track coach Bob Kersee. Law, along with many other NFL players
including Jerome Bettis, has been working out with Kersee at the
UCLA track but a real measure of his commitment is to shift from LA
to St. Louis in late June . . . By the way, despite all of Willie
McGinest's offseason efforts to solve the hamstring problems that
have plagued him, he is not yet 100 percent and did only limited
work at the final minicamp. The belief is that he'll be healthy and
ready to go by training camp, but the Patriots do not want to risk
a reinjury now. The same did not apply to Terry Glenn, however.
``He's full go,'' Carroll said. ``We're all anxious to see how he
handles himself. This camp will be a good gauge.''

IS NEW `LEAGUE' THE WAY TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last thing boxing would seem to need right now is
another set of capital letters, but Pensacola, Fla., attorney Fred
Levin believes there is one set that might help clean up the
sport's image, and it's not ``FBI.'' It's ``WBL,'' as in World
Boxing League.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily, at least, that is the name Levin has attached to an
idea he's been hatching for two years to try to bring some order
into the red light district of sports. Levin, who recently earned
$275 million as the lead attorney in Florida's case against the
tobacco industry that resulted in a $13 billion settlement,
stumbled upon his idea in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has spent the last half-decade or so advising Roy
Jones, who just happens to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in
the world. In the process, Levin had his eyes opened to a seamy
side of sport he never quite knew existed. Second, he read a book
called, ``The NASCAR Way,'' a tome about the marketing of the
fastest-growing professional sport in the country, auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Those two experiences helped Levin see the light, and now he's
hoping a big-name sponsor and the world's top fighters will, too,
because if they do, they could make the WBC, WBA, WBO, WBU, IBF,
IBC, IBA, and their 119 ``world champions'' and phony rankings
obsolete. For that alone, Levin's plan deserves serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 10 years I been screwed up in this, I got an education
quick from Don King, Bob Arum, and the rest of 'em,'' Levin said.
``Then you start fooling with those sanctioning bodies and you
learn how it works. Nobody ever solicited a dime from me but it was
obvious what was going on. Roy would beat the hell out of a guy and
the next month the guy would be rated ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally signed a three-fight deal with Arum because we
could see you had to be connected. We did it to get to (then super
middleweight champion James) Toney. But it pissed me off. Roy could
afford to do it, but not every fighter is in the position of a Roy
Jones. I just started thinking there had to be a way to end the
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Levin joined forces with Dallas Mavericks
president-CEO Terdema Ussery, the ex-commissioner of the
Continental Basketball Association and ex-president of Nike Sports
Management. It was through Jones's affiliation with Nike that Levin
and Ussery began to talk about boxing's ills. It was a long
conversation that led to a simple solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it the World Boxing League for now but it
wouldn't really be a league,'' Levin said. ``I've got some leading
sports figures and business people interested in being
stockholders, and what we want to do is get a commissioner who
everybody in boxing would respect as a person of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the WBL would contract with someone like the Boxing
Writers Association to provide independent rankings. We'd have
nothing to do with them beyond paying for the service. There'd be
no interference from the WBL with the ratings service, not like it
is now where it's all done internally and who knows what goes on?
The writers or whoever send the ratings and we live with 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'd cut the divisions to 10-12 (from the present 17) and
we'd provide professional referees and officials who would be paid
by the WBL, not the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important, we'd charge no sanction fees to fighters. Roy
paid $400,000 in sanction fees and Reggie (Johnson) paid over
$100,000 (for last weekend's light heavyweight unification title
fight). For what? A plastic belt? They charge you extra for the
damn belt!
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model is NASCAR, which has private-sector sponsoring.
Other sports have gone to the same thing. What we're looking for is
one sponsor to put up around $3 million a year for several years
and they'd get the Pepsi World Champions or the Gillette World
Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its long history in boxing, Gillette is a natural.
It's a credible brand name that would distinguish its champions
from the rest. Roy, for example, would be the `Gillette light
heavyweight champion of the world.' They'd get the naming rights to
the belts and the peripheral marketing tools like the ring mat for
40 or 50 title fights a year. And boxing is an international
business so we're not just talking about brand exposure in the US.
It would be on worldwide television regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fewer champions associated with a major corporation and
an organization that doesn't charge sanction fees or get involved
in rankings, people would start to recognize boxing again for the
great sport it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin points out that Budweiser just paid $10 million to have
its logo on Dale Earnhardt's stock car for five years; it will be
plastered on any empty space Earnhardt can find because he already
has a multitude of other logos on his car and racing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In the WBL's case, there would be only one sponsor, at least
initially. That company would get the full benefit of what Levin
and Ussery believe would quickly become the recognized world
champions in a sport with more kings at the moment than the Roman
Empire had.
</P>
<P>
   But why would the fighters risk entering a new venture when
boxing's three crime families _ the World Boxing Council, World
Boxing Association, and International Boxing Federation _ still
wield so much power over their futures?
</P>
<P>
   Five more letters. M-O-N-E-Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd need the biggest champions to come with us,'' Levin
acknowledged. ``We'd need Roy and Lennox Lewis and Oscar (De La
Hoya). We'd need (Shane) Mosley and the other guys viewed by the
boxing media and the public as the true champions at the various
weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the media would accept the idea almost immediately
because it's a better system than the one that's in place'' _ and
under investigation by the Federal government for selling ratings
and title shots. ``The public would accept it if it gave them one
true champion and the politicians would love it because they know
they can't legislate boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighters would go for it because they wouldn't have to pay
those sanction fees to fight for a championship. It wouldn't cost a
nickel to become a champion in this organization. There's no
negative to this thing other than finding a sponsor. The only
people who'd be against it are the promoters because they've been
making good livings manipulating the system for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said the WBL's champions could fight for the titles of
other organizations, if they wanted, but if he and Ussery and their
partners can find the right sponsor and convince champions like
Jones to believe in them, he believes, before long there won't be
other titles to fight for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organizations will fall by the wayside,'' Levin said.
``You won't have all these champions. You'll have more TV fights
between top-rated guys fighting for a chance to get a shot at a
real title.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fred Levin has his way _ and, as the tobacco industry
learned, he usually does _ that title will come with a razor maker
or a soda can logo, and something else. It will come with some
integrity.
</P>
<P>

   The bad blood between Fernando Vargas and De La Hoya almost
spilled on a restaurant floor last week in Big Bear, Calif., where
Vargas is training for his July 17 fight with former IBF junior
middleweight champion Raul Marquez, an Olympic teammate and friend
of De La Hoya's. Big Bear is a small community with only two real
restaurants, so it was no surprise that both the new IBF 154-pound
champion and the old one ended up at Sandy's Sports Bar, three
tables apart, since both are training at Big Bear to prepare for
the altitude at Lake Tahoe. The two began exchanging cross words,
and when De La Hoya arrived to join Marquez for dinner, Vargas
accused De La Hoya of plotting against him with Marquez in hopes of
seeing Vargas lose before De La Hoya had to face him. When a long
line of autograph seekers began to form at De La Hoya's table,
several sources said, Vargas grew enraged and louder before finally
leaving. Last week, at a press conference in Los Angeles, Marquez
handed Vargas a De La Hoya T-shirt and Vargas threw it back,
snapping, ``Keep it! You'll need it to wipe the blood out of your
mouth!'' To say there's bad blood here would be an understatement .
. . After that incident, De La Hoya reaffirmed his decision to
never fight Vargas, who has taunted and criticized De La Hoya since
he was on the 1996 Olympic team and failed to follow De La Hoya's
1992 gold medal performance with one of his own. De La Hoya told
Arum he intends to fight Felix Trinidad Sept. 18 and then move up
to 154 pounds but not to chase Vargas. Rather, he plans to
challenge WBC champion Javier Castillejo before moving on to WBA
champion David Reid, himself a former Olympic gold medalist and
Vargas knocker . . . Reid's July challenger, Kevin Kelly of
Australia (not the one from Flushing, N.Y.), is of so little skill
and import that HBO has declined to televise the fight despite
holding a deal with Reid . . . Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's
trainer, was quoted in El Mundo, a Spanish-language newspaper in
Puerto Rico, as saying his fighter now wanted double his agreed-to
$15 million purse to fight Trinidad. Fortunately, De La Hoya has
more sense about dollars and cents than Alcazar. He told Arum that
while he had several contractual issues about the pay-per-view
overages, the size of his guarantee is not a problem. The proof of
that is De La Hoya and Trinidad will launch a nine-city promotional
tour Monday in New York. They will then fly on separate planes to
Chicago Tuesday. Then it's on to Miami and San Juan Wednesday,
Houston and Dallas Thursday, Mexico City Friday, Universal Studios
in Los Angeles Friday, and a big finish at the Las Vegas Hilton
Theatre Saturday night, when they will join Latino pop idol Luis
Luis on stage.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision by IBF junior lightweight champion Roberto Garcia
to pull out of his title fight last weekend against Derrick
``Smoke'' Gainer because he didn't like the makeup of the officials
was a smart one. Who but the most naive could blame him after he
saw judges from Florida (Gainer's home state) and Mississippi
(where Gainer has often fought) and none from California, his home
state? The champion turned his back on a $400,000 payday, the
largest of his career, and another $200,000 for a rematch within 90
days if he lost for the simple reason that he believed the rematch
was as guaranteed as last weekend's purse. HBO executive Kery Davis
was in the middle of the on-site negotiations and was justifiably
upset, arguing, ``I'm not naive, but if we go along with these kind
of things, we're saying our sport is corrupt. We're saying each guy
comes with his own judge and the third guy is responsible for
getting it right. I can't accept that.'' Perhaps not, but one
veteran boxing insider said, ``It looked like they were setting the
kid up. Maybe they weren't, but it looked that way.'' . . . Garcia
may still end up on HBO this fall vs. WBC champion Floyd Mayweather
. . . World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion Herbie Hide
was recently declared bankrupt in England because of his refusal to
pay some bills, and this is causing problems with how he is to be
paid for his June 26 title fight with 6-foot-7-inch Vitali
Klitschko. The biggest problem came when Hide told a British
reporter he had left 8,000 pounds next to a lamp in his room at his
training camp and when he returned the money was on fire. Soon, so
were British court officers, demanding to know where it came from.

DOCTORS UNABLE TO ASSIST JANNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ He had the personal trainer ready to whip him into
shape. This was going to be a big summer for Craig Janney. He was
looking at July 1, the day he'll become an unrestricted free agent,
as his chance to find a new place to play and secure his long-term
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, unfortunately, I've exhausted every opinion out
there,'' said the former Bruins center. ``It looks like I won't be
able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 31 years old, Janney a couple of weeks ago notified the
Islanders, his most recent port of call, that a troublesome blood
clot below his right knee would not allow him to continue his
career. Janney said last week that no fewer than five doctors
diagnosed critical vascular damage in the leg and an impaired valve
that relays blood back to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not functional in a hockey sense,'' said Janney,
speaking by phone from Scottsdale, Ariz., where he lives with wife
Kim and the couple's 15-month-old daughter, Barrette. ``The clot's
not going away _ it might not ever go away _ and there's a chance
I'll have to stay on blood thinners the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Janney, the clot developed late in the season after
he took what he felt was a harmless slash during a team practice.
Following the workout, he boarded the club's flight for a long trip
to Calgary and, upon leaving the plane, realized his leg was stiff
and swollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a lot of factors coming together,'' he said.
``There was the slash, the long flight . . . and I've never liked
flying much, so I just sat in my seat for hours, my leg bent the
whole time, and that didn't help. On top of everything else, it
turns out I've got some kind of blood disorder, too, some sort of
protein deficiency maybe I had for years and knew nothing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for that unfortunate confluence of factors,
agent Rich Scimone right now would be shopping Janney's stats
around a 28-team league hungry for talented playmakers. Now Janney
ponders life without the game that took him from the neighborhood
rinks in Connecticut, to Boston College, to the US Olympic team
('88), to the riches of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, I've done fairly well,'' said Janney. ``From that
standpoint, I'm fortunate, I don't have to rush out and do
something. All of this has happened so quickly, I've really had no
time to deal with it, never mind figure out what I'm going to do
from here. I'm just now trying to swallow it. I've had some offers
to do some things, mainly back East. A lot of my buddies back home
have gotten into finance, but to be honest, I don't know what I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at his best, the sweet-passing Janney collected 106
points in 1992-93, his first full season with the Blues after being
dished to St. Louis with Stephane Quintal in the deal that brought
Adam Oates to Boston. Janney's game lacked grit, the key element
that kept him from being an elite player in the league, but his
soft hands and keen sense of timing made him a valuable piece to
any offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first years in Boston were highlights,'' recalled Janney.
``You go to the finals twice like that ('88, '90), it's so exciting
to be part of something so big. I only wish I had been a little
older, maybe I would have appreciated it more when it was
happening. I'll never forget that first year, Taz (Terry O'Reilly)
telling me and Bobby Joyce, `Hey, listen, you may think right now
that this is going to happen to you eight or nine times in your
career, but don't be so sure, it could be your only chance _ so you
better be ready to go.' He was so right. We got there twice, and I
never got close again.''
</P>
<P>
   In slightly more than 11 years, Janney helped four wingers
collect 50 goals in a season. Brett Hull, here in the finals with
Dallas, drilled in a bunch of Janney's patented soft feeds in St.
Louis. Brendan Shanahan, Keith Tkachuk, and Cam Neely also hammered
home his relays on their way to 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the pleasure of playing with some top goal scorers,''
Janney said. ``And a lot of guys can't say that they helped four
guys to 50 goals. I'm pretty proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   On his worst days now, said Janney, he makes his way around with
what he describes as a ``club foot.'' Nearly any amount of exercise
causes his leg to swell and brings a loss of feeling in the limb.
He laughs about using a cart when he plays golf, hanging a ``Derek
Sanderson handicapped flag'' on the buggy as he makes the 18-hole
loop. He has to wear support hose, more apt to be worn by those 30
or 40 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the swelling's bad, that part of my leg can get three to
five times bigger than normal,'' he said. ``All these doctors I
see, vascular guys, heart specialists, they see me and they laugh
because I'm so young. They say, `Wow, your veins are so great.' And
I say, `You know, I really don't want to hear that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Janney remains on Coumadin, the blood thinner, and
keeps his physical activity to a minimum. The clot doesn't
dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't budged in three months,'' he said, when asked if he
might try a comeback if the condition were to clear. ``The damage
has been done, to the vein and to the valve. I'd love to say
(there's a chance of coming back), but there's just no way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janney's partner in trade, Quintal, will see a huge payday when
he becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1. Within the last two
weeks, the Canadiens offered The Q a deal worth $10 million over
four years. He turned it down. Don't be surprised if the Rangers
come up with the same money but only three years of servitude . . .
Ex-Hab Vinny Damphousse agreed to terms with the Sharks Friday.
He'll make $18 million over the next four seasons and the Sharks
can sign him for a fifth year (2003-04) for $5 million, an option
that kicks in automatically for Damphousse if he attains
predetermined point levels . . . Ex-Bruin Dave Reid, who drives a
vintage Volkswagen Beetle around the Big D, knew he was getting a
little grayer when his Dallas teammates edited out his selection of
dressing room music. ``I walked out of the room,'' said Reid,
``when they made me get rid of my Neil Diamond records.'' . . . He
shot down the suggestion when it first came up a couple of weeks
ago, but Stars general manager Bob Gainey would be a nice fit as
club president in Montreal, where Ron Corey has decided to step
down. Gainey's eldest daughter attends McGill University in
Montreal. Another daughter just finished high school in Texas. If
the Stars win the Cup, where's his challenge in Dallas? And right
now, for someone who likes challenges, they don't come much bigger
than the very ordinary Canadiens . . . Vancouver GM Brian Burke is
on record as wanting to take the talented Sedin twins, Daniel and
Henrik, in the June 26 amateur draft at Boston. The Canucks have
the No. 3 pick, which means, for starters, both Tampa Bay and
Atlanta would have to pass on the talented Swedish pair. Burke then
would have to deal with Chicago (at No. 4) or the Islanders (No. 5)
to pick up the extra selection. In short, it's possible, but a real
stretch. And it all goes off the boards if Patrik Stefan remains
available at No. 3. Burke also is on record as saying he'd take
Stefan ahead of the whole bunch. Or is that posturing just to
entice the Bolts to bite on someone other than a Sedin? . . . Rick
Dudley got his wish last week when the Senators released him as
their GM and he signed with Tampa as president. The sticking point
was compensation. Word around the league is that the Senators will
get $1 million from Tampa Bay and a second- or third-round draft
pick . . . Good guy Marshall Johnston was recently promoted to
assistant GM in Ottawa to replace Dudley. ``I know I'll be a better
manager than I was a player,'' said Johnston, who collected 66
points in seven NHL seasons . . . Ex-Ranger first-round pick Chris
Kontos (15th overall in '82) is now a TV sports anchor with a
Barrie, Ontario, station . . . Valeri Kamensky's free agent price
bumped up considerably with his strong showing for the Avalanche in
the playoffs (9 points in 10 games) upon recovering from a
fractured wrist. Once Theo Fleury arrived from Calgary, it was
thought to be a fait accompli that Kamensky would be out of
Colorado, the Avalanche not having the dough to sign everyone. But
Fleury flopped in the series with Dallas, leading to speculation
that Colorado might not choose to bring him back and instead use
some of the savings to rehire Kamensky. One or the other will be
gone, which will bring offers from the Rangers. And if Kamensky is
the one let go, look for the Panthers to make a bid. He summers in
Miami and would make an interesting fit on a line with countryman
Pavel Bure.

   Fans toting homemade signs have a field day with Sabres forward
Miroslav Satan's last name (the pronunciation is a less-devilish
Shuh-tan), to wit: ``Thank God for Satan'' and, one in New Jersey,
``Beat the Devil out of Satan.'' When he first entered the league
with the Oilers, it was suggested that Satan insert an H into his
name, but he passed on the idea . . . Jacques Demers, now with
Dudley as his new boss in Tampa, has three years remaining on his
deal as coach and GM of the Bolts. Dudley likely will bring in
Steve Ludzik from the Detroit Vipers (IHL) as the bench boss,
leaving Demers to focus solely on GM duties _ something that Demers
figured was a year down the road for him anyway. Ludzik was Sergei
Samsonov's coach for the year ('96-97) that Samsonov spent in the
IHL . . . When Islander GM Mike Milbury gets around to trading
Ziggy Palffy (and just forget the Rangers), the league wants to
review the deal (shades of baseball's Bowie Kuhn/Charlie Finley
days). League vice president Colin Campbell: ``Once it comes across
the table, we'll look at it.'' The Islanders have to get a player
or two in return, someone with talent who hasn't made the big
bucks. One alternative: The club that acquires Palffy also could
agree to pay the player that it sends to New York. For instance, if
the Blackhawks wanted Palffy badly enough, they could send Alexei
Zhamnov to New York and agree to pay his $3 million-plus salary,
effectively making Palffy an $8 million-a-year player (a price
level that doesn't make some clubs blink) . . . Word out of LA is
that the Kings have decided that neither Dave Lewis nor Ted Nolan
will be their next head coach. Still on the list of possibilities:
John Van Boxmeer, Andy Murray, and Dave King . . . Stars defenseman
Craig Ludwig has worn the same wide-body shin pads since his days
at the University of North Dakota (carbon dating has traced them to
the Bronze Era). In recent years he has received two letters from
the Hockey Hall of Fame, requesting that he donate them at the end
of his career. Ludwig's response each time: ``If you take my pads,
you've got to take me.'' He hasn't heard back. Ludwig is also a
serious offseason softball player, suiting up for the ``Sid
Grinker'' club in Milwaukee, where he handles third base duties.
His specialty: home runs and knocking down sizzling shots at the
hot corner . . . The Flyers gave assistant GM John Blackwell the
heave-ho last week after seven years. There wasn't enough work for
three men to do, said GM Bob Clarke, who also has Paul Holmgren in
the front office. Word along Broad Street is that the Flyers want
to enhance Holmgren's role with the club, perhaps preventing him
from bolting to the Minnesota Wild . . . NHL clubs turn in their
protected lists 48 hours after the completion of the final Stanley
Cup game. If the Sabres-Stars series goes to the limit (Game 7 is
June 22), the lists would be turned in June 24 _ only one day prior
to the Atlanta Thrashers expansion draft. Talk about a one-timer .
. . Ron Low called it quits as head coach in Edmonton when Oiler
boss Glen Sather made him an offer he had to refuse: one-year
extension with no raise ($450,000 in Canadian funds). Low walked.
Kevin Lowe is the heir apparent _ provided he'll take the lowball
$450,000. Meanwhile, Low is one of three who have interviewed for
the Thrashers job, along with Don Hay and Curt Fraser. Contrary to
reports out of Toronto, Mike Keenan is not under consideration for
the Atlanta coaching job . . . Sabres forward Michael Peca is
finalizing a deal for ``Peca's Pickles'' here in hockey-mad Western
New York. You've got a terminal case of pennant fever if you still
have a loaf of Big Yaz bread tucked away in the family freezer.

AT PINEHURST, NO. 2 IS NO. 1 ATTRACTION 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The 99th US Open begins Thursday at the storied No. 2
course at Pinehurst in the sandhills of North Carolina, one of the
game's true jewels. There is a history of classic golf at the
course, including the North &AMP; South Amateur and a couple of PGA
Tour Championships in the early years of this decade. The United
States won the Ryder Cup there in 1951, and Jack Nicklaus won the
North &AMP; South Amateur there in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   There are deep Bay State roots in the course; it may be even
more steeped in Boston than The Country Club in Brookline, where
the Ryder Cup will be contested this September. James Walker Tufts,
who bought the property before the turn of the century, was born in
Charlestown in 1835. The Tufts family is woven into the course, the
resort, and the sandhills.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ross, a native of Dornoch, Scotland, who took over as
golf professional at Oakley CC in Watertown in 1899 and created Bay
State courses such as Salem, Winchester, Oak Hill, and Brae Burn,
became professional at Pinehurst in 1900 and completed the
construction of the second 18 holes later in the decade. Pinehurst
No. 2 is one of his architectural monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been a venue for the US Open, and its time is long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Andrade, who grew up in Bristol, R.I., and went to Wake
Forest, has seen a lot of Pinehurst. Andrade, who did not qualify
for this year's US Open, won the North &AMP; South Amateur at the No. 2
course in 1986 and made it to the semifinals the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played it quite a bit,'' said Andrade. ``In college I
played it all the time. We used to go down there a lot. We played
the ACC Tournament there once and we played the PGA Tour
Championship there. I went there about a month ago to check out all
the changes they've made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very, very hard. It's going to be
very difficult. It's going to be very different. It's really not
going to give you that US Open feel, because there's hardly going
to be any rough around the greens the way they're going to set it
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are all egg-shaped. I think they're a little more
raised, a little more sloped than they used to be. I think,
depending on wind and weather and firmness, I would take even par
right now to win. I think even par is going to win the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top players bypassed Memphis this week, including US
Open defender Lee Janzen, who is looking for a title to go with the
ones he won at Baltusrol in 1993 and last year at San Francisco's
Olympic Club. He played four straight weeks, up to the Memorial at
Muirfield Village last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly trying to aim my game to be at its peak by the
end of this tournament, so I could go home and practice and
hopefully be ready for the US Open,'' said Janzen at the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen feels his game is on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's probably slightly better than last year,'' he
said. ``I probably have more confidence in my game now than I did a
year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does the US Open seem to be his tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I have the right answer,'' he said. ``I like
playing strategy, always playing the smart shot. I think I control
the distance of my irons very well, which I think is very crucial
in the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are very hard. I hit the ball pretty high and spin
the ball a lot. I'm able to land the ball very close to where I
think you need to land it on each green and make it stop.
Fortunately, I putted very well both times, too. They weren't the
best putting weeks I've ever had, but they were certainly very
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a guy has to know how far he's hitting each club at a
course like Pinehurst, and I think it helps to spin the ball. Guys
that hit the ball high and soft will have a better chance at
Pinehurst to get the ball near the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tiger Woods won the Memorial, he said he would take the
week off to prepare for the US Open. He also won in Germany, so
this would make it three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing is, my game is starting to come around,'' said
Woods. ``No doubt about that. I'm starting to understand how to
play golf a little better than I had before. That's definitely the
thing you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will continue to learn how to play this game until
the day I die. It always changes. That's one of the great things
about it. You will always learn how to better manage yourself
around golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to soak up all the mishaps I've had in my life
and applied it each and every time and made it better.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who is the world's No. 1-ranked player, has never
even seen Pinehurst No. 2 but planned to be there this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is it's going to be shaved around the greens,''
said Duval, who is expected to play despite burning his hand on a
teapot Friday. ``You know when you go to the US Open you have to
hit it on the fairway and you need to hit it on the green. That's
what I'm going to try to do. I'll figure out a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This should be a special US Open. There may be eight courses at
the Pinehurst resort, but there is only one No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Hines of West Roxbury, who has been involved with Jack
Nicklaus in every phase of the Golden Bear's business operations,
teamed up with son Steve Nicklaus to buy Executive Sports
International. It does global marketing and promotion of golf
tournaments, including the 2001 US Senior Open at Salem CC, and
even the proposed new hockey rink and athletic facility at Boston
University. But the major project at the moment is the creation of
the Jack Nicklaus Museum on the campus of Ohio State. ``We have a
bid into Boston University, and we're in on the early stages with
Villanova,'' said Hines. ``The one at Villanova is for basketball,
and the one at Boston University is for hockey. We're waiting to
hear from them. We've had a couple of trips to meet with them.
We're doing the 2001 Seniors at Salem, and we're also doing the
hospitality for BankBoston at the Ryder Cup.'' ESI just opened an
office in Beverly because of all of the Boston trade. ``We have
over 40 tournaments,'' said Hines. ``We do three weeks in a row in
Japan, and we help bring in an international field. We usually
bring in about a dozen for each tournament.'' Hines started out in
resort management, then went to the hotel business, to consulting
for Jack Nicklaus Design, to Golden Bear Corp., to desiging
clubhouses and hiring club managers and golf pros. ``He hired me in
1988 full time at Muirfield Village and I started doing special
events for him,'' said Hines, who also oversees the Golden Bear
Tour, a minitour on which Duval's father, Bob, tuned up for the PGA
Senior Tour. ``We have 17 events, and it just kicked off in Florida
for the fourth year,'' said Hines. ``It's been a huge success.'' .
. . Mike Weir, a native of Sarnia, Ontario, who hits the ball from
the left side, said at the Memorial he wrote to Nicklaus when he
was 11, asking for golf advice. He was stunned to get a reply. ``I
saw that it had his signature on it and I was thrilled,'' said
Weir. ``I still have it at home, framed.'' Weir played his way into
the Memorial and finished 66_285 for joint 24th . . . George
Strode, who will retire as executive sports editor of the Columbus
Dispatch this year, covered his 94th round of the Memorial _ every
round since its inception, including the early ones for the
Associated Press. He has dignified the tournament with his presence
. . . Nicklaus was impressed by young Spaniard Sergio Garcia after
a practice round. Nicklaus is 59, Garcia 19. ``I had no idea how
good a player he was,'' said Nicklaus. ``I knew he was going to be
good, but he's a little bit better than I thought. It's his
composure, and the general makeup of his whole game. He's long.
He's very accurate. He's got a marvelous short game. He's well
beyond his years.'' Will Garcia be a captain's pick for the
European side in the Ryder Cup in September? ``They'd be crazy not
to pick him,'' said Nicklaus . . . Curtis Strange, who won the 1988
US Open at The Country Club and defended successfully at Oak Hill
the next year, made a sustained run at the Memorial. ``I'm a little
surprised at some of the putts I've made,'' said Strange, who
spends more time in the broadcast booth these days. ``To do well
out here, though, you have to eat, sleep, and prepare. If you
don't, I don't think you can do your very best. I can't do it
anymore. I can only play between 15 and 16 tournaments, and for me
that's not enough to be competitive.''

NO VIP TREATMENT FOR VET

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the interest of fairness, we must assume the worst about
Robert Deheer, a 77-year-old war hero.
</P>
<P>
   In order to give the benefit of the doubt to representatives of
the Veterans Affairs Department, we should take for granted that
Deheer is a stubborn, argumentative, even abusive man.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   We should presume he's physically threatening, at least as much
as a man can be at his age and with his infirmities, which require
him to park his car in handicapped spots.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where the trouble began.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Deheer decided to drive to the Carl T. Hayden
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix to have his hearing aids
adjusted. It's a problem that goes back to World War II, when
Deheer found himself a little too close to shell concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to the VA and like always the lot is almost all full,''
he said. ``So I drive around and around and can't find a
handicapped spot near the building. Nothing close enough for me to
walk to comfortably. Then I spot these two parking places close to
the building marked `VIP.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to Deheer, he was approached by a security officer
with the VA when he tried to pull into one of the spots. (I'm told
the spaces were reserved that day for federal inspectors.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, `Who are the VIPs?' '' Deheer said, ``And she
told me, `Not you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No one from the VA would speak directly about what happened
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, because his trial has not occurred, we have to
wait until due process has happened until we can make any
comment,'' said hospital spokeswoman Paula Pedene. &QL; 
NOT EVEN FOR A MINUTE
</P>
<P>
   Three security officers eventually were involved. Deheer said he
asked if he could park in one of the VIP spots just for a minute in
order to use the rest room, then promised to move on.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   While not speaking directly to Deheer's claims, Pedene said the
hospital has a policy of accommodating anyone in such distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't understand what the big deal was,'' Deheer said.
``So, yeah, I was arguing with them. Then I said forget it. I got
back in my car and was going to drive away when two guards came
over and said they were arresting me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was handcuffed and placed in a security van. Deheer said he
could no longer control his bladder and urinated on himself. He
said he was taken to a holding cell and handcuffed to a bench,
where he waited for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Guards issued him two citations, one for $20 for failing to
comply with an officer's request, the other a $50 charge of
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way I will ever pay either fine,'' Deheer said.
``I have never been arrested for anything in my life, until this. I
can't believe it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Deheer contacted attorney Michael Rooney, who requested a
hearing on the charges before a federal magistrate. It's scheduled
for July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sickened by what happened to Bob Deheer,'' Rooney said.
``This is a man who nearly lost his life fighting for his country,
and this is how we're going to treat him?'' &QL; 
DIFFICULT FOR GUARDS
</P>
<P>
   It must be difficult for security guards who find themselves
confronted by someone making a scene, perhaps jamming up a parking
lot. But even if, for safety's sake, they decided to haul away
Deheer, why charge him?
</P>
<P>
   Why not just calm him down and send him on his way? Or better
yet, why not let him park in one of the reserved spots and avoid
the whole mess?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Deheer was a machine-gunner in France. During an enemy
assault in the fall of 1944, another gunner abandoned his weapon
and Deheer took over and helped fight off the attack. He eventually
was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't make someone a VIP, what does? &QL;

SENATOR'S MOM KEEPS `JOHNNY' IN LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He's introduced around town as ``Senator'' or ``Mr.
Chairman'' or ``The Honorable John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   His mom still calls him `'Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She keeps me on the straight and narrow,'' says McCain, a
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but Roberta McCain, 87, could have scolded the
white-haired Arizona Republican, a former Vietnam War POW and
winner of the Silver Star for bravery, for cursing at the guards in
the Hanoi prison camps where he was held from October 1967 until
March 1973? She learned about the profanity in a magazine article
years later, but was still fired up about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I'm coming over there and wash your mouth out with
soap,' '' John recently told a National Press Club audience that
included his mother. ``I said, `But, Mom, these were very bad
guys.' And she said, `That's no excuse. I never taught you to use
such language under any circumstances.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like her son, Roberta McCain possesses a sly, self-deprecating
sense of humor and the toughness that comes from years of seeing
loved ones placed in harm's way in military action. But unlike the
Arizona senator, his mom, a striking woman, shuns the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to her camera shyness, she has rarely, if ever, told the
story in public about the day in 1967 when the phone rang in London
and a naval aviator said two U.S. planes had been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, apparently, was John's.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta McCain and her husband, Jack, were getting dressed for a
party at the Iranian embassy. He was commander in chief of U.S.
naval forces in Europe. He had just been elevated to the rank of
full admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Carol (McCain's first wife) and said, `I think he's
been shot down. What do you think?' She said, `I think the same
thing,' '' Roberta said.
</P>
<P>
   She found out the next day that John had ejected from the plane,
parachuted into a Hanoi lake, and was a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine that that was good news? It all depends where
you're standing, I guess. For 12 to 16 hours, we just assumed he
was dead.'' &QL; 
PREPARED FOR TRAGEDY
</P>
<P>
   She said she never was in denial about what was unfolding,
accepting each piece of news for what it was, and helped by her
faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen people who wouldn't accept reality. That just leads
to unhappiness. I'm pragmatic, I guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she said, she had always been prepared for the
eventuality of tragedy. ``My husband chose his profession, and my
son chose his profession. I take the view that you stand up and be
counted for what you believe in.'' And she said she believed in the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to tell her story on the A&AMP;E television network,
which invited her to be interviewed for a 60-minute biography of
John McCain, 62. She also turned down an invitation to appear in a
``60 Minutes'' profile of her son, or to have her picture taken
especially for this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time a picture of me looks like somebody they dug
up who'd been down in the grave for seven days, and the worst of it
is, it looks exactly like me,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But, with no cameras in sight, she relaxes. Sometimes, she calls
visitors ``honey.'' Even the ``Arizona Republic'' reporter who
interviewed her finds himself invited over for tea. &QL; 
SHE'S NOT FOOLED
</P>
<P>
   At the National Press Club speech in May, she cracked up
reporters by chiding the senator for turning down the wrong
corridor after his address was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder he got shot down (in Vietnam),'' she quipped at the
time. `'He can't even find his way to the elevators.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the remark later, she laughs and says: ```See, my
children don't have me fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Roberta Wright grew up in Los Angeles and attended
finishing school with her sister, who is her identical twin.
Roberta later lived in Washington, London and New York City, where
her husband served as military adviser to the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The library in her Washington, D.C., apartment contains ``stacks
and stacks'' of memorabilia, including photos of her husband posing
with Presidents Nixon and Johnson and other chief executives. Last
week, she said, she asked former President Ford at a luncheon to
sign an old photo featuring himself and Jack McCain, and he gladly
complied.
</P>
<P>
   She also enjoyed telling how she christened a ship in 1952 named
for her father-in-law, John Sidney McCain, who was also an admiral
and with whom she was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had another story that was more interesting than
the one I was looking for,'' said Mark Salter, John McCain's chief
of staff. He and the senator recently completed a book, ``Faith of
My Fathers,'' that focuses on the McCain family's military history.
It is due out in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just run the tape recorder and let her talk. We got all
sorts of great anecdotes. She's got a very good eye,'' Salter
said. &QL; 
PRESIDENTIAL CREDENTIALS
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died on a plane returning from Europe in 1981; they
had been married 48 years and had three children, including John.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta believes her son's background _ his military record and
a career in the U.S. House and Senate _ provides him the
credentials to be president. He is the chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that every mother, when the baby is born, assumes
their baby is going to be president. I never had thought about it,
but the more I do think about it, I think Johnny is the best
qualified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She follows politics on C-SPAN and in the newspapers, and says
she keeps an open mind. ``I try to educate myself on both sides of
a subject in politics. And without anybody else telling me what to
do, I try to arrive at an intelligent conclusion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But usually I'm wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't be making many campaign appearances. She said she is
too thin-skinned to be a politician, and too reticent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever heard that expression, `a yellow-bellied
coward?' You're talking to one,'' she said. &QL; 
HER OWN AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason, too, why she'll stay on the
sidelines during the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Like her son _ and this may be the most profound similarity
between the two _ Roberta McCain is fiercely independent. Her
agenda is her own.
</P>
<P>
   She plays bridge, cooks, sews. And she travels all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   She goes to Turkey and Jordan and India. She travels so much
that she keeps a car in Europe, staying for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can count on me for anything because I love traveling.
When you're as old as I am, you'd better make hay while the sun
shines. Time's a wastin'.'' &QL;

STARS OVERCOME INJURIES, SABRES, 2-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The Stars might have pulled the wool over the
NHL world Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly buffaloed the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Modanogate _ the Mike Modano injury saga _ turned into a Trojan
horse of sorts for the Stars as Modano played brilliantly with a
left wrist that still might or might not be broken and the Stars
bludgeoned the Sabres in a 2-1 game that wasn't as close as the
score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals gives the Stars
a 2-1 edge in the best-of-seven series. It also returns home-ice
advantage to the Stars and takes away the playoff mystique of
Marine Midland Arena, where the Sabres were 7-0 heading into
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to go down 2-1 in this building, knowing their
history in the playoffs here is so strong that would have given
them huge momentum,'' said winger Dave Reid, who assisted on both
Stars goals. ``It was something we talked about, and really we
focused on putting all our effort out there tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did, overcoming Modano's sore wrist, an early groin
injury to winger Brett Hull and a hard-charging Sabres team that
coach Lindy Ruff said ``played a bad hockey game.'' In taking the
victory, the Stars outshot the Sabres, 29-12, forced 25 giveaways
and blocked 19 shots.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sabres hemmed and hawed about how to check Modano _
who came out as a left wing to start the game then quickly moved
back to center on the top line _ Joe Nieuwendyk and linemates Dave
Reid and Jamie Langenbrunner controlled the game, scored two goals
and delivered he knockout punch the Stars needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great, and they've been great,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``What people don't realize is that the lightest
person on that line is 195 pounds (Langenbrunner). They're a big
line that doesn't mind paying the price and fighting for their
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored his 10th and 11th of the playoffs, leading the
NHL. Langenbrunner is second in NHL playoff goal scoring with 10.
Nieuwendyk tied an NHL record (set by Joe Sakic of the Colorado
Avalanche in 1996) with his sixth game-winning goal of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was a huge performance to take the pressure off of
Modano, who himself came up with a huge game, playing almost 19
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have both lines going, that's when we're incredibly
hard to check'' said Reid. ``Check last year's playoffs, if you
know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nieuwendyk was lost for the playoffs in the first
game with a knee injury. The Stars eventually couldn't score enough
to beat the Detroit Red Wings. Saturday night, they outlasted red
hot Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek by throwing both lines at him all
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres scored first on Stu Barnes goal at the 7:51 mark of
the second period. But the Stars bounced back when Langenbrunner
put together a tremendous shift of forechecking and Nieuwendyk was
able to bat in his own rebound at the 15:33 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams went into the third period tied and Nieuwendyk
scored the game-winner at the 9:35 mark when Langenbrunner lifted a
perfect pass from behind the net into the slot and Nieuwendyk
lifted a wrist shot over Hasek, who had hit the ice expecting a low
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a goal-scorer's goal,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all intents, it ended a game in which the Stars
overcame eight penalties. The Sabres went 0-for-8 in the game with
the man advantage, including a power play in the final two minutes
for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau, Mike Keane, Modano, Jere Lehtinen and a host of
defensemen were exceptional on the penalty kill. But, as Hitchcock
said, every player was exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our best game of the playoffs, I mean everybody came
out and really, really gave a superior effort,'' Hitchcock said.
``In that third period, we just wanted it bad, we wanted to get a
win here.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Stars give the Sabres their first consecutive
defeats in the playoffs and put them down in a series for the first
time in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first chunk of adversity we are going to have to
face,'' Ruff said. ``They gave us a darn good lesson there.'' nn

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
A previous engagement kept Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. from
taking his customary seat behind home plate Saturday night. But
before McLane left the Astrodome on Friday night, he asked Jose
Lima to get him a win.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No problem, boss,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   When you're pitching as well as Lima, nothing seems to be a
problem. The emerging staff ace withstood an early deficit long
enough for the offense to rescue him in a 3-2 victory over the San
Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Lima struck out a season-high 10 batters and allowed six hits in
eight innings. The crowd of 39,893 saluted Lima with a standing
ovation as he left the mound at the start of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly his house for the night, as evidenced by signs
bearing messages such as ``Cy Lima'' and ``Lima Time.'' But after
throwing a season-high 132 pitches, Lima's time had run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Billy time,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   As in closer Billy Wagner, who struck out two of the four
batters he faced for his second save in two nights and his 16th of
the season. But as good as Wagner was, he knew the night belonged
to Lima, who joined Boston's Pedro Martinez as the only 11-game
winners in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lima pitched a heck of a game,'' said Wagner, who hasn't
allowed a run in his past 9 innings. ``To be honest, I hate
watching him pitch when he does his antics, but I've talked to guys
like Barry Bonds, and they understand that he's having fun. I
wouldn't do it, but he's having fun and he's backing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima was the beneficiary of another rock-solid defensive
performance by the Astros _ particularly second baseman Craig
Biggio and shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, both of whom made late bids
for ESPN's Sunday night Plays of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   But Lima's best supporter was catcher Paul Bako, who broke a 2-2
tie with a home run off former Astro Donne Wall in the seventh
inning. It was Bako's first home run in an Astros uniform and his
first since Sept. 5, 1998, when he was playing for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who improved to 11-8 in one-run games, have won 10
of their last 12 at the Astrodome and eight of their last 11
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to credit my teammates,'' said Lima, who has held
opponents to a .193 batting average over his last six starts.
``They played great defense behind me, and they scored enough runs
for us to win. I want everyone to know this game was for Drayton.
He's been going through a lot, and I want him to know that I'm
behind him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was just as strongly behind Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fans were unbelievable,'' he said. ``Getting that
standing ovation was the best feeling ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima breezed through the first four batters of the game but
worked himself into a jam after allowing a single and a walk with
one out in the second inning. A wild pitch gave the Padres runners
at second and third with two outs, but Lima struck out third
baseman George Arias to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   After he struck out Arias, Lima did his now-famous slide step
before heading toward the dugout. Arias appeared to mutter
something to Lima, but that was the extent of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things he does rub a lot of guys the wrong way,''
said Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn, who was activated from the
disabled list before the game. ``But I think he just does that to
keep himself focused. He's 11-2; he must be doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres broke through in the third when Eric Owens started a
two-out rally with a double to left. Gwynn singled Owens home and
scored easily on a double by Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their key players are out, but they still have a good
club,'' Lima said of the Padres. ``After I gave up the those two
runs, I knew I couldn't just give up. I knew if I could hang in
there, the guys would score some runs for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo started the comeback with a towering home run to
left field to lead off the fifth. It was Hidalgo's 12th home run,
ranking him second to Jeff Bagwell (20) among the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Bagwell doubled off reliever Will Cunnane
and scored on Carl Everett's two-out triple to left-center field.
Everett leads the Astros with a .426 batting average with runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being up there with runners in scoring position,''
said Everett, who has been battling cold symptoms. ``I think that's
how you should be judged. If you're driving in runs in those
situations, you're doing a good job. I really don't care about
batting averages; it's all about run production.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Saturday afternoon, the Comets hung their second straight WNBA
championship banner from the Compaq Center rafters and got their
second set of rings from commissioner Val Ackerman.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day should have been reserved for nothing more than high
spirits and good times. And the afternoon was filled with emotion
as the Comets, after the pre-game celebrations, fed off their
feelings to run over the Washington Mystics 88-63 before a sellout
crowd of 16,285 for the home opener.
</P>
<P>
   But gaiety was mixed with sadness as the absence of
cancer-stricken point guard Kim Perrot hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out tonight when they introduced me,'' said coach Van
Chancellor, ``and I kind of broke down on the bench when I got my
ring. That just brought back so many great memories. I thought we
were a little bit emotionally drained at the start of the game. But
we came back, and to get our rings, raise the banner and win like
we did, what a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, who set a league record with 15 consecutive wins
last year, used dominant defense and high-octane offense from
Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson to record their
second straight victory of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes scored 21 points and had six assists, five rebounds and
three steals, but her biggest contribution might have been on
defense. She held heralded rookie Chamique Holdsclaw to 3-for-14
shooting and six points before Chancellor turned the game over to
his reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's 24 points led all scorers, and she clamped down on
Nikki McCray (2-for-13 shooting, nine points).
</P>
<P>
   The Comets held the Mystics to 39.7 percent shooting (23-for-58)
and scored 26 points off 21 Mystics turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The win was in contrast to the Comets' 68-64 preseason loss to
the Mystics on June 3, when McCray and Holdsclaw combined to help
Washington overcome a five-point deficit with less than two minutes
to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's win came in the wake of a heavy emotional
outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my ring, all I could think about was Kim Perrot,''
Chancellor said, ``what a wonderful person she's been, how much
she's meant, how much I really wanted her here so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot missed the celebration and victory as she continues to
wage her battle with cancer. But there were other reasons for
emotions. Cooper talked afterward about how tough it was to play
knowing that her mother, who died of breast cancer during the
offseason, wasn't in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed my mom and the fact she didn't get a chance to
be in the celebration of the raising of the banner,'' Cooper said.
``I really hate that Kim wasn't here. All of the different feelings
and emotions just came to me right before we walked out to receive
our rings.''
</P>
<P>
   There was reason for Swoopes to feel melancholy, too. She went
through a divorce during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional for lots of reasons,'' she said. ``And
to me, the biggest thing was that Kim was not here today. She was
so successful in everything we did last year. I was used to hearing
her in the locker room, pumping everybody up, just being Kim. Then,
to walk out there, the fans cheering us on, I was kind of
reminiscing, going back to everything we went through last year as
a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being back-to-back champions and being a part of history, the
ceremony for me was more emotional because I feel that I
contributed to last year's championship more than the year before.
And then, just to kind of think back, Eric (Jackson, her former
husband) was very supportive of me. He was at every game. And just
to know it's completely different this year
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's something that as the season goes on and we play more
games, I'll be able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Comets mauled the Mystics from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets led 44-33 at halftime, then used an 18-5 run early in
the second period to take control. Back-to-back treys by Thompson
(15 points, seven rebounds) and Swoopes ended the run and gave the
Comets a commanding 64-40 lead with 12:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that run Holdsclaw had perhaps her most
confounding moments of a befuddling debut on national television.
She missed a 3-point attempt with Cooper grabbing the rebound.
Then, following Swoopes' 3-pointer, Holdsclaw missed a layup, with
Cooper again snaring the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Holdsclaw, the No. 1 pick in the 1999 WNBA draft
from Tennessee, was 2-for-13 from the floor. She did finish with a
game-high 13 rebounds and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holdsclaw and McCray are two very talented players,'' Cooper
said. ``We knew to win we would have to stop them. Not only did we
stop them, but I think this team did a tremendous job overall. We
were able to do a lot of things, once we got good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chancellor turned to his reserves during most of the
final seven minutes, matters only got worse for the Mystics, who
got 13 points from Shalonda Enis and 10 from Murriel Page.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' Jennifer Rizzotti, playing for the first time in the
regular season, came off the bench and fired in a 3-pointer with
6:41 left that put the Comets up 79-48.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the final emotions the Comets experienced would indeed be
joy and euphoria.

Odd how we never saw this coming. It seems such an obvious, perfect
script.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs rolled to the NBA Finals with an almost
unblemished run. They were the league's best team, unrelenting,
certain. But somehow, we never saw the ascension of the New York
Knicks coming.
</P>
<P>
   The last team in the playoffs with their franchise center
limping, then out, somehow the Knicks seemed like little more than
a made-for-the-tabloids combination of rumors and demotions, an
overheated East Coast version of the dysfunction that shut down the
Lakers and Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   But now it makes perfect sense, as if it were _ to use the word
both toss around so confidently _ destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday night in San Antonio, the Knicks and Spurs
will bring together in the NBA Finals the nation's largest market
and one of the league's smallest.
</P>
<P>
   The Finals will pit a team that thrives on controversy and one
whose idea of discord is arguing over the out-of-bounds flowers on
David Robinson's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were New York's latest wretched refuse, a misfit
collection of the dismissed (Larry Johnson), maligned (Marcus
Camby) and reviled (Latrell Sprewell).
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were labeled ``too nice,'' then won with the flawless,
selfless confluence built around a former superstar, Robinson, who
stepped aside to create a leading role for another, Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their differences, they share a 26-year wait for the
title one will win. The Spurs moved to San Antonio in 1973 while
still in the American Basketball Association; the Knicks won their
last NBA title the same year.
</P>
<P>
   And both are brimming with confidence. The Spurs had a
spectacular three-month run to the Finals, including consecutive
playoff sweeps. The Knicks defeated the series of obstacles that
had been put before them.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks arrive having exorcised the demons of previous
playoff defeats to the Pacers and Reggie Miller, and their most
heated rival, the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a team that believes in themselves, and I think
most everything else comes from that,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
said. ``That is a very together group, a very dedicated group. They
went and got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won despite the Achilles' tendon tear that cost
Patrick Ewing the past four games and the remainder of the season.
And they vanquished the Pacers on Friday, despite a second-quarter
knee sprain to Larry Johnson, the Game 3 four-point play hero and
Ewing's replacement in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks rose above each obstacle and distraction,
including the demotion of general manager Ernie Grunfeld and
continued uncertainty over coach Jeff Van Gundy's job status.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The media) buried us, covered us, started shoveling dirt on
us,'' Ewing said. ``We just believed in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson cannot play, the doubts likely will rebuild by
Wednesday, despite Friday's win taken largely without him. But the
Knicks have played so well despite injuries, Spurs guard Avery
Johnson said: ``I hope they don't lose Allan Houston next. Then
they might sweep us.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson is considered questionable to return in the
Finals. Without Johnson and Ewing, the Knicks would have to face
7-footers Duncan and Robinson with a frontcourt of Chris Dudley,
Kurt Thomas, Marcus Camby and Herb Williams, at 41 the NBA's oldest
player. Even with Camby coming off a phenomenal series against the
Pacers, the Knicks' offense, once built almost entirely around the
low post, will have no big men for whom they can run plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Eastern Conference finals) helped me prepare for this,
especially getting the Davis boys (Dale and Antonio) and (Rik)
Smits,'' Camby said. ``Those guys are big also.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely looking forward to the challenge of going
against David Robinson and Tim Duncan. I'm not going to back down
because they have a lot of All-Stars and a good team. We have a
good team also.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby is used to overcoming doubt. Acquired for fan and team
favorite Charles Oakley, Camby did not fit in Van Gundy's system
early in the season and was rarely used. He blossomed late in the
season as an active, athletic reserve, working in tandem with
another castoff, Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove me in the series was way back when I got traded,
you know, people were questioning the trade, saying I wasn't going
to get it done,'' Camby said. ``Me and Latrell took it upon
ourselves to go out there, play with heart and pride and get the
job done. Now we're where we want to be, where our goal is.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sprewell, suspended by the Warriors and vilified nationally
last season for choking his coach, the turnaround has been even
greater, from, he said, ``the bottom of the barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we play for,'' he said. ``As a kid, you sit up
and you watch TV and you're saying, `Hey, that's Michael (Jordan),
that's Larry (Bird), and James Worthy,' some of the guys you
admire. You always hope to be in this position. To actually be
going through it and experiencing it is a feeling that I've never
felt before. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Knicks' joyous Madison Square Garden party,
the Spurs celebrated their berth in the NBA Finals with a few back
slaps and high-fives. The Knicks, with a day off Saturday and three
practice days before the Finals, likely will be able to use their
emotions better than the Trail Blazers could.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, with nine days off since their sweep, will have a
different challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the glow,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie said. ``Guys
are excited; guys are feeling good about themselves. This team is
hungry and focused. We're a hungry group right here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs, despite their 11-1 playoff run, have been at the
best and hungriest when things haven't gone quite so well. Though
their struggles did not last nearly as long as those of the Knicks,
the first No. 8 seed to reach the Finals, they used a 6-8 start to
come together and grow to become the championship favorites.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a week spent as toast of their town, the Spurs
will test their ability to remain humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we operate with a little fear, we tend to be better
around here,'' Avery Johnson said. ``When we don't have fear, when
we tend to relax and think we're really good, it's been proven
we're not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Knicks are at their best when cocky. But for all
their differences, and despite their different roads to the Finals,
both teams have reason to strut on the River Walk, as if no one
else could have gotten this far.

   PODUJEVO _ 'Twas not a famous victory. And as we followed the
Yugoslav Third Army out of northern Kosovo Thursday and saw all the
young men who would have fought _ and died _ in their battle with
equally young British and Americans and French and Italians, a
terrible reality dawned upon the Serb people.
</P>
<P>
   They stood by the road, weeping and giving the retreating
soldiers the three-fingered victory salute of Serbia _ and then
they went to their homes, many of them, and packed their bedding
onto the roofs of their cars and drove away behind their soldiers
with their stiff-faced, grieving families.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the start of the Third Army's withdrawal, but it was
real enough; a juggernaut of supply trucks and armored personnel
carriers and busloads of troops and ambulances and Praga
antiaircraft gun-trucks and truckloads of soldiers in steel helmets
draped with plastic camouflage leaves.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier left with his German shepherd dog sitting beside him
in the cab of his truck, another with a photograph of old Marshal
Tito pinned to the back of his troop carrier, the founder of the
Yugoslav National Army standing at his desk in a blue suit in a
Yugoslavia long lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not Milosevic, but Tito.
</P>
<P>
   Up in Belgrade, of course, when the joy-shooting and fireworks
had died down, the pro-Milosevic television was celebrating a
``victory'' which had been achieved _ wait for it _ ``thanks to the
peaceful policy of our President, Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   An exclusive victory this, it seems, like the victory of Mark
Antony at Actium, of Custer at the Little Big Horn, like Rommel's
victory at El Alamein.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs of Kosovo _ for the tens of thousands of decent,
worthy Serbs who are not war criminals or militiamen _ it is a
tragedy of epic proportions. And for the Albanians _ deliverance,
or political betrayal?
</P>
<P>
   As we threaded our way through the 15 mile-long convoy of
Yugoslav armor and trucks humming up the highway to Raca, there was
time enough to reflect on Serbia's defeat after almost three months
of NATO air raids, after thousands of Serb deaths _ 1,600 of them
civilians _ and after the loss in action of not a single NATO
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   We drove with these soldiers through valleys and gentle fields
that might have been Kent were it not for the burned houses amid
the fields of crimson poppies.
</P>
<P>
   One home in Podujevo _ a ghost town of smashed Albanian houses
and shops with a clutch of terrified Serb civilians at a street
corner _ was still smoldering, set alight, I suspect, by four ugly,
shaven-headed, bearded men we saw in a white car.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers didn't look like the ``degraded'' army of
NATO-speak. Their soldiers smiled and gave the three-fingered
salute and sat chatting or sleeping in their trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Prizren Brigade of the Third Army were in full camouflage
kit, their faces bronzed by days in the sun and long nights in the
open. And not a single vehicle _ not a single truck or Praga or
personnel carrier _ had a single scratch on it, not even a bullet
hole.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO's bombs were destroying the Yugoslav Third Army, then a
lot of the Third Army had kept a lot of their kit and troops in
perfect condition. They left, most of them, not as a rabble but as
soldiers withdrawing in good order.
</P>
<P>
   And they would, I think, have fought had NATO come. Goran, a
young army doctor from Nis to whom I gave a lift on the way back to
Pristina _ his departure will come later - said that his greatest
concern had been KLA guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of my four best friends at Podujevo, one was shot dead by the
KLA ten days ago, another wounded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Serbia and the KLA never respected this. It is my
opinion that we should not be leaving here like this, that we
should not be withdrawing. We should have fought.''
</P>
<P>
   And he pulled out his wallet and produced every soldier's dream:
a photograph of a beautiful child with brown hair sitting on a
chair. ``She is my first daughter, Miljana, and she is just 18
months old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought of other family snapshots I had seen in Kosovo, in
the ``cleansed'' Albanian villages and beside the road to
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Here on this very road upon which I was driving, the
Independent's Albanian interpreter had undergone her moment of
terror just seven weeks ago. And all those gutted homes among the
poppy fields have created a terrible legacy of contempt as well as
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Most accounts talk of execution and rape by the paramilitaries
and by the drunken ``White Eagles'' gunmen from the Drina River.
</P>
<P>
   But those murderers contaminated _ if only by association _
every Serb who held a gun in Kosovo. And that includes the Yugoslav
army. I know Yugoslav soldiers who have been sickened by these
crimes. But they could not _ or did not _ stop them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Military officers were talking Thursday of 800 arrests of
paramilitary men by the Serb authorities, of sentences of up to 20
years for murder. They talked of one Serb gunmen sentenced for
killing an Albanian family of 15.
</P>
<P>
   A bit late, I thought. And I'd like to know more about all those
court cases and all that Serb justice meted out to the killers of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs of Kosovo tried to give their soldiers their support
as they drove away from Serbia's most sacred soil. On a road
bridge, someone had strung a banner which said: ``We live for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   At Luzane, the Prizren Brigade fired into the air with their
hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles, a spray of golden cartridge cases
falling like rain through the brown dust of the trucks. One army
truck carried a photograph of a young and half-naked woman on its
hood.
</P>
<P>
   Another bore the red, white and blue flag of Yugoslavia. A
pretty Yugoslav female soldier sat in the back of one truck, her
blonde braids hanging over her tunic. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point on the highway, three Albanian women in scarves
watched the Third Army in retreat. Thanks to NATO, these soldiers
are going. Thanks to NATO, those three women will no longer have
the chance of independence from Serbia in three years' time _ as
they were led to believe after March's Paris ``peace'' talks. For
them, too, this may not prove a famous victory. &QL;

   Yugoslavia's heavy armor and tanks and antiaircraft missiles
will be hauled up this road in the coming days and then will come
the Serb police and the paramilitaries (those of the latter who
have not already made it back to what is now called ``Serbia
proper'').
</P>
<P>
   There will follow, too, the thousands of Serbs who are
abandoning the land of their fathers, just as the Serbs fled
Krajina and eastern Croatia and eastern Bosnia. I saw them
Thursday, their little Yugo cars hugging the back of the last
convoy from Pristina, women in the back, men crammed in the front.
</P>
<P>
   The world is not going to care about their dispossession. Serve
them right, the world will say.
</P>
<P>
   And what message will they take with them to Nis and Novi Sad
and Kraljevo and Belgrade and the other bombed cities of Serbia?.
</P>
<P>
   I came across a smart young machine-gunner guarding his army's
main supply route in the shadow of an ancient Serbian church
Thursday . His black beret and camouflage tunic and webbing were
spotless, his English almost as clean.
</P>
<P>
   How did he feel, I asked? ``I am a soldier,'' he replied. ``And
I do not have political views.'' Oh but you do, I said to myself.
You do. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ So, ``Wag the Dog'' was a documentary. ``The Russians
are coming,'' a Yugoslav army captain announced to the coffee
drinkers on the Corso in Pristina Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They roared in delight and disbelief. But it was quite beyond
their comprehension that NATO forces would delay their own entry
into Kosovo over an infantile squabble about whose soldiers should
cross the frontier first.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, of course, the innocent who had to pay the price for
this farce.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Catholic church, an Albanian priest shook his head
in disbelief. ``Why hasn't NATO come?'' he pleaded. ``Things here
are very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the hill, a clutch of Albanian homes were
smoldering. And in the streets of Pristina Friday there were too
many men with guns. One of them walked into the restaurant of the
Grand Hotel on Thursday night and threatened to kill the diners.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred KLA captives were seen wandering through the city,
still dressed in their black prison uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   And the roads around Kosovo's capital were lined with civilian
cars as the Serbs of Prizren and Djakovica _ trusting in a KLA
cease-fire _ abandoned their cities for northern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what NATO wants,'' Yugoslav volunteer Private Stefan said
with contempt when I came across him near the Army club. ``They are
delaying so that the Serbs will leave and give them an
Albanian-only Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is `cleansing' us with their delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I have the nerve to explain that no, really, NATO Generals
Wesley Clark and `Mike' Jackson were rowing like children about who
goes first? I murmured something I'd heard on the BBC about
``logistics difficulties'' and Private Stefan snorted with
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as NATO hesitated _ only to find the Russians stealing their
thunder _ Kosovo was moving towards just the kind of anarchy NATO
had promised to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   When I drove the road north to Merdare Friday, the villages were
burning _ either Serb homes set alight by their departing owners or
Albanian property destroyed by Serb gunmen _ while the Third Army's
withdrawal sucked thousands of panic-stricken civilians into its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   The old city of Prizren is almost entirely empty of its Serb
inhabitants _ almost every car I saw bore a Prizren or Djakovica
license plate _ while the Serb citizens of Pristina are turning
with bitterness against their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of civilians called to halt the exodus, a tall man
in spectacles screamed at his fellow Serbs: ``You've been (screwed)
by Tito and by Milosevic _ may their descendants have bone cancer
for 12 generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along the highway out of Pristina appeared the kind
of men we had hoped not to see.
</P>
<P>
   There were tall militiamen with long hair and gunmen in black
shirts, and even the departing Yugoslav troops now displayed an
unhappy combination of regular soldiers in army uniform and bearded
men in military vehicles with slouch hats or cloths wound around
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier was waving a beer bottle in the air. Several were
driving tractors among the army convoys, pulling trailers covered
with tarpaulins. Who, I wonder, owned the tractors?
</P>
<P>
   The convoys themselves were a Boys Own of Russian weaponry, BMP
armored vehicles, tracked radar-guided antiaircraft guns and
batteries of white-tipped SAM-6 surface-to-air missiles along with
FROG ground-to-ground rockets.
</P>
<P>
   And yet again, not a single one had been scratched by NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the SAM-6 racks were empty _ the missiles must have been
fired at NATO planes _ and many of them were still covered with the
branches of the fir trees with which they had been camouflaged
during the war. Several guns had been draped with flowers, one
antiaircraft battery sprouting dark red roses from its barrels.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Serbs enjoyed Moscow's temerity in tweaking NATO's
ego, they waited in vain for the Russians to show up. It mattered
little to the families driving north, towing trailers piled with
living-room furniture and beds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the highway, a new banner has been raised. ``The only road
is the road to Kosovo,'' it says. But Friday, the only road was the
road out of Kosovo _ and the Serbs were using it to flee the land
in which they have lived for generations. &QL;

NIEUWENDYK GIVES STAR PERFORMANCE

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Mike Modano played, injured hand and all. Brett Hull
left after only three shifts because of a groin pull. The Dallas
debts piled high and then higher.
</P>
<P>
   But discipline and depth heal many wounds in the playoffs, not
to mention a pair of Joe Nieuwendyk goals, and the Dallas Stars
shrugged off adversity inside Marine Midland Arena Saturday &UR;  &LR; night
and posted a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres in Game 3 of the
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a bad hockey game,'' said Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff,
whose club mustered a franchise-low 12 shots against the Stars.
``We didn't have it. If we play like that, we're definitely going
to lose. They suffocated us.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Stars a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven
series, which resumes here Tuesday night. They now stand only two
victories away from winning their first Stanley Cup, but by that
time they could be minus a large portion of their starting cast.
None of the injuries, however, seem to have an effect. No matter
how many parts fall off, the distant sons of Norm Green's Minnesota
North Stars just seem to draw tighter on defense and find ways to
win.
</P>
<P>
   The key find Saturday &UR;  &LR; night was the pair of goals by
Nieuwendyk, who centered a line with Jamie Langenbrunner and
ex-Bruin Dave Reid. Assisted on both goals by his linemates,
Nieuwendyk erased a 1-0 deficit at 15:33 of the second period and
then popped home the winner with a sparkling wrister to the top
right corner halfway through the third. It gave the former Flame
six game-winners this postseason, tying the mark established by
Colorado's Joe Sakic in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in with a purpose,'' said Nieuwendyk, who played only
two minutes of last year's playoffs before San Jose defenseman
Bryan Marchment ripped up one of his knees with a hit from behind.
``We wanted to play a simple game. With guys on our team like Craig
Ludwig, Guy Carbonneau, and Mike Keane, guys who've been through it
all before, there's no panic on our bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo bench, meanwhile, looked like a herd of deer caught
in the headlights of the spaceship in ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind.'' With a packed house of 18,595 screaming and shaking
white pompoms, they came out with their least inspiring game of the
playoffs. After winning seven straight on home ice, they came out
with a clunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first chunk of adversity that we're going to have to
face,'' said Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their poor, seemingly timid play, the Sabres did manage
a 1-0 lead. Former Penguin Stu Barnes skated into the slot and
fired home a deflected pass from Richard Smehlik at 7:51 of the
second period. Sabres, 1-0, and Hull already had said goodnight
after injurying his groin. All the breaks were conspiring in favor
of the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   No one gave that bit of bad news to the Stars. Led by Nieuwendyk
and a wall-to-wall defensive game that covered nearly every inch of
the ice, the Stars ignored the obit that was being written before
their eyes. They clogged the middle and blocked shots. In fact,
they blocked 19 shots, seven more than the Sabres could put on
Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our team,'' said Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock.
``They played with poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's first goal came after Hasek turned back his
forehand attempt from the slot. As he was about to crash to the ice
following a Rhett Warrener check, Nieuwendyk swept a backhander
under the fallen Hasek. Tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner made the key play on the winner, shaking off a
trailing Curtis Brown with a sharp stop and turn along the goal
line. Nieuwendyk shimmied into the slot, collected Langenbrunner's
feed and with a snatch and jerk lifted the winner to the top shelf
with John Bucyk-like perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret,'' said Ludwig, admiring his
teammate's goal, ``that with this goalie you have to shoot high _
he takes away the bottom of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went 0 for 8 on the power play. A frustrated Modano
was caught for three minor penalties alone in the second period.
The Stars gave them every opportunity to get ahead early, but the
Sabres kept handling the puck like some oversize curling stone. The
Sabres got off 24 shots total, and missed the net on half, the
majority of those coming on the power play. By contrast, the Stars
missed the net on only four of their 33 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done yet,'' said Nieuwendyk, the favorite in the
Dallas room to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP. ``But
we took a real big step.''

PUNCHLESS RED SOX TAKE IT ON THE CHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He struck out twice in a game for only the third time
this season, after striking out just seven times in his previous 23
games.
</P>
<P>
   He hit into a double play for just the fifth time this season.
And it was the first time in 1999 he's whiffed and hit into a
double play in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   By anyone's criteria, it was a lousy afternoon. By the exacting
standards Nomar Garciaparra has set for himself, it was a
five-alarm fire, a nationally televised exercise in futility that
mocked the promotional print ad the Fox Network ran before this 4-2
loss to &UR;  &LR; the Mets, one in which Garciaparra's face was superimposed
on the body of a prizefighter exchanging punches with Mets slugger
Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, while Garciaparra and the rest of the struggling
Boston hitters (.211 average and 28 runs in 10 games this month)
offered little more than a baseball version of the rope-a-dope, the
Mets threw all the body punches in sending the Sox to their sixth
loss in seven games and seventh in their last nine. Solo home runs
by Benny ``And The Mets'' Agbayani and Robin Ventura off Sox
starter Pat Rapp and another by John Olerud off reliever Mark
Guthrie accounted for three of their runs.
</P>
<P>
   When Garciaparra falters, especially the day after he had just
one infield hit in six at-bats against the Mets, the inclination is
to search for a cause-and-effect explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt? Nope, at least nothing beyond the aches that are part of
his daily routine, and certainly nothing as obvious as the strained
groin and bad knee with which John Valentin is trying to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tired? Wouldn't be surprised, manager Jimy Williams said, given
that (1) it takes an act of God to keep Garciaparra out of the
lineup, and (2) the Sox were back at the ballpark Saturday morning
about 10 hours after winning in 12 innings the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired? Yeah, I'm tired, but it's part of the game,'' said
Garciaparra, who has just three hits in his last 17 at-bats, has
not homered in his last 11 games, and has just three RBIs in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never ask (for a day off). I don't make that decision. I
prepare myself day in and day out to play. It's my job to get ready
to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox didn't advance a runner to second base until the sixth
inning, and then only because Mets starter Al Leiter made a bad
throw on an easy force play.
</P>
<P>
   Only once all afternoon did they have more than one hit in an
inning. That was in the seventh, when Troy O'Leary had their only
extra-base hit, a double sandwiched between singles by Damon Buford
and Creighton Gubanich, and the Sox scored both of their runs to
draw within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis then worked Leiter for a full-count walk, but Jason
Varitek, pinch hitting for Rapp, popped out weakly on a
``foshball,'' a pitch Leiter has only recently taken to throwing,
one he describes as a batting-practice fastball that throws
righthanded hitters off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman walked and stole second with Garciaparra at the
plate in the eighth, but Mets reliever Armando Benitez fanned
Garciaparra with a split-fingered fastball and Mike Stanley flied
to left.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud took Guthrie deep in the bottom of the inning to make it
4-2. O'Leary hit a broken-bat single with one out in the ninth, but
Mets closer John Franco, beaten by the Sox Friday, closed them out
for his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra shook his head when asked if he were trying to do
too much in the absence of any sustained attack by the rest of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling myself,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to get
some hits, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on myself, battling myself to feel comfortable. I
hit a couple hard, but right at people. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   A reshuffling of the lineup isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hit the pitcher eighth, I'm not going to do
that,'' said Williams, invoking the strategy employed on occasion
by Cardinals manager Tony La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just keep playing hard, and good things are going to
happen. We get pitching like that, we're going to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who beat Franco with a single Friday in the 12th but
has just one RBI in eight games, also suggested the Sox can't dwell
on their recent failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have short memories,'' he said. ``That's the only
way to do it.''

HERMOSILLO SPARKS GALAXY VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ He only needed one look and one whip of his
right foot to get started _ but with it, Carlos Hermosillo may have
pushed the right buttons to get the Los Angeles Galaxy going again
following a convincing season debut.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it alone, midfielders Simon Elliott and Roy Myers
made their best contributions of the season, but Hermosillo's 32nd
minute goal fueled Los Angeles' attack as they held on to defeat
MLS champion Chicago 2-1 in front of a Hermosillo-inflated crowd of
18,102 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great tonight,'' said Hermosillo, playing with Los
Angeles for the first time since Chicago eliminated them last
season in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it took me nine games to get my first goal and this
year I got one right away which is always great,'' he said. ``It's
only one game but I liked how we played and how everyone got
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a big victory considering it came without Cobi Jones
and Robin Fraser, who are both with the U.S. National team
preparing for today's friendly against Argentina in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid called it one of the best performances
of the season, explaining that the addition of Hermosillo open's
the field offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it helps that he (Hermosillo) can finish but what also
helps is that Carlos is a presence and a known scorer,'' said
Schmid. ``The opposition ties up people with Carlos and Carlos is
such a smart player not only on the goal but he's in there on
combinations and he makes good passes to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The two goals gave the Galaxy its first multiple scoring game of
the season and ran L.A.'s record to 10-0 in games where Hermosillo
nets either a goal or assist. The victory also moves the Galaxy
(7-6, 15 points) to within three points of the third place Fire
(6-6, 18 points), giving the club its second straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid praised the play of recently acquired midfielders Elliott
and Myers, who offer playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos solid relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy's a big plus because when teams try to take away
Cienfuegos we have somebody else we can go to,'' said Schmid. ``And
in Simon, we found somebody who can playmake for us on a deeper
part of the field, which makes it easier for Mauricio as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had to play short-handed most of the second half
after defender Paul Caligiuri was ejected in the 51st minute for
sticking his leg at Fire midfielder Manuel Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri may have been frustrated for failing to contain
Chicago striker Josh Wolff to start the second half. With the
Galaxy leading 2-0, Wolff easily sprinted around Caligiuri on a
long pass behind both of them. Caligiuri took a last second stab at
Wolff, but he couldn't get there, allowing Wolff to beat Galaxy
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman to the far post in the 47th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy led 1-0 thanks to perhaps its best work of the season
midway through the first half. The play started when Danny Pena
sent a pass in front of the penalty arc for Elliott. Elliott let
the ball run through his legs for a trailing Roy Myers, then kept
heading toward the Chicago goal.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was able to give the ball to Elliott as he entered the
penalty area. As soon as the Chicago defense closed, Elliott sent a
pass out to Hermosillo, unmarked on the right side. Hermosillo beat
Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton, hitting the inside left-post to
give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy went up 2-0 in the waning seconds of the first half.
Cienfuegos sent a long cross to Elliott to the left of the Fire
goal. Elliott finished by beating Thornton to the far post.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Mike Modano, he of the celebrated wrist, was game
but not totally effective. Brett Hull, who provided the difference
in Game 2, departed with a groin injury after playing just two
minutes, leaving another void.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With these Stanley Cup Finals at a crossroads _ Game 3 of a
best-of-seven series tied at one game apiece _ the Dallas Stars
showed up at Marine Midland Arena in search of another hero
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The search turned up an old one: Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done yet,'' the Stars center said after his second
goal of the night, 9 minutes, 35 seconds into the final period,
proved the difference in a 2-1 Dallas win over the Buffalo Sabres.
``But after this one, we're a step closer.''
</P>
<P>
   In another ``biggest game of the season'' for a team accustomed
to tight spots, it was fitting Nieuwendyk would be a
difference-maker as the Stars won a second straight game and
regained the home-ice advantage they lost in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he missed all but one playoff game after suffering a
knee injury in the opening game of the first-round series with San
Jose. As Dallas' offense ground to a halt in the Western Conference
finals against Detroit, one of the team's more skilled players
could only sit and watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt like he got cheated last year,'' defenseman Craig
Ludwig said. ``But he's making the best of it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Modano limited and Hull gone, the Stars needed Nieuwendyk
to come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Mike is hurt,'' he said. ``When you lose a guy
like Brett Hull, too, it's tough. This shows a little bit about the
character of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was hardly alone in that regard as Modano took a
painkilling shot to a left wrist the club still officially refuses
to term broken _ a stance coach Ken Hitchcock reiterated Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a circus, isn't it?'' Modano said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   So is it broken or isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll just go along with Hitch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Stars could afford a few sideshows after a win
that ended Buffalo's streak of seven home victories in this
season's playoffs. In the course of things, the Sabres' previously
deadly power play fizzled on all eight opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to explain,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``We
were pretty tight. We were squeezing the sticks pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Stars) did a number on us tonight. They gave us a
darn good lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 is here Tuesday night, with Buffalo facing a virtual
must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, this hardly seemed Dallas' night. Modano's status made
a tense situation all the more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody expected him to play,'' Hitchcock said.
``Even at 65 percent, he could do some things for us out there. We
really knew boarding the airplane yesterday that he was a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, injured in a collision in the third period of Game 2,
played with a cast. But Hull left early and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to play tomorrow, he (Hull) wouldn't be a player,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas weathered the emotion of an excited crowd and a team
playing its first game of the series at home, but the Stars didn't
help themselves by picking up four first-period penalties that kept
much of the play in their end.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, goalie Ed Belfour, who faced only 12 shots, had
little to do with keeping things even in the early stages. On a
night when Stars defenders blocked 19 shots, Buffalo got just three
on net in the opening period despite spending 5:45 with at least a
one-man advantage and the final 1:14 with a two-man edge.
</P>
<P>
   The lone Sabres goal was a quick-strike effort on which Belfour
guessed wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Having handled just four shots to that point, he bit on a fake
by Richard Smehlik, who shuffled the puck over to Stu Barnes. With
Belfour out of position, Barnes wristed a shot into a virtually
open net for his sixth goal of the playoffs at 7:51 of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars continued to hamper their own cause with penalties,
and an increasingly frustrated Modano picked up two minors in the
span of less than three minutes and three in the second period
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it appeared the Sabres had matters in hand, Dallas
struck back. On a nice feed from Jamie Langenbrunner, Nieuwendyk
had a point-blank shot that Dominik Hasek (29 shots, 27 saves)
managed to stop but could not control. The Dallas center reached
back in and poked the rebound into the net to tie the score at 1 at
15:33, his 10th goal of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first goal was just hard work,'' Hitchcock said. ``But
that second one _ that's a goal-scorer's goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Nieuwendyk came through. And again, Langenbrunner did the
dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Langenbrunner dug the puck out from behind the
Buffalo net and got it out front, where Nieuwendyk found himself in
a staredown with Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie generally considered the best in the world blinked,
and Nieuwendyk lifted the puck high and to Hasek's left, just under
the crossbar, for his sixth game-winner of the playoffs, tying the
record set by Colorado's Joe Sakic in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Dallas was in control of these Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``We've got a special group
of guys here.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one of them needed to be just a little more special
Saturday night, Nieuwendyk was happy to oblige.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HE'S earning a national reputation as baseball's Mambo King, and,
yes, Mambo King fits him well.
</P>
<P>
   But let's call him something else, too. He is Jose Lima, the
Human Dinner Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Pencil in Lima for a 7:05 p.m. start, and you're pretty much
assured of having a table around 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   He works like he dances _ fast. He plays the game the way his
music plays in the Astros' clubhouse _ bouncing all over the place
in waves of rumbling beats.
</P>
<P>
   He secures wins so fast and efficiently, even Parrotheads like
Astros manager Larry Dierker have found a sort of
cheeseburger-in-paradise affinity for the merengue music Lima
blares in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the words are,'' Dierker said, ``but I know
how the sounds go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeff Bagwell after Saturday night's 3-2 Lima fest, as
riveting drumbeats and trumpets sounded in the background: ``The
whole team is learning the words to this stuff. It's getting kind
of crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting to where you'd have to be crazy not to believe Lima
no longer is a novelty. He no longer simply is the Ricky Martin of
the major leagues, a cup of life spilling all over the field and
filling the stands with fans ready to rumba.
</P>
<P>
   He is the image of what the big leagues should be.
</P>
<P>
   If only more people started acting more like Lima and less like
San Diego's George Arias and others who get their jocks all wound
up every time Lima slide-steps across the mound after a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   If only, like Lima, everyone in the game acted as if he were
giddy about being a big-leaguer. If only fewer clung to the game's
antiquated tradition of showing all the emotion of a rosin bag.
</P>
<P>
   If only more players punched their fists into the air, danced
off the field after a big moment and screamed with joy at the
heavens whenever they felt like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an entertainer,'' Bagwell said of Lima. ``He doesn't do
anything to show anybody up, or even just for the fans. He's
enjoying every minute of this. He's loco.''
</P>
<P>
   And baseball should be loco for Lima, instead of appalled at him
like some are. He is attracting fans to the Astrodome. He is
putting up W's. He is having an All-Star year. He is entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   To end the second inning of his gritty six-hit, 10-strikeout
performance over the Padres, Lima struck out Arias with a wicked
changeup. Lima clenched his fist, screamed and slid his leg across
the mound as if performing onstage.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Arias tossed his helmet to the ground, glared at
Lima and shouted a few choice words in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, get over it, George. You struck out. It was only the first
of the three K's you had on this night. Go sit down, and if you're
lucky, maybe next time you'll hit a home run off this Mambo King,
this Human Dinner Reservation, this face of what baseball's future
should be.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Lima is showing baseball is that if it's fun and
fans that the game wants, this is how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit a home run off of me, stop at every base and dance for
me,'' Lima said. ``I don't care. I'm going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He has what the game needs _ personality. Mix that with a record
that improved to 11-2 with Saturday's win, and you have why 39,893
fans spent the night shimmying right along with a pitcher whose
best stuff is an 81-mph changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, when most big-league starting pitchers would be
locking themselves into some sort of emotional air chamber, Lima
was working the room like it was his wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted fans, teased teammates. He even spiced things up by
smacking a shaving-cream pie in the face of Astros shortstop Ricky
Gutierrez, who was being interviewed on live television.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's cap was turned backward, his eyes darting back and forth
scanning the crowd. Fans chanted his name and held up banners
saying: ``It's Lima Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lima Time. And it's time more players started acting more
like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is supposed to be fun, and the way he plays it, he's
making it fun for everyone,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Why cling to those stuffy baseball ways that began back in the
days when the game was like the plumbing _ always outdoors?
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakest act in baseball,'' Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Steve
Woodard has called Lima.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after breaking to a 2-0 lead, some in the Padres'
dugout began cackling and feigning Lima's slide dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were making fun of me,'' Lima said. ``Hey, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, fine. But Lima gave up only two singles the rest of the
way, and the Padres were done. It was a head-spinning,
hip-swiveling two hours and 20 minutes. It was what the game should
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the music follows him out of the clubhouse,''
Dierker said. ``He just takes that energy out to the mound.''

BALK LIFTS ANGELS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels catcher Matt Walbeck is
probably the last guy one would expect to steal home, and he wasn't
about to try Saturday night in the eighth inning of a tie game
against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   However, his bluff from third fooled Diamondbacks reliever
Byung-Hyun Kim into a balk. When Walbeck walked in to score, the
Angels were on their way to a 4-3 win before 37,916 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn's 14th homer of the year earlier in the inning tied
the game at 3 _ a feat in itself for the Angels, who hadn't scored
more than two runs in their previous four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went into the game having lost 26 of 28 games when
they trailed after the seventh inning. But Vaughn tried to do
something about it in the eighth, waking up a crowd that the Angels
hitters seemingly lulled to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But his homer only tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and nobody on, Todd Greene singled and Diamondbacks
starter Andy Benes was lifted for Greg Swindell. Darin Erstad
singled off Swindell, and Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter went
to the bullpen again, summoning Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus walked to load the bases for pinch-hitter Jeff Huson,
but Huson never got the chance to be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   As Kim stared in to the catcher about to deliver a 2-2 pitch,
Walbeck took a few quick steps off third toward the plate, enough
to cause Kim to jerk his right shoulder. The balk was called.
</P>
<P>
   The play was set up after Angels manager Terry Collins motioned
from the dugout to third base coach Larry Bowa to get Walbeck to
try a bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said `Go! Go! Go!' and (Kim) looked up,'' Bowa said.
``Terry was right on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people,'' Kim said through an interpreter.
``I heard a lot of people yelling `He's going home!' I was a little
shocked and nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck, who has 12 career steals including one this season,
said he has stolen home in his career. While playing for the
Tigers, he was on the back end of a double steal, coming home when
his teammate drew a throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   He had no intention of stealing home Saturday, just to shake up
the rookie pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just moved my feet real fast to get him to see me out of the
corner of his eye,'' Walbeck said. ``And it worked because he
flinched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heads-up play,'' Collins said. ``More than anything
he was trying to get the guy's concentration off the hitter. And he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (5-1) earned the win in relief of Chuck Finley
(seven innings, three runs, six hits). Benes (4-6) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has been as big a part of the offense's recent struggles
as anybody. Since his previous homer on May 30, Vaughn was 7-for-40
with no extra-base hits and only two RBI until connecting on a 2-2
pitch from Benes, hitting it into the Angels' bullpen in
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been getting me out the past couple of days,'' Vaughn
said. ``You're constantly adjusting. I finally did what I'm
supposed to do _ drive the ball that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a big win, especially after they tore us up
(Friday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley led off the game for Arizona with a single and two
outs later scored from second on a single by Matt Williams for a
1-0 Diamondbacks lead.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the sixth consecutive game in which the Angels'
opponent scored first. The last time the Angels scored first was
June 5, when they took a 4-0 lead on the Dodgers, only to lose,
7-4.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Angels responded in the bottom of the first with
two runs to take a 2-1 lead. Orlando Palmeiro opened in the inning
with a single and scored on a double by Randy Velarde. Two outs
later, Velarde scored on a double by Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley held that lead until the fifth inning. With one out
in the fifth, Steve Finley hit a one-hopper that first baseman
Darin Erstad knocked down. He retrieved it and threw to Chuck
Finley covering first. The Finleys collided, but Chuck held onto
the ball and Steve was out.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck needed a few warmup pitches to make sure he was OK to
continue, but the next batter, Jay Bell, hit his 20th home run to
tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Williams hit a line drive over the center-field
fence, his 18th homer of the year, to give Arizona a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Benes cruised after the two-run first. He walked the
first two batters of the third inning, but got two big outs when Mo
Vaughn grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth inning, the Angels did not put a baserunner
into scoring position until Vaughn's homer with one out in the
eighth tied the game at 3.

DiSARCINA REDISCOVERS A-GAME 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. _ Gary DiSarcina came here to rehab his
left wrist. Instead, he found a spa for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   This sleepy California League town is just an hour from Anaheim,
but light years from in-fighting and back-biting that has helped
illustrate the Angels' last-place standing in the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody mentions the mutiny against manager Terry Collins or Jim
Edmonds' AWOL status from the team as he rehabs his own injury.
DiSarcina laughs around the batting cage like he has known these
guys his whole life _ even though he got here Monday and leaves
after today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who signs a five-year contract should have a clause
that says he must come down here and play one series a year,''
DiSarcina said Saturday night before the Angels' Single-A Lake
Elsinore Storm played San Diego's affiliate from Rancho Cucamonga.
``Up there, with the daily pressure to win, win, win, you forget
why you started playing in the first place. This is so refreshing,
so much fun. It really knocks the egos out. It does wonders for
your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much fun when he booted a high chopper at shortstop in
Monday's first game of a minor-league rehab that moves this week to
the Angels' Double-A club in Erie, Pa. But he got over it.
DiSarcina, remembering all three home runs he hit last year,
laughed when he saw he was penciled in as Saturday's designated
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He knows these are the baby steps of his rehabilitation for a
surgically repaired left wrist that was broken early in spring
training. He has been making the Angels road trips, taking batting
practice and fielding grounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be patient with these things,'' DiSarcina said.
``When you're younger, all you want to do is get back and sometimes
you can be dumb about it. I haven't had any setbacks yet, but I'm
here to get my timing and reflexes back. That takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's easy but determined manner is the quality that has
made him a leader in the Angels clubhouse for most of the past
decade. He doesn't have Mo Vaughn's scowl or Collins' Type-A+
personality. But teammates respond.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is injured, DiSarcina doesn't have the usual presence
with the Angels. But he always knew he would be back by the
All-Star break. DiSarcina worries about the reception that awaits
Edmonds, who lives in Orange County but has not worked out with the
team after shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels a deep responsibility for what goes on here,'' Angels
left-hander Chuck Finley said of DiSarcina. ``This is his team.'
</P>
<P>
   The same would be true here if he wasn't expected back in
Anaheim within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Elsinore shortstop Nelson Castro said DiSarcina has made a
few suggestions that have helped his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are little things, but it means so much to hear them from
someone who has been there,'' said Castro, in his second year at
Single-A. ``I always threw sidearm to first and the throws got
away. He got me to throw more on top. Coaches have tried that, but
when he said it got through.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina says he learned that when he was in Double-A Midland,
and Texas and Angels veterans came down to play an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember talking to guys like Dick Schofield, Devon White
and Jack Howell about what it takes to get to the big leagues,'' he
said. ``I wanted to know everything. These guys are like that _
like a sponge.''

ANGELS SUMMON LUKE, COLANGELO FROM MINORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After Saturday's game, the Anaheim Angels
called up outfielders Mike Colangelo and Matt Luke from Triple-A
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, 22, is an outfielder who hits leadoff. Through
Friday, he was hitting .362 in 26 games for Edmonton after being
promoted from Double-A Erie, where he hit .339.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo was a 21st-round pick in the 1997 draft and played
most of last season at Single-A Lake Elsinore, where he hit .379.
</P>
<P>
   Luke, the former Dodger who was on the disabled list for two
months with a back injury, was hitting .429 (9 for 21) with five
home runs since his return to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make room on the roster, the Angels sent Chris
Pritchett to Edmonton and designated Tim Unroe for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   No worries: Ken Hill said he didn't have any ``pop'' on his
fastball Friday night. Just as long as he didn't hear a pop coming
from his elbow there seems to be no reason for concern.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Hill's velocity Friday was in the 87-88 mph
range, down from his usual 92-93 mph and that could be a cause for
worry. Hill had surgery on the elbow last year (June 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a dead arm, it was one of those things,'' Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins didn't seem too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also have to look at his two (previous) starts, where he
was dominating,'' Collins said, referring to victories over the
Twins and Dodgers. ``The one thing we've tried to make sure was to
stay consistent with his rest so he'd stay in a rhythm. But it
might also be taking a lot out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Monday's off day, Hill will get an extra day's rest
before his next start, Thursday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon update: Right fielder Tim Salmon continues to make
progress while recovering from a sprained left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon is shagging balls in the outfield during batting practice
and hitting soft toss, swinging with one hand. He won't begin
taking batting practice off live pitching for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Better days: During his horrendous start this season, Tim
Belcher promised things would get better. Well, he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher pitched his best game of the season Wednesday in a 2-1
win over the Giants. He went a season-high eight innings and
allowed just one run and four hits.
</P>
<P>
   In his first seven starts this year, he was 1-3 with a 9.89 ERA.
In last seven, he's 3-2 with a 3.79 ERA. His only bad start came
against the Dodgers that included the fight with Chan Ho Park.
Before the fight, Belcher shut the Dodgers out through 42/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's in a groove,'' Collins said. ``A guy like
Tim lives with command and movement. He's got to keep pitching, and
he's hit that stride.''

U.S. WOMEN HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ignored by NBC's live cameras during their gold
medal-winning victory over China at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
the time has come for the U.S. women's national soccer team to
unleash eight years of relative obscurity when they visit Giants
Stadium in front of a national television audience Saturday against
Denmark in their opening game of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since their gold medal, the women's team has grown in
popularity, becoming what U.S. coach Tony DiCicco describes as the
``standard'' for the rest of women's soccer to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Even though China has beaten the U.S. twice recently and Norway
or Germany can defeat the U.S. on any given day, the American women
are expected to raise the FIFA Trophy this summer when the third
Women's World Cup final is concluded at the Rose Bowl, July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a fair expectation? Not really. But the U.S. women are
playing at home, coming off an Olympic gold medal and have the
revenge factor fueling those expectations after losing the 1995
World Cup to champion Norway.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. also has the best training facilities,
best farm system (the colleges) and has the benefit of keeping its
women together on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Factor all that together and one can see why the U.S. is
considered the world leader in women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are distant to what the men's Brazilian team
faces in terms of the pressure to win, but in some respects, we
share their expectations on a world level,'' admitted DiCicco. ``No
matter where they (Brazil) take the field and no matter who's on
their team that particular day, they're expected to entertain and
expected to win. Not just by the Brazilian fans, but by every fan
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful expectation that is to carry. And at some
levels we carry that expectation also. And to tell you the truth,
we absolutely love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Brazilians, the American's expectations were built on
tales rather than television.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. team won the inaugural 1991 Women's World Cup in
China following a 2-1 victory over Norway, they had to send faxes
and make phone calls to get the word out to friends and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one met us at the airport, there were no ticker-tape
parades,'' said striker Mia Hamm, laughing. ``One of our sponsors
took an ad out in the papers to let people know we had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicicco had two images from that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we arrived at JFK after we won it, there were literally
less than five people there to greet us. One was Bora Milutinovic
(U.S. men's coach at the time) and the others I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other image comes from Michelle Akers. She was sitting
next to an older American woman on the ride home. The woman asked
her what she had just done and Michelle told her we had just won
the first Women's World Cup in China. The lady said, `That's nice.'
I mean, there was no significance to the event outside of our
little world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. failed to recapture the 1995 World Cup in Sweden,
few noticed their 1-0 loss to Norway in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was hoping its popularity and women's soccer would
reach a larger audience during the 1996 Olympics, but NBC failed to
show the team's thrilling 2-1 victory over China on live
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' said U.S. forward Tiffeny
Milbrett. ``I don't know how many people on this team would say it
but our team was very upset it wasn't shown. We felt like here you
have a gold medal contender and it seemed like they just didn't
care enough to put us on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all changed now. Every minute of every game building up
to the final will be aired nationally on either ABC, ESPN or ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is grouped in the first round with unlikely challengers
in Denmark, Nigeria and North Korea, but as the tournament gets
into the later stages the parity among the final eight teams will
be closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of differences between the first two World
Cups and this one,'' said Hamm. ``So many more teams out there can
compete for this title. I think in 1991 there were maybe four or
five teams. But now you have to adjust tactically and make
different decisions on how you attack and defend in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be a walk in the park. A lot of people are
expecting us to win, but this is the most competitive tournament
we've ever played in.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defender Brandi Chastain said the pressure to win isn't
as high as the media is making it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win the tournament, that's our goal, we wouldn't
have started training in January if we thought for one minute we
wouldn't win,'' said Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the expectations that communities across the United
States are placing on us are much greater that the expectations
we're putting on ourselves because we have control of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure we feel is only coming from within. It's not
coming from the media. It's not coming from our families. It's not
coming from soccer communities. It's coming from the 18 players
participating in the World Cup. We know what we're capable of
achieving so the pressure in that sense is lessened.''

CIENFUEGOS SAYS AGE NOT CATCHING UP WITH HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos has
struggled to find the consistency that landed himself a spot on the
MLS All-Star team the previous three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with a career best 13 goals and 16 assists last
season, but with only four assists and no goals heading into
Saturday's match against Chicago, a reporter asked if age is
starting to catch up with with.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people mention my age but there are a lot of players
five or six years older than me and I'm in much better condition
that they are,'' said the 31-year-old El Salvadoran. ``It's not my
age, the way I play on the field within the lines demonstrates I'm
only 31.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Galaxy has struggled this season, Cienfuegos says he's
an easy target to pin the blame on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about Cienfuegos, but Cienfuegos doesn't
make the team,'' he said. ``As a whole we're not playing up to a
level we were playing at last year. We're not finding a rhythm yet,
including myself.
</P>
<P>
   ___Former UCLA striker Seth George signed with the Galaxy
Friday, saying he was happy to be reunited with former UCLA coach
Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   George, 23, signed with 1860 Munich of the German Bundesliga
after graduation, but he opted out of his contract because of
limited playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to be back in my hometown and playing for Sigi
again, Schmid said. ``I hope to bring some offense to the team,
maybe not scoring goals but setting them up and being a catalyst.''

OFFICIALS QUELL RIOT OF 200 AT TENT JAIL

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Two hundred inmates at Tent City Jail rioted Saturday
night, hurling rocks at officers, lighting fires to six tents and
dumping over portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, and no one escaped in the ``bedtime''
disturb ance at the Maricopa County jail, which ended about an hour
after officers used pepper spray on the rampagers, said Sgt. Dave
Trombi, a Sheriff's Office spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was dealt with real quick,'' Trombi said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 Phoenix police officers, sheriff's deputies and
Phoenix firefighters also responded to the riot, Sheriff Joe Arpaio
said Saturday at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said it was probably gang-related and began about 9 p.m.
as inmates were listening to their bedtime story of Star Wars, part
of a new program.
</P>
<P>
   With their faces hidden behind tow els, rioters lit mattresses,
trash cans and six tents on fire, but none of the tents was
destroyed, said Capt. David Wilson, a special projects commander.
</P>
<P>
   Matches are considered contra band, but Wilson said the public
sometimes throws cigarettes and matches over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Trombi said officers had noted that tension, possibly racially
moti vated, was stirring among the inmates Friday and contributed
to Saturday's flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, instead of getting ready for story time, many
milled about outside the tents.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 inmates were moved late Saturday to other ``hard
jail'' facilities, such as Durango and Madison Street, and 35
``instiga tors'' were moved to the Towers Jail, Arpaio and Trombi
said.
</P>
<P>
   In noting the response time, Arpaio made reference to a 1996
riot, saying, ``We have learned something about this disturbance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, 1996, hundreds of inmates, angry over conditions in
Tent City, rioted after an inmate went to a toilet without
permission and was pepper-sprayed by a guard. Three guards and six
inmates were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Three guards patrolling the jail quickly were overmatched by hun
dreds of rioters, some armed with sledgehammers. Guards in the Es
trella Jail complex that includes Tent City didn't have access to
helmets, gas masks and other riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Several fires erupted, and Na tional Guard troops were seen
entering.
</P>
<P>
   After the riot was quelled, Arpaio promised to let an inmates
commit tee air complaints of abusive guards, bad food and poor
living conditions. &QL;

AS THE WRIST TURNS: MODANO SHOWS THAT HE'S A TOUGH KEN
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Rumors of his playoff demise, as it turned out,
were greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey _ that's hockey, Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sipping from a soda bottle with his left hand. He had
just taken 30 shifts on the ice and logged more than 18 minutes. He
had won four faceoffs and absorbed the wrist-whackings that came
with it.
</P>
<P>
   He had played tough. Yes, imagine that. Mike Modano, Stanley Cup
tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   For an unkindly large share of his hockey career, Modano has
battled his cover-boy looks and his image. To those who weren't
paying attention, Modano was the blue-eyed, sweet-skating goal
scorer. With all due respects to Barbie, he was Ken on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken, meet Macho Mike.
</P>
<P>
   He shoots, he plays. Two shots, actually. As just like that,
minutes before Game 3, the Novocaine numbed the Stanley Cup finals'
most well-chronicled wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you get your hockey news, after Modano was
plowed into the boards last Thursday by a rugged check from
Buffalo's Jay McKee, you figured the Stars center:
</P>
<P>
   A. was faking.
</P>
<P>
   B. had a broken wrist and would be lost for the rest of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   C. would never play the piano again.
</P>
<P>
   D. none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer, obviously, was D. I think. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is in the NHL,'' Modano said, leaning
against his locker _ with his left hand, even _ after the Stars'
dramatic 2-1 victory over the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hides injuries. You're not going to give any team any
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the continuing saga of As The Wrist Turns had
filled columns of newspaper space across two countries. There were
conflicting reports that conflicted with previously conflicting
reports. There were wrist doctors interviewed on TV, and NHL
officials interviewed about who exactly could get interviewed on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all, with his left wrist decidedly
aching, was Modano, who added to the Oliver Stone veil of intrigue
Friday by mysteriously draping his sportcoat over his left forearm,
just so the TV cameras would see.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, there was no mystery, coach Ken Hitchcock said
after the biggest road win of the franchise's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think everybody expected him to play,'' Hitchcock
corrected. ``I think it was necessarily a lift. I think when the
diagnosis came back that it was not broken, I think everybody felt
that even if he played with 50 or 60 percent usage there, that he
would still be an effective player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitch added, ``We really knew boarding the plane yesterday that
he was a player.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to announce it, however, because full
disclosure in the NHL is apparently as elusive as front teeth. Even
Saturday night, after he had played with such relative abandon and
inspired his own team, Modano played a cat-and-mouse game with how
exactly he had the injured arm covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had kind of a little splint on it,'' Modano said at first.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Hitchcock had already revealed that he played
using a rubberized cast, Modano blinked and said, ``He did? I
wasn't going to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He had played better games, but maybe none more courageous. Yes,
imagine that. Modano, the Stars' John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   He said he realized that he was definitely doing to play
``probably this morning. It felt a lot better when I woke up. And
tonight, after seeing the doctor, it felt a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two minutes of the game, Modano, who started,
grabbed the loose puck and surged in on Buffalo goalie Dominik
Hasek. He fired off a solid slapshot and then almost spanked in a
rebound. He was still skating into the Sabres zone, causing
disruption, in the final minutes when he made a textbook backhand
pass that most healthy forwards couldn't even make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting-wise, I felt 100 percent,'' Modano assessed. ``Stick
handling and taking faceoffs, maybe 70 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that every time he took a faceoff _ nine times in the
game _ he got slashed on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hockey, Modano sighed.
</P>
<P>
   The assorted other wrist-slashings, he confessed, probably added
to the frustration that led to him taking three two-minutes
penalties over a 10-minute span in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It was Modano's way of telling the frisky Sabres that neither he
nor his injured wrist are fair game.
</P>
<P>
   But play? Oh, the Stars sniffed. Macho Mike was always going to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to suck it up _ everybody's got to suck it up,'' said
defenseman Craig Ludwig. ``Mike knows that we count on him. He did
what he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a gutsy performance. It was a numbing performance, and
we're not only talking about the stunned Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mystery with, for the Stars, a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Fooled me. I think. Sort of. nn

NIEUWENDYK MAKING UP FOR TIME LOST IN '98 PLAYOFFS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Wherever you are, Bryan Marchment, Joe
Nieuwendyk sends his love.
</P>
<P>
   This June is for you, you black-hearted knave.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's 1998 playoffs were stolen by the rogue cheap-shot
artist from San Jose in the first game of the postseason 12 months
ago. A year later Nieuwendyk has personally taken charge of leading
the Stars toward a Stanley Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, shoot down Mike Modano. Send Brett Hull to the
hospital. Wipe out Benoit Hogue and Grant Marshall. Take your best
shot, Sabres. Somehow the Dallas Stars find a way and Saturday
night at Marine Midland Arena, that was again Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored two classic goals, stamping himself as the
clubhouse leader for the Conn Smythe Trophy which goes to the
playoff MVP, leading the Stars to a heart-stopping 2-1 victory over
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   No whining now. You've had a whole 26 seconds in three full
games and then some when this series wasn't either tied or had a
one-goal difference and that was after Derian Hatcher's
empty-netter at the end of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of time to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' victory was like a sickening kick in the solar plexus
to the Sabres, handing them their first home loss of the playoffs,
giving Dallas a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series and restoring
the Stars' home ice advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Not to get ahead of ourselves, because this series is still far
from over, but if the Stars finish what Nieuwendyk has started, let
me be the first to suggest that he should be at the front of the
line when it comes time for the Stars to sip from hockey's Holy
Grail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man on a mission,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said
following another superb defensive performance by his team, which
outshot the Sabres 29-12. That's particularly impressive when you
consider that the Stars took nine penalties to just three for
Buffalo and spent most of the night fighting off the Sabres' power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Modano played _ and played well _ despite a broken bone in his
left wrist. Hull, the Stars' best long-distance shooter, left the
ice late in the first period with a strained groin and never
returned. The Stars just kept grinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't worry about it,'' said veteran center Guy
Carbonneau, who was on the ice killing most of those nine penalties
the Stars took. ``We lost Brett and it took us 10 or 15 minutes
before we realized he wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   That elbow in your ribs is Carbonneau's. He was making a joke.
You can do that when you've just gone up 2-1 in the Stanley Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
   But while Carbonneau and Modano and Jere Lehtinen and the Stars'
defenseman were the unsung heroes in Saturday night's critical
victory, it was Nieuwendyk and his line which stepped up to take
charge offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing as well as I've ever seen him play and I've seen
him play great,'' Stars' defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``He missed
a lot when he couldn't play in the playoffs last year and he's
determined to make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing the playoffs last year, watching the Stars eventually
lose to Detroit in the Western Conference finals, made Nieuwendyk
realize that time is slipping away and there's no guarantee he'll
ever come this close again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult last year not being a part of it,'' he said.
``Especially when you get to this point and you realize what it
takes to get here. I'm just sorry I wasn't there for my teammates
last year and I'm thrilled to be here now.''
</P>
<P>
   His two goals Saturday night were beauties, particularly since
they were the result of gritty, hard work by Nieuwendyk and
linemates Jamie Langenbrunner and Dave Reid.
</P>
<P>
   His first one, with 4:27 to play, tied the score at 1. There was
a flurry in front of Sabres' goalie Dominick Hasek and the puck
skidded behind the net. Langenbrunner centered it. Nieuwendyk
stretched to his left to control the puck and Hasek sprawled out to
cover the right side of the crease. Nieuwendyk drilled it perfectly
into the empty left side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   As pretty as that one was, the game-winner _ Nieuwendyk's sixth
of the playoffs, tying the NHL record set by Joe Sakic in 1996 _
was simply gorgeous for most of the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It came with 10:25 left in the game and again, it was
Langenbrunner who controlled the puck on the boards and held it,
setting up the play.
</P>
<P>
   Then ... well, let Nieuwendyk describe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the puck in there for awhile and Jamie did a great job
of getting it to the front of the net,'' he said. ``It had to go
through a few legs to get to my stick and I just pulled it to my
forehand. Hasek's always on his way down, so I was just able to get
a fortunate shot away, upstairs and top corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds so simple, but it broke about 18,595 hearts at Marine
Midland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal was just unbelievably hard work by three
guys,'' Hitchcock said, ``but that second goal was a goal scorer's
goal. There are a lot of people who get the puck in that position
all year and never make that play. That is a goal-scorer's goal.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll go you one better, Hitch. I'd say it was an MVP's goal. nn

STARS SHIRT DOOMS TICKET HUNT
</HEADLINE>
 CUP JOURNAL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Outside Marine Midland Arena, waiting for Game 3
of the Stanley Cup Finals to begin, Scott Thomas was all dressed up
and had nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Thomas said, lonesomely. ``I started out
thinking I would pay $100 for a ticket, but the more grief I get,
the more I want to be inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had the cash, but he also had one incriminating problem.
The Addison resident was wearing a Stars jersey _ Joe Nieuwendyk's
No. 25 _ while a sea of red-shirted Buffalo Sabres fans washed into
the arena around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I got one for you,'' a wise-rump stopped and motioned to
Thomas. ``For you, $1,000. Just for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a credit analyst back in Texas, had been in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., all week attending a national Junior Chamber of
Commerce convention. He serves as president of the Dallas Jaycees.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and about 10 of his fellow conventioneers gathered in a
Niagara Falls bar last week to watch the first two games of the
series on TV. Sabres fans, he said, were surprisingly respectful of
the intruders with ``foreign'' accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was some people from Minnesota who were giving us
trouble,'' he said. ``I just told them fine, but the (soon-to-be
Minnesota expansion team) Wild is going to be in Houston soon.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat, Thomas was joined by a pair of kindred spirits _ more
Stars fans. Paul McMorrow, age 9, was also having second thoughts
about his choice of wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   If those taunting Sabres fans only knew who young McMorrow
really was ... .
</P>
<P>
   His mom, seated at his side, is Linda Modano McMorrow _ one of
Stars standout Mike Modano's two sisters. The McMorrows live in
Boston and made the trip to see Mike play in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Aha, a scoop! Will he play in Game 3, we asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Linda answered. ``We didn't get to talk to him
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The McMorrows got their tickets, left by their famous family
member, and headed inside. When we left Thomas, he was still on the
sidewalk, still trying to emancipate a single Game 3 ticket from a
Sabres fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have worn another shirt,'' he said, still
looking lonesome. TAILGATING AND THEN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Down Washington Street, in a parking lot just a half-block from
Marine Midland Arena, the burgers were grilling and the wings were
frying.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, 41, of Rochester, N.Y., was tailgating. He was also
fendering, radiatoring, windshielding and even possibly
brake-fluiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real famous out at Rich Stadium,'' Johnson assured me.
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson has done to his 1980 Pinto station wagon likely is
not covered in the owner's manual. Once red, the hood of the
rusting Pinto is now literally charcoal black. And your family
vehicle would be, too, if you used the front end of the car to
barbecue burgers, fry chicken wings, and cook eggs and bacon before
football and hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   As on a stove top, the hood of the wagon had four pans of hot
coals going. In one pan, Johnson used a shovel to cook eggs and
pancakes. A handsaw was frying strips of bacon. In an upturned Army
helmet, Johnson was deep-frying the chicken wings. A garden rake
held the burgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were these factory options on the Pinto?'' I asked Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He stared back as if I were the strange one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell you I'm famous for doing this out at Rich
Stadium?'' he asked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd offer you a beer, but we've run out of ice,'' Johnson
said, lifting the, uh, cooler, which was actually a toilet bowl. On
a good day, he said he can fit 18 cold Labatt's in it _ and have a
seat to drink them.
</P>
<P>
   The police don't hassle him, Johnson explained, because somehow
the hood-charred Pinto runs and has all of its state registration
papers, if not the Betty Crocker seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he said, pointing proudly at a bowling ball
that was propped with finger holes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we use to drink shots from.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, because a bowler never knows when he needs a drink, Johnson
pours shots of Wisniowka Polish cherry liqueur into the ball's
finger holes. His buddy, Scott Siegel, 35, of Buffalo, demonstrated
by hoisting the ball and downing two stern drips of something red
and sticky. He would have gotten it on his shirt, but he wasn't
wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done this for hockey before, but this is big,''
Johnson explained as the wings gurgled in grease, somewhere in the
vicinity of his car battery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get you a burger or something?''
BUFFALO DID IT RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   OK, the scoreboard once came crashing down, and the place is not
exactly teeming with parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But by all other standards, Marine Midland Arena is a handsome
place _ and a perfect reminder of everything that is wrong about
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   On its exterior portals are stone carvings of charging buffaloes
and sprawling goaltenders. Its main entry is a 330-foot long and
65-foot high glass pavilion that quickly whisks spectators to every
one of the four levels of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1996 at a cost of $127.5 million, $72 million of which
came from private funds, Marine Midland Arena seats 18,595 for
hockey and seems vast and functional compared to cramped, lame-duck
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The atrium area features escalators _ are you listening, Mr.
Perot? _ that swiftly carry fans up to the upper levels. It isn't
the cardiac stress test that Reunion can be.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in 1996, hours before a Sabres game, when the
arena was empty, the giant eight-sided message board came crashing
down onto the ice. No one was injured, and the alleged accompanying
jinx that came with the incident has been rendered forever moot by
the Sabres' play this postseason.
METALLICA NEXT?
</P>
<P>
   Could that have been ... eek ... the bride of Satan that sang
before Game 3?
</P>
<P>
   Well, one day, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Smolinska, who sang the U.S. and Canadian anthems, is, in
fact, the fiancee of Buffalo winger Miroslav Satan. nn

HARBAUGH BECOME INTERACTIVE OWNER ON IRL PIT CREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The list of celebrity car owners in
open-wheel racing includes actor Paul Newman, comedian David
Letterman, former NFL quarterback Joe Montana and current NFL
quarterback Jim Harbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the others, Harbaugh is hands-on in the pits. Harbaugh,
one of the founding owners of Pennzoil Panther Racing, spent last
night's Longhorn 500 working on the pit crew of race winner Scott
Goodyear. Dressed in one of the team's yellow-and-black fire suits,
Harbaugh held the sign board that directed Goodyear to his stall
along pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a small job,'' said Harbaugh, who is partners in the
team with TV executive Terry Lingner, automobile businessman Gary
Pedigo and team manager John Barnes. ``Everybody pitches in here
and I just hold the sign board. But I'm not over-the-wall. Hell,
no. My main thing is to help the guys, stay out of the way and
support the sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh's interest in Indy-car racing grew when he played for
the Indianapolis Colts. Harbaugh, who spent last season with the
Baltimore Ravens, was traded to the San Diego Chargers during the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh has attended every IRL race this season, including
Goodyear's first career series victory at Phoenix International
Raceway in March. After the second victory last night, Harbaugh
kept the win in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we keep playing and keep racing, good things are
going to happen,'' Harbaugh said. ``And good things happened
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh is also well aware of the dangers inherent in this
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing they tell you when you get down to that pit is
keep your head on a swivel,'' said Harbaugh, who added he would not
be wearing a helmet last night. ``Make sure you're always looking
out at the track for what might potentially go wrong. We had a
meeting yesterday with the IRL, talking about trying to make it
safer for the crew guys. They're exploring how football helmets are
designed so the guys could hear and see and get some ventilation _
and maybe a facemask so they could see below 'em, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh attended last night's race with Chargers center Kendyl
Jacox, an NFL rookie last year who played high school football at
Dallas Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just finished with about seven weeks of minicamps, spread
out from April,'' said Harbaugh, who has been installed as the
starter by new Chargers coach Mike Riley. ``Because we've got a new
coach, we're allowed additional minicamps. Believe me, we need the
work.''

PLANO'S GREG RAY RIDES DRAFT TO SECOND IN IRL RACE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Greg Ray ran out of cars at the Longhorn 500
last night. Not his own _ rather, everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   With a cracked cylinder head that slowed him for the final 60
laps, the Plano resident needed to draft to stay close to leader
Scott Goodyear. But with 10 of the field's 26 cars not finishing,
Ray had nowhere to turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   He had enough to hold off Sam Schmidt and secure second place,
but it was Ray's second consecutive runner-up finish in this race
at Texas Motor Speedway. He finished second in the True Value 500
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When a racer drafts, he drives closely behind another car to
take advantage of a pocket of low air resistance immediately behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had the best car out there tonight in traffic,''
he said. ``But in the open, it just wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a near repeat of last year's June race at TMS, Ray said.
His Aurora-powered No. 2 Glidden-Menards Dallara felt strong and
passed well, he said, but with the faulty cylinder head, he was
losing about a tenth of a second per lap for the final 60 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were losing horsepower, losing water pressure _ there was
nothing we could do,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the finish was Ray's best of the season. He led 56 laps,
most in the race, after starting fourth. He took his first lead on
Lap 61 and his final lead on Lap 101, holding it until Lap 137.
</P>
<P>
   While Goodyear was uncatchable, Ray had to concentrate on
holding off a hard-charging Schmidt near the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 20 laps, I didn't lift \Roff the accelerator\S the
whole time,'' Schmidt said. ``That's good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray hadn't finished a race this year. He had crashed in his past
two races, and a faulty gearbox cost him in the season-opener Jan.
24 at Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go into Colorado in a comfort zone now that we've put
together a complete race,'' Ray said, looking ahead to the Radisson
200 on June 27 at Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain,
Colo. ``We'll definitely need to start winning some of these if
we're going to figure in the point standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who had crashed in his past two races (finishing 21st both
times), was tied for 20th in the point standings coming in. He
moved to eighth by earning 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, I'm real happy with the race,'' he said. ``You
have to start somewhere and get some points, and you do that by
getting in the top 10 and top 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he believes he can win at TMS and called last night's
race another learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting smarter, I know when to go hard, I know when to
lay low, when to be sneaky and when to show your cards,'' he said.
``But a lot of what I learned here, I won't make public
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   But a public that included many hometown fans in the TMS crowd
of 88,000 had to be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the Indiana Pacers, Dallas Cowboys or
Stars, you talk about hometown advantage,'' Ray said. ``Texas Motor
Speedway has been great to me.''

RANGERS LAMENT MISSED CHANCES AGAINST ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The outcome hinged on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   None involved the 1-1 fastball that Rangers center fielder Ruben
Mateo crushed for a two-run, 420-foot homer during the third at-bat
of his major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   No, it instead came down to the two batters Rangers right-hander
Aaron Sele failed to put away on two-out, two-strike pitches and
the two retired by Colorado right-hander Curtis Leskanic during the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers' 8-7 loss last night at The Ballpark in
Arlington will be remembered as an evening of opportunities lost
instead of Mateo's coming-out party.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who entered this appearance on his best roll of the
season, failed to put away Colorado's Vinny Castilla and Todd
Helton with the bases loaded after retiring Larry Walker and Dante
Bichette on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla drew a 3-2 walk to force across the first of the
Rockies' four runs that inning, and Helton lined a 2-2 fastball
between first baseman Lee Stevens and the bag for a three-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you how important every pitch and every swing of
the bat are,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Leskanic, who retired only one of four batters during the eighth
inning before being removed by Colorado manager Jim Leyland,
delivered when the Rockies needed it the most.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed reliever retired Ivan Rodriguez with a 3-2
slider that the Rangers' catcher took for a called third strike on
a nine-pitch at-bat with the bases loaded, and he induced an
inning-ending ground ball from third baseman Todd Zeile to preserve
the Rockies' 8-5 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so mnay things that we could have done out there
tonight to change the outcome of the game,'' said Oates, referring
to the fact that the Rangers scored only two runs despite having
the bases loaded during the seventh and eighth innings. ``It was an
uphill battle for us all night, but we had not only the tying run,
but the winning run on base during final innings. Unfortunately, we
were unable to pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored once in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by left
fielder Rusty Greer, and again in the ninth on a solo home run by
Zeile, but Colorado closer Dave Veres _ who pitched the final 1 2/3
innings _ recorded his eighth save by retiring Stevens to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who on Monday allowed only two runs on five hits during
the Rangers' 3-2 victory at Los Angeles, entered this start 3-0
with a 3.71 earned-run average during his previous four starts.
Colorado's Pedro Astacio (6-5) earned the victory by allowing four
runs (two earned) on eight hits and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, though, did fall victim to Mateo, whom the Rangers
recalled yesterday from Triple-A Oklahoma to replace injured center
fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who went hitless during his first two trips to the plate
against Astacio, belted a 1-1 fastball into the left-center field
seats during his fifth-inning at-bat that scored second baseman
Mark McLemore and cut the Rockies' lead to 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' Oates said of Mateo. ``It looked like
he'd been here for some time. That's about as well as you can show
all your tools in one night. You got to see his arm strength with
that relay throw early on. You got to see his power, period. You
got to see his speed, and he was able to take a walk at the plate
in a crucial \Reighth-inning situation\S.''

STARS' PENALTY-KILLERS DO THEIR JOB
</HEADLINE>
 KILL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The Buffalo Sabres' power play, a deadly weapon
throughout the playoffs, accomplished the near-impossible Saturday
night. It sapped the energy from Guy Carbonneau, the Dallas Stars'
seemingly ageless forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got me tired,'' said Carbonneau, standing in the Stars'
dressing room in a sweat-soaked T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau and his teammates on the Stars' penalty-killing unit
had reason to be tired. They also had reason to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty-killers negated the Sabres' high-wattage, power-play
unit eight times, and the Stars defeated Buffalo, 2-1, at Marine
Midland Arena to take a 2-1 lead in the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the difference for us,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   The power play has been the difference for the Sabres much of
the post-season. They had the most effective unit in the league,
scoring 16 goals with the extra man in 15 games before playing the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had the best penalty-killing unit coming into the Finals,
but the Sabres got the best of the special teams' play in the first
two games. They scored one power-play goal in Game 1, and both of
their goals in Game 2 came with the extra man.
</P>
<P>
   They had plenty of chances to pad their totals Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the whole game short-handed,'' Stars defenseman
Richard Matvichuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it only seemed that way. Officially, the Stars were
short-handed eight times. Unofficially, they had another late in
the game with goalie Dominik Hasek on the bench and the extra
attacker on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, that's enough for the Sabres to score a couple of
goals. Instead, the Stars shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   The key to killing the penalties was the 39-year-old Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbo's been doing it for 25, 30 years now,'' said defenseman
and close friend Craig Ludwig, exaggerating a tad. ``He's a smart
player. He's not the fastest player on the ice, but he's one of the
toughest to play against because he's so smart.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mike Modano limited by a wrist injury, Carbonneau played on
the first penalty-killing unit. He won faceoffs, blocked shots and
generally harassed the Sabres. When Buffalo had a 5-on-3 advantage
for the final 1:14 of the first period, he twice broke Alexei
Zhitnik's stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' Matvichuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau had help. The Sabres didn't even get off a shot on
the 5-on-3, epitomizing an amazing period for the penalty-killers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had four power plays in the first period, including a
four-minute stretch when Matvichuk was called for roughing with two
seconds remaining in a Luwig minor.
</P>
<P>
   During all the power-play time, the Sabres got only one shot
through to goalie Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we killed those penalties in the first period, our team
was really energized and really excited,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
really felt that was just so much confidence for us to kill
those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had to kill two more in the second period, both
because of penalties called on Modano. Again, the Sabres failed to
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had two more chances in the third period, including
one opportunity late when Tony Hrkac was called for tripping with
17:38 gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars killed the first 11/2 minutes, and then the Sabres
called a timeout to pull Hasek for the extra attacker. They had a
6-on-4 for 35 seconds, and the advantage for the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Stars killed it.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, the game ended when Carbonneau and Mike Keane
both hit the ice to block a last-second shot.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Stars was that they killed all the
penalties. The bad news was that they had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we didn't want to do,'' Carbonneau said. ``We
wanted to play our aggressive game and play with emotion, and maybe
we got caught with too much emotion. Penalty-killing was big, but
we've got to cut down on the penalties.'' nn

RANGERS CALL UP MATEO AS GOODWIN GOES ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It could be the beginning of an era.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the beginning of an error.
</P>
<P>
   It could be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   It could be for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above depends upon center fielder Ruben Mateo, the
crown jewel of the Rangers' minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled their heralded 21-year-old outfielder from
Triple-A Oklahoma yesterday to replace center fielder Tom Goodwin,
who Saturday suffered a small tear of the flexor muscle in his left
hip. Mateo went 1-for-4 in his debut, smashing a two-run home run
in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers placed Goodwin on the 15-day disabled list and
issued No. 38 to Mateo, whom right-hander Jeff Zimmerman christened
as ``The Chosen One.'' Manager Johnny Oates inserted the
strong-armed, right-handed hitter into the Rangers' lineup, where
Mateo started in center field and hit second.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, how long will Mateo remain?
</P>
<P>
   Those in the organization lack a definitive answer, but no one
appears willing to dismiss Mateo as the simple solution to what
should be no more than a 15-day problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even answer that,'' general manager Doug Melvin said.
``He hasn't played a game yet. When you're in a pennant race like
we are, you sort of have to take things day-by-day and
week-by-week. In this case, it's a two-week period.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Oates said. ``A lot of it probably depends
on how he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, who has hit .340 with 17 home runs and 58 runs batted in
59 games this season for the RedHawks, will become the Rangers'
primary center fielder during his length-to-be-determined stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to come up here and sit on the bench,'' Oates
said, ``but that doesn't mean he's going to play every inning of
every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo arrived at The Ballpark in Arlington with no preconceived
expectations for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever God allows me to do,'' Mateo said through Luis
Mayoral, the Rangers' Latin American liaison who served as his
interpreter. ``I'll do my best and play hard to help this team win,
but the bottom line is I'll let God take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo speaks English, but yesterday the Dominican Republic
native utilized an interpreter to ease a mentally taxing afternoon
that included a 2 1/2-hour, thunderstorm-induced flight delay from
Oklahoma City. Mateo experienced great success there with the
RedHawks and ranked among the Pacific Coast League leaders in hits
(81, first), runs (50, first), RBI (second), batting average
(fourth) and home runs (fourth). However, Mateo said boredom never
sat in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about staying there,'' he said. ``I never
thought about coming to the major leagues. I just took it
day-by-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin refused to rush Mateo to the major leagues despite the
wishes of the coaching staff, who wanted the outfielder on the
Opening Day roster. Yet, Goodwin's injury opened the door for
Mateo's much-anticipated arrival despite other available options.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could have reinstated outfielder Mike Simms from the
15-day disabled list and played reserve Roberto Kelly in center
field until Goodwin's return. Simms rejoined the team on Friday
after completing his medical rehabilitation assignment Monday, but
the Rangers chose to recall Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Simms declined to comment on the situation. That in itself
expressed his frustration with the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have another center fielder,'' Melvin said. ``You
have to protect yourself with two players at every position.
Otherwise, you could lose a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennants are sometimes won and lost by one ballgame. This
makes us a better ballclub than any other alternative available to
us.''

SABRES CAN'T FIGURE OUT STARS' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The Buffalo Sabres' offense had been stifled all
game long, smothered on the power play, stymied when playing even
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Down a goal, having fired only 11 shots on Eddie Belfour through
the first 57-plus minutes of play Saturday night, they got one last
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went on another power play, thanks to a tripping
penalty called on Dallas Stars forward Tony Hrkac with 2:22 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sabres played like they had all night, throwing only one
more shot at Belfour before they surrendered 2-1. It was Buffalo's
first home loss of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Buffalo players knew something had gone wrong, and
they knew the Stars' tight neutral zone checking system had
something to do with it. They just didn't know what to do about it
come Game 4 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't give us anything,'' defenseman James Patrick
said in a subdued Sabres dressing room. ``You can beat one guy (on
the Stars), and there's still four guys below you, blocking the net
and taking away the shooting lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Patrick could describe the Sabres' offensive futility:
12 total shots, including three in the first period and three in
the third period, despite having eight power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Others were generally at a loss to explain the offensive
lethargy, except to credit the Stars and their shot-blocking
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had trouble getting the puck to the net,'' defenseman Rhett
Warrener said. ``They make a real effort of blocking shots.''
</P>
<P>
   His solution: ``Basically, what it comes down to is hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did display some shot-blocking ability, deflecting 19
Buffalo shots over the game. The Sabres, by contrast, blocked 14.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Sabres players blamed their power play for
squandered scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play has been exceptional during the playoffs,''
defenseman Jay McKee said. ``But tonight they blocked a lot of
shots. They collapsed (on defense) very well. They play five guys
in their zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Buffalo players said that Game 3 was similar to Game 1,
which the Sabres won, except that the teams reversed their roles.
In Game 1, the Stars were unable to capitalize on numerous
man-advantage situations, and that cost Dallas the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to capitalize on your power play,'' said forward
Dixon Ward, who failed to get a shot on goal. ``We've just got to
find a way to get to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres didn't seem sure how to penetrate Dallas' suffocating
defensive schemes, however, and indicated they would spend the next
two off days trying to find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out what we're doing wrong,'' McKee said.
``We haven't been able to generate much offensively. We'll have to
watch the videotape (of the game) and be more prepared the next
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking only 11 shots and mustering very few real scoring
chances in going down a game in the series, a review of the
videotape offered Buffalo its best solution for offensive woes. nn

PACE CAR RUINS NIGHT FOR BEECHLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES POLANSKY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Legendary driver Johnny Rutherford, a
three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 and a Fort Worth
resident, thought he'd seen everything during a career that
included 24 Indianapolis 500 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But while at the controls of the pace car in last night's
Longhorn 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Rutherford encountered
something he couldn't remember ever witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like that before,'' said Rutherford,
after his pace car and Donnie Beechler's car collided during a
yellow-flag situation late in the Indy Racing League event. ``It's
unfortunate, and I'm very disappointed because we knocked Donnie
\RBeechler\S out of the race when he was doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   As the field came down the backstretch under a yellow flag on
Lap 180, Rutherford was hurrying to catch the leaders. The pace car
and Beechler, who was running in the top 10, came together as
several drivers, including Eddie Cheever Jr., tried to avoid track
debris left over from Tyce Carlson's wreck. Rutherford found
himself boxed in with nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began when Carlson lost control of his car while
exiting Turn 2. He turned sideways and slammed the rear of his car
into the wall and brought out the yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody moved to the inside, and as I moved inside, the pace
car came out,'' Beechler explained. ``It ran over the front end of
my car and knocked us out. It's unfortunate because that's probably
the best car I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the collision deployed the airbag in Rutherford's
Oldsmobile Alero pace car, leaving an abrasion along the inside of
his right arm. He refused emergency assistance, however, and jumped
back behind the wheel of the backup pace car and finished his
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The incident spoiled what was shaping up to be a banner day for
Beechler, who had never finished higher than 10th in an IRL race.
Beechler led 26 laps during last night's race and was in front for
the final time on Lap 147.
</P>
<P>
   Beechler, while disappointed, said it was nothing more than an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were in such a hurry to get to the leader, and we
all moved at once,'' he said. ``It wasn't like they were reading a
book or something and not paying attention. It's just one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford hopes some positives will come from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's lessons to be learned from everything, and I
think chasing the leaders is something we won't do again,''
Rutherford said.

STARS STEP UP IN SPITE OF INJURIES

   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Dallas Stars winger Brett Hull played only three
shifts during Saturday night's 2-1 victory against the Sabres in
Game 3, leaving the contest in the first period with a sprained
groin and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Did you notice?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano played with a badly injured left wrist. His
stickhandling wasn't what he'd like it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Did you notice?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to spot the deficiencies in the Stars' game these
days. The Stars seem to have found a way to make up for injuries,
to win despite adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when our backs are against a wall, we seem to find
another gear, we seem to play better,'' winger Pat Verbeek said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's wrist injury didn't seem to hurt the team. Whatever
combination of magic drugs and intestinal fortitude Modano needed,
he found and swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   He won 44 percent of his faceoffs with an injured wrist, for
goodness sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to suck it up,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig. ``We wouldn't
expect anything less. He has to play. We count on him.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hull out of the contest early, others were counted on as
well. Center Tony Hrkac worked to redirect shots in front of Sabres
goalie Dominik Hasek. Center Joe Nieuwendyk had a two-goal night
and his line appears to grow more willful every night. Guy
Carbonneau helped kill off seven penalties, blocking three shots
and dishing out a team-high four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek said the key to this give-and-take, the balance of power
the team is feeling right now, is the product of time and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through times when Mo, Hatch and Nieuwy have all
been out and yet we still continued to win,'' Verbeek said. ``It
hasn't been a thing that just happened. It's been a steady process.
Over the last 21/2 years, our group has been pretty much the same
and we've really built on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And never missed a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Hull is listed as day-to-day,
although he mentioned Hull has experienced this same injury twice
this season, and the most recent occurrence took him seven days to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   His team can pick up the slack, no doubt. But you have to wonder
if Hull will follow Modano's lead during this gut-check time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the rest of your life to heal,'' Modano said. ``This
only comes once in a lifetime.'' nn

THE CLOSER, THE BETTER FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATHAN SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ If winning close games is contagious, the
Rangers are in a full-blown epidemic. And if there's a cure, they
don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   At 12-4, the Rangers lead the American League in one-run
victories and winning percentage in one-run games (.750). Friday
night's 3-2 victory was their 10th in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said they haven't been the stereotypical
close games where teams bunt runners over and try to manufacture a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't been the case,'' Oates said. ``For us, it's been a
two-out, three-run home run to win the game. It's just been one of
those streaks where everything has gone our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said pitching should get some of the credit. More
specifically, left fielder Rusty Greer attributed the success to a
bullpen that has a 3.63 earned-run average,second in the AL behind
Anaheim's 3.30 and fifth in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been able to either hold teams at bay late in the
game and enable us to come back and win or stop the other team from
scoring and enable us to hang on and win a one-run game,'' Greer
said.
</P>
<P>
   WELL-WORN WETTELAND
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland has been busy lately. That's been good
news for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland had appeared in 10 of the team's past 14 games before
last night, recording eight of his league-leading 21 saves in the
process. In that span, he has dropped his earned-run average from
4.96 to 3.25.
</P>
<P>
   While manager Johnny Oates said he is pleased with the results,
he is also mindful of Wetteland's workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize how much he's pitching this year,'' Oates said.
``He's held up well, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland shrugs off the recent busy stretch, saying it comes
with the job of being a closer. But both he and Oates said
efficiency makes the difference. The fewer pitches Wetteland has to
throw, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole key,'' Wetteland said. ``Early in the year, I
was coming back from an injury and I was really struggling with my
mechanics. I was turning in 20-pitch outings, and that doesn't
help.''
AT FULL STRENGTH
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't think center fielder Tom Goodwin's injury will
take 15 days to heal, but that didn't stop them from putting
Goodwin on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said he thinks the torn left hip
flexor muscle that Goodwin suffered Friday is only a seven- to
10-day injury, which means the Rangers could have kept him active
and played a man short until he was ready. But Melvin said that
given the upcoming schedule, that wasn't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't afford to go to New York and Boston short of
players,'' Melvin said. ``Games are too important with the position
we're in.''

SCOTT GOODYEAR TAKES LONGHORN 500
</HEADLINE>
 500-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It took Scott Goodyear 21 starts to score
his first Pep Boys Indy Racing League victory.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday night's Longhorn 500, Goodyear has won two of the
past three IRL events _ and stamped himself as a championship
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear avoided the tire blistering problems that doomed
defending champion Billy Boat early and then drove away from
hometown favorite Greg Ray late to become the first two-time winner
on the IRL's 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been close here a couple of times, so this is special
for us,'' said Goodyear, driver of the No. 4 Pennzoil Panther G
Force-Aurora. ``It's nice to have a win here. We're leading the
championship after our disappointment at Indy, and it was a nice
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear won his first IRL race at Phoenix International Raceway
and initially moved into the points lead on March 28. He was
running a solid fourth in the Indianapolis 500 on May 30 when an
engine failure ended his day just past the halfway mark. This
victory, by 0.888-seconds over Ray, moved Goodyear from second back
into first in the driver's championship by 19 points against Jeff
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're chasing the championship,'' said Goodyear, whose
trademark calculating style proved a perfect fit in the first race
run under the IRL's new reduced rev limit of 10,000 RPMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't working that efficiently in traffic in the
beginning,'' said Goodyear, who took the lead for the first and
last time on Lap 166 of 208 around the 1.5-mile quad-oval. ``We
kept making wing changes and stagger changes and pressure changes
during the pit stops. I was working with the weight-jackers and
rollbars, making the car better throughout the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to play it cool and make the changes during the pit
stops so we could have a car to go racing with at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goodyear was ready to rock, the contenders had been
reduced to Ray and Stan Schmidt. But Ray's relentless pace was
slowed by a cracked engine cylinder head with approximately 60 laps
remaining. And Schmidt began to fade soon after Goodyear drove
around him in Turn 1 and into the lead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Ray led a race-high 56 laps in his No. 2 Glidden/Menards
Dallara-Aurora, but settled for second place at TMS for the second
consecutive June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a track that pays dividends for aggression. That is
right up my alley,'' said Ray, perhaps the most vocal critic of the
IRL's reduction in revs from 10,300 to 10,000. ``Early on we had a
great car. We had an excellent handling race car. We certainly had
the best car out there in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But like last year, we needed more traffic. We were losing a
10th (of a second) every lap and I could see Stan coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt closed within striking distance of Ray on Lap 206 but
couldn't find a line around the Texan, to the delight of a crowd
estimated at 88,000. Schmidt, the heir to two-time Indianapolis 500
champion Arie Luyendyk at Treadway Racing, recorded his best finish
of 1999 in the No. 99 Sprint PCS G Force-Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, who naturally races on Goodyear Eagle radials,
reported no problems with the rubber on his car. That was in
contrast to Boat and teammate Kenny Brack, the reigning Indy 500
champion, who were forced to pit on laps 17 and 19, respectively,
because of blistered right rear tires. Those green flag stops put
the A.J. Foyt Racing teammates a lap down and reduced them to
also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Schmidt drove on Firestone Firehawk tires.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, who started eighth, averaged 151.177 mph in a race
that saw six cautions for 39 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard at Indy, making the car work around
tires that have got a lot of laps on them,'' said Goodyear, 39, a
native of Canada living in Carmel, Ind. ``The other things we're
doing I'm not telling you.'' nn

TIRE TROUBLE COMMON THEME ON HOT TEXAS TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The past two Indy Racing League races at
Texas Motor Speedway have been good and bad for Goodyear Tires.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall at TMS, several Goodyear-shod drivers had trouble with
their tires.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Scott Goodyear won the Longhorn 500K with Goodyear
tires, but once again some potential front-runners had tire trouble
early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat and Kenny Brack each had to pit less than 20 laps
into last night's race, each complaining of tires that were
blistering. Scott Sharp, who led the first 28 laps, was also forced
to pit early because of tire trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lauritzen, Goodyear's operations manager for the IRL, said
that when the tires were tested at TMS in April, they tested them
at night. He added that they were expecting the race to start about
1 1/2 hours later than the 6:30 p.m. start time.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years the race had started around 8 p.m., but the
time change was announced when Fox Sports Net announced its
schedule of IRL races in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plain and simple, we came here prepared for a night race and
it ended up being an afternoon race,'' Lauritzen said. ``We did not
find out about the time change until about two weeks ago. When we
came here in April we waited until the sun went down and the track
temperature was about 90 degrees. Once the sun set \Rlast night\S
and the track temperature came down to where we tested, we had very
few problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said they had to back off to save their tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our setup was very hard on our tires,'' Sharp said after he
finished 10th. ``Because of the problems with our tires, we
purposely backed off on the speed just to make sure we were safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Lauritzen said last night's problems were
different than the tire trouble in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some of this tread blistering in practice,'' he said.
``It was nothing related to what happened last year. This was
surface blistering because these tires held air. We did not have a
single tire go down and the carcass was intact.''
Ward loses lead, streak
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ward was the points leader and Ward had completed every lap
of every IRL race entering last night's race. That changed during
the Longhorn 500.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started on Lap 119, when Ward, who had completed 600
of 600 laps in the three previous races, came in with a broken
right-rear wheel bearing. The problem was fixed in two stops, but
he was 32 laps down by the time he returned. He finished 18th after
completing 176 laps.
</P>
<P>
   It cost him his points lead, as winner Scott Goodyear collected
50 points to Ward's 12. Goodyear has 146 points after four races,
119 more than Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get it back,'' Ward said of the points lead. ``It was
just one of those races.'' Frustration for Cheever
</P>
<P>
   In April, Eddie Cheever surprised the Indy Racing League
community by making the switch to the Infiniti powerplant.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Cheever won the 1998 Indianapolis 500 with the
Oldsmobile Aurora engine, but he also won the first race of 1999 at
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Last night at TMS, Cheever, driving the only Infiniti in the
25-car field, led 13 laps and was comfortably in the top-10 late in
the race, albeit a few laps down. But on Lap 193, he was forced to
pit because of a broken battery tray.
</P>
<P>
   Despite running strong, Cheever was still a little frustrated
after a 16th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here prepared to win,'' Cheever said. ``The Infinti
engine was strong and helped secure us a fifth starting position.
We had our tires figured out. So we had every intention of taking
the checkered flag. We have only ourselves to blame for our results
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two races that Cheever has had the Infiniti he has
finished 16th and 18th.
Old trouble
Rookie John Hollansworth Jr. of Dallas fell victim to the same
problem that hurt him at the Indianapolis 500. He was stuck in
fourth gear for the final laps of that race, and last night at TMS,
it knocked him out on the 146th lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with the motor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the engine couldn't handle what was asked of
it in such a high gear, and a piston failed, said crew chief Rob
Stark.
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth, tied for 12th in the point standings coming in,
fell to 17th.
Gregoire finishes strong
</P>
<P>
   After not qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 two weeks ago, a
little added pressure was placed on French driver, Stephan
Gregoire, when his team set a goal to finish in the top five of
last night's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never put too much pressure on me,'' Gregoire said after
finishing fourth. ``I knew I had to do something great. We needed a
break because everything that had happened to us since the
beginning of the season was just bad breaks. Tonight I hope we
proved it.''
Kelley Racing struggles
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Racing placed its two drivers in the top two qualifying
positions for last night's race, but after falling well behind
early with tire blistering problems, neither pole sitter Mark
Dismore nor Scott Sharp figured in the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Dismore worked his way back through the field and grabbed
eighth, while Sharp led 28 laps early before slipping to 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow \Rrace winner\R Scott Goodyear made the Goodyear tires
last. No one else did,'' Sharp said. ``He was just cruising. It
became real evident when I came in the first time there were
blisters, blisters, blisters.... At that point I just dropped way
back because we needed points.''
Foyt's drivers falter
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt, team owner for defending Longhorn 500 champ Billy
Boat and '99 Indy 500 champ Kenny Brack, saw his drivers encounter
the same Goodyear tire problems. Brack finished 13th and Boat was
24th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we lost a lot of positions because of the right rear
blistering,'' Brack said. ``We couldn't run more than 15 laps
\Rbefore it would start to blister\S, and then I had to just reduce
speed to maintain the rear tires.''
Four drivers repeat
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Wallace, Casey Smith, Steve Kidwell and Ryan Lawler were
all repeat winners in Legends and Bandolero division races
yesterday afternoon at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace won the 25-lap Legends Pro division main event, with
Smith taking the Semi-Pro feature. Kidwell won the Masters event,
and Lawler took another Bandolero victory.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's Mitch Cook won Legends Charger division race. The
Legends will next race on the quarter-mile asphalt track inside the
larger superspeedway June 24 as the first race of the Thursday
Night Stampede.

MAJOR-LEAGUE OFFENSES SHOWING EXTRA VOLTAGE IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   June 5 was another bad day for the New York Mets' pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii, who had been the Mets' most-reliable starter,
allowed six runs on nine hits and a walk in only four innings. The
Mets lost to New York Yankees, 6-3, and their team earned-run
average moved up to 4.87, the highest since 1962, when they lost
120 games with a 5.04 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips, disgusted with the situation,
fired pitching coach Bob Apodaca and assistant pitching coach Randy
Niemann after the game, along with hitting coach Tom Robson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're underachieving,'' Phillips said. ``At the one-third
point of the season, we needed to right the ship, and we still have
plenty of time to get where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets weren't the only ones having a bad pitching day, but
that's not uncommon in major-league baseball this season, not when
the league ERAs are soaring to record heights and home runs are
flying out of the park at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, there were 240 more home runs hit this season
compared with the same amount of games a year ago, when the
all-time record was set.
</P>
<P>
   The American League's ERA was 5.04, which would tie the all-time
worst for a league set in 1936 by the American League. The National
League ERA was 4.56, the highest this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Pick any day of the season, and there are plenty of tawdry
pitching stories to tell. June 5 is one worth examining.
The fall of the mighty
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux allowed five runs on 11 hits
in eight innings on June 5 against the Boston Red Sox. That left
opponents hitting .330 against him, the highest batting average
allowed by a National League starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same pitcher who won four consecutive Cy Young Awards
this decade and as recently as 1995 held opponents to a .197
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always started off pretty slowly as far as my location,''
Maddux said. ``But earlier this season, I felt my biggest problem
was not getting any movement. I'm focusing on getting mechanically
sound and finding the right trigger point, whether it's my hands,
my feet or my chin.''
</P>
<P>
   One theory being discussed behind the scenes is that Maddux is a
victim of the new strike zone. Umpires, rebelling against having to
call higher strikes, have shrunk the width of the strike zone,
meaning fewer pitches are being called strikes on the corner of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux still got the victory against the Red Sox, despite
allowing 10 or more hits for the sixth time in 12 starts. By
comparison, he allowed 10 or more hits only eight times in 124
starts in 1993-96 during his Cy Young streak.
Resurrecting a star
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo, the only pitcher in 1995 to have a lower opponent's
batting average (.182) than Maddux, was released by the New York
Mets in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   With teams desperate for pitching, he wasn't sidelined long.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs signed him to a Triple-A contract, then
discarded him after three starts in the minors. The Cleveland
Indians put him through a tryout, but were shocked by the lack of
velocity and movement of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers were next in line to give him a try. General manager
Sal Bando called it ``trying to catch lightning in a bottle,'' when
the Brewers signed him on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, Nomo allowed seven runs in four innings in a 12-11
loss to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. Prior to that, he was
2-1 with a 2.41 ERA in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   The low-budget Brewers have been trying to catch lightning for
several years. They thought free agent Jim Abbott might be the
answer after he went 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA with the White Sox last
season. He is 1-5 with a 7.24 ERA with the Brewers. They tried Bill
Pulsipher, the once-great Mets pitching prospect, but he's on the
disabled list with a bad back. Ben McDonald and Jeff D'Amico had
careers ruined by torn rotator cuffs. Cal Eldred can't shake elbow
troubles. The Brewers even tried out 38-year-old Steve Ontiveros,
the 1994 American League ERA champion who has had three elbow
reconstruction surgeries. They haven't brought him up _ yet.
\Nsubheds:Belcher vs. Park
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher Tim Belcher signed a two-year, $10.2 million
contract as a free agent in the off-season. He was 4-5 with a 6.57
ERA heading into a June 5 matchup with Chan Ho Park, who was 4-3
with a 4.84 ERA. Both expected to do better this year. Park's
troubles were one reason why the Dodgers fired pitching coach
Charlie Hough.
</P>
<P>
   They took out their frustrations on each other during a
head-to-head matchup at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Park, trying to sacrifice in the fifth inning, dropped a bunt
down the first-base line and was tagged out by Belcher. Park
thought it was an excessively hard tag. The two had words, then
Park threw a forearm to the face. When Belcher tried to retaliate,
Park resorted to kick boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' Park said. ``I can't understand why he did
that to me. He pushed the ball in my chest. It feels like he tried
to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who had a shutout going, fell apart and lost a 4-0 lead
by allowing a grand slam to Devon White. Park was later suspended
for seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was left with a spike wound on his left thigh and wasn't
amused to learn Park was trained in martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a poor excuse,'' Belcher said. ``He knows Tae Kwon Do,
so what? I like to hunt. I didn't take a shotgun.''
\Nsubheds:The Trade
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the Montreal Expos had two one and one out in the
sixth inning when Toronto Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi went to the
mound to check on starter Joey Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi, whose team trailed 1-0 at the time, said, ``Don't \Rlie
to\S me. How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton told him he felt fine. Fregosi left him in. The next
batter, Orlando Merced, hit a three-run homer, and the Expos went
on to win, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regrets telling him I felt fine because I
did,'' Hamilton said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are the one having regrets.
</P>
<P>
   They acquired Hamilton in the off-season from the San Diego
Padres, hoping to add a veteran starter who could enhance at least
their wild-card playoff chances. They not only gave up starter
Woody Williams in return but two good prospects, pitcher Carlos
Almanzar and outfielder Peter Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who spent five weeks on the disabled list with a
shoulder injury, dropped to 0-3 with a 13.21 ERA. Williams pitched
that same day in San Diego, allowing two runs in 51/3 innings
against Seattle and is 2-3 with a 3.43 ERA.
Coors Field blues
</P>
<P>
   Nomo wasn't the only pitcher to have trouble in Coors Field on
June 5. Rockies pitcher Darryl Kile allowed five runs on eight hits
in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kile is 6-9 with 6.19 ERA in 21 starts at Coors Field since
signing a three-year, $24 million contract with the Rockies. In
that same span, he's 11-11 with a 4.27 ERA in 27 games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is wrong with pitching in baseball, Coors Field isn't
helping matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' 12-11 victory on June 5 marked the 24th time both
teams have scored at least 10 runs in a game at Coors Field since
it opened in 1995. By comparison, the Rangers have been involved in
just seven such games, home and away, during the same time period.

BOBBY V. ACTS AS IF HE KNOWS HE'S A SHORT-TIMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ It has finally happened. New York is turning
Bobby Valentine into ``Bobby Bizarro.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week wasn't a good one for Bobby V. His appearance on the
Mets' bench wearing a fake mustache and sunglasses after his
ejection from Wednesday's game was the emotional, impulsive act of
a manager realizing that his days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   That message came across loud and clear last weekend when Mets
general manager Steve Phillips fired three of Valentine's coaches,
including hitting instructor and right-hand man Tom Robson, who had
been with Bobby V. in Texas, Japan and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The firings effectively removed Valentine's support system on a
team that already gives him no support. The consensus in the New
York media is that Phillips is hoping to provoke Valentine into
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Valentine has shown other signs of unraveling. He
benched the hard-to-get-along-with Bobby Bonilla, reportedly
telling him he'd rather play one of his coaches in the outfield
than put Bonilla back in the field. Nothing wrong with that. Others
have had their run-ins with the difficult Bobby Bo.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla promptly refused to pinch-hit in two consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also ripped two local beat writers on the radio and
got into a dugout shouting match with one of them later at the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   His Halloween costume party _ he insists he was never really
back in the dugout _ after being ejected in the 12th inning
Wednesday, had a chance to be hilarious, but his players and the
Mets' front office just aren't laughing any more. Instead, it was
simply another bizarre act in a long-running series.
</P>
<P>
   The league certainly didn't think it was very funny, hitting him
with a two-game suspension, which he's appealing, and a $5,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Can a pink slip be far behind?
Historic Finals
</P>
<P>
   Visiting writers from Canada and other outposts have snidely
enjoyed pointing out that Dallas' most famous landmark is a grassy
knoll downtown. What they might not know is that Buffalo shares
some of Dallas' history in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Stanley Cup Finals between the only two cities where
U.S. presidents have been assassinated in this century: John F.
Kennedy in Dallas in 1963; William McKinley in Buffalo in 1901.
Up in flames
</P>
<P>
   Collect call for Kenny Rogers: Temper, temper, Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Rogers was with the Rangers and demolished a
stationary bike at Oakland? Punched the mound at Tiger Stadium with
his pitching hand after giving up a home run to Cecil Fielder?
Shoved a reporter out of the Rangers' clubhouse who had written
about that incident?
</P>
<P>
   He's up to his old tricks again.
</P>
<P>
   Upset after blowing a 6-2 lead at San Francisco last weekend,
Rogers ripped apart three telephones and a bathroom paper dispenser
between the dugout and the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It was an expensive temper tantrum: The Giants sent him a bill
for $2,000. Why so high? Because the pulverized phones supposedly
were tamper-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it; I was upset. I have a temper, I've never hidden
that,'' Rogers admitted. ``At least I was smart enough to use my
right hand this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't know what he was so mad about: He'd given up just five
runs in his 6 2/3 innings, virtually a quality start by today's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, by the way, had an open-and-shut case: They caught
the whole incident on videotape.
No heir apparent
</P>
<P>
   Word from inside the Mavericks' organization says the media had
best hold up on those ceremonies anointing Donnie Nelson, Big Don's
son and Mavs' assistant, as the next head coach of the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   That, insiders say, is far from a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly there's nothing in writing guaranteeing the
succession and the Mavericks don't have any obligation to honor
that scenario. It's one of those things that seems to have taken on
a life of its own once Big Don mentioned that he'd like to see it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Young Donnie, by the way, is the only assistant coach in the NBA
with his own secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Divine intervention
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours after this newspaper ran a headline that read,
``Deion's football future: `It's up to the Lord,' came word that
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had decided to try to negotiate an
extension of Deion Sanders' contract.
</P>
<P>
   Just goes to show that The Man does indeed work in mysterious
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Hold that thought
</P>
<P>
   Deion's Q&AMP;A with our Clarence E. Hill Jr. last week included
Sanders' weak defense about playing in the Pro Bowl. Hill asked him
if he had regrets about making that decision ``from a perception
standpoint.'' Deion's response completely missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely moved in the game. ... Besides, the doctors told me
there was nothing I could do to worsen my injury, and I didn't have
a setback,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong answer.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the question was about perception and whether a
player who had missed almost six full games near the end of the
season when his team needed him badly should be showing up at the
Pro Bowl, which has nothing to do with winning and everything to do
with ego. Like it or not, that clearly sends the wrong message to
his teammates and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad decision, and the fact that Deion can't admit that,
even with hindsight, shows a severe lack of judgment on his part.
\Nsubheds:Passports, please
</P>
<P>
   Did you realize that every Caucasian player on the Mavericks was
born in another country? Check it out: Shawn Bradley and Dirk
Nowitzki, Germany; Steve Nash, South Africa; Chris Anstey,
Australia; Bruno Sundov, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Just coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   Not completely.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Donnie Nelson, whose wife is Swedish, has
coached international teams and loves European players.
</P>
<P>
   Three's not the charm
</P>
<P>
   After 18 years with just one media director, the Mavericks will
soon have their third in less than a year. Tony Fay, who took over
when longtime PR man Kevin Sullivan resigned late last summer, will
now follow Sully's footsteps out the door after a dozen years with
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Fay, 32, will join with other former Mavericks employees to
start their own public relations/event management company, with the
Sidekicks already signed up as their first client. Fay, a
season-ticket holder even before he went to work for the Mavericks,
hasn't missed a game since Derek Harper dribbled out the clock in
the 1984 playoffs against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   He was a talented, loyal, dedicated employee, and the Mavericks
are losing too many like him.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Mavericks to go outside the organization to find a
replacement this time.
Too much weight?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds as if Edmonton might not be able to keep Doug Weight and
his $6 million contract, which translates into about $4.3 million
in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening, Stars?
REVO'S RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Word has it that every phone in the Phoenix Suns' front office
now has Caller ID. They want to be sure they pick up when they see
it's the Mavericks calling.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spurs needed a soft pickup team to practice, while they
were waiting to see whether the Knicks or the Pacers would be
joining them in the NBA Finals, the Mavericks were available.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson says he didn't know he was violating
NBA cap rules by providing a lavish Hawaiian vacation to Gary Trent
and his family. Hey, he's only the general manager. You didn't
expect him to know the rules, too, did you?
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's no longer bogged down with his nonessential duties
as club president, the Rangers' Tom Schieffer is concentrating on
more important things, such as touring cities around the country to
study the real estate infrastructure around their ballparks.
Development: That's the new name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   NBA scouts in Chicago for last week's predraft camp were
whispering excitedly about a 7-foot-3, 320-pound Toronto prospect
named Jerry Sokolowski. One problem: He's only in the ninth grade.
The 15-year-old is expected to add another four to six inches in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A disgusted fan e-mailed the Chicago Tribune's Steve Rosenbloom
wondering if Notre Dame football players such as Jarvis Edison, who
fathered a child with booster Kim Dunbar, get credit for Lamaze
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Ba-da-boom!

THE DANGER IN US-ONLY INVESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week The Financial Times plastered across its front page
the news that private investors in the United States are removing
money from international investment funds as the trend to invest
only in US equities gathers pace.
</P>
<P>
   This news was based on figures compiled by the Investment
Company Institute, a trade association of the mutual fund industry.
According to the institute's research, a net $7.15 billion was
withdrawn from funds investing outside the United States in the
first four months of this year, while the industry as a whole
attracted $74.91 billion in new cash.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward US equities-only investing began two years ago.
As recently as 1996, international investment funds attracted a
whopping $50 billion in cash. In 1997, however, investment in
international funds fell to less than $8 billion, as the ``Asian
flu'' spread across continents. That number is now negative $7
billion, despite a significant increase in overall investment.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons why this has occurred. First among
them is the spectacular performance of US equities. As Robert Swift
of Putnam Investments told The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
   People are seeing that the United States has provided 23 percent
returns over the last five years, compounded, while non-US has
provided half that, and theyre saying theres no point owning this
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the war in Kosovo unnerved money managers everywhere.
Even with an end to the hostilities, there remains widespread
concern that simmering ethnic tensions in the Balkans could erupt
again at any moment and destabilize an uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Third, there is a growing consensus that European companies
simply can't compete with their more dynamic US counterparts. The
rap is that Euro companies are too conservative, too risk-averse
and too hidebound by tradition and paternalism to win in what has
come to be called the new economy. AT&AMP;T reinvented itself in 18
months. British Telecom, it is said, is simply incapable of doing
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, there's the Y2K problem, the computer glitch that causes
computers to read the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University researcher Juan Enriquez has argued that the
Y2K problem was especially acute because of its potential impact on
emerging-market nations. Enriquez noted that many emerging market
countries _ Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia and Chile, to name
just five _ have been so bedeviled by pressing financial and social
crises that they have devoted virtually no attention to the
disaster that lurked in all of their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, however, is not just a problem for emerging-market nations.
European countries and companies based there have also been laggard
in their Y2K preparations and contingency planning. A leading
European computer-consulting firm published a report earlier this
year detailing the inadequacy of these preparations. On top of all
the other concerns, this may be the x-factor that has been tipping
the scales against investment in European investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its causes, the trend toward US-only investing is
unsustainable in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   As former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Thursday, the
world cannot solely depend on US economic growth. If you take a
look around the global economy, said Rubin, it is still true that
the only major part of the global economy that has sustained,
domestic, demand-led growth is the United States, and that is
certainly not a healthy situation in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that there has been some good news of late.
Germany's economic output grew faster than expected in the first
quarter of this year (having fallen in the last quarter of 1998).
Japan, which has been in a depression, announced Friday that its
economy surged 7.9 percent in the first quarter of this year; a
stunning development. Emerging market countries have not seen the
kind of disinvestment that was much feared earlier this year.
Indeed, emerging market funds are, at the moment, doing better than
mutual funds that invest in Europe. And the end of the war in
Kosovo has relieved some of the tension that gripped financial
markets for the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   But the concerns remain. Money managers, after all, are in the
business of maximizing their client's investment returns. If,
collectively, they decide that Y2K and cultural dynamism and
political instability argue against investing in International
funds and that the only safe course is to pour money into US
equities, then the consequences for the global economy will be
profound.
</P>
<P>
   Following the outflows and inflows of money will thus be a major
preoccupation of US policy makers over the course of the next six
months and will determine short-term fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan may think the Federal Reserve Bank should raise
interest rates in the near future to tamp down the fear of
inflation. But he probably wont be able to do that. The United
States needs money going out into the global economy. Three-legged
stools cant stand on one leg.

 &HT;    Win or lose Senate race, Hillary will make history for women
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It seems the perfect ending for a century that started
with women seeking the right to vote: a first lady running for the
U.S. Senate while she's in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up 55 percent of the voters but they are a diverse
lot. Even in New York, women won't just vote for another woman. A
lot of the Hillary haters are women, ready to aim their most
vicious darts at a woman who has outsmarted conservative
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever promised this first lady a rose garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is an easy target because she lives the
successes and failures of the women's movement in full view. She is
the first first lady to do so. For at the heart of the enormous
gains women have made this century are the freedom and the tools to
pursue both families and careers. The pitfall is that marriages
crumble or flourish in the new kind of partnering marriage
relationship that demands. It requires, above all, men who aren't
threatened by a spouse's success, those secure in their own
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Hillary's recent appeal to more moderates _
especially, as the polls reflect, older men _ is her loyalty to her
husband through the most nightmarish and embarrassing public
exposure any political spouse has ever suffered. It's a good bet
that Hillary lived the old cliche of standing by her man out of a
desire to preserve the dignity of her own position as much as
anything else. She has. And we have no business speculating about
her feelings for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will take a giant step for future first ladies and wives
of high-profile public figures by just running for the U.S. Senate
while her husband is still president. The backlash to the women's
movement will insist that a first lady couldn't possibly do another
job _ despite having criticized Hillary for doing too much. But
Hillary supporters say she, like most women today, is perfectly
capable of shouldering two major jobs at once.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years after women won the right to vote, we aren't close
to equal political power. More power for women is important because
it will eventually result in a less violent, harsh and greedy
society. And a more family-friendly one. At the rate we're going,
women won't attain gender parity in Congress until 2500.
</P>
<P>
   When I first listened to Hillary at a political event before her
husband's election, I thought she was the best-informed female
political speaker I'd ever heard. She talked substance, not emotion
or party cliches. She never dodged a policy question, whether on
taxes, child care or foreign affairs. She was respectful of her
husband, but she never demurred that he knew more than she.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time during the past six years, she has taken a
softer approach, out of political necessity and respect for the
office of the presidency. But in her run for the Senate seat
representing New York, she ought to revert to the substantive,
intellectual woman she is. Then, even if she loses, she will have
opened an historic door for women who want to mix traditional with
progressive roles in a new way. Not all men or women can think
outside the box about those options yet _ but in the next
millennium, they will.
</P>
<P>
   Most women who seek political power, whether conservative or
liberal, aren't trying to flaunt anything; they're trying to fix
things. And in Washington, there's a whole lot to fix.

 &HT;    Kidnapper to sell house
 &HT;    ATTN: Massachusetts
 &HT;    By Michele Gelormine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was once known as the Pepto-Bismol house.
</P>
<P>
   The oceanfront mansion, now more famous as the house where
convicted kidnapper Stephen Fagan lives, is on the market for $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 57, and his fourth wife, Harriet Golding Martin, have
done extensive renovations to the 7,154-square-foot house,
including changing the pink exterior to a more neutral color.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said Thursday that he and his wife intend to stay in Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color was dreadful,'' Fagan said. ``Restoring a house is a
combination of joy and pain. It's a lot of work. Even before (the
arrest), we had planned to sell. It's a lot of fun to restore, but
this is a lot of square feet for two people.''

   Fagan and Golding Martin bought the house for $1.6 million in
1996, under the names William S. and Harriet G. Martin. Fagan
assumed the identity of William Martin after taking his two young
daughters from his ex-wife in Massachusetts 20 years ago, fleeing
to Florida with them and telling the girls their mother was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan and his ex-wife Barbara Kurth were embroiled in a custody
battle at the time. Fagan said he took the girls because Kurth was
an alcoholic and a neglectful mother. He points to Kurth's three
drunk-driving arrests _ one with the girls in the car _ to back up
his claims.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth has denied his accusations and has said she suffered from
the sleeping disorder, narcolepsy.

 &HT;    Student loans make the grade
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ After the caps and gowns have been returned, the
parties thrown and the rejection letters thrown away, the real
business of being a would-be college student begins.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Economics 101: Footing the Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Amber Meyers has that part under control. On June 5 she
graduated from Franklin High School. In August she starts her civil
engineering studies at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Because Meyers, 18, started the scholarship and student loan
hunt during her junior year, she has lined up enough grants and
scholarships to cover half of her tuition, and an additional $6,000
in Perkins and subsidized Stafford loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit more that I need, but for the most part
I'm pretty well covered,'' said Meyers, who began an internship
today with the City of Kettering, part of her financial aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   The college-bound most likely have become experts in their own
right in the world of student loans. But there's a whole new crop _
students and parents _ who haven't a clue where to turn.
</P>
<P>
   If you're headed to college in the fall and haven't started
looking into student loans at all, you're awfully late, but not
without hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students were starting the process now at Wright State,
they wouldn't receive smaller campus-based funds (ie. the Federal
Supplemental Educational Opportunity grant, Federal Perkins loan or
federal work-study),'' said Jennifer Penick, associate director of
financial aid officer at Wright State University whose office is
dealing with last-minute financial aid processing for the
winding-down school year, summer and for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But she emphasized that there is still aid out there to be had.
``There's still time to apply for federal financial aid and to
receive major types of federal and state funding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers admits she didn't know what she was getting into before
her junior year. The first person in her family to attend college
right out of high school, Meyers said she was ``kind of dumb to the
fact. It was, 'Oh, you've got four years, don't worry about it.'
But then by the middle of senior year, you realize, 'You've gotta
pay for college.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, guidance counselors, college financial aid
offices and financial institutions with whom you're familiar are
the first places to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the expansion of the Internet, has made
navigating the student loan process less of a headache and more of
a gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you would go to your local bank, savings
and loan, or credit union and apply for a federal loan,'' said Mark
Cannon, a Miami University alumnus who serves as executive director
of the Coalition for Student Loan Reform, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization of state and private student loan companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, however, mergers have made banks more
specialized in nature, with some emerging as student loan
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, while legally still required to involve a bank
in the process as a trustee, are now becoming all-inclusive
lenders, originating loans under their own name and taking care of
all repayment obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Family Education Loan Program's $33 billion annual
program has made student loans big business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really gearing a lot of our products and services to be
able to provide loan services and products via the Web,'' said Jim
Eickhoff, senior vice president for business development and
marketing for Cincinnati-based Student Loan Funding Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Like other lenders across the country, SLFR offers its own brand
of loans. Its Jump Start Stafford loan was made available for the
first time in 1997 to Ohio students and to out-of-state students
attending Ohio schools. All recipients must be eligible for either
subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides the greatest savings. They can do no better in
Ohio,'' Eickhoff said. Based on the new federal interest rate for
Stafford loans, JumpStart's new rate should be 5.42 percent in
1999-2000, provided that payments are made on time and SLFR's
EasyPay program (their automated bank account deduction program) is
used.
</P>
<P>
   While SLFR has obviously established itself in the lending
community _ since 1984 the company has provided more than $4.5
billion in financial aid to 730,000 students, primarily in Ohio,
with $1.1 billion in loans granted for the 1998-99 school year
alone _ it is just one of countless lenders that students and
parents need to research. Finding the one that fits your individual
needs, such as discounted interest rate payments, account access
and flexible repayment alternatives is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to financial aid is the four-page FAFSA (Free
Application for Federal Student Aid), a mandatory form for college
students. Once filed, colleges use the ``expected family
contribution'' established by the FAFSA and the individual
colleges' costs to determine if accepted students are eligible for
subsidized or unsubsidized loans as part of its financial aid
package.
</P>
<P>
   Each college typically provides students with a list of
preferred lenders with whom they already have a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The whole student aid path _ including a one-page promissory
note that collects borrower information, certifications and promise
to re-pay the loan _ usually takes no more than four weeks to
process.
</P>
<P>
   The process seems cut-and-dried, but that doesn't eliminate the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest ones is, 'Am I eligible? Do I make too much
money?''' said Denise Rossitto, spokeswoman for Washington,
D.C.-based Sallie Mae (Student Loan Marketing Association).
``People tend to think (that option) is beyond reach for
middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been the case since 1992, when the federal
government created unsubsidized loans for students from middle- and
upper-income families, regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   What's New?
</P>
<P>
   With the recent trend in dropping student loan interest rates _
and with tax incentives and early-payment programs _ more people
are finding student loans more affordable. Each summer Congress
sets the maximum federal loan interest rates (meaning Stafford loan
lenders can go below that rate as low as they want). Last July 1
the Department of Treasury reset the rate to 6.86 percent (while a
student is enrolled) and 7.46 percent (during repayment), the
lowest rate in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years other major changes have made to make the
borrowing process easier for students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Master Promissory Note is a new Stafford loan
application/promissory note for the 1999-2000 academic year that
cuts down on paperwork for institutions and borrowers of Stafford
loans.
</P>
<P>
   At the discretion of each individual college, the MPN will be
used as of July 1 as a multi-year promissory note. Students will
have to fill out the form _ basically a promise that they will pay
the money back _ only once during their enrollment in a four-year
or graduate school, as long as he or she stays at that school, and
continues to borrow from the same lender.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Mae is testing a new student loan program called
Laureate, which would give colleges the ability to provide loans
for students through the Internet, with three schools. It plans to
expand its test program to 50 more schools in the upcoming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real anxious to get this across all campuses in the
country. The whole management access for financial aid officers is
just unbelievable,'' Rossitto said. ``The program will get the loan
applied for, approved, guaranteed and funds dispersed within 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers credits her high school guidance counselors and family
friends with steering her in the right direction. Despite having to
re-think her college choice (the University of Notre Dame topped
her list) after looking at finances, Meyers can't wait to become a
UD freshman.
</P>
<P>
   She's also looking toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little brother is a freshman in high school,'' Meyers said.
``I'm telling him to start all of this earlier than me.''

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Tensions were high all over
Kosovo Sunday, as a second wave of NATO troops began entering
war-torn province. It was certainly higher at the strategic airport
just outside Pristina, where Serbs and Russians were blocking
further access to NATO troops one day after some British forces
were allowed to enter. The NATO security force initially was
expected to set up its command center at the airport, but that
facility's status remained unclear. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and President Clinton spoke by telephone for an hour Sunday about
Russia's role in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Meanwhile, two
Yugoslav soldiers were killed Sunday morning in the Vranjevac
district in separate attacks involving the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army, and British paratroopers shot and killed a Yugoslav police
reservist after the man fired a pistol at a NATO patrol.

   KOSOVO-ALBANIANS _PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ As German NATO troops

killed by Serb troops. It was the same all over the war-torn
province as the second wave of NATO troops to begin their
peacekeeping mission, with fearful Kosovar Albanians literally
stepping out into the light for the first time in weeks.

blessed by party leaders, that reflects an attempt to change the

pose a dilemma for Rep. Bart Stupak, the four-term Democrat who
represents this sprawling, wooded region. Stupak had been one of
about 30 Democrats who consistently crossed party lines to oppose
gun control -- at least, until this spring. Dismayed by the recent
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and near Atlanta, Stupak has
publicly suggested that he would vote for legislation this month to
require child-proof safety locks on guns, mandate background checks
at certain gun shows and ban the import of high-capacity ammunition
clips. A look at the pressures on one congressman on the issue. By

A VEGETABLE OIL FOR ENGINE LUBRICATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Efforts to make cars more environmentally sound have centered on
designing cleaner-running engines, and eliminating the need for
gasoline in favor of electricity. But presumably any car will still
have an engine made up of some moving metal parts, and that
requires lubricants. Cars like trains, lawn mowers or chain saws
rely on petroleum-based motor oils. Which brings those concerned
about the environment right back to the drawing board. Even an
electric car may produce toxic waste from motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   But James Lambert and Duane Johnson have developed an
alternative. They have patented a vegetable oil lubricant. Their
invention can be circulated in internal combustion engines, or
sprayed in one-time applications like those necessary for
lubricating train rails.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors, from Colorado Springs, Colo., plan for their
lubricant to be ``a total replacement for current petroleum and
vegetable-based additives to petroleum.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, car owners who changed their own oil could just dump
a pan of dirty black oil into the nearest sewer drain. Now that
people understand how toxic oil waste can be to soil, water,
plants, animals and people, used motor oil must be discarded
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   But other petroleum-based lubricants are still regularly dumped
in the open.
</P>
<P>
   Some lubricants are also used in what the inventors identify as
``total loss applications.'' In those applications, oils are
applied only once and then thrown away. Trains use such oils,
spewing huge amounts of petroleum waste onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``A train alone may consume five gallons of oil per 1,000 miles
as the oil is sprayed on the track to lubricate the wheels,'' the
inventors write in their patent. ``This amounts to a total of
300,000 gallons annually being discarded along railings within the
U.S. alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the oils used in cars and on train rails are petroleum
based, they are not biodegradable. In addition, chemicals are
usually added to improve the consistency and performance of the
oil. Of course, these oils are distilled from crude petroleum, a
nonrenewable natural resource.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert and Johnson hope to eliminate concerns over motor oils
altogether. Their patent covers a vegetable oil lubricant they say
is biodegradable as well as more efficient at lubrication and heat
transfer than petroleum-based oils. Their lubricant is made up of
three elements: a base oil, an oil made up of hydroxy fatty acids
and an oil made up of vegetable or animal waxes.
</P>
<P>
   The patent stipulates that the base oil come from unrefined
vegetable oils like soybean, canola, rapeseed, crambe, safflower,
or sunflower. The inventors prefer to get their hydroxy fatty acids
from castor, and their waxes from jojoba, meadowfoam or lanolin.
Natural anti-oxidants are also present in the lubricant, and the
inventors say that synthetic anti-oxidants may also be added.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, which belongs to the Agro Management Group &UR;  &LR; of
Colorado Springs, is 5,888,947.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLEANING UP THE DRY CLEANERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The dry-cleaning industry has also been plagued with the
environmental, health and occupational hazards of the solvent
usually used to clean clothes, pechloroethylene. Researchers have
worked for years to find an alternative to the chemical known
commonly as Perc.
</P>
<P>
   William Hayday, from Woodbury, N.Y., and Stephen Bates, from
Huntington, N.Y., have won a patent for an alternative they say
cleans clothes better than Perc without any of Perc's drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Perc became popular as a dry-cleaning solvent because it does
not ruin dyes, damage or shrink fabrics, and is nonflammable and
easily distilled.
</P>
<P>
   But its uses are far more reaching than clothes cleaning. Perc
is also a popular industrial degreasing agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industrial uses of Perc are approximately tenfold greater
than its use as a solvent for dry cleaning,'' the inventors point
out in their patent.
</P>
<P>
   But Perc is also poisonous to water, soil and the ozone layer.
Any substitutes must prove as effective at dry cleaning and
degreasing, while also being biodegradable and nontoxic.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the inventors have discovered that ``a particular
propylene glycol ether, when mixed with certain weight percentages
of water to form an azeotropic mixture'' creates a solvent that
cleans clothes better than Perc. (An azeotropic mixture is one in
which the vapor composition is identical to that of its liquid, the
inventors explained, so the liquid and vapor act as one substance).
</P>
<P>
   The inventors say their patented solvent also degreases metals,
cleans electronic components and scours and mills woolens better
than Perc. It also weighs less than water, making it easier to
dispose of, since unlike Perc, it will not sink to the bottom of a
water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Hayday and Bates received patent 5,888,250.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 &HT;    GOP RECASTS ITSELF AS CHAMPIONS OF HIGH-TECH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress will put the lucrative high-tech world
into play this week as Republicans seek to build an alliance with
an industry that has largely been a feeding ground for Democratic
fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are sponsoring the first-ever National Summit on
High Technology, comprised of high-profile hearings before the
Joint Economic Committee to be spread over three days.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will be the opening
witness Monday. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who chairs the panel,
asked Greenspan to review the ``outstanding impact this growing and
relatively new segment of the economy has had on jobs, wages and
standards of living.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Greenspan, the committee will hear Monday from IBM
chairman Louis Gerstner and Intel Corp. president Craig Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Day two of the summit will feature Microsoft Corp. chairman and
co-founder Bill Gates, who will ``explore legislative issues of
concern to this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates' top concern in Washington nowadays is the landmark
antitrust trial against Microsoft being heard in a federal
courthouse within sight of the Capitol. Republicans hope that
Gates' anger against the Democrat-run U.S. Justice Department will
yield major campaign contributions for their candidates in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the high-tech industry has become an
increasingly vital reservoir of political money. The Center for
Responsive Politics estimates that computer industry executives
gave some $9 million to Congressional candidates in the 1997-98
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also been taken aback by the breadth of the
72-member high-tech fundraising committee organized by Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. As the Republican White House front-runner, Bush
counts in his financial corner such industry luminaries as America
Online's James Barksdale, Cisco Systems' John Chambers, and Intel
co-founder Gordon Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Two anti-Microsoft figures are scheduled to testify Wednesday,
Day three, at the high-tech summit: Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun
Microsystems, and Marc Andreessen(CQ), chief technology adviser to
AOL and a co-founder of Netscape Communications, absorbed by AOL in
a recent $10 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Although accusatory McNealy and Andreessen e-mails have been
featured at the Microsoft trial, neither business leader is a
steadfast Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to counter the Republican political drive, House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., last week named a
Democratic high-tech advisory panel. It is headed by two Silicon
Valley Californians: Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Anna Eshoo.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic activists also last week sponsored a ``technology
outreach'' day, which included informal exchanges with Microsoft
senior vice president Craig Mundie, Silicon Valley entrepreneur
John Doerr and Dell Computer chairman Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are at risk of further losing high-tech support
for their failure to get behind legislation that would protect the
industry from Y2K computer damage suits. The bill faces a key floor
vote in the Senate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trial attorneys are preparing to file a blizzard of lawsuits
against the computer industry over the feared failure of systems
unable to deal with the date change on Jan. 1, 2000, widely known
as the Y2K computer glitch. The trial lawyers remain firmly in the
Democratic camp, which may influence what is widely seen as a close
vote.

`PHANTOM MENACE' VISUAL EFFECTS SPECIALISTS REVEAL ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- They put the sizzle in the lightsabers, the juke
in Jar Jar, the bang in the battle droids and the wiles in Watto.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping out a record 2,000 digital-effects shots in just 18
months for ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' they
were the true Jedi knights, the ones who sliced through technical
challenges of all sorts to give the exacting George Lucas the sleek
digital sheen and jaw-dropping effects that drive his latest space
epic.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, after two years of tight-lipped labor at Skywalker
Ranch, the top visual-effects men at Lucas' Industrial Light &AMP;
Magic could reveal some of the little secrets they tucked into
``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was the Visual Effects Society's first-ever Festival
of Visual Effects, held last weekend in North Hollywood. Among the
embarrassment of riches were key visual-effects and animation
leaders from ILM. Among their secrets:
</P>
<P>
   __Now we know what E.T. did after ending his movie career.
</P>
<P>
   As the film neared its completion, Lucas showed a rough cut to
buddy Steven Spielberg, whose own directorial credits include the
beloved alien-in-Chatsworth tale, ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Lucas decided it might be fun to have E.T. in the
Galactic Senate, so in March, just two months before the film was
supposed to hit theaters, the effects guys got a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we put E.T. in one shot and Steven said, `I couldn't see
it,' so we added him bigger in another shot,'' said visual-effects
supervisor Scott Squires, winner of an Oscar for technical
achievement and twice nominated for other Oscars on ``Dragonheart''
and ``The Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to spot the former Valley alien now that he's made it to
the big time? Look lower left in the wide shots. But it may take a
magnifying glass and the jog-shuttle control on your DVD months
from now to get a good look.
</P>
<P>
   __Talk about space odysseys. Another little background joke
involves the scene where Liam Neeson's Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn
tries to buy replacement parts for the damaged space ship in which
he, the queen and others escaped from Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   As the pugnacious parts dealer Watto and Qui-Gon walk through
the outdoor back area of Watto's shop, look between them. In the
background is the pod, minus one dead astronaut, from the late
Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   __As Queen Amidala and some of her troops storm through the
palace hallway, trying to capture the viceroy, look over their
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a portrait in the hallway, and it's (of) George
Lucas,'' said Greg Maloney, who oversaw two-dimensional compositing
duties in the film.
</P>
<P>
   __Did you happen to notice those lovely, cascading waterfalls in
the long shots of the queen's home planet, Naboo? That's not water,
it's salt, cascading down models that were 12 to 14 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   The crew shot the cascading salt with extremely fast cameras,
running at 96 or 120 frames per second, four or five times the
normal film speed. Who needs particle effects in your
computer-animation package when you've got a mess of Morton's to
pour?
</P>
<P>
   __Creating many shots was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle,
as it flashes by at 24 frames per second. Backgrounds would be
pieced in from 1/30th scale models shot at various distances,
full-size props and digital creations ``blue-screened'' onto the
shot, while many key characters in each scene didn't exist. They,
too, were digital and had to be pieced in around everyone else,
along with their shadows and reflections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first saw this (raw film footage from live-action
shooting), you'd just scratch your head and say, `How are we going
to make this a movie?' '' said Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   __Six effects shots that were ``finaled'' -- having gone through
the entire creation process until they literally had Lucas'
personal stamp of approval -- were later edited out of the final
version of the movie that hit the screen. Can you say ``special
edition''?
</P>
<P>
   __Jar Jar's father didn't like him initially either.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Coleman was the film's animation director, ``responsible for
basically everything with a head on it,'' creating characters for
all three crews of special-effects artists who worked on the film.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 45 animators labored over 810 of those 2,000 shots, or
about an hour of the film, creating and breathing life into 66
different kinds of characters, including four speaking parts,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of those animated characters has been Jar
Jar Binks, the goofball Gungan who provides pratfalls and patois in
near equal amounts throughout about 30 minutes of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I speak to kids, I talk about Jar Jar. When I speak to
you (adults), I talk about Watto,'' Coleman said. ``I read the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman acknowledged, however, that ``when I read the script for
the first time, I had the same (negative) reaction to Jar Jar. But
I really felt like my little brain shouldn't be asking these
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he feels better about Jar Jar, in part because of
the reception it gets from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk to the people that George thinks should be the
focus of the movie, kids between 9 and 15, they love Jar Jar,''
Coleman said. ``And what I've noticed is when people see the movie
a second time, they're willing to give Jar Jar a second chance. But
I've stopped watching the (Internet) news groups.''
</P>
<P>
   __There's a reason Jar Jar doesn't walk like a human. He isn't
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually can't walk like us; it comes out of his bone
structure,'' which the computer modeled and is very different from
a human's hips and knees, Coleman said. ``I actually grew to love
it. I think it adds to his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Jar Jar has (ITAL) five (END ITAL) different gaits,
including ``the hot sand walk,'' the ``Gungan shuffle,'' and the
``walking in leaves'' walk, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   __Watto was first.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he ``fell in love with him from the first time I
read the script. I've been very pleased with the reaction to
Watto.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Watto has very little hard-to-animate clothing, he
was the first character the animators tackled.
</P>
<P>
   __When Qui-Gon asks the Gungan leader what would happen to Jar
Jar after the Jedis left, the original dialogue said he would be
``bounded unto death.'' The sentence was later struck from the
film, to the chagrin of Jar Jar haters everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   __Coleman, who had worked at ILM on such films as ``Men in
Black'' for four years before ``Phantom Menace,'' had never
actually met Lucas before being named head of the film's animation
unit.
</P>
<P>
   So when the call came telling him of the important assignment,
``I was terrified,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more terrifying: being handed the initial scene drawings
for the hugely complicated battle scene between the Gungans and
battle droids during the film's climax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even tell you what it's like to get handed a
storyboard like this,'' Coleman said. ``I love this scene, but it's
almost impossible to tell you how many things are moving around on
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas did what he could to ease Coleman into his task. During a
two-week stint while shooting was going on in London, Coleman and
Lucas talked endlessly during breaks in filming about Lucas' vision
of the characters, their backgrounds and looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would Watto be from Tattoine? Would he be wiping his brow?''
Coleman said of the kinds of questions they were kicking back and
forth.
</P>
<P>
   __The digital-effects guys wouldn't have used the new, extremely
fast Kodak film stock chosen for ``Phantom Menace'' by the director
of photography. Its relatively large grain, particularly in its
blue register, may have looked fabulous on screen, but it made
melding blue-screened digital shots and blue uniforms even more of
a pain, said Squires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you would shoot on the slowest stock you can get away
with, with the finest grain possible,'' Squires said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lucas will sidestep all that in Episode II: He plans
to shoot it all on high-definition digital video, one of the first
films to be made that way. He's already begun the process, sneaking
five high-definition digital video shots into Episode I. Squires
wasn't saying which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Testing has already begun on how best to use the HD video
cameras for the next film, and Squires said, ``There'll be another
set of issues to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   __The next episode is less than three years away and work has
already begun.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles,
``Star Wars'' producers said they had already begun pre-production
meetings on Episode II, days before Episode I had opened.
</P>
<P>
   And for the ILM jedis waving their digital swords over all this,
they'll be back at the computers by next February, angling for a
release date of May 19, 2002. May the Force be with them.

PALESTINIAN BEHIND '72 OLYMPIC KIDNAPPING BARRED FROM WEST BANK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli government Sunday barred Mohammed Oudeh,
a Palestinian official who recently acknowledged playing a
mastermind role in the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage-taking episode,
from entering the West Bank to return to his home in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bavarian prosecutors issued a warrant for Oudeh's
arrest, based on his admissions in a recently published
autobiography. In his book, published in France, Oudeh, who is
better known as Abu Daoud, described smuggling arms into Germany
and transporting the terrorists into the Olympic village before
they took Israeli athletes hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, followed by a bungled rescue operation, left 11
Israelis, five Palestinians and one German dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning instructed
security forces not to allow Abu Daoud, who planned the murder of
Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, to enter the Palestinian
Authority from Jordan,'' said a statement issued by the outgoing
Prime Minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   Oudeh, 63, a lawyer, has lived with his wife in Ramallah since
1996, when he was allowed to return from exile for a Palestine
Liberation Organization leadership meeting and stayed. During the
last few years, he has traveled abroad frequently and has enjoyed
the privileges of an Israeli-issued VIP pass that allowed him
relatively free movement through Israeli checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu also ordered Oudeh's VIP pass canceled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli decision, while based on Munich's intent to
prosecute, nonetheless tests what some Israelis consider to be the
most difficult premise of the peace negotiations: that the past is
past and that former terrorists should be treated as partners in
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Those who experienced terrorism directly feel this most keenly.
``It is inconceivable that a man with a direct or indirect
connection with the murder of the 11 from Munich would ever be here
as a free man,'' said Uri Afek, chairman of the Israeli Olympic
Committee at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And Ilana Romano, widow of Yosef Romano, an Olympic wrestler who
died in the 1972 episode, said on Israel Radio, ``Arrest this man,
this murderer, this criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Amman, Jordan, Oudeh criticized the
Israeli decision to bar him as hypocritical and insulting to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Oslo, nobody was supposed to be interested in re-opening
the pages of the past,'' he said. ``The Israelis should take into
consideration that there is a peace process and that we are not
anymore enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned that Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak talks freely
now about assassinating Palestinian operatives in Beirut in the
same era as the Munich attack. It is part and parcel of a shared
history of violence and counterviolence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been living in the Palestinian territories for three
years without any problem,'' he continued. ``The Israeli
intelligence knew everything about me, and despite that they are
ready to re-open a historical account.''
</P>
<P>
   Daoud Oudeh, his son, said in Ramallah that there is no reason
to hold his father accountable if the Palestinian leaders above him
go untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Munich was not a one-man decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Palestine: From Jerusalem to Munich,'' Oudeh said
that the Palestinians did not mean to harm the athletes taken
hostage. The Palestinians intended to take hostages and to use them
as leverage to obtain the release of Palestinians from Israeli
jails, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not issue orders to kill,'' Oudeh said in the phone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli athletes were shot dead at the start of the
operation. Oudeh said it was because they resisted during the
storming of their compound.
</P>
<P>
   The others died from shooting during the rescue operation. In
his book, Oudeh blamed German police for ``ambushing'' the
terrorists, opening fire on them and their hostages. He also
criticized Golda Meir, then Israeli prime minister, accusing her of
intransigence during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Oudeh said that the spirit of the peace
negotiations demanded that the past be buried.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone Sunday, he said that the Israelis allowed him,
along with other Palestinian exiles, to return to the West Bank in
1996 based on a decision that any previous act against Israel ``is
considered legally null.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would challenge the action against him in
Israeli court.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the decision was an embarrassment to the
Palestinian Authority, making it look like the Palestinian
leadership could not ``protect its members.'' But associates said
that he does not feel that Palestinian leaders were expressing
sufficient outrage Sunday.

FANS PACK DODGER STADIUM FOR RICKY MARTIN TURNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frenzied fans turned Dodger Stadium totally loco amid screams
and cheers as Latin heartthrob Ricky Martin hit the stage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a tight gray shirt and black slacks, Martin belted out
his chart-topping hit ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' on a podium above a
colorful flock of dancers and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Puerto Rican Elvis, Martin was a flurry of motion, every
step eliciting cheers and squeals from the mostly female crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personality really comes through,'' said restaurant worker
Nancy Solari, 23, of North Hollywood. ``His music is really
passionate, and he's a great performer. He's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7{-hour Wild Wild Wango Tango 2, produced by local Top 40
station KIIS-FM (102.7), was a celebration of today's multiethnic
pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the spectators _ teeny-boppers, 20-somethings,
even grandmothers _ were there for Martin, the swivel-hipped
singing sensation whose single of ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' (The
Crazy Life) recently went to No.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him,'' said Reseda resident Nancy Solari's sister
Susan, 26, who works in the TV industry. ``He's really cute, and he
can really dance. Ricky has this spark to him, and we've heard so
much about him. We're finally getting to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadium officials estimated that about 50,000 people attended
Saturday's show, which also included performances by Enrique
Iglesias, Blondie, 98 Degrees and M.C. Hammer. But Martin's
performance has been long-awaited by fans ever since his appearance
on the Grammy Awards in February.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 27-year-old pop superstar was a member of the teen
group Menudo and went on to star in ABC's hit soap ``General
Hospital'' and even appeared on Broadway in ``Les Miserables,'' it
was his performance at the Grammys that sparked interest among the
English-language audience.
</P>
<P>
   His self-titled English-language debut album is selling 300,000
copies a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to shake his hips, and he sings really good,
too,'' said Maria Gonzalez, 31, a South Bay executive assistant.
``But his hips are the best part.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Martin stopped traffic in New York's Rockefeller
Center when he performed for fans outside the studios of TV's
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so much better now than he was before,'' said Christina
Orozco, 16, a 10th-grader from Newhall. ``He's always been good,
and he's a good actor, too, but he's really grown.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a cheap day at the ball park. Vendors did a brisk
business selling six designs of T-shirts at $25 apiece, and ticket
prices ranged from $35 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   Postal employee Carlos Gonzalez, 32, of Laguna Niguel, said he
paid $600 to bring seven members of his family to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 8-year-old son and 7-year-old niece wanted to see Ricky,''
he said. ``But I'm here for Will Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd remained well-behaved and orderly through the
fast-paced show, and a broken water main that threatened the event
did nothing to dampen the spirits of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:30 p.m., all problems with the ruptured water main had been
resolved. Traffic flowed freely, and there were no incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Utility crews had worked frantically to restore water service to
Dodger Stadium after the 16-inch main ruptured just hours before
fans showed up for the sold-out concert.
</P>
<P>
   While the stadium's water supply was back by 1 p.m., the start
of the Wango Tango concert was delayed by 90 minutes to 3:30 p.m.
amid the chaos of traffic jams on surrounding freeways and surface
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But concertgoers such as 16-year-old Celeste Chavarin, who drove
in from Encino, said the postponement wasn't a big deal and that
only the show's cancellation would have been a problem for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good because we were already running late. But it would
have sucked if the concert was canceled because we would have
braved all that traffic for nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on many freeways, including the San Bernardino, Harbor
and Golden State freeways, was stop-and-go for hours before the
concert was scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Peterson, 26, who flew all the way from Salt Lake City,
Utah, to attend the concert, said traffic was more a pain than
anything else. Although it took her an hour and 15 minutes more
than she expected to get to Dodger Stadium, she, too, was glad the
show was only postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have cried because I flew out here yesterday from Utah
to see this concert. I would have been really, really disappointed
if the show was canceled. It would have been fierce,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 residents of a neighborhood near Chinatown remained
without water service into the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of people due to arrive at the stadium, the Los
Angeles Police Department took the precaution of issuing a tactical
alert at 1:30 p.m. to ensure there was no disturbance owing to a
delay or cancellation of the highly anticipated show.
</P>
<P>
   The tactical alert, which boosts the number of on-duty officers
by holding them after their regular shift is over, was lifted at
1:55 p.m., Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no problems whatsoever,'' said LAPD spokesman Officer
Don Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials also scrambled during the outage to draw up plans
on how to fight a fire under those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any pressure in most of the hydrants,'' said
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. ``We were
concerned that if there was a fire, we would have had to shuttle
water.''

DATA `BROKER' DEFENDS USING FALSE PRETEXTS TO GET PRIVATE
INFORMATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he entered the private investigation business
nearly 20 years ago, James J. Rapp opened a company to do
surveillance and other things that he did not want to talk about,
particularly because its name, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, aptly
described its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rapp, a 39-year-old investigator who used to promise on his
Web page that he could quickly get anyone's private telephone
records or bank account balances for as little as $100, is in the
middle of legislative, regulatory and criminal battles over how
much privacy millions of Americans should enjoy when they go to the
bank or make a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp has made a career of posing as the person whose records he
is trying to uncover, to trick banks, telephone companies and other
institutions into revealing confidential information sought by his
clients. The practice is known in the trade as pretexting, and it
has drawn a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission that names
Rapp, his wife, Regana, and their company, Touch Tone Information
Inc. A trial date has not been set, although Touch Tone has agreed
to honor a preliminary injunction barring the investigative
practices that are at issue in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is billed by both sides as a landmark case, and Rapp
is receiving significant support from a coalition of information
brokers and debt collectors who see the government's action as a
potential threat to their livelihood. But even some of his allies
are uneasy about using Rapp as the vehicle to avoid new and tougher
government privacy rules, because he has a criminal record and
served a four-year prison sentence for theft.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Rapp has also been discussed in Congress as
lawmakers in both the House and Senate, with the support of the
Clinton administration, are trying to make such investigative
techniques a federal crime and impose new civil liabilities on
practitioners of the art of deceiving banks. He is being
investigated by a grand jury in Colorado under a new state law that
makes it a crime to use deceptive practices to obtain private
information.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate lawsuit filed in 1996, he was alleged to have
helped a client, the International Beverage Corp., obtain telephone
records of a competitor, Saybrex International, from AT&AMP;T as part
of an effort by International Beverage to learn who Saybrex's
customers were. Saybrex, a family-run liquor exporter in Beverly
Hills, Calif., ultimately successfully sued the competitor _ though
not Rapp, who was not named as a defendant in the suit. Saybrex,
however, was unable to force AT&AMP;T to tighten its procedures for
handing out customer records.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent series of interviews, Rapp and his lawyers said
there was nothing inherently wrong with using trickery to get
confidential information, particularly since that information is
often not otherwise obtainable. They also said that Rapp had
cracked many cases in which deception was the only way to find
money for victims of crimes and neglect, like abandoned spouses and
children, and for plaintiffs in lawsuits who were unable to collect
judgments, and for insurance companies and banks that had been
defrauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that the government is sending in its case is that
if you're a deadbeat dad, you don't have to worry any more,'' Rapp
said. ``After all, how else are you going to get at this
information?''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp has his defenders, and is even cited as an exemplar by an
industry group of investigators and debt collectors who so far have
been moderately successful in watering down proposed legislation
and obtaining significant loopholes for certain kinds of cases,
such as tracking down assets for child support payments. The group,
the Coalition to Amend the Financial Information Privacy Act, is
paying for Rapp's legal defense in the FTC case _ and using him to
help raise money for its lobbying efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's members maintain that the practice of pretexting
is no different from what police officers or some journalists do
when they go undercover or assume false identities in the course of
doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the information brokers say that publicly available
data bases and computer services offer a variety of information
about people and their finances, including their Social Security
numbers, the prices they paid for their homes and any existing
liens. They note that other information, like bank deposits, can be
obtained when necessary through a court subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   But Rapp and his supporters say that information like bank and
telephone records is generally not publicly available, that it can
change quickly during the time it takes to get a judge's order, and
that the only way money can be recovered in many instances is by
duping a financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our clients are trying to do is even the odds,'' said
Stephen C. Leckar, a lawyer at the Washington firm Butera &AMP;
Andrews, which is representing both the coalition and Rapp. ``If
some people don't pay their bills, investigators like Rapp are just
leveling the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FTC sees it as privacy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch Tone's pretexting is a particularly pernicious invasion
of consumers' privacy _ using deception to gain access to
sensitive, private financial information,'' Robert Pitofsky, the
FTC's chairman, said. ``This case should send a strong message to
information brokers that the FTC will pursue firms that use false
pretenses at the expense of consumers' privacy and also create
opportunities for economic injury to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry is caught in the middle. On the one hand,
it has publicly denounced the deceptive techniques and called for
some new legislation, although it has also tried to make sure that
any new laws do not create new liabilities for the banks that might
be too quick about turning over confidential information. On the
other hand, many of the clients of investigators like Rapp have
been banks seeking to collect delinquent loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little question that some banks will hire information
brokers,'' said John Byrne, a senior counsel at the American
Bankers Association and an expert on privacy issues. ``We have
tried to emphasize that banks should ask questions about how they
are getting information and that there are legitimate means of
getting at the same stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Court papers in both the Saybrex and FTC lawsuits describe Rapp
and his employees as using fake telephone numbers and phony
corporations to deceive banks or telephone companies into turning
over confidential information.
</P>
<P>
   In the FTC case, transcripts of calls to banks that were
recorded as part of the government's surveillance revealed Touch
Tone employees pretending to be doddering customers in order to
obtain Social Security numbers and other information, like the
maiden name of an account holder's mother. In some cases, bank
representatives declined to help. But in others, they guided the
Touch Tone employee to the correct answer and even supplied
information like account balances.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Private investigators familiar with the deceptive practices of
information brokers say another common technique is the ``Trojan
check.'' The broker sets up a dummy corporation and sends a check
for a small amount of money to the target of the investigation
either as a supposed rebate or award. When the target deposits or
cashes the check, information about the target's bank account is
imprinted on the canceled check. The broker can then use that
information to approach the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation and legal fights come as Washington has become
captivated by privacy issues and the rights of consumers and the
businesses that hold their confidential records, from insurance
companies and hospitals to banks and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the House Commerce Committee inserted a variety
of consumer privacy protections into the latest version of
legislation to overhaul the nation's banking system. Those
proposals, which were endorsed by consumer groups and include a new
right to sue companies that violate their customers' privacy
rights, threatens to undermine broad industry support for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it is not clear whether the broadly worded existing
federal fraud laws would permit the criminal prosecution of a
person who deceives an institution to gain access to private
information, which is why Congress may act this year to make the
law more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On the Web pages and court papers of the coalition supporting
Rapp, he is portrayed as a victim of an overzealous federal agency,
an agency that if it prevails will make it more difficult for
abandoned wives and their children to find desperately needed
assets of their deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Rapp has become the industry's poster boy for what
the coalition has called a ``witch hunt'' by federal regulators, it
turns out that he has had his own more serious difficulties with
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp served four years in prison in the 1970s and  &UR; ' &LR; 80s in
Colorado for theft, which was a violation of his probation on an
earlier conviction for auto theft. State records in Denver show
that in 1992 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a peace officer. He
and his wife have had more than $38,000 in tax liens imposed by the
federal government for failing to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's using him as their symbol ``is like bankers
embracing Jesse James,'' said Marshall B. Grossman, a Los Angeles
lawyer who represents Saybrex.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a man who has made a career out of deception, it
can be difficult to sort through the substance of many of Rapp's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that the investigations and the poor
health of his parents had driven him out of business in recent
weeks, a business that he said had annual revenue of about $1
million for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was nothing wrong with employing deception to get
at private information and that his clients over the years had
included banks, tabloid newspapers and television programs. He
asserted that he had probably trained half of the nation's
information brokers, had solved ``over 100 cases a day'' and that
he worked for private investigators hired to get information for
news organizations about the families of the victims of the
Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had done work for agents at two field offices of
the FBI, but he refused to provide any references or say anything
more about the work.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his assertions could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   He also asserted that he had received an ``associate's degree''
in criminal justice from Metropolitan State College in Denver. But
Carrie Schafer, the communications director for the college, said
school records showed that Rapp had attended the school but did not
complete enough courses to earn a degree.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And while Rapp has had no qualms about using trickery to obtain
confidential information on behalf of his clients, he so values his
own privacy that he was hesitant to be photographed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live way out in the county and no mail comes here,'' he
said. ``Everything is quiet. That's the way I like it. Nice and
quiet and easy.''

NORTH KOREA AGREES TO TALKS ABOUT YELLOW SEA CONFRONTATIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea agreed Sunday to talk to U.N. military
officers in an effort to resolve the ongoing confrontation between
the South Korean and North Korean navies in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for the sixth day in a row, North Korean military
vessels intruded into the waters south of the effective demarcation
line separating the seas of the two countries. The North does not
recognize the line, but in recent years it has never challenged it
so aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean patrol boats rammed North Korean vessels on Friday,
trying to drive them north and leading to a sharp escalation of
tensions. That was when the U.N. Command, which is led by American
officers and includes 37,000 American troops stationed in South
Korea, called on North Korea to discuss the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Carl J. Kropf, a spokesman for the U.N. Command, said that
North Korea had agreed Sunday to meet, perhaps as early as Tuesday.
The meetings will be held with generals from each side, the
highest-level discussions normally held, and will take place in the
border village of Panmunjon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North's message is viewed as a positive step by the U.N.
Command,'' Kropf said in a statement. ``It remains in everyone's
interests to reduce tensions at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea seems to have stopped ramming the North Korean
boats, at least for the time being, but it has dispatched warships
to the area and put its army on alert.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides have been careful so far to avoid direct
exchanges of fire, tensions are so high that officials are
concerned that an accident or low-level officer's decision could
set off a battle that would have far-reaching consequences for one
of the last remaining frontiers of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   After its boats were rammed, North Korea threatened to carry out
``self-defensive strikes'' against the South Koreans, whom it
accused of intruding into its waters. But North Korean declarations
are always so bellicose and extreme that it was difficult to
determine if this declaration was anything more serious than
run-of-the-mill threats and bluffs.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, America's sweepstakes companies, like American Family
Publishers and Publishers Clearing House, have filled mailboxes
with letters promising consumers millions of dollars and selling
magazine subscriptions. For years, the magazine industry has
flourished with the help of those grand, empty promises, depending
on them in the first half of the 1990s to generate a third of its
new subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the stampsheet houses, as the sweepstakes companies are
called, are under a cloud of bad publicity and government scrutiny,
first set in motion by an investigation into their practices
introduced by 32 states early in 1998. As a result, the
ever-growing lack of consumer trust and the poor performance by
sweepstakes companies are threatening to drive the magazine
industry into what some publishers are calling its own recession.
</P>
<P>
   Because Americans are responding with less enthusiasm, the
sweepstakes houses have delivered far fewer subscriptions to the
magazine publishers they tout. The good news is that magazine
publishers are finding new ways to attract subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, E. Daniel Capell, a magazine circulation analyst,
will publish a report in his newsletter, Capell's Circulation
Report, that shows for the first time the sharp downturn in
subscription rates for magazines that sell subscriptions through
the two main sweepstakes houses, American Family Publishers,
jointly owned by a unit of Time Warner's Time Inc. and an
investment group associated with the Pritzker family of Chicago,
and Publishers Clearing House, a limited partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Capell announced his survey of the circulation directors of 136
consumer magazines last week at a meeting of those executives
sponsored in part by the Magazine Publishers of America, and the
results are already sending a chill through the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The stampsheet houses typically rely on their year-end mailings
to generate the bulk of their annual responses. Capell's survey
found that subscription response rates, from the 1997-98 year-end
mailings to the 1998-99 year-end mailings, are down an average of
37.4 percent for magazines sold through American Family Publishers;
for magazines carried by Publishers Clearing House, subscription
rates are down 29.2 percent. For many magazines, these figures
represent a huge downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see serious subscription problems for
large-circulation titles that rely heavily on the stampsheets,''
Capell said. ``The women's services magazines will take the biggest
hit: Family Circle, Woman's Day, Redbook, and Ladies' Home Journal.
The newsweeklies are the next tier.''
</P>
<P>
   Capell's report comes after American Family Publishers agreed
last month to make extensive changes in its practices and settled a
civil charge filed by four states charging that it had deceived
consumers. On Friday, however, a federal judge in North Carolina
found American Family in contempt for violating a 1993 settlement
in which the company agreed to tone down its contest promotions
there.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. Senators received nervous executives from the
sweepstakes and magazine industries who were lobbying for
last-minute changes to a bill, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and
Enforcement Act, that the Senate is expected to pass before the
July 4 recess. The bill would limit the kind of solicitations that
have so beguiled consumers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Industry response to the subscription downturn is uniformly
dour. Lindsay Valk, the director of circulation marketing for
Hearst Magazines, publisher of Redbook and Esquire, two magazines
that are heavily reliant on the stampsheets, said that some Hearst
titles ``have seen a big hit to their volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory B. Zorthian, the vice president of business development
at Forbes magazine, which sells subscriptions through both American
Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House, refers to the
sweep decline as ``a circulation recession.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got people scared,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Woods, the circulation director for Prevention magazine,
which is published by Rodale, said he had expected to generate at
least 100,000 subscriptions from the stampsheets for the year-end
mailings, but got less than half that number.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Block, a founder of American Family Publishers and a former
consultant to Publishers Clearing House, estimates that for some
magazines, the subscription rate will be off by as much as 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Reader's Digest Association founded the first magazine
sweepstakes in 1962. Business boomed in the 1980's and early
1990's, then slowed a bit, partly because of consumer fatigue,
before dropping precipitously last year.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch is simple: consumers get letters exhorting them to
enter a sweepstakes. Accompanying the letters is an offer of
cut-rate magazine subscriptions. In the past, many consumers
subscribed, either because they thought it would increase their
chances of winning, or to take advantage of an inexpensive magazine
offer. Under the bill before the Senate, the sweepstakes mailing
would have to display a statement that no purchase of a
subscription is necessary to win a prize.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Holland, a senior vice president at Publishers Clearing
House, would not confirm the percentage drop in subscription rates,
but conceded that they were down.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Caughman, the chairman of American Family Enterprises,
said that ``the mass-market titles sell best with the stampsheets,
so they are therefore more vulnerable in the downturns, without
question. They are more reliant on the stampsheets. If you're `Fly
Fishing on the Housatonic,' this is not going to affect you.'' She
would not confirm the percentage of decline but said, ``We're not
down to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Both executives defended the seductive nature of their company's
mailings. Ms. Holland said: ``The whole purpose of the sweepstakes
is merely to call attention to the offers inside. After all, we do
guarantee the lowest magazine prices.''
</P>
<P>
   With subscription rates dropping, Capell predicts that in 2000
many magazines will have to lower their rate bases, the circulation
levels that magazines guarantee to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pashby, executive vice president of the Magazine
Publishers of American, said: ``I assume that would be a logical
progression from what has happened. However, I think that
publishers have been quick to go out and look for new ways of
reaching the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods of Prevention said that the magazine's circulation staff
is studying other ways to get subscriptions. The Internet, he said,
shows some hope; he said that Prevention now picks up 5,000
subscriptions a month from Women.com, a Web site with which it is
affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers are relying increasingly on new kinds of
marketers, like News Subscription Services, a company in Greenwich,
Conn., that provides, for example, a method by which consumers are
offered magazine subscriptions when they order from a catalog.
Consumers who order from Lands' End, for example, may get a
solicitation for a cut-rate subscription to Martha Stewart Living.
</P>
<P>
   The sweepstakes companies, which can keep up to 90 percent in
commissions on the subscriptions, are also trying to reverse their
losses.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Publishers started an advertising campaign last
week that shows the happy, smiling, winners of prizes that start at
$1,000. ``We're focusing on showing consumers that 19,000 consumers
will win prizes from AFP in 1999,'' Ms. Caughman said. She added:
``I believe consumers love us.''

`CLARA BOW': ONE WHO HAD `IT' IN THE AGE OF THE FLAPPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clara Bow's stardom lasted for only about a decade, through the
1920s and into the '30s, but that added up to 58 movies and an
astounding popularity that bears comparison with Jean Harlow and
Marilyn Monroe. Her winning ways are brought back in ``Clara Bow:
Discovering the `It' Girl,'' Monday's Turner Classic Movies
biography.
</P>
<P>
   Although the writers of this affectionate documentary evidently
read too many fan magazines at an impressionable age, and Courtney
Love's narration is sloppily delivered, the story is worth telling,
both for what it reveals about the exploitation of vulnerable
performers by Hollywood studios and for the details of a sad life
that belied a devil-may-care image.
</P>
<P>
   Afflicted with a mentally unstable mother and a father who seems
to have taken an interest in her only when it served his needs
(including, it is suggested here, his sexual urges), she was
rescued by the camera.
</P>
<P>
   As Monday's clips from several of her hits attest, she had
personality to spare, and her boss at Paramount, B.P. Schulberg,
worked her hard, renting her out to other studios for more than he
paid her; in 1924-25 alone, she made 25 movies, some of which have
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   She became the era's most famous flapper, a symbol of sexual
freedom, both on screen and off, and had affairs with, among
others, the silent-film star Gilbert Roland, the director Victor
Fleming, the young leading man Gary Cooper, and Bela Lugosi, a k a
Dracula. Gossips credited her with taking on the whole USC football
team.
</P>
<P>
   Elinor Glyn, the novelist who invented ``it'' and made a
lucrative deal with Clara Bow at the height of her fame, defined
the word as ``that strange magnetism which attracts both sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bow's bad times began with the coming of sound; this star from
New York understandably saw the microphone as an enemy. At the age
of 25 she was a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief comeback, she retired with her husband, Rex Bell,
to a Nevada ranch. There was an attempted suicide, a spell in a
mental hospital and years of loneliness. Perhaps the most touching
moment in the documentary is hearing the actress who had so much
trouble with her diction practicing Elizabethan poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Following the documentary, TCM presents three of the best-known
Bow movies: ``It,'' ``The Wild Party'' and ``Down to the Sea in
Ships.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Hair testing to detect illicit drug use, a
procedure already popular with at least 1,000 employers in the
United States, is now being adopted by some schools, opening a new
chapter in the continuing debate over the best way to keep
adolescents from experimenting with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   De la Salle High School here, which is affiliated with the
Brothers of the Christian Schools, a Roman Catholic order, began
testing the hair of its 870 students in March 1998 in a pilot
program sponsored by Psychemedics Corp., the leading hair-testing
company. Five other Catholic schools in the New Orleans region have
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motivation is to provide a good place for kids to learn
and develop,'' said Yvonne Gelpi, De la Salle's president, ``and if
you keep that in focus, it enables you do do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents seem relieved that the school has assumed some of the
burden of keeping their children off drugs. And hair testing deters
drug use, some teachers say, by giving teen-agers an excuse to
resist peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' said Joseph Hines, De la Salle's dean of
students. `` `My school drug-tests me; I can't do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the federal government, which has set strict standards for
urine testing, has not done so for hair tests because it has yet to
be convinced of their accuracy. And the American Civil Liberties
Union opposes random testing, whether or not someone is suspected
of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always concerned about testing people who haven't done
anything wrong,'' said Lewis Maltby, director of the employment
rights office of the ACLU. Hair testing, Maltby said, ``is growing
fast and that's what alarms us. The problem is easy to state: It
doesn't work. It's not reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Private schools can make drug tests a condition of enrollment
without inviting lawsuits. But now two public high school
principals in New Orleans want to test their students, too, raising
the prospect of a legal battle with national ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an invasion of privacy,'' said Joe Cook, executive
director of the ACLU of Louisiana. ``What somebody's done over the
last 90 days without harming anyone is nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Connick, the district attorney of Orleans Parish, which
includes New Orleans, argues that hair testing at school is
constitutional because it meets the criteria for protecting health
and safety concerns stemming from drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with taking a piece of hair from your head?''
Connick asked.
</P>
<P>
   As he pointed out, drug tests of school athletes in Oregon and
of students engaged in extracurricular activities in Indiana and
Arkansas have been upheld in court.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kubacki Jr., president of Psychemedics, which is based
in Cambridge, Mass., said 80 schools, mostly private, in 26 states
were using Psychemedics to test their students for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hair testing is based on the premise that drugs ingested in the
body travel through the bloodstream and are deposited in hair
follicles roughly in proportion to the amount taken. Traces remain
in the hair, disclosing how long the drugs have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as rings of a tree,'' Kubacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Since hair grows at the rate of a half-inch a month, the test
uses the inch and a half closest to the scalp to detect drug use
for the last 90 days. A hair sample the diameter of a shoelace tip
is clipped and sent to a laboratory, which liquefies the follicles
to measure the presence of five drugs: marijuana, heroin, cocaine,
amphetamine and phencyclidine, or PCP.
</P>
<P>
   Government researchers have raised questions about whether drug
molecules bind more to coarser black hair than to finer blond or
brownish hair, creating racial or gender disparities, and whether
passive exposure to marijuana or other smoked drugs could produce a
false positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of detecting it in hair but in interpreting
what you find,'' said Michael Welch, a research chemist for the
National Institute of Standards and Technology. ``Experienced labs
generally do a pretty good job of identifying what's in hair.''
</P>
<P>
   But Welch added: ``It's potentially possible that people could
have detectable levels in their hair without ever using the drug. I
think it's going to take more research before these problems are
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubacki said Psychemedics used a patented method that
distinguished between external contamination and ingestion by
thoroughly washing the hair sample beforehand and identifying not
just the drug but also its metabolite, a substance produced by the
body's metabolism. Before the test, the process also extracts the
melanin, which gives hair its color, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mieczkowski, a professor of criminology at the University of
South Florida who specializes in the technology of drug testing,
said hair testing was as accurate as urinalysis. Because bodily
fluids like urine are excreted swiftly, Mieczkowski said, ``hair
testing is almost the only thing we have'' to gauge longer-term
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Hair testing is used by courts, police forces and other
law-enforcement agencies. Connick, the district attorney, said his
office had been using the tests ``with excellent results'' to
evaluate drug offenders for diversion into treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great method of detecting a history of drug use,'' he
said. ``The larger time frame allows you to find out what the
defendant has been using.''
</P>
<P>
   But his office supplements hair testing with urinalysis to learn
whether offenders have used drugs in the last day or so.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Mumm, the diversionary-program director, said, ``That
tells us they probably won't stop on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Psychemedics offered a year's free hair testing for two
schools in New Orleans, De la Salle High School accepted, followed
by St. Augustine High School. De la Salle sends more than 90
percent of its students to college. But it had enough of a problem
that teen-agers jokingly called the school ``De la Drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The reputation was unwarranted, Ms. Gelpi said, but she assumed
that some youngsters were trying drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's nationwide, it's in our city,'' said Ms. Gelpi, who
functions as chief executive officer of the school. ``If it's in
our city, it's in our schools. We've got to take some big steps to
get away from drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Salle's principal, Brother Jeffrey Callaghan, told a
packed meeting of parents in December 1997 that the school wanted
to start testing their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only standing ovation I've ever received at a
parents' meeting,'' Callaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas vacation that year, he warned the students that
hair testing would start the following March, giving them three
months to stop any drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Janes, a junior at the time, said, ``Girls really flipped
out, because they thought they were going to have their hair cut.''
Panic subsided once they learned that the hair taken would be
cosmetically inconspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and dad thought it was great,'' said Ms. Janes, 18.
``They didn't have a problem with privacy, and it was one less
thing they had to worry about because the school was doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate Christian Moises, 17, wore his hair cropped so
short that Hines, the dean of students, had to apply scissors to
the young man's leg to collect enough body hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that big a deal,'' Christian said. ``I have nothing
to hide, so it doesn't bother me one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian's mother, Jennifer Moises, said she had mixed feelings
at first because of the privacy issue. ``I felt confident that my
son would pass it,'' Mrs. Moises said, ``but I also felt sorry for
the parents whose children failed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   But most parents, she said, ``thought it was a very good idea
and couldn't understand why it hadn't been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   With three months' notice, only 28 of De la Salle's 870 students
tested positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd asked me what it would have been,'' Ms. Gelpi said,
``I'd have said much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual results were released only to parents of students who
tested positive, and the students were quietly referred for drug
counseling. When the students who failed were retested several
months later, only three, all white females, failed. This year, 12
students tested positive. Three others transferred to different
schools rather than be tested.
</P>
<P>
   Students are now tested at least once a year, at an annual,
per-student cost of about $55, which has been added to De la
Salle's tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What parent wouldn't pay $55 to know that their child is
drug-free?'' Ms. Gelpi asked.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vincent Nzinga, the principal of Frederick Douglass High
School, a public school whose 1,300 students are overwhelmingly
black and often poor, wants them tested, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of them want to go somewhere, they want to
be somebody,'' Nzinga said. ``I want to give them all the
advantages I can.''
</P>
<P>
   He has petitioned the Orleans Parish School Board to permit drug
testing, and the board will decide this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe we need to sweep any problem under the rug,''
Nzinga said. ``If there's a problem, what people want to know is
that we're doing something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcee Fortier High School, another public school in New Orleans,
also wants hair testing for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU will challenge drug testing in New Orleans public
schools as a violation of protections against unreasonable search
and seizure and invasion of privacy in both the U.S. Constitution
and the Louisiana constitution, said Cook, the ACLU executive
director in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But Connick, the district attorney, said that if parents
approved, hair testing should be extended to every public school in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have enough problems educating students,'' he said, ``but
the problem is magnified because of drugs.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Areas of dense fog with spotty showers and drizzle will prevail
early Monday from the Middle Atlantic States to southern New
England especially near the coast. The low clouds and fog will
gradually lift to allow for periods of hazy sunshine in many areas
as increasing breezes mix drier air from aloft toward the ground.
Damp conditions will linger longest near the east coast of New
England as a weak low-pressure area drifts slowly south of Cape
Cod.

   A band of clouds and thundershowers will accompany a front as it
moves from the eastern parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley
early Monday to the interior Northeast on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A few strong thunderstorms will occur to the west of the crest
of the Appalachians, especially where some hazy sunshine adds fuel
to the sultry air mass. In the wake of the front, cooler and less
humid air will spread from the northern Mississippi Valley toward
the Great Lakes states.
</P>
<P>
   Warm and muggy weather will persist over the Southeast. A cold
front moving east will promote a broken band of strong
thunderstorms near the southern Mississippi and western Tennessee
valleys. Farther east, scattered thundershowers will be common in
the humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and some strong thunderstorms will move from the
northern Rockies toward the central Plains as low pressure moves
along a front separating hot air over the interior West from much
cooler air to the east. Most of the western states will have
abundant sunshine, but some isolated mountains thunder will occur
in the heat of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Alaskan Heat
</P>
<P>
   The weekend weather in central and eastern interior Alaska bore
a strong resemblance to typical spring conditions in the deserts of
the Southwest. Temperatures surged into the upper 80s and low 90s
as the circulation around a strong ridge of high pressure over the
Yukon Territory resulted in steady winds from the south at high
levels. Over 21 hours of sunshine contributed to the uncommon
warmth. The heat was accompanied by desertlike humidity which fell
below 20 percent in many locations. The heat will abate by midweek
as a cool front arrives from the western part of the state.

 &HT;    Surging populations in South sap water from its cities
 &HT;    ATTN: North Carolina, South Carolina editors
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Record highs have touched 100 degrees in recent days
in Cary, N.C. Substantial rain hasn't fallen for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, computer programmer Robert Bonham doesn't worry about
running out of water. His grass might turn brown, but that's more a
nuisance than a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that I pay for water like I pay for cable.
I expect it to work,'' Bonham said. ``I won't think about it unless
we get to a point where there's so much growth the city can't
deliver it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost reached that point in Cary and other fast-growing
areas of the Deep South _ not just because of an early season
drought but also because of a decade of intense growth and
development. Booming counties and towns haven't built treatment
plants or laid pipes fast enough to keep up with surging Southern
populations.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1998, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia
ranked in the Top 10 for people moving within their boundaries.
During that same period, the Top 10 fastest-growing counties in the
country included five from the Deep South _ four in Georgia and one
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a planning perspective, water is an absolute necessity,''
said Michael Vasu, a professor of public administration and
political science at North Carolina State University. ``There are
some parts of the infrastructure that you can let deteriorate to
some extent, like roads. But when there's a lack of water, you need
an immediate solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a smattering of weekend rain, communities throughout the
South are restricting outdoor water use. Drought conditions exist
from south Alabama to northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the mercury hit the century mark in Cary, the town
council stopped accepting building applications so the community on
the edge of Research Triangle Park could figure out where to get
more water. Since 1988, Cary's population has more than doubled to
nearly 90,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Politics designed to curb growth delayed construction of a new
water treatment plant, which may not be operating till 2003 or
later. The city currently buys 40 percent of its water supply from
Raleigh and Durham.
</P>
<P>
   A recent heat wave that pushed temperatures at the
Raleigh-Durham airport to 100 degrees for the first time in four
years has prevented municipal neighbors from sharing with Cary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the ability to share our water
resources is a factor in future development, whether it's
residential or business,'' Vasu said. ``South Carolina is starting
to feel some of that but certainly North Carolina and Georgia are
at the forefront of all that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, S.C., where growth has been modest but steady,
Richland County Land Development Administrator Ken Knudsen has
absorbed water woes like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My water pressure is low, but whose isn't?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, less than 10 inches of rain has fallen in
Columbia _ 6 inches less than the average for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Selling water is an industry for Columbia. It buys water from an
area electric utility then resells it to other governments. In
1998, Columbia earned more than $50 million in revenue from water
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is about to get more expensive. The utility claims
water diverted from its hydroelectric plants are undervalued and it
may increase its charges to Columbia and others by as much as 10
times current cost.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, severe or extreme drought conditions grip most of
the state. Several metro Atlanta areas already have imposed outdoor
watering restrictions _ including suburban boom counties like Henry
and Cherokee. Fescue lawns will go unwatered. Chevy pickups will go
unwashed. The reason: Demand exceeds delivery capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the issue,'' said Pat Stevens, chief of environmental
planning for the Atlanta Regional Commission. ``I've been around
for 20 years and that's the issue. When you have that kind of
growth, the infrastructure doesn't keep up. There are restrictions
in Henry County but not in the city of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot, dry summer has put its traditional victim on the front
burner: the Southern farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Drought threatens to wipe out half the South Carolina corn crop.
In Virginia, farmers won't plant soybeans till rain falls because
the seeds won't sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Burley tobacco farmers in Kentucky welcomed the dry start to the
season that helps plants establish sturdy root systems. But if
plentiful rains don't fall soon, the tobacco will be stunted,
producing less leaves and profit.
</P>
<P>
   In south Alabama, ranchers are sending cattle to market early
because there's barely grass to graze in dry, dusty pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Southern homeowners and farmers might be passed by one weather
extreme only to get hit by another, one meteorologist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but right now, if we want to make a real
dent in it,'' said Keith Lynch of the National Weather Service in
Wakefield, Va., ``we're going to need a tropical storm.''

SERB EXODUS IS SMALLER MIRROR IMAGE OF ALBANIANS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ An enormous column of Serbian civilians
followed their army and police out of western Kosovo Sunday, moving
slowly on the narrow roads past an enormous column of Italian
troops and armor moving the other way, toward Pec and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeeping troops are finally spreading through Kosovo,
but not nearly fast enough to stop the panicked flight of Serbs
living near the Albanian border in the part of Kosovo known as
Metohija, which means ``the land of churches,'' where the Serbian
Orthodox Church has its holiest sites.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, NATO is failing at its stated intention of creating a
climate of security in Kosovo where all the inhabitants of this
ravaged land can return to their homes and live peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Serb families were crammed into cars and tractors and anything
that moved, piling their belongings on the roofs, sometimes wrapped
in plastic to keep off the rain. Tractors pulled trailers filled
with more people, some of the poorest Serbs of Kosovo, who said
that the armed insurgents of the Kosovo Liberation Army were moving
back into western Kosovo towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine now for the Albanians,'' said one man named Bojan
from Djakovica, whose car was stuffed with his extended family.
``It's not safe for Serbs anymore. The KLA is in the town.'' Where
will he go? ``I don't know,'' he said. ``How can I know?''
</P>
<P>
   One little white Yugo car broke down on a hill, steam exploding
from the hood. Three panicked Serbs grabbed suitcases and boxes and
toys from the car to throw them into a trailer ahead of them in
line, fearing that the convoy would move off without them. Left
behind in the back window, as they pushed the car off the road, was
a doll with blond hair. One old man gave the three-fingered Serb
salute, normally a gesture of defiance, but a golden cross was
draped through his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cars had license plates from Prizren, Pec and
Djakovica. On the road were fresh piles of clothing that had fallen
off Serb tractors, like the filthy, rotting clothes that still line
some roads as a memory of the Albanian exodus.
</P>
<P>
   As the Serbs retreated east, they passed thousands of young
Albanians who never left Kosovo, who lined the road and shouted,
``NATO! NATO!'' and ``Thank you!'' at any passing military vehicle.
One little boy had ``NATO'' written on his forehead. Another
carried a banner with the insignia of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians clapped and threw flowers on NATO's tanks and
armored personnel carriers, as the Serbs, with more desperation
than hope, had thrown flowers on the Russian tanks that moved
through Pristina to occupy its airport very early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb exodus is a smaller mirror image of the exodus of
nearly 1 million of Kosovo's Albanians, giving an oddly biblical
feel to what remains a passionate and vengeful conflict over land.
Many of the Albanians were forced to leave Kosovo, and some unknown
number were killed for resisting, or for being deemed supporters or
members of the KLA. Others were driven from their homes in the
villages and fled to the hills, living rough for the three months
of this war.
</P>
<P>
   By sharp contrast, of course, no one is pushing out the Serbs,
who are fleeing from fear. Some Serbs surely bear guilt for the
ravaging of their Albanian neighbors and the burning of their homes
and businesses. Some Gypsies who helped the Serbs are also fleeing,
as are some Turks from Prizren, this elegant 14-century Turkish
town, who also helped Serb officials and security officers roust
out Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not at all clear that any of those now fleeing will
come back, although some 5,000 or so are being put up at least
temporarily in and around Pristina, especially in student housing
around the university, which remains shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the Germans fleeing Eastern Europe after World
War II,'' said a senior NATO-country diplomat who has been working
with humanitarian agencies. ``What happened to the Germans there
from 1945-47 was the greatest movement of people since the end of
the war, not Kosovo. Millions of Germans, perhaps 40 million, fled
and no one had any sympathy, because they were guilty. It's a
little bit like that now.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sorry for the Serbs and for ``the likelihood of an
ethnically clean Kosovo,'' he said. ``NATO was supposed to
synchronize its movements with the withdrawal of the Serbs, to
prevent this vacuum, and it didn't happen. While every Albanian
knew they would come home one day, these Serbs know they'll never
come back. I don't question that in one way, but it adds to the
wave of sorrow and misery here.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian responses are relief, happiness and some glee. In
Prizren Sunday, the main square was full of Albanians of all ages
who had never left, but hidden in their apartments for nearly three
months, sending women and old men out to try to buy bread.
</P>
<P>
   They sang and cheered and gave flowers to the nonplussed young
German soldiers of NATO's force. One young German, riding behind a
machine gun on his jeep, had flowers strewn at his feet and tears
pouring from his eyes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the Germans arrived in Prizren about midnight, many
Albanians greeted them in their pajamas and bathrobes, said Haki
Bojniku, a 20-year-old economics student. ``You cannot write down
the way I feel now,'' he said, beginning himself to cry. ``I feel
free now, like a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bina, a 23-year-old Albanian, said life in the town had felt
very dangerous with Serb aggression and NATO bombs. ``I live in the
middle of town and the Serbs didn't touch us,'' she said. ``But we
heard what they did in the villages. And here they stole everything
they could find, and they always asked for money. We waited hours
in lines for bread and oil, and sometimes they said, `It is only
for Serbs.' They said, `NATO will give you bread. You wanted NATO,
ask them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And now that NATO is in Prizren? ``When I saw them, I finally
felt I could breathe the air,'' Bina said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abdullah, 34, said he survived by helping push a
neighbor in a wheelchair. ``They wouldn't touch someone like
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shpend Kume, 18, said he and his family also remained at home,
hidden away. ``They wanted the young men like me,'' he said. ``We
heard that they took the young men. We sent my grandmother out for
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he felt when he saw the Serbs fleeing, he said
simply: ``I'm happy. The Serbs are finished here. They shot and
they robbed and set houses on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the innocent Serbs, and the children? ``Of course
children are children,'' said Valton, 23, breaking in. ``And their
mothers are maybe innocent, too. But their fathers did everything
here, and they should go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As high-technology business strategies go, it was a classic,
perfectly executed: find a technological ``discontinuity,'' race a
new product to market and dislodge an entrenched competitor.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Greg Galanos, the founder of the tiny
software company Metrowerks Inc., did in 1991. Realizing that Apple
Computer and Motorola Corp. were allying with IBM to shift to a new
microprocessor chip called the Power PC (the discontinuity), he
quickly developed a type of software tool known as a compiler (the
new product) for use by programmers writing software for Apple
Macintosh Power PC computers.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, Galanos found that his Code Warrior
compiler software had a 95 percent share of the market for Apple
Macintosh programming tools. The dislodged competitor in this case
was the larger, less nimble Symantec Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately there was just one flaw in the strategy:
Metrowerks had seized the commanding lead of a shrinking market.
The grand alliance that Apple and IBM envisioned never jelled, and
Apple's share of the personal-computer market began to collapse
from a peak of about 13 percent to around 3 percent, where it
bottomed out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' compiler software continued to play a crucial role,
enabling programmers who designed applications for the Macintosh to
convert their instructions to machine language. Trouble was, fewer
programmers were interested in creating new Macintosh applications.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Galanos scanned the horizon for the next big
technological discontinuity. And the 41-year-old Metrowerks
president may have found it: the increasing fragmentation of
computing from its desktop-PC foundation to a new, pebbly terrain
of digital consumer-electronics devices that include video-game
machines and ``smart'' voice and data cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with three years ago, when Metrowerks was developing
software entirely for the Macintosh, 60 percent of the company's
projected $30 million in revenue this year will come from sales for
software tools used to program the processor chips that are at the
heart of the consumer electronics market.
</P>
<P>
   This coming post-PC era, as it has been called, does not play to
the strengths of the software giant Microsoft, which currently
leads the esoteric but crucial market for software tools _ the
programs that programmers themselves use when creating software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, with more than $200 million in annual tool sales, is
the leader in this field because it sells the primary tools used in
making programs for the industry-dominating Microsoft Windows PC
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the post-PC shift toward computerized consumer electronics
products _ which employ many different operating systems and so
require many different kinds of programming tools _ is creating a
new opportunity for a raft of smaller software tool makers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Metrowerks, the noteworthies include Cygnus, Greenhills
Software, Imprise, Integrated Systems and Wind River Systems. But
none of these other companies offer the range of products across
different chip families that Metrowerks does.
</P>
<P>
   And Metrowerks has distinguished itself by making significant
inroads in the market for hand-held computing and wireless devices.
The company is the leading software tools vendor for the popular
Palm Pilot organizer. And Metrowerks recently struck a deal with
Motorola to provide software tools for Motorola's new Mcore
microprocessor family of chips for digital cellular phones and
similar computerized communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' biggest coup, though, has come in the video-game
field. All three of the major game makers _ Nintendo, Sega and Sony
_ have announced that their next generation of game machines
scheduled for release later this year will use chips and operating
systems that rely on Metrowerks software development tools.
</P>
<P>
   Having a single software development environment is something
that is highly prized by video-game developers, who must gamble on
which system will be most popular and then be prepared to quickly
rewrite, or ``port,'' their programs to a competitor's gaming
system.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it also means that any developer creating games
for these new machines will have to use Metrowerks tool kits. It is
perhaps the most valuable validation yet for the strategy that
Galanos and Metrowerks are now pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of creating developer communities around
post-PC devices,'' Galanos said in his office in Cupertino, Calif.
``The games business is defining the software industry today.''
</P>
<P>
   Metrowerks' strategy is a concept akin to Microsoft's practice
of offering outside programmers the company's applications
programming interfaces, or APIs _ computer-code pathways into and
out of the operating system to which programmers connect their
software.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying this idea to consumer electronics, Metrowerks is now
finishing work on a tool kit _ called Powerparts _ that is supposed
to make it simple to adapt programs for one type of device for use
on another device, as well as offering programmers a library for
quickly creating visual control panels for consumer devices. A
scheduling program created for a hand-held electronic organizer,
for instance, might be easily translated to a version used on a
smart cell phone with a screen.
</P>
<P>
   With Metrowerks having established its bona fides in the
Macintosh tools market, and now gathering steam in the post-PC
market, Galanos is finding enthusiastic supporters from many parts
of the computer industry _ particularly among executives who like
nothing better than to see upstarts flying successfully beneath
Microsoft's radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's managed to build a software developer business in spite
of all the Microsoft positioning,'' said Eric Schmidt, chairman and
chief executive of Novell Corp., a leading network software company
and Microsoft competitor. ``And he's done it with good products in
a difficult market.''
</P>
<P>
   Although compilers are remarkably complex programs that are
largely invisible to typical computer users, they play a crucial
role in the computing world. The quality of a compiler can
determine how quickly programs run, how easy is it to write
programs and whether those programs are more or less error free.
</P>
<P>
   And a fast compiler can sharply improve a programmer's
efficiency _ no small consideration, since complex programs might
contain millions of lines of programming instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you impact the efficiency of software development, then you
impact time to market,'' Galanos said. ``And time to market is
everything today.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the company's forward momentum has not carried
over to its balance sheet or stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Although revenues have followed an upward trend, Metrowerks,
which ends its financial year in July, has eked out profits in only
four financial quarters since the beginning of fiscal 1996. And any
gains have been more than offset by the losses during that stretch,
as the company has invested heavily in its new strategy. Investors,
meanwhile, have shown little appetite for Metrowerks' shares, which
were trading above $9 in early 1998, but closed last Friday at $3.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The market hasn't been good for small and micro-cap stocks,''
said David Kaminer, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities in
Montreal. ``But now their strategy is paying off in market
positioning,'' he said of Metrowerks, ``and I expect profitability
to return soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many other software wunderkinds like Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs, who embraced computers as teen-agers, Galanos came
relatively late to this line of work. At age 17, after dropping out
of high school, Galanos left his native Australia in 1974, and for
the next two years traveled by foot, bus and car in Asia and
Europe. His adventures included encountering unfriendly Khmer Rouge
soldiers in Laos in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Vientiane, and American tourists were the targets for
roaming soldiers,'' he recalled. To ease his discreet withdrawal
from Laos, he said, ``I quickly added an Australian flag to my
backpack and threw greenbacks at the soldiers at all the
roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, his wandering took him to Montreal, where he settled
in 1976 and became a self-taught programmer working for the
electric utility Hydro-Quebec. While there, he became manager of
the environment department, where despite a a ban on the use of
non-IBM personal computers he orchestrated the covert rental of
Macintosh computers by the department's scientists.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the accountants discovered his ploy in early 1985,
the group had one of the largest Macintosh networks then in
existence _ some 60 of the machines.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the age of 28 that Galanos started college,
studying computer science at the University of Quebec, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   He became intrigued with the work of Nicholaus Wirth, a Swiss
computer scientist who invented the Pascal and Modula programming
languages, and after graduating, Galanos founded Metropolis
Computer Networks in 1986 as a company that sold a Modula compiler
to colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The modest success of that business attracted the interest of a
French venture capitalist, Jean Belanger, who supplied $100,000 of
financing in 1989 that helped Galanos found Metrowerks as a more
broadly based tools provider _ a relationship that eventually
resulted in Belanger's becoming chief executive three years ago,
freeing Galanos, still president, to also become chief technology
officer.
</P>
<P>
   As the Macintosh tool kit started taking off, Galanos took the
company public in 1994 and subsequently moved Metrowerks to Austin,
Texas, to be closer to the locus of Power PC chip development and
to take advantage of the engineering labor pool in that emerging
technopolis.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later he set up an office for himself and a small
group of the company's best programmers in Cupertino, in Silicon
Valley, to be close to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Galanos acknowledges that the software tools market is a
difficult one. But he says he is confident that Metrowerks will
return to profitability this year, now that its new business model
is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for his optimism has been Metrowerks' ability to
raise prices for the software tools it sells to its 150,000
licensees.
</P>
<P>
   Price pressures had been tremendous in the desktop computer
market, given Microsoft's commanding market share in both operating
systems and tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating-system vendors want to give away compilers to
encourage people to write applications for their operating
system,'' said Richard Smith, a software industry executive who is

WHY ALL THE FUSS ABOUT LOU DOBBS?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The audience for CNN's nightly business news program
``Moneyline,'' between 300,000 and 400,000 homes a night, is so
small it would not be close to qualifying as one of the 100
most-watched shows on all of cable television.
</P>
<P>
   As for broadcast television, ``Moneyline'' would be dwarfed by
the likes of ``America's Greatest Pets,'' on UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Moneyline'' has become one of the most lucrative hours in
all of cable television, so important to the overall revenue at CNN
that when Lou Dobbs announced last week that he was leaving as host
of the show, it was widely regarded as a potentially serious blow
to CNN's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the disparity between viewers and dollars is that
the number of viewers is not nearly as important to ``Moneyline''
as the identity of those who are watching. That has been as pure a
collection of investment-oriented viewers in affluent households as
any on television.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of audience, which creates advertiser demand and
higher ad rates, underscores the increasing strength of financial
news and information on television, a trend that has developed over
the last several years, thanks chiefly to booming stock markets and
the ever-increasing number of stock investors.
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been most noticeable at CNBC, NBC's now-runaway
cable channel success, which by the end of this year is expected to
generate earnings in the range of $400 million, becoming the most
profitable media property owned by the General Electric Co. Those
media properties include, of course, the far more heavily watched
NBC broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Goodman, president of CNN's sales and marketing
operations, said that advertiser demand for financial programming
has been ``huge, and it has grown at a faster rate than even the
media marketplace at large, which is hard to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN, recognizing the growth potential _ and the blistering
profit pace being set by CNBC _ tried to expand its position in
this market by starting CNNfn, a competing all-financial-news
network, in December 1995. Dobbs, already managing all of CNN's
financial news coverage, was also put in charge of that network as
president. His leadership role at CNNfn was another reason his
departure raised concerns about the future of CNN's financial news
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Moneyline,'' it has been such a favorite with
households with incomes above $75,000 a year that its
cost-per-thousand price to advertisers, or CPM in industry jargon,
the basic measurement of the true value of a show to advertisers,
is among the best in all of television.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said that by the network's reckoning, the cost per
thousand for ``Moneyline'' is higher than that of any other
news-based program on any network _ including all the prime-time
network news magazine programs. Goodman did not disclose what the
specific price was, but he added that ``as far as we can tell, the
CPM's are second only to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said that he and many other CNN executives were shocked
last week to hear that Dobbs was leaving. But he added: ``Are
advertisers canceling? No. No one has said I don't want to be in
`Moneyline' as a result of the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said that while Dobbs was an important part of how well
``Moneyline'' was doing, ``agencies and advertisers recognize
people are tuning into lots of CNN financial programs, some Lou
hosted and some he didn't. The ratings are good; the income profile
is good. The audience characteristics are not unique to
`Moneyline.' They are unique to CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gralnick, executive vice president for CNN financial news,
said that ratings for ``Moneyline'' in the first three days last
week after Dobbs left were holding exactly at the level they had
been. ``It's going to be interesting to see what the brand is in
`Moneyline,' period,'' Gralnick said.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president for broadcast and
programming in the United States of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide
ad agency, which has clients like American Express and IBM that
have been frequent advertisers on ``Moneyline,'' said: ``The
ratings will be impacted somewhat; that's inevitable when the face
on a program changes. Viewers tune in not just for content but also
for the individual who delivers the content.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``CNBC has good-quality business programming on at
the same hour. I do expect some erosion on CNN. That's why the
choice of a replacement for Dobbs is so crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gralnick said of CNN's plans to replace Dobbs: ``We're in no
hurry. Getting the right host is important. But the worst thing we
can do is leap into anything. The mandate is to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   More important in the long term for CNN may be the ability of
CNNfn to grow enough to compete with CNBC. At the moment, the
competition is one-sided. CNBC is on 24 hours a day and reaches
more than 68 million homes. CNNfn is on 18 hours a day and reaches
just over 12 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bolster, the president of CNBC, said of CNNfn: ``If they
don't have enough scale, they won't have impact. CNBC is about
impact, not ratings. And in terms of financial news, does a cable
operator have to have two networks? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Gralnick said that Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and now vice
chairman of its parent company, Time Warner, ``has made growing the
distribution for CNNfn the primary goal of the company for this
year and next.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that CNNfn should move to 24-hour-a-day status by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can catch up to CNBC, however, remains a serious
question, and Dobbs' departure was widely regarded as a setback to
that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Gralnick said, ``If Lou's departure hurries the effort to add
distribution, it could end up being a good thing.''

IBM NEGOTIATOR'S TESTIMONY HITS MICROSOFT HARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of
the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial. His
litany of accusations was lengthy and specific _ threats and
enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp. delivered at
meeting after meeting. His charges were fleshed out with the dates,
places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
</P>
<P>
   Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's
personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first
representative of a PC maker to testify for the government. David
Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the
Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called
``some of the most important evidence in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a
knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on
earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft
charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust
suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the
representative witness for PC makers. Ever since IBM selected
Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in
1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the
PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws
were meant to prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach
and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's
lawyers to try to undercut its contentions. For months, the Justice
Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand
_ and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of
Gateway Inc., who ultimately decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was
told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to
``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce
competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were
rejected. But the legal standard in such cases, established in a
1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be
``uniquely unequivocal'' _ in the airline case, the evidence was a
tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence. The
contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested
discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain
promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows. No Microsoft
contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must
``drop or eliminate'' OS/2. But he insisted that the overall effect
of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for
Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the IBM PC business was _
incentives to aggressively distribute its product. If accepting
those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 _
made by another unit of IBM _ that is mainly a business decision
for IBM to make, they say. IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust
experts say it was probably not a violation. ``It will be very
difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,''
said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and
prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from
so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing
software. When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft
charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the
incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then
getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher
price for Windows than its competitors. The exception was the
Compaq Computer Corp., which received a significantly lower price,
Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing
Windows 95 _ a straightforward business rationale for different
terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on
Microsoft's statement. The document, an internal memo, said IBM
believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded
on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
``IBM,'' the May 1997 document stated, ``currently pays a higher
royalty than our leading competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the
prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows
operating system was submitted in previous testimony. To protect
confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
took that testimony in closed sessions.
</P>
<P>
   If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying
more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more
legal ammunition to the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of
Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the
puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Tensions were high all over
Kosovo Sunday, as a second wave of NATO troops began entering
war-torn province. It was certainly higher at the strategic airport
just outside Pristina, where Serbs and Russians were blocking
further access to NATO troops one day after some British forces
were allowed to enter. The NATO security force initially was
expected to set up its command center at the airport, but that
facility's status remained unclear. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and President Clinton spoke by telephone for an hour Sunday about
Russia's role in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Meanwhile, two
Yugoslav soldiers were killed Sunday morning in the Vranjevac
district in separate attacks involving the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army, and British paratroopers shot and killed a Yugoslav police
reservist after the man fired a pistol at a NATO patrol.

   KOSOVO-ALBANIANS _PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ As German NATO troops

outside or very far from their homes in 78 days for fear of being
killed by Serb troops. It was the same all over the war-torn
province as the second wave of NATO troops to begin their
peacekeeping mission, with fearful Kosovar Albanians literally
stepping out into the light for the first time in weeks.

   SOUTH-HEATWAVE _ ATLANTA _ Record highs have touched 100 degrees
in recent days in Cary, N.C. Substantial rain hasn't fallen for
weeks. Still, computer programmer Robert Bonham doesn't worry about
running out of water. His grass might turn brown, but that's more a
nuisance than a crisis. ``The expectation is that I pay for water
like I pay for cable. I expect it to work,'' Bonham said. ``I won't
think about it unless we get to a point where there's so much
growth the city can't deliver it.'' It's almost reached that point

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina) _ Russian soldiers continued to occupy
Pristina airport Sunday, blocking the entry of British troops, in
an embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort.
While Clinton discussed the stalement with Yeltsin by telephone,
British officers fumed in private that the place they had picked
for their headquarters had been confiscated by interlopers.
Commanders spent much of the day, without apparent success,
searching for an alternative location. There was no triumphal news
conference on the airport tarmac, as had been expected, by Gen.
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander. British paratroopers shot a Serb
policeman dead Sunday afternoon, after he fired gunshots near one
of their patrols. In Prizren, to the south, German troops came
under sniper fire, then killed a Serb as he tried to attack them in
a battered yellow car. Even as the peacekeepers began to enter
Pristina, departing Serbs torched Albanian houses and a mosque near
the city center. By John Kifner.

 &HT;    TENSE STAND-OFF GREETS US TROOPS' ARRIVAL IN KOSOVO

   JERLI PRELEZ, Yugoslavia _ American troops, probably the most
vilified among the NATO peacekeepers by Kosovo's bitter ethnic
Serbs, finally began their official peacekeeping mission in Kosovo
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And on a day filled with tense moments between NATO and
Serb-dominated Yugoslav troops throughout the war-torn province,
American paratroopers were barely two hours into their mission
before a brief, but tense stand-off ensued.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 members of the 82nd Airborne out of Fort Bragg, N.C.,
had landed in this southern Kosovo village to begin establishing
the American operations base of Kosovo Force (KFOR), when an
obviously drunken Serb soldier got out of a bus carrying a
Russian-made Kalashnikov and threatening to fire at them.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had blocked the Serb troops' planned exit road
toward Yugoslavia to make way for nine M1A1 battle tanks coming
around the next bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to . . . kill them all,'' the Yugoslav soldier
yelled as he approached the newly established American checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Before the stunned paratroopers could draw their weapons, the
unnamed Serb soldier was seized and disarmed by other Serbs who ran
out from the convoy. One of them yelled out, ``Don't . . . shoot
because they'll . . . kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   After a tense five-minute discussion between American sentries,
led by Sgt. 1st Class Mladem Fulir, and the Serb convoy commander,
the convoy carrying about 300 heavily armed Serb troops -- waving
obscene gestures and looking stone-faced -- turned around and took
a longer route toward the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fulir, 40, a cigar-chomping Croatian American doubling as
translator and lead sentry, who ordered the convoy in Serbian
either to give up its weapons or turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very lucky,'' Fulir said later.
</P>
<P>
   Though heavily outgunned on the ground, the American
paratroopers were protected overhead by two Apache helicopters that
circled the convoy as it passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little better than we thought it was going to be,''
said Sgt. Kendall Holse, 30, of Amarillo, Texas. ``We were prepared
for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The paratroopers helicoptered in on Blackhawk choppers ahead of
Alpha Company of the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry
Regiment, as the advance element in the American sector, setting up
camp on the road between the towns of Urosevac and Pozaranje.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When Brigadier General John Craddock's helicopter touched down
in this wheat field 20 miles south of the provincial capital
Pristina, some local villagers cheered and others wept tears of
gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to over-dramatise it,'' said Craddock, but there
was no mistaking the joy of the Kosovars, who chanted ``USA!'' and
``Thank you'' and rushed to shake the general's hand.
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-minute briefing on Jerli Prelez the general walked
out to greet about 100 ethnic Albanian residents of the village,
many of whom said they had not been out of their houses for three
weeks out of fear of Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very happy because the Serb criminals are going
home forever,'' said Avni Rejebi, 27, a professional soccer player
from the nearby village of Tankovic. Craddock's arrival marks the
start of the official Kosovo presence of the United States, which
flew 80 percent of the sorties in the 11-week NATO air war on
Yugoslavia but enters the embattled province a day after its
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 American troops were to be here by the end of the day
Sunday.

CABLE CONVENTION FOCUSES ON HIGH-SPEED INTERNET DELIVERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At first blush, the National Cable Television
Association's annual convention, which began here Sunday, seems
just like the group's shows of years past. For instance, the roster
of exhibitors is dominated, as usual, by programmers _ MTV
Networks, Romance Classics, the Game Show Network.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the program schedule and some hallway talk here,
much of the buzz in the cable television industry is not about
cable television at all. Instead, a lot of the excitement is about
delivering high-speed Internet service and even telephone calls
using the cable industry's ``broadband communications pipe,''
otherwise known as the coaxial cable lines that pass almost all of
the nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sessions this year are ``Internet 2,'' ``Introducing
High-Speed Data Services'' and ``Topics in Broadband Data
Networking.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes only three letters to explain the shift: AT&AMP;T. At this
time last year, AT&AMP;T was known for being the No. 1 long-distance
phone company. But since then, AT&AMP;T's chairman, C. Michael
Armstrong, has committed more than $90 billion to also become the
nation's biggest cable company, acquiring Tele-Communications Inc.
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, faced with looming competition from the Baby Bell local
phone giants in its core long-distance market, wants to retaliate
by using cable systems to deliver integrated packages of telephone
and data service. (yes, television.)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Armstrong will be coming out as a Cable Guy. He is
scheduled to give the morning's keynote address, ``Enter the
Broadband Millennium.'' Even more telling, he is sticking around to
schmooze and is holding a reception here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the cable industry's commitments a few years ago to
deliver advanced services, Decker Anstrom, the association's
president, said in a telephone interview last week: ``There is a
focus on delivering what we promised in the Telecommunications Act
of 1996. Since the act the industry has invested $20 billion in
physical plant to deliver new products and competition to the local
phone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, though, that as sexy as the Internet may be, the cable
industry's bread and butter remains television and its main battle
continues to rage against the broadcast networks. For every
Armstrong here, there is a Sumner Redstone, chairman of the
programming giant Viacom International, who is speaking Tuesday
morning, and a Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corp., who
closes the convention Wednesday.

CREATING A GIANT BRAIN, AND NOT GETTING CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Iowa)   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who invented the computer? asks Scott McCartney, a staff writer
for The Wall Street Journal, in his diverting new book ``ENIAC: The
Triumphs and Tragedies of the World's First Computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Radio Shack, despite the credit given by a child in one of
McCartney's anecdotes. It wasn't even John von Neumann, the
mathematician and logician who is often called the father of the
computer and whose name still labels the basic architecture of the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCartney writes, the distinction rightly belongs to
John W. Mauchly and Presper Eckert, two men at the University of
Pennsylvania who created ENIAC, ``the first digital,
general-purpose, electronic computer _ the first Giant Brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Designed and built in the mid-1940s, ENIAC (for Electronic
Numerical Integrator and Computer) was, in McCartney's words, ``a
bus-size mousetrap of 40 nine-foot-tall cabinets filled with nearly
18,000 vacuum tubes and miles of wiring.'' He continues: ``It was
developed as a weapon of war, a machine that could calculate
trajectories for World War II artillery guns. Though unwieldy,
ENIAC was wired with enough innovation and genius to provide the
spark for computer development. The genealogy of the modern
computer begins here, with ENIAC, Eckert and Mauchly.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is this not more widely known? Why don't the names Eckert
and Mauchly resonate like Fulton, McCormick and Edison? The answer
to this question is the heart of McCartney's book and provides it
with its spice and dramatic tension. First, because ENIAC operated
under Army secrecy, it was little known except in computing
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Second, complex controversy surrounds who got credit for the
machine. As McCartney tells it, while ENIAC was being built a team
member met von Neumann, who was interested in crunching numbers for
the Manhattan Project, the secret program to design and build the
atomic bomb. Von Neumann joined the team, contributed ideas for
ENIAC's successor, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Calculator),
and wrote a widely distributed paper on those ideas, ``First Draft
of a Report on the EDVAC,'' which included certain of Eckert's and
Mauchly's concepts without crediting them. Eckert and Mauchly
countered with their own paper, but it lacked von Neumann's
eloquence and received little notice. So von Neumann garnered the
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even more complex controversy surrounds who got credit
for the very idea of the machine. Very briefly: Eckert and Mauchly
failed to file for a patent for ENIAC until June 1947, long after
its completion, when they had decided to build a business around
their invention. But they proved inept as entrepreneurs and in 1950
had to sell to Remington Rand, the typewriter maker, which five
years later was bought by the Sperry Corp. and renamed Sperry Rand.
</P>
<P>
   Sperry, now holding the patent for ENIAC, subsequently signed a
cross-licensing agreement with IBM, which by the 1960s had become
the leading seller of computers. Challenging this agreement, the
Honeywell Corp. in 1967 sued Sperry over the validity of the ENIAC
patent. The resulting trial came down to the issue that the
Honeywell lawyers unearthed: whether Mauchly had been inspired by
John V. Atanasoff, an Iowa State professor who in the early 1940s
had been working on a digital calculating machine and whom Mauchly
had visited in June 1941. Mauchly proved a poor witness on the
stand, and the judge ruled for Honeywell, taking the tack that the
ENIAC patent was invalid because it had been applied for too late.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney praises the judge's decision, arguing that it was
necessary to open up the computer industry to competition. But on
the issue of Mauchly vs. Atanasoff, he sides with Mauchly, arguing
that whatever ``theory and principles'' of the computer ``had been
articulated'' before Mauchly went to work on ENIAC, Mauchly had
worked with ``blinders on'' and his solutions were ``born of simple
practicality.'' But it is in arguing this point that McCartney's
case for ENIAC's originality seems weakest.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the ancestry of ENIAC, McCartney touches on everything
from Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1833), which proved
impractical to build at the time, down to Howard Aiken's Mark I
electromechanical calculator built for IBM in the early 1940s,
which unlike Babbage's machine lacked a ``conditional branch,'' the
``If ... then statement of computing'' known as a subroutine.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney writes that Mauchly claimed never to have heard of
Babbage and that he came up with the subroutine idea for ENIAC on
his own. But one finds it hard to believe that Mauchly was unaware
of computer theories that were in the air at the time, so to speak.
Curiously, McCartney makes no mention whatsoever of a principal
propagator of those theories, Alan M. Turing, the British
mathematician and logician who in the 1930s solved many of the
problems of computing with his design of the hypothetical Turing
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCartney makes a persuasive case that ENIAC was the
first working computer ever built. Mauchly was heartbroken over
never getting proper recognition or profiting from his invention.
He chalked up von Neumann's getting credit to the theory, in
McCartney's words, ``that discoveries are attributed to the person
with the biggest reputation at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert, on the other hand, while bitter, ``took a more
historical view of his fate,'' McCartney writes, ``comforting
himself with the knowledge that many inventors didn't receive
proper credit until events were digested with wisdom of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the publication of ``ENIAC'' will prove a part of that
process. At least it tells an absorbing story and sheds light on a
moment when our world was transformed.

   OSSINING, N.Y. _ When Michael Aitchison and his wife, the Rev.
Claire Woodley-Aitchison, began looking for child care after
arriving in Westchester County a few years ago, they thought about
getting an au pair from overseas. They assumed it would be a young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wanted girls,'' Aitchison said. ``We tried all
the tricks. It wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the couple's three young boys were a tough
sell, and the best candidates politely declined. Then, through
``chance, default or an act of God,'' as Ms. Woodley-Aitchison, an
Episcopal priest, put it, they found Jais, a young man from
Denmark, and they have had male au pairs since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a testosterone zone, and it takes a very special
woman to survive in a household of men, especially if you're not
related to them,'' she said. ``With three boys, having male au
pairs made so much sense. They were able to match my sons' energy
level and show them the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   While they are still the exception, male au pairs are emerging
as a child-care alternative in suburbs and cities across the United
States. Often inspired by a sister's previous experience, the men
are interested in becoming au pairs for many of the same reasons
that women are: adventure, a chance to improve their English and
the opportunity to experience American culture firsthand and on the
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   For the families, young men make good role models for boys and
willing companions in such pursuits as climbing trees and finding
frogs. And their presence can send a subtle message to boys and
girls, parents say, about gender roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my kids to grow up thinking that only women care
for children,'' said Jennifer Crewe, a publishing executive who
lives in New York City with her husband, two sons and a male au
pair from Poland. ``I want them to know that both men and women can
do both sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is still small, with fewer than 500 male au pairs
nationally among the half-dozen agencies approved by the federal
government to supply au pairs. But agency officials report that the
numbers of male au pairs have risen steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago we had no male au pairs, but now we have families
who request them, and the numbers have been increasing every year
for the last few years,'' said Paul Christianson, director of Au
Pair USA, a division of the nonprofit organization InterExchange in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Au Pair USA currently has 150 male au pairs from 19 countries
out of a total network of 1,500 au pairs. Christianson said that
because there were so many more men from other countries interested
in becoming au pairs here than there were spaces available, the
pool of men was especially strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to sell male au pairs,'' he said. ``We could
probably have two or three times the number of male au pairs if the
demand was there. As a result our standards are infinitely more
scrupulous with the selection of male au pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies have started to promote young men as an option for
families partly out of necessity. Since 1997, when the British au
pair Louise Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder, the
once-abundant supply of au pairs from Great Britain has largely
dried up, and agency officials have scrambled to fill the vacuum.
They have turned to countries like South Africa, Brazil, Poland and
Japan to recruit young women _ and men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge for us is that families have a
preconceived notion of what an au pair is _ Scandinavian, tall,
blond,'' said Heidi Woehl, director of Au Pair Care in San
Francisco. ``But now you might have a Mexican au pair or a Czech au
pair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s tens of thousands of au pairs from overseas
have cared for children through a program regulated by the U.S.
Information Agency. Initially, the agencies were allowed to recruit
only from Western Europe, but the program was recently expanded to
include any country with which the United States has diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The program, in which women and men between the ages of 18 and
26 are in the United States for one year on a special visa, was
intended to provide both affordable child care and a cultural
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Families pay an upfront fee of $4,000 to $5,000 a year to cover
health insurance and travel expenses. The au pairs are paid a
weekly stipend, typically $140 to $160, and they are not to work
more than 45 hours a week or more than 10 hours a day. Their
primary responsibility is to care for children, which includes
preparing meals, doing laundry and keeping the children's rooms
tidy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of au pairs in the United States at
any given time has fluctuated between 11,000 and 13,000, with
12,000 projected for this year. A big change has occurred in the
number of British au pairs, which dropped to 882 in 1997 from 2,115
the year before, according to the U.S. Information Agency. The
agency does not track the number of male au pairs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Male au pairs say they get double-takes from Americans who
cannot believe any young man would want to spend his days running
after toddlers or folding laundry. Depending on where they are
from, the men can get equally strong reactions from friends and
families back home.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Schjerning, an au pair from Denmark who cares for an
11-year-old boy with cerebral palsy in Croton-on-Hudson, said his
Danish friends ``accepted it'' and did not make a fuss. But for
Inaki Gorraiz of Spain, a former soccer goalie with rugged features
who cares for a 9-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy in northern
Westchester, the reaction at home was very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends were amazed,'' he recalled. ``A couple of people I
know said, `Are you gay?' I said, `Of course not.' I thought it was
so stupid. Anyone can take care of children if they like them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gorraiz, 23, the decision to be an au pair for a year was,
in the long run, a way to realize his dream of studying film at the
University of California at Los Angeles. He needs to improve his
English to gain admission to the program, and his young charges are
helping him do that. (He also happens to love children, he says,
and had experience baby-sitting in Spain.)
</P>
<P>
   The other day, he and the 9-year-old, Elizabeth Migliorelli,
were watching ``Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' together,
and she explained the meaning of several unfamiliar words. He, in
turn, helps her fine-tune her soccer skills. ``He's a great goalie,
he's fun to play with and he doesn't cheat,'' she said after giving
Gorraiz a high-five during a skirmish with her brother.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of male applicants to the U.S. au pair
program reflects the greater acceptance of male involvement in
child rearing in some European countries, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deliberate effort to include male staff as part of
early childhood programs in Scandinavia, France and Belgium,'' said
Dr. Sheila Kamerman, a professor in the School of Social Work at
Columbia University who does comparative research on family issues
in industrialized countries. ``They think it's important for young
children to be exposed to males as well as females.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, one lingering concern is the
possibility of sexual abuse, agency officials and parents say. In
1993, a male au pair from Germany pleaded guilty to sexually
molesting an 8-year-old Massachusetts boy. Last year the agency
that had placed him, Au Pair in America, in Greenwich, Conn., paid
a settlement to the family after a civil suit. The agency no longer
recruits men.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents say that having a female care giver does not
insulate them from tragedy, as illustrated by the case of Ms.
Woodward, whose conviction in the death of 8-month-old Matthew
Eappen was reduced to manslaughter. Other parents acknowledge the
possibility of abuse by young men but say they are alert to signs
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust my creep factor,'' said Ms. Woodley-Aitchison, who
leads sexual misconduct awareness workshops for the Episcopal
Diocese of New York. Her husband, a psychotherapist, also conducts
the workshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what to look for,'' she said, ``and our guys never
presented any of those signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Christianson of Au Pair USA called pedophilia a ``horrible
mental disease'' but ``very, very rare.'' He added: ``Do we
penalize the entire young male population because of something
that, statistically, is a very remote possibility? I just don't
think it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Aitchisons, couples who have had one male au pair often
become repeat customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families can be a little hesitant about looking at male
applicants but usually once they go with a male, they tend to stick
with men,'' said Shauna Gallegos, executive director of Au Pair
Programme USA in Salt Lake City, an agency that will place 30 male
au pairs this year, up from five in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of male au pairs is putting a new twist on the old
joke about wives who wanted to screen out attractive female au
pairs who might turn their husbands' heads. Morten Kublick, Ms.
Woodley-Aitchison's 23-year-old au pair from Denmark, is a body
builder with blond hair, piercing blue eyes and a cool, calm
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends come over,'' she said, ``and ask, `Oh Claire, how
did you arrange this?' ''

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina) _ Russian soldiers continued to occupy
Pristina airport Sunday, blocking the entry of British troops, in
an embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort.
While Clinton discussed the stalement with Yeltsin by telephone,
British officers fumed in private that the place they had picked
for their headquarters had been confiscated by interlopers.
Commanders spent much of the day, without apparent success,
searching for an alternative location. There was no triumphal news
conference on the airport tarmac, as had been expected, by Gen.
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander. British paratroopers shot a Serb
policeman dead Sunday afternoon, after he fired gunshots near one
of their patrols. In Prizren, to the south, German troops came
under sniper fire, then killed a Serb as he tried to attack them in
a battered yellow car. Even as the peacekeepers began to enter
Pristina, departing Serbs torched Albanian houses and a mosque near
the city center. By John Kifner.

   KOSOVO-SCENE (Pristina) _ An enormous column of Serb civilians
followed their army and police out of western Kosovo on Sunday,
moving slowly on the narrow roads past a column of Italian troops
and armor moving the other way, toward Pec and Prizren. By Steven
Erlanger.

   KOSOVO-TENSION (Prizren) _ Two Serbs in a small yellow car
opened fire Sunday evening on a group of just-arrived German
peacekeepers. The peacekeepers fired back, killing one of the men
and seriously wounding the other in a tense and unsettled second
day of NATO's arrival in Kosovo. The body of the Serb, wearing
civilian clothes, still sat slumped late Sunday night in the
bullet-riddled car facing the barrel of a German tank, a bloody
reminder of the dangers of this peacekeeping mission as it moves
into Kosovo before the heavily-armed Serb troops have moved out. By

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Prizren) _ In the next three months of Kosovo's
summer, hundreds of thousands of poor Kosovar villagers will cross
from Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro to go home again. But in
these first days of open borders, most are too afraid of
still-retreating Serbs and landmines in the countryside. By
Elizabeth Bumiller.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS (Urosevac, Kosovo) _ On the second day of NATO's
operation in Kosovo, American ground troops began to enter province
in force today, but their progress was far from swift and their
control over what will ultimately become the American sector in
southeast Kosovo was anything but ironclad. By day's end, there
were supposed to be nearly 2,000 soldiers and marines in Kosovo,
but the heavy, rumbling convoys left their bases in Macedonia late
and bogged down on the road to Kosovo. By Steven Lee Myers.

<P>
   KOSOVO-GRAVES (Hallac, Yugoslavia) _ A month after refugees
reported that Serb paramilitaries killed 46 people during a two day
rampage through this village and a nearby hamlet in mid-April, a
visit to both sites on Sunday revealed compelling evidence that
mass killings did in fact occur. In this village, a swathe of fresh
digging that appeared to be a mass grave lies feet from a bullet
pocked wall. And in nearby Ribar, twenty-six new graves in the
local cemetery and two dozen burnt houses stand as evidence of some
form of attack. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ Clinton and Yeltsin reached no
agreement on Sunday on the standoff between NATO troops and a small
group of Russian troops in Kosovo but agreed that NATO and Russian
military commanders should meet quickly to try to end the problem,
White House officials said on Sunday. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ The chief negotiators for Russia and
NATO haggled for a fourth day to no avail over how and where
Russian troops would serve in a Kosovo peacekeeping operation. By
Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALLIES (Berlin) _ The Kosovo crisis has brought radical
changes to the European continent: thrusting Germany into a leading
military role not seen since 1945, galvanizing attempts to forge a
common European defense policy, and altering Europe's relationship
with the United States. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-JSTARS (Aboard the JSTARS surveillance plane over
Albania) _ This rebuilt Boeing 707 carries the U.S. Air Force's
newest and most advanced system for watching enemy troops from the
air. The system has assumed a key role in both picking targets and
monitoring the peace agreement. Though used experimentally during
the Persian Gulf war, the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
Systems are still so new that the Air Force and Army have only four
of them worldwide _ two of them now in the Balkans. Unlike its
better-known predecessor, the Airborne Warning and Control System,
or AWACS, this system was designed to scrutinize events on the
ground over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SWISS (Geneva) _ Fearful of too many refugees flooding
into the country, Swiss voters on Sunday overwhelmingly approved
tighter rules for asylum seekers. Already home to some 180,000
Kosovar Albanians, Switzerland has been experiencing an enormous
influx of refugees fleeing the turbulent province. With arrivals up
by 60 percent over last year at this time, Switzerland is expecting
as many as 60,000 refugees by the year's end, giving it the highest
number per inhabitant in Europe. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>

   KOSOVO-SUVA (Suva Reka) _ This is the most ruined town in
Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian city where, before this war began in
late March, the Kosovo Liberation Army was strong and Serb police
rarely entered. By Steven Erlanger.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Television has more channels than ever before, more prime-time
shows than ever before and, of course, more commercials than ever
before. And yet, to the consternation of many television industry
executives, the one thing it seems to have fewer of is one of the
most essential commodities of the business: stars.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, television seems to have smaller stars than
it once had. In interviews with executives from networks, studios
and talent agencies, the list of names that were consensus choices
as unquestioned television stars of the magnitude of some of the
names of the past _ even the not-all-that-distant past of five
years ago, the era of Jerry Seinfeld, Tim Allen and Roseanne _ was
remarkably short. It basically began and ended with one name:
Calista Flockhart of Fox's hit ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons range from the spread of the television audience
over an increasing number of channels to the networks' strategy of
targeting specific age and gender groups.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff in widely recognized, mass-appeal stars has some
serious implications for the television business, more than the
problems it causes for TV Guide magazine, whose editors admit a
certain desperation in trying to find 52 stars a year for their
covers. (The magazine has gone so far afield lately in its
starvation hunt for identifiable TV names that it put the cast of
``Star Wars'' and the Latin singer Ricky Martin on two covers in
the past month, though neither has much of anything to do with
television.)
</P>
<P>
   For broadcast networks, which continue to market themselves as
the one source for advertisers to achieve mass reach, the faces and
names of stars are at the center of marketing strategies. In his
first executive change, Garth Ancier, the new president of NBC
Entertainment, added a new head of casting for the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a great part of the identification of a network is
the faces of its stars,'' Ancier said. ``They represent your
network and create your brand. They're all important.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet there does not appear in the networks' current roster to
be a host of likely successors to Seinfeld, who left his NBC comedy
last season, and Allen, who wrapped up his hit comedy, ``Home
Improvement,'' last month for Walt Disney's ABC _ and no one in the
same universe of appeal as icons like Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason,
Mary Tyler Moore and the Bill Cosby of the 1980s (though the Bill
Cosby of today remains perhaps the biggest name still working in
prime time).
</P>
<P>
   One clear indication of the decline in recognizability of
today's television stars is the so-called ``TV Q'' poll, conducted
by Marketing Evaluations Inc. Stars are ranked in this poll based
on both popularity and familiarity. In the latter category,
television stars have recorded a sharp drop-off in scores over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, for example, the top 25 female television performers
averaged a 68 percent familiarity score. By this year that number
fell to just 50 percent. Among male performers, the top 25 had a
score of 70 as recently as 1996. This year it is down to 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking about the kind of star who could not walk
through Times Square without stopping traffic,'' said Alan Berger,
the executive vice president of the television division of the
International Creative Management talent agency, ``I really don't
think many of today's stars would qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger emphasized today's stars because he acknowledged that
Cosby remains a star of enormous recognition and popularity, and
Michael J. Fox of ABC's ``Spin City'' is another completely
familiar and popular figure. Other stars on their second or third
go-rounds of stardom (all, not coincidentally, at CBS, the network
that trades most heavily in stars from the past) include Ted
Danson, Don Johnson and Dick Van Dyke.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these performers owe their stardom much more to their
previous work than their current work. Johnson, in fact, is often
cited as the kind of white hot star of a generation ago, when he
was in ``Miami Vice,'' that is rarely if ever generated today.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the network late-night entertainment shows have
also detected for some time that, as one executive producer put it,
``The number of stars who will move the needle of the ratings has
dwindled drastically.'' And among the few stars that do have an
impact on the ratings, he said, virtually none is a current
television star.
</P>
<P>
   So where have all the big stars gone? More than anything, they
have gone the same way the big hit shows have gone: to smaller fame
in smaller arenas. David Poltrack, the executive vice president of
research for CBS, said the entire scale of television had to be
reduced, based on declines in network viewing percentages. He
pointed out that hit shows of the past reached 30 to 40 percent of
the viewing audience. Now a show is a hit if it reaches 15 to 18
percent of the audience. And shows on one new network, WB, are
being called hits when they reach only about 5 percent of the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the overall reduction in what constitutes a
hit-sized audience, it is the willingness and even the desire of
some networks to seek only a small slice of the total viewing pie
that is contributing to what one talent agency executive called the
``Honey I Shrunk the Stars'' trend in television.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is best exemplified by WB, owned by Time Warner and
Tribune Co., which limits its viewing targets to the audience
between the ages of 12 and 24. WB stars like Sarah Michelle Gellar
of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' Katie Holmes of ``'Dawson's
Creek'' and Keri Russell of ``Felicity'' are enormously popular
with female teen-agers, for example. But many adults would have no
idea who they are.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine as far as WB executives are concerned because they
have willingly defined themselves as a network with a narrow goal:
Be a hit with the young. ``When you have niche networks, you're
going to have niche stars,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said this limitation had an impact on the other end of
the age spectrum at CBS, which has numerous shows with big overall
ratings but a large percentage of viewers over 50 years old. That
drastically limits the number of performers whom non-CBS executives
would identify as true wide-appeal stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said that Roma Downey, the star of ``Touched By an
Angel''(who happens to have one of the highest current Q-scores of
any female star on television), was not quite in the big star
firmament because so many younger people would not be able to
identify her.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ancier said, Ray Romano, the star of one of the
biggest comedies on television, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' cannot
be ``called a big star, though he's talented enough to be one.''
The reason, he said, is that CBS' audience is so dominated by older
viewers that Romano is not as widely popular as he might be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Romano, a family man, does not get his name bounced
around in the entertainment tabloids either. Along with Dennis
Franz, star of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' he is what Berger called ``a
regular guy.'' That can impede stardom a bit, for as Ancier put it,
``Part of being a star is having some mystery about you.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors in the star drought that are cited by
networks and studio executives:
</P>
<P>
   _ The prevalence of news magazines. There are 12 prime-time news
hours on the air every week, which takes away hours that could be
filled with star-driven shows. Of course the news magazines do have
some stars of their own, including some iconic figures like Barbara
Walters and Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The surge in animated shows. Next season there will be six on
the air. Needless to say, these do not create stars in the
traditional sense, though Ancier argued that ``Bart Simpson is one
of the most recognizable faces in the world; so is Homer.'' But
Nancy Cartwright and Dan Castellaneta, who speak the words for
those characters, go through their daily lives unacknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   _ The near endless coverage of every move a new star makes in
magazines and on television magazine shows like ``Entertainment
Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood.'' One talent agency executive
suggested that ``the public goes through stars faster than ever
before and then gets sick of them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The trend, of more than 10 years, toward what is known as the
``ensemble show'' and away from what is called the ``single-star
vehicle.'' At least 20 network series could be called ensemble
shows. ``It's always harder for a star to emerge from an
ensemble,'' Berger said. ``George Clooney did it. But it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney burst out of the hit NBC drama ``E.R.'' as a star of
national stature. This was certainly confirmed when he signed on to
play the lead in the ``Batman'' movie series. But ``E.R.'' allowed
him to reach the biggest and most representative audience in
television.
</P>
<P>
   A WB star, James Van Der Beek of ``Dawson's Creek,'' had a movie
success more typical of today's television stars. His movie,
``Varsity Blues,'' was a box office hit, yet all the executives
interviewed for this article agreed that Van Der Beek had not yet
come near broad star status, because the same smallish audience
that watched his television show went to see the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``To build a star out you have to put him in a movie where he
plays a different role,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble of six actors in NBC's hit comedy ``Friends'' have
certainly made it to wide national recognition, most of the
executives said. But that group consciously marketed themselves as
a group from the beginning _ and they may be individually less
celebrated because of it.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Calista Flockhart had such wide support as an
unquestioned television star is precisely because her show is a
star vehicle _ the title is her character's name. It is, thus, a
show about her.
</P>
<P>
   But another reason may be Ms. Flockhart's ascension to one
traditional Pantheon of universal television stardom: the cover of
Time magazine. With Seinfeld gone, Ms. Flockhart is alone among the
new crop of television stars with that achievement, though in her
case it has less to do with her star power than with what the
character has come to represent. Still, even on the Time cover, it
was Ally McBeal who appeared (along with Susan B. Anthony and Betty
Friedan), representing some form of postfeminist icon. Ms.
Flockhart's face might have been there, but her name was not.
</P>
<P>
   But even the near stars and niche stars of today's television
shows are turning up monthly on numerous magazine covers. That is
partly a function of their being always more identifiable than the
latest cover model, and partly a function of the stratification
that is taking place in all media. One television studio executive
said that television was becoming more and more like music radio.
``Each music genre has its own station,'' the executive said.
``That's the direction television is going toward.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ms. Flockhart, the group of performers most industry
executives cited as the top level of stardom in television today
included names like Drew Carey and Jenna Elfman of the ABC comedies
``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Dharma and Greg''; Kelsey Grammer of
``Frasier'' and the six-member cast of ``Friends'' on General
Electric's NBC; and David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, stars of
``The X-Files'' on Fox, a subsidiary of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jenna Elfman is sort of a typical star of today's
television,'' said one senior executive at a talent agency. ``She's
like an almost-star. She might get there someday.''

DEVELOPING A BETTER LANGUAGE FOR WEB TRANSACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word NUMBER in parentheses has been used in the 4th graf
instead of the symbol, which is non-transmittable to many newspaper
systems.) 
(lb) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aiming to make shopping on the Web easier, a consortium of
credit-card companies, Internet merchants and developers of online
payment technologies plans to announce on Monday that its members
have agreed to develop a standard for executing electronic commerce
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The standard, known as electronic commerce modeling language,
will eventually enable consumers to buy from multiple Web sites
without re-entering data like a name, shipping address or
credit-card number. The coding of so-called electronic wallet
software will store such customer information on a secure server
and is intended to pass the data to different merchants' Web sites
with fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important first step,'' Ken Cassar, digital
commerce analyst for the Internet research firm Jupiter
Communications, said. ``A lot more needs to be done, but the
parties who've joined in are pretty much the ones you'd want.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, electronic wallet technologies have faltered because
the coding used by merchants to format checkout pages has varied
widely. For instance, the code used to indicate a consumer's
credit-card number could begin with ``CC(NUMBER)'' in some cases,
and ``CN'' in others. The wallets were sometimes unable to
recognize the variations, and thus could not work with many sites.
As a result, consumers have generally ignored the wallet companies.
</P>
<P>
   That situation will change, according to the electronic commerce
consortium, which includes America Online, Microsoft, Dell
Computer, Compaq Computer, Visa USA, IBM, Sun Microsystems,
Mastercard International and American Express, as well as a host of
Internet merchants and electronic wallet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Once merchants can essentially speak the same language, wallet
companies will be able to offer consumers the prospect of one-click
checkout across many sites.
</P>
<P>
   Such a feature could increase Internet sales substantially,
since customers often bail out of transactions rather than go
through several time-consuming steps to complete a purchase. In
February, a report by Jupiter found that 27 percent of online
buyers abandoned their orders before checkout for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be particularly important for attracting new
customers,'' said John Pettitt, chief technology officer for
Beyond.com, a software retailer. ``Every time you ask a customer to
do something, you risk losing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitt said Beyond.com offered one-click checkout to America
Online customers who had signed up for its Quick Checkout
electronic wallet, and he said the feature had ``been very
successful for us.'' Aside from that, however, he said Beyond.com
had declined to do business with other companies that offer
electronic wallets, like Cybercash and Transactor Networks,
``because they don't have a critical mass of users.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that lack of critical mass is that consumers see
little reason to sign up with an electronic wallet company that
does not have a large number of merchant partners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Cassar of Jupiter, electronic wallet companies have
made little headway until now in part because they have had to
persuade retailers to format their sites to conform to their
particular wallet technology. The hope has been to sign up enough
retailers to become the de facto standard and thereby consolidate
the market. ``But instead they've Balkanized the market,'' Cassar
said.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for wallet companies is not only the potential to
charge a fee for each transaction processed, but also the
opportunity to gather valuable consumer data. ``If I've got a
wallet company and I build a list of 100,000 names and addresses of
people who've bought from Barnesandnoble.com, that's pretty
valuable,'' Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   While the electronic commerce consortium's agreement on how to
define data overcomes one hurdle in the effort to spread the use of
electronic wallets, the use of consumer data represents a far more
thorny issue. The wallet companies say they will protect consumers'
privacy. But there are others who might object to such gathering of
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a merchant who competes with Barnesandnoble.com, I'm
not going to be happy about a wallet company selling that
information to a competitor,'' Cassar said.
</P>
<P>
   Since credit-card companies already sell lists along those
lines, he added, they will probably resist any efforts on the part
of wallet companies to compete on that front, as could portals like
America Online, which can use such information to deliver more
advertisements to highly specific audiences.

IN ITS SIXTH DECADE, `CARMINA BURANA' ECHOES THROUGH THE
MAINSTREAM 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of music's most resilient creatures is on the loose again,
making tracks across the landscape of mainstream entertainment. It
leaves traces on the vaguely medieval choruses of John Williams'
score to ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' and a
heavier imprint on ``Hate Me Now,'' the creepingly catchy hip-hop
hit by Nas. Its rhythmic echoes even resound behind a recent
promotion for the ``South Park'' film.
</P>
<P>
   What is that blasted music, ever present on soundtracks and in
television commercials, surfacing everywhere from the video arcade
to the ice skating rink? It is ``Carmina Burana,'' a cantata
composed in the 1930s by the German music educator Carl Orff around
a group of 13th-century ballads by wandering monks.
</P>
<P>
   As the most likely musical background for jousting nobles or
scary monsters, used in films from ``Excalibur'' to ``Natural Born
Killers,'' Orff''s work defines the sound of the pop Gothic. Its
dramatic contours seem to suit every style. Charlotte Church, the
13-year-old Welsh soprano sensation, sings from it on her latest
album, ``Voice of an Angel,'' as did Barbra Streisand before her.
Nancy Kerrigan and Torvil and Dean have skated to it, video game
players annihilate enemies to it, and the German industrial rock
group Einstuerzende Neubauten and the teen-pop heartthrobs 98
Degrees have used it to herald the opening of their shows.
</P>
<P>
   The piece's ubiquity is more pronounced in the classical world,
where it is a staple for choruses, orchestras, opera companies and
ballet corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience turns out for it,'' said Julie Rushbrook, the
outgoing president of the Grace Choral Society of Brooklyn.
``That's the bottom line for a community choral society. It really
helps pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rushbrook has sung the piece three times in 15 years, most
recently last month. With the last few years, nearly a dozen groups
have performed the piece in the New York region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmina Burana'' is so firmly wedged into the popular
consciousness that Nas may have thought he could slip it into
``Hate Me Now'' undetected. A representative for his record label,
Columbia, said that Nas and his collaborator, Sean (Puffy) Combs,
initially used a recorded sample of the work's first section, ``O
Fortuna,'' but later removed it and wrote their own background
music. European American Distribution, which administrates the
copyright to ``Carmina Burana'' in the United States, is exploring
whether this reinterpretation constitutes unfair use.
</P>
<P>
   It may not make for a sound legal argument, but the idea that
``Carmina Burana'' somehow belongs to everyone instinctively rings
true. Its tenacious hold on the public imagination suggests a power
that transcends most critics' dismissals of the piece as naive and
overwrought. ``Carmina Burana'' exists between the high and the
low, the modern and the traditional, reminding listeners just how
seductive such border crossings can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It possesses qualities similar to rock: it has a high degree
of repetition, the harmonic patterns are very simple, it is very
earthy and emotional,'' said John Daly Goodwin, the musical
director of the New York Choral Society. ``There's spectacle, with
the very large orchestra and the flashy percussion section. And
then much of the text is about drinking and debauchery.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin is hardly the first to discuss ``Carmina Burana'' in
terms of rock. For a 1957 recording supervised by Orff, William
Mann wrote, ``Bill Haley and Orff sometimes get their effects by
identical means.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have made jibes at ``Carmina Burana'' similar to those
leveled against rock: ``Those of us who are accustomed to listening
to `music' were nonplused by the sounds that emanate from this
score,'' Paul Henry Lang wrote in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Even its defenders value ``Carmina Burana'' particularly because
it is accessible and fun. ``People are used to amplified sound, and
they like the lush broadness, the wave of aural experiences it
offers,'' said the choreographer Kent Stoller, whose staging of the
piece, complete with a gigantic wheel of fortune and a 72-member
chorus hanging from a swing, has proved a perennial hit for his
Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. ``It fits with their
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmina Burana'' is a simple piece according to the standards
of conventional classical music. Plunging listeners into a near
climax with the first notes of ``O Fortuna,'' its opening
meditation on fate's cruelty, the work clips along on the strength
of hummable melodies and heartily employed drums. Its text, in
Latin, Low German and French, alternates between bawdy love songs
and anguished meditations on mortality. The dominant baritone and
soprano embody lusty sexual stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet below the surface, ``Carmina Burana'' is awash with musical
and cultural complexities. Its rhythms are tricky, with constant
tempo shifts and mixed meters. Following the philosophy he
developed in his Schulwerk method for teaching children, which
introduces musical concepts through improvised body sounds and
gestures, Orff used these jumpy beats to stimulate a physical
response. Coinciding with the emergence of African-American music
as the century's soundtrack, ``Carmina Burana'' contributed to the
evolutionary cycle that has returned rhythm to the center of
Western musical experience.
</P>
<P>
   Orff, who died in 1982, was clearly influenced by contemporaries
interested in jazz, like Stravinsky, if not by jazz itself. He did
not intend, however, to capture the spirit of the changing world.
He sought to attain a timelessness that he sensed in early
composers like Monteverdi, and fabricated his own medieval chimera
to that end. Although it sounds very little like medieval music,
``Carmina Burana'' transports audiences to a dream of the past. For
all its fleshiness, the music feels fake because the world it
conjures never existed.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it suited to the film genres of fantasy,
action-adventure and horror. Whether it adds to the glamour of the
Arthurian knights or of rock's Lizard King, Jim Morrison (Oliver
Stone used elements of Ray Manzarek's rock version of the piece for
his soundtrack to his film ``The Doors,''), ``Carmina Burana's''
dynamic illusions help erase any thoughts of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy that ``Carmina Burana'' creates is the source of its
pleasures. But it, too, is more complicated than it first appears.
Orff's attraction to the primitive was linked to a quest for
purity, a troubling desire for an artist working in 1930s Germany.
The composer, who wrote music for the 1936 Olympics and worked in
Germany throughout World War II, shared certain artistic ideals
with the Nazis, all evident in ``Carmina Burana.'' Its monorhythmic
passages, rousing major-chord progressions and lyrical explorations
of a Bavarian Arcadia all fit the Nazi regime's model of art as a
conduit to an earlier epoch unblemished by the effects of
modernity, including racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of Nazism stains Orff's legacy. It is the main reason
the cantata was not performed in the United States until 20 years
after its debut. Is ``Carmina Burana'' an example of Nazi art? A
closer look reveals only more contradiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Orff never joined the Nazi Party, although he cooperated with it
to survive. For example, he accepted a commission to write a
replacement score for ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' by Mendelssohn,
whose work was banned because he had been Jewish. The initial Nazi
response to ``Carmina Burana'' was negative: officials condemned it
as pornographic and derivative of African-American styles. Orff
denied impure intentions, but as the decades have proved, the
work's eroticism and the rhythms that link it to rock lay at the
heart of its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond whatever conflicts emerge over copyright, the
reverberation of ``Carmina Burana'' through Nas' ``Hate Me Now''
sets one thing right. By linking Orff's work with hip-hop,
African-American culture's latest path to world dominance, ``Hate
Me Now'' has resurrected a latent spirit within this creature.
</P>
<P>
   The crashing tympanies of ``Carmina Burana'' will resonate as
long as rhythm itself continues to define this musical epoch,
connecting Africa to Europe and our own shores. That is not merely
some Gothic reverie; it is a truly universal sound.

   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ It was only a matter of minutes after
Sgt. 1st Class Mladen Fulir and the rest of his platoon from the
82nd Airborne Division clambered from Black Hawk helicopters when
the confusion and complexity of NATO's initial days of occupation
in Kosovo were cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a checkpoint on the road east of here, the Americans
first encountered a convoy of Yugoslavian military trucks, escorted
by a Russian armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Fulir let it pass, but he stopped a bus full of armed Serb
soldiers that came later, ordering them to hand over their weapons
or turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them the choice,'' said Fulir, a Croatian-born
paratrooper still fluent in Serbo-Croatian. And so they left, as
did another truck with three Serb soldiers that arrived at the
rural crossroads soon after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't give you my gun,'' one of the Serbs said teasingly as
he climbed back into the driver's seat, ``because you won't give it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of NATO's operation in Kosovo, U.S. ground
troops began to enter the province in force on Sunday, but their
progress was far from swift and their control over what will
ultimately become the American sector in southeast Kosovo was
anything but ironclad.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, there were supposed to be nearly 2,000 soldiers
and marines in Kosovo, but the heavy, rumbling convoys left their
bases in Macedonia late and bogged down on the road to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit
made it only as far the Stankovec 2 refugee camp north of
Macedonia's capital, Skopje, before receiving orders to stay at a
British base there for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders attributed the delays to traffic and the logistical
challenge of moving troops from several NATO allies along the
narrow road that wends its way through the mountainous border with
Kosovo, though German and Dutch forces continued to cross on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Yugoslav troops, still in Kosovo, intermingled with
the peacekeepers in convoys large and small, with soldiers waving
Serbian flags along with AK-47s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They almost seem happy,'' said Sgt. 1st Class John D. Tucker,
a platoon leader of a pair of Bradley armored combat vehicles
making its way to the checkpoint, which for now remains the core of
the American-controlled sector.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials here say the Yugoslav forces have, so
far, cooperated with the operation and kept their pledges to
withdraw. By Sunday evening the U.S. troops in Kosovo had
encountered no significant resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Each American going into Kosovo carries a blue card spelling out
the ``rules of engagement'' for whenever troops encounter soldiers
or civilians. The rules say they should use minimum force, only
when NATO forces are directly threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But in a province racked by warfare and ethnic hostilities and
full of weapons, NATO commanders are afraid encounters like those
at the checkpoint could quickly turn violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we get in there and look formidable and
professional for the community,'' Lt. Col. Bruce Gandy, the
commander of ground forces for the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit,
told officers preparing to send a force of 2,000 marines into
Kosovo early Sunday. ``If we do that, I think it has a capacity to
dissuade any hostile action.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Americans will ultimately control a sector from Urosevac
through Novo Brdo, taking over from French forces who arrived on
the first day. In the beginning the sector will be divided between
Army and marines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. forces began pouring across the border in Kosovo at
midday Sunday, led by the 82nd Airborne and tanks and other armored
vehicles from the 1st Armored Division. As they drove north, they
passed towns ravaged by President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign
against Kosovo's Albanian majority, including Kacanik, Gabrica and
Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of minefields laid by the Serbs were marked off with
yellow tape and warning signs. Along the road, there were also men
wearing uniforms of the Kosovo Liberation Army, as well as clusters
of refugees walking home, but otherwise the towns were deserted.
</P>
<P>
   The scene surprised Lt. Charles Hitchcock, commander of an M1-A1
Abrams tank. ``I didn't think everybody had left,'' he said.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina) _ Russian soldiers continued to occupy
Pristina airport Sunday, blocking the entry of British troops, in
an embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort.
While Clinton discussed the stalemate with Yeltsin by telephone,
British officers fumed in private that the place they had picked
for their headquarters had been confiscated by interlopers.
Commanders spent much of the day, without apparent success,
searching for an alternative location. There was no triumphal news
conference on the airport tarmac, as had been expected, by Gen.
Wesley Clark, the NATO commander. British paratroopers shot a Serb
policeman dead Sunday afternoon, after he fired gunshots near one
of their patrols. In Prizren, to the south, German troops came
under sniper fire, then killed a Serb as he tried to attack them in
a battered yellow car. Even as the peacekeepers began to enter
Pristina, departing Serbs torched Albanian houses and a mosque near
the city center. By John Kifner.

   HAIR-DRUGTEST (New Orleans) _ De La Salle High School, a
parochial school, is one of a handful of schools around the country
that tests for student drug use by taking hair samples. The testing
has been a big success at De La Salle, with parents almost
unanimously in favor of it. Now, two public school principals want
hair testing at their schools. The ACLU, among others, is opposed.

   MAALE GAMLA, Golan Heights _ After 20 years in this leafy,
peaceful farming collective, Yigal Kipnis has grown quite attached
to the view from his tree-shaded back porch _ terraced hills
undulating down to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand how hard it would be to give it up, a
home and a life built from scratch in a sparsely populated
wilderness area that Israel seized from Syria during the 1967
Arab-Israeli war and formally annexed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a civil engineer, Kipnis turned pioneer at the age of
28 when he and his wife, Mira, like thousands of other Israelis,
heeded their government's call to go forth and settle the Golan. It
was an adventure that became a life as they raised four children in
this 60-family collective, while Kipnis tended mango groves and
Mrs. Kipnis taught chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   But as Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak prepares to restart
negotiations with Syria, Kipnis, like many here, seems ready
intellectually, if not emotionally, to consider leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our political interests and our personal interests are at odds
here,'' Kipnis, 49, said. ``And I don't think we can put our
personal interests before the idea of a full peace with Syria. We
hold onto hope that those of us closer to the shores of the Galilee
will be able to stay. But even that is probably not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising many Israeli analysts, residents of the Golan Heights
voted overwhelmingly for Barak, even though he had stated clearly
his intention to move forward on peace with Syria. The possible
implications for them were clear, since most analysts say at least
partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights is a precondition for
peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But while no one wants to give up their home, many said they
voted not parochially but as Israelis, concerned about the nation
as a whole. In fact, the Third Way, the party whose single issue
was preserving the Golan, captured only 14.8 percent of the votes
in the Golan itself and, flaming out completely, lost all of its
four seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yehuda Harel, a Third Way founder who is now a former member of
parliament, said it was his party, and not the issue, that had
failed. ``A total collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Israelis as a whole have relegated the issue of the Golan
Heights to the back burner. It barely came up explicitly during the
campaign, as it did in the 1996 elections, when cars throughout the
country carried bumper stickers reading, ``The nation is with the
Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it arose only implicitly as the unspoken second half of
Barak's promise to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon within a
year. Since Syria effectively controls Lebanon, most _ but not all
_ analysts see a safe withdrawal from Lebanon as inevitably linked
to a withdrawal from the Golan, too.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis love the Golan, a beautiful area dotted with dairy
farms, fruit groves, waterfalls and ravines. If it were given up,
the Israelis would also lose their only ski slopes and one of their
few fine wineries.
</P>
<P>
   But eager to see a withdrawal from what is seen as a futile
conflict in Lebanon, where 25 to 30 Israeli soldiers die a year,
many Israelis try not to think too hard about the consequences for
the Golan. Polls show most expect the territory to be given up.
</P>
<P>
   Golan residents resent keenly the link with Lebanon _ even those
who understand it as a diplomatic reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're presenting us as responsible for the deaths in
Lebanon,'' said Orly Feldman, who manages the guest cottages at the
Merom HaGolan kibbutz. ``Instead of blaming the government for not
making a decision on withdrawing from Lebanon, people are blaming
us just for being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the settlers in the West Bank, the Golan settlers, who
number about 18,000, tend to be kibbutznik types. Most are secular
and center or left politically.
</P>
<P>
   A pioneering Zionist spirit drove the original settlers to
transform barren land. In the last 10 years, they have been joined
by thousands of Russian immigrants. Over time, they all have
coexisted with the tightknit Druse community of about 17,000, who
have remained loyal to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For years, although many Golan settlers believed in making peace
with the Palestinians, they were silent peace supporters because of
the inherent contradiction in their position. They did not support
peace negotiations with Syria, too.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a tranquil zone, free of the rocket attacks that
plague residents of the northern border with Lebanon, they
preferred the existing situation: no active hostilities, if no
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why rock the boat?'' Harel asked. ``We succeeded in making
something here that is a little better than Israel itself. I never
lock my home. The air is clean. We have a lot of very modern
agriculture and great wildlife. We live in peace with the Druse and
with the religious. We don't have Arabs or ultra-Orthodox, so we
don't have tensions _ except for the looming question of our
fate.''
</P>
<P>
   A historian and an iconoclastic politician, Harel, 64, spoke in
a cafe in Katzrin, the largest town in the Golan. He shared
cappuccino and pastry with Ramona Bar Lev, a longtime friend and
fellow Golan defender.
</P>
<P>
   Although his face is rippled with character and time, his eyes
twinkled and he did not wear his defeat with great melodrama.
Instead, he analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the electoral failure of the Third Way reflected
its constituents' disappointment with the fact that the Golan party
had joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way's larger failure, he said, was that, as a small
party, it had ended up marginalizing the issue of the Golan, which
is a national concern and not a special interest.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging, he said he had led a national mobilization on behalf
of the Golan more than once before and he would do so again, when
the time demands it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Harel and Mrs. Bar Lev said the election results were no
reflection on Israelis' concern about the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman's party got only a half percent, and no one says
that means Israel no longer believes in womankind,'' Harel said.
</P>
<P>
   They also discount a recent poll published in the Maariv
newspaper in which 42 percent of Golan residents surveyed said they
were prepared to leave in exchange for a full peace with Syria and
compensation from the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``People cannot say what they will do,'' Mrs. Bar Lev said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Golan residents think it is pointless to worry too
soon and shut out the political talk, assuming they have a future
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, we bury our dead here,'' said Mrs. Feldman,
the kibbutz hotel manager. ``What more can we say?''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``I can also add that the subject of leaving has
never come up with my husband or any of my four children. We're not
suppressing it on purpose. But if every two years we started making
evacuation plans, we'd drive ourselves nuts.''

</P>
<P>
   The Druse residents of the Golan _ Arabic speakers who belong to
a sect that is an offshoot of Islam _ do not know what to think
about the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   In Majdal Shams, the largest Druse town in the Golan, Syria lies
on the other side of a rusty chain-link fence that divides both the
town and families. For years, divided families have gathered on
either side to converse across a gulch with loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we will only be under Israeli rule for not
much longer,'' said Saleh Ibrahim, 23, a barber at the Salon
Majdal. ``But Barak, Netanyahu _ we don't trust any Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   His customer, Ramia Ibrahim, 19, said: ``If there's peace, Syria
will come. If not, they won't. Either way, we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Israelis held fast to the credo that the Golan,
from whose heights Syria had once repeatedly shelled Jewish
settlements, was essential for Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister
assassinated in 1995, and then Shimon Peres, his successor, first
began considering territorial concessions in the Golan, neither
Israelis nor Golan residents were ready to follow them. It seemed
too abrupt a shift in thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Under Netanyahu, official talks with Syria came to a halt,
although he has recently acknowledged holding private negotiations.
The Golan fell off the political map. But rising concern over
Israel's debilitating engagement in Lebanon has produced widening
support among Israeli politicians for the idea that trading land in
the Golan for peace would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Barak, a former general, in command, the public,
including Golan residents, seems more willing to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not do it in one minute, to change our focus,''
Kipnis said. ``But now we are ready to. It's not fair to say to the
people of Israel, `Don't make peace for Israel because we have a
personal problem with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kipnis said this wistfully, munching on corn on the cob in his
backyard. The personal problem, he added, belongs to his
generation, those who literally tilled the soil. His children, he
said, will move on, the way he moved on from his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Harel's Third Way party did leave behind one key contribution to
the cause: a law that calls for a referendum and a parliamentary
majority to approve an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Standing atop Mount Beltan, surrounded by schoolchildren
visiting an empty army bunker, Harel gazed down at the Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are years I say the Golan Heights is not for sure,'' he
said, smiling, ``and there are years I say it is not a lost
cause.''

QWEST MAKES   HOSTILE BID FOR U S WEST , ALSO SEEKS FRONTIER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Bermuda)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Making the brashest telecommunications move in years, Qwest
Communications International Inc., a young, high-flying
communications carrier, said Sunday that it was making a hostile
$55 billion bid to acquire U S West Inc., the old Baby Bell local
phone giant, and the Frontier Corp., one of the nation's biggest
long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest is trying to take U S West and Frontier, formerly
Rochester Telephone, away from one of its main rivals, Global
Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda. Like Qwest, Global Crossing has built a
billion-dollar business in recent years by exploiting the surging
worldwide demand for electronic communications.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, U S West agreed to merge with Global Crossing
in a stock deal that the company then valued at $37 billion.
Frontier agreed to be acquired by Global Crossing in March for
$10.8 billion in stock. Now Qwest wants to win them both.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Crossing-Qwest showdown is just the latest bombshell
in the telecommunications business, which has come to resemble the
railroad and steel industries of a century ago in its ruthless
dashes for assets and market share. For consumers, the whirlwind
means that the companies that deliver their communications links
with the world are changing faces even as they try to offer
integrated bundles of telephone and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the proposed acquisitions of U S West and Frontier, we
take the next logical step in accelerating our delivery of
Internet-based, broadband communications services to customers,''
said Joseph P. Nacchio, chairman and chief executive of Qwest. In a
statement, he said the proposed deal would create an ``Internet
communications powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming all parts of the deal are completed, Qwest said its
offer represented a 45.8 percent premium over U S West's stock
price on Friday and 35.3 percent over Frontier's stock price.
Global Crossing's stock price, and thus the value of its offer for
U S West, has declined since last month.
</P>
<P>
   Like the last big communications takeover fight, Worldcom's
brassy $36.5 billion victory over British Telecommunications and
GTE in 1997 to acquire MCI Communications, the No. 2 long-distance
carrier, this latest fight underscores the power of young,
fast-moving companies in the face of more sluggish seniors.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Qwest offer is a sign that deregulation and the
growth of the Internet are only accelerating the pace in the
telecommunications business. Worldcom got its start in the 1980s
and was still considered an upstart when it went after MCI, but
Qwest and Global Crossing did not even exist in their current forms
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest is controlled by Philip Anschutz, the reclusive Denver
tycoon, and emerged from Anschutz's takeover of the Southern
Pacific railroad in 1988. Qwest has used rights-of-way from the
railroad and others to build an advanced nationwide fiber optic
communications network. Global Crossing was founded a few years ago
by Gary Winnick, formerly an associate of the junk-bond financier
Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and is building an
international undersea fiber optic communications system.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have raised billions of dollars from investors
based on their founders' financial pedigrees and on their ambitious
business plans.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the most valuable communications asset in the world
probably remains the simple copper telephone wires that enter
almost every American home. U S West, which emerged from the
breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, controls millions of those wires. Global
Crossing and Qwest each covet that direct link with customers, even
though U S West is growing slower than the other Bells and even
though U S West's 14-state region includes many less-profitable
rural areas in the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 bars the
Baby Bells, including U S West, from selling long-distance services
such as those offered by Global Crossing until they convince
regulators that they have opened their local networks to
competitors. U S West is far away from winning any such case, which
could make the quest for U S West somewhat quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's offer would give U S West shareholders Qwest stock
valued at up to $80 for each of their shares. But if Qwest did not
also reach a deal with Frontier, the value would be cut to $78 in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest would also give Frontier shareholders $20 in cash and
stock valued at up to $55 for each of their shares. Again, if Qwest
did not also reach a deal with U S West, the value of the Frontier
deal would fall to $73 total for each share, from $75. Qwest would
also assume $11.4 billion in U S West and Frontier debt.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, shares of U S West closed at $54.875, up 56.25 cents
on the New York Stock Exchange, and Frontier's shares ended at
$55.4375, down 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's shares, meanwhile, rose $1 in Nasdaq trading, to close
at $44.875, and Global Crossing's shares ended at $50.75, up 25
cents.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether Global Crossing or Qwest wins U S West, the
combined company will not be allowed to sell long-distance
telephone or data service to U S West's current customers, at least
for now. That is somewhat deflating for Global Crossing, which,
through its deal for Frontier, has wanted to acquire a roughly $100
million long-distance business in U S West territory. But the
regulatory questions could be a concern for Qwest, which is in fact
based in Denver, the same city as U S West.
</P>
<P>
   But propelled by their hard-charging and well-respected chief
executives, both Qwest and Global Crossing seem to be betting that
they can stampede the regulators, that the issue can be finessed or
that U S West will win long-distance approval in the normal course
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global Crossing has described themselves as the wet Qwest,
Qwest under the ocean,'' Nacchio said in an interview, ``They have
aspirations to be like us but they're not. We've completed our
nationwide network. They have one cable under the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he expected to hear from U S West and Frontier
within a few days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is the personality and reputation of those chief executives,
Nacchio of Qwest and Robert Annunziata of Global Crossing, that
could well make the tangle over U S West more rancorous than the
recent fight over Mediaone between AT&AMP;T and the Comcast &UR;  &LR; Corp..
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and Comcast cut a deal that seemed to make everyone
somewhat happy, giving AT&AMP;T control of Mediaone and Comcast up to
two million new cable customers. It may be tougher for Qwest and
Global Crossing to strike a similar arrangement because Nacchio, a
former AT&AMP;T executive, and Annunziata, who built Teleport
Communications Group, one of the early competitors to the Bells in
local markets, both want to step into the ranks of the elite global
communications carriers.

   &LR; HOLMDEL, N.J. _ Basic black and power chords are constants in
heavy metal, and there was plenty of each at Ozzfest, the 16-band,
11-hour concert that appeared twice at PNC Bank Arts Center here.
</P>
<P>
   At Ozzy Osbourne's fourth annual summer roadshow _ featuring his
reunited original band, Black Sabbath _ songs about death, the
Devil, anger and rebelliousness were all good-time music for fans
who came to jump and howl along. Bands performed on the center's
main stage and on a smaller one in a field, where the size of the
dust cloud measured the enthusiasm in the mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   Only in heavy metal could a revived oldies act _ Black Sabbath
played songs from the late 1960s and early '70s _ headline a bill
of '80s and '90s bands without a significant generation gap. Metal
still serves its time-honored purposes: venting defiance, repelling
adult authority and, in its lyrics, examining issues of power,
death, faith and identity that other pop glosses over.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ozzfest reveals that current metal is a many-splintered
thing. Speed-metal knocked down barriers between heavy metal and
hard-core punk in the 1980s, and the pure, whipsawing impact of
guitars, drums and bass was in exhilarating form with Slayer, whose
songs are physiologically engineered to provide a testosterone
rush. Growled lyrics about mayhem, hammering one-chord stretches
topped by streaking lead guitar, and pauses for fist-pumping
between tempo changes felt like a combination of a massage and a
motorcycle chase.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s metal has been learning from hip-hop, alternative
rock and dance music. Hybrids were everywhere at Ozzfest. System of
a Down played the day's most volatile music: vocals that jumped
from howl to screech, riffs that suddenly switched from stomp to
dirge to nagging repetition to pummel, and a midset rant about the
politics of bombing Yugoslavia. Hed(pe) segued bratty Cypress
Hill-style rapping into its metal growl, with funk and reggae
syncopation in its guitars.
</P>
<P>
   The Deftones, drawing from alternative rock, set sustained
melodies against a hard-riffing onslaught, like troubled lullabies
during an earthquake, though the songs seemed amorphous and
self-indulgent onstage. Primus, a band enthralled by its own
cleverness, played dumbed-down songs with musicianly filigrees, not
realizing that a cliche played with a smirk is still a cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Drum machines and synthesizers helped to drive Static-X,
Apartment 26 and the more impressive Fear Factory, who merge hard
core's righteous fury with industrial rock's mechanistic drive. Rob
Zombie's B-movie-inspired songs combine a heavy-metal stomp with a
steady dance-music thump; he had the day's theatrical extravaganza,
with makeup, a flashing ``666'' sign, go-go girls and puffs of
flame. Slipknot, from Des Moines, accessorized basic songs by
performing in red jumpsuits and clown and ghoul masks.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzfest '99 offered a hint of diversity amid the overwhelmingly
male and white performers. The day's first set was by Drain S.T.H.,
a female hard-rock band from Stockholm. The tour lineup also
included Puya, which raps and growls its lyrics in Spanish and
layers conga drumming, horn-section lines and mambo rhythms amid
thrashing guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Ozzfest bands are all descendants of Black Sabbath. The
way Tommy Iommi on guitar, Geezer Butler on bass and Bill Ward on
drum slammed out slow riffs _ guitar and bass in unison, drums
thudding and rumbling _ and then shifted into double time was a
revelation that rock has never outgrown. The same tactics, as
updated by Metallica, were used at Ozzfest by Godsmack, Pushmonkeys
and Flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night Osbourne's voice was a wreck; he said he had
suffered three broken ribs from a fan's bear hug earlier this week.
So Black Sabbath featured Iommi on guitar, making each riff
adamantine and turning each tempo shift into an upheaval. His
lead-guitar solos went into stretches of triplets and Blues 101
squiggles.
</P>
<P>
   But Black Sabbath earned its legacy by realizing it was no
longer a second-rate blues-rock band, but a monolithic riff
builder. Its original lineup made those riffs resonate while the
crowd yelled all the lyrics it knew.

SINGERS WHOSE ART TRANSCENDS THE SONGS THEY SING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wasn't it Barry Manilow who crooned ``I am music, and I write
the songs''? What a terrible thought. If music had meant well by
us, surely he or she or it would not have chosen that particular
mouthpiece; surely music would have wanted us to have better songs
and better singers.
</P>
<P>
   Every age deifies certain kinds of talent, and ours pays too
much obeisance to singer-songwriters, our modern troubadours. It's
pretty hard to be good at both, especially since so many singers
insist on writing their music  &UR; and  &LR; their lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   People devoted to performing nothing but their own work can grow
very tiresome unless they are quite extraordinary. What's the best
test of singer-songwriters once we've grown accustomed to their
lure as performers? When and whether other singers perform their
work, I think, and whether that work changes over the years.
</P>
<P>
   If you're singing all your own songs, you're writing to the
contours of your own voice and the limits, not just the strengths,
of your temperament. It's a great thing to be able to write for
other voices, to tell stories and distill emotions not your own.
</P>
<P>
   Singers are never merely interpreters of other people's music
unless they are dull, dumb or derivative. There are too many ways
(still) to work with, through and past a lyric, too many ways
(being discovered or rediscovered) to use one's voice without the
aid of conventional language, drawing on sounds, syllables,
overtones, microtones and all kinds of breath patterns.
</P>
<P>
   So let us take two recent recordings and treat them as case
studies in interpretation and composition.
</P>
<P>
   _ `THE GOSPEL SOUL OF MARION WILLIAMS' (Shanachie Spirit Feel):
Marion Williams sang gospel music and nothing else all her life.
(She died in 1994 at 67, having received a MacArthur grant and a
Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievement in her last years.)
The gospel repertory is filled with spare and simple Anglo-American
hymns and with African-American songs derived from spirituals and
revival meetings, with some blues and jazz infusions. Elaboration
and improvisation are a must.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was a fierce and potent soprano who could sing at any
tempo: a furious syncopated march, a pure adagio, a pulsing blues.
And when she sang a capella, she knew that, rather than being
released from what the other instruments did, she had become
responsible for what they did. Her timing on ``Sit Down Servant''
was as taut as any drummer's, and she picked her notes so that you
hear the harmonies as well as the melody.
</P>
<P>
   She could growl like a man, a fact that always reminds of the
line in Bessie Smith's ``Black Mountain Blues,'' ``All the birds
sing bass.'' (Gospel thrives on these transgender vocalizings.) The
blues tonalities on songs like ``Savior, Don't Pass Me By'' are
gorgeous and feel invented on the spot, not dutifully inserted.
(Stylistic dutifulness is the bane of much contemporary blues
singing.)
</P>
<P>
   All the material of great blues and gospel singing, so abused by
soul singers today, is here: the varied timbres, the breath as a
musical device, the well-tempered moans and slides, the melisma
used discreetly, not as a substitute for true pitch or true
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   She was a great singer. And this wasn't just because of her
amazing technique. (She could go overboard with it at times.) It
was because of her emotional resources. ``Just a Closer Walk With
Thee'' is an old song that has lived through many renditions. They
all fell away when I heard Williams sing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ CASSANDRA WILSON, `TRAVELING MILES' (Blue Note): Here is a
best-selling album by a wonderfully astute young singer with a
voice that quickens your senses instantly: low and lustrous, but
slightly overcast. ``Traveling Miles'' is a homage to Miles Davis.
It contains Ms. Wilson's reinventions of songs Davis wrote (like
``Blue in Green''), collaborated on (like ``Seven Steps'') or did
celebrated versions of (Wayne Shorter's ``ESP,'' Cyndi Lauper's
``Time After Time'' and Snow White's ``Someday My Prince Will
Come'' by Frank E. Churchill and Larry Morey).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson has written lyrics for the Davis instrumentals, and
she has written lyrics or both music and lyrics for five additional
songs. I went to a concert at Lincoln Center last winter that Ms.
Wilson devoted to Davis, and I was enthralled. The same gifts are
on this album: the way she plays with meter, her delicate tonal
shifts, the unpredictable but unforced phrasing, the harmonic
sophistication joined to an easy, bluesy swing.
</P>
<P>
   But this album satisfies me much less than the concert did, and
that's because I do not find Ms. Wilson an interesting songwriter.
The song of hers that works best, ``When the Sun Goes Down,'' is
the song closest to a traditional blues. And her best lyrics, for
Davis' ``Run the Voodoo Down,'' are also drawn from the
well-stocked living library of blues imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Her songs _ and this is true on other albums, too, like ``New
Moon Daughter'' _ dissipate into wispy melodies and too-pretty
musings. But the tepid melody and too-pretty words of ``Someday My
Prince Will Come'' arouse her critical and creative instincts, and
the tension between the song and her twangy, restless arrangement
makes it alive and emotionally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is very hard to be a truly exceptional singer right
now. There is so much material around you can make every kind of
mistake. Ms. Wilson's choices are always interesting, though; they
include the Monkees, Joni Mitchell, Robert Johnson and musical
theater songwriters from Irving Berlin to Lerner and Loewe. There
are so many styles and techniques, too _ jazz, rock, all the
highways and byways of new music and world music _ that it requires
enormous taste, technique and imagination to choose songs that you
can make yours in a way that has depth as well as flash.
</P>
<P>
   Fine songwriters and fine singers are collaborators. Less than
fine songwriters ought to fall on their knees and pray that a
creative singer will take what they've done and make it up all over
again. At its best, interpretation is revelation. Why should
singers or listeners settle for less?

 &HT;    DAY TWO OF NATO TAKE-OVER IN KOSOVO GETS HARDER, MORE DANGEROUS
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-ALBANIANS; KOSOVO-STANDOFF.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Keeping the peace in Kosovo got harder
and more dangerous for NATO troops Sunday, as British soldiers shot
and killed a civilian Serb who fired on them here in the provincial
capital, and German troops in the second city of Prizren killed a
sniper after several contentious standoffs with Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   NATO finally retreated from its effort to set up headquarters at
the crucial Pristina airport here, after a Russian contingent that
is supposed to be part of the Kosovo Force, or KFOR, raised a
day-long barricade to keep the NATO troops out.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-Russia embroglio carries weighty long-term consequences
-- radio Belgrade today suggested it signalled the start of a new
cold war -- but the killing of an armed Serb man who fired on NATO
troops caused an immediate uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The man, reported to be a reserve policeman, came up to a
British patrol and began opening fire with a pistol. The British
paratroopers warned him to stop, then returned fire when he failed
to do so, according to a NATO military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They followed the rules of engagement,'' he said, since they
were shooting in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the growing tension was a request by Serb
journalists that NATO supply armed guards to escort them home to
Belgrade, out of fear trigger-happy allied troops or armed Kosovar
Albanians may shoot at them.
</P>
<P>
   More strain came as news circulated of three dead bodies found
in northern Prizren Sunday, according to Capt. Gareth Light of the
Irish Guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assessed it to be a reprisal attack,'' he said, suggesting
the likely assailants were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the ethnic Albanian guerrilla group that mounted the fight for
Kosovo independence from Yugoslavia. Two of the dead were Yugoslav
army troops.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 5,000 German NATO troops -- whose sector includes
Prizren, the province's second-largest city -- also ran into
resistance Sunday; first when they ordered Serb troops at the
border with Albania to begin withdrawing. The Germans set a
half-hour deadline, which the Serb-led Yugoslav troops
unsuccessfully tried to extend to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The border units did leave as demanded, but when German forces
got into the city they faced off against a line-up of Serb
paramilitary forces trying to approach the city.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides faced each other a few feet apart while a German
commander talked to a Serb who was wore a black bandana wrapped
around his head.
</P>
<P>
   To the cheers of a crowd close by on the sidewalks, the Serbs
backtracked keeping their rifles ready and eyes toward the Germans.
A few traded curses with the ethnic Albanians taunting them and
relishing the humiliation of their former tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The German NATO troops struggled to control the tensions in a
region where, according to German Gen. Fritz von Korf, there were
still 3,000 Serb troops. They are not required to withdraw from the
area until Tuesday and the Germans acknowledged the difficulties in
trying to keep the peace between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a period when you have flowers on one side and hatred on
the other,'' German Gen. Helmut Harff said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, a Serb military sniper was shot dead after firing
into the air and threatening ethnic Albanians. A German soldier
also was reported wounded in the exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that a Serb man was killed by the Germans when he
was apparently threatening to shoot at them. One German soldier was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb troops and paramilitary had continued setting up
roadblocks despite that being a violation of the agreement with
NATO. German troops said they were having trouble figuring ways for
the Serb troops to withdraw so they would not come into
confrontation with ethnic Albanians. Also, they said Serbs were
still looting and burning Albanian homes.
</P>
<P>
   Unidentified men opened fire on a car carrying two German
journalists, killing both of them, the German Foreign Ministry in
Bonn reported.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jean Morissette, a Canadian military spokesman in Ottawa,
confirmed that a Canadian reconnaissance unit went to the aid of
two German journalists about 25 miles south of Pristina. There were
no other immediate details.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 to 150 U.S. Army soldiers in armored vehicles crossed
into Kosovo at Blace, Macedonia, in the first significant U.S.
force to join 5,000 NATO peacekeepers already in the province.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the Russians who lined up against NATO did not make
a retreat when tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops who suddenly appeared here before daybreak
Saturday continued blockading the airport with an armored personnel
carrier and armed troops who were joined at the line of
confrontation by Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   First the Russians turned back a French convoy Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission was to deploy at the fuel bulk depot at the
Pristina airport,'' said the French officer leading the convoy, who
refused to identify himself. ``When we arrived half an hour ago, we
saw Russians and Serbians and they said we cannot enter.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Russians nor the Serbs would talk to correspondents
about why they were refusing to let NATO forces enter the airport
they had been planning to use as KFOR headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ordered to do it,'' said one burly Russian officer.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sunday afternoon a British contingent made another go at
getting through the barrier, but they, too, were rebuffed. While
the confrontation was underway, the Russian troops brought a second
armored carrier as reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the day, KFOR commander British Lt. Gen. Sir
Michael Jackson apparently decided to cut his losses to avoid a
more serious conflict with the Russians and found another locale
for his headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton, in an
hour-long telephone conversation Sunday, agreed their generals
should work out details for the first 200 or so Russian soldiers
already in Kosovo while talks continue on command arrangements for
a larger Russian contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unable or unwilling to
save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see Russian
troops as their protectors. Those fears have sent Serb civilians
fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 8,000 Serb civilians arrived in neighboring
Montenegro early Sunday, leaving Kosovo ahead of NATO peacekeeping
troops, police said. An additional 2,000 were expected to arrive
Sunday, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday also brought some easier moments for NATO, as it began
deploying tank units throughout the city and continued getting
thanks and good wishes from ethnic Albanians who have been cooped
in their houses for much of the time since late March. That was
when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began, and when the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav government intensified its zealous ethnic
cleansing campaign to decimate the Albanians' 90-percent majority
in Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every NATO tank seen on Pristina's streets wore bunches
of flowers tossed by grateful Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the flowers to the NATO troops,'' said Fidoni
Shala, 10, who was carrying a handful of roses to a tank Sunday
morning. ``We want to say thank you for coming here to protect
us.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces did seem to be gaining in their effort to replace
Yugoslav troops here and secure the city as KFOR headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The main road into the southern outskirts of Pristina was well
guarded by evening, and tanks were in place throughout the city
center that apparently will be the transit route for troops fanning
out to more northern parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is ``to guarantee mobility to friendly forces,'' said
Capt. Light, who was coordinating movements of dozens of units from
the top of a tank parked just south of the city center.
</P>
<P>
   He said Yugoslav military have given fewer problems than he
expected, and were engaged in withdrawal from Kosovo as required by
the agreement Yugoslav generals signed late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't contravened anything so far,'' said Light. ``But
they're not very happy to have us here at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   More fires apparently set by departing Yugoslav forces sent
columns of smoke into the skies over Pristina and suburban villages
throughout the day. Another constant billow of smoke came from the
central police station, where documents not being burned were flung
out the window into a guarded courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were lined up at routes out of the city, bags at their
side, hitching rides back home. They may have been reservists like
a soldier who identified himself only as ``Draga'' and said he was
glad to be getting out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be OK now,'' he said, as a friend gave him a
lift back home to Urosevac and his technical school classes.

MARKETERS BET ON `AUSTIN POWERS' TO ENDEAR THEM TO THE YOUNG
</HEADLINE>
   (With AUSTIN-POWERS) 
(nk) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The magazine ad features comedian Mike Myers as the British
spy-a-go-go, Austin Powers. He is lounging in a royal blue satin
robe with a milk-filled martini glass in hand and a milk mustache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milk keeps my bones strong,'' says the advertisement for the
National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board, ``so I can keep my
mojo working overtime. Oh, behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Behave, indeed. As the international man of mystery himself
might say, what's going on with the sexy advertising, baby?
</P>
<P>
   With the release last week of New Line Cinema's ``Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' a rush of promotional tie-ins has
arrived. That is no surprise, since the original Austin Powers film
from 1997 has developed an almost cult-like following among that
most elusive of advertising audiences _ young people.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable is that some fairly mainstream marketers are
running advertising that might make some viewers blush. And
apparently, they can get away with it because it is all part of the
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spoof,'' said Jay Schulberg, vice chairman and chief
creative officer at Bozell Worldwide in New York, part of True
North Communications, which created the milk board's ad. ``He's a
lovable rogue. We are very careful about who we use in advertising,
and there is no one who we'll use that is offensive to any segment
of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are willing to take a calculated risk with an
on-the-fringe character in order to reach their target audience,
Jack Trout, a Greenwich, Conn.-based marketing consultant, said.
Linking with Austin Powers is corporate America's attempt to be
seen as cool in the eyes of the youth market. It is hipness by
association, Trout said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an in-joke and it's only in among the crowd they want to
talk to,'' Trout said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the film's title has a bit of the in-joke about it. In
England, the slang word ``shag'' is blatantly sexual, and its
American counterpart would never be used in mainstream advertising.
Nevertheless, it is being played up in a big way in ads here.
Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic has renamed one of its airplanes the
Shaglantic. Cadbury-Schweppes PLC, the maker of Mott's fruit juices
and apple sauce, is introducing Shagadelic Shakers, ready-made
cocktail mixers in bar-like shakers. The last Mott's film tie-in
was with ``Rugrats: The Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The British are aghast at the use of word,'' said Don
Moriarty, managing director of CMG Communications in New York,
Virgin Atlantic's ad agency. ``But here, it's much more vague. It's
more suggestive than literal.''
</P>
<P>
   Heineken USA said it was ``very cognizant and had substantial
discussions'' about use of the word, but decided it was acceptable
because it was a send-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Myers' appeal is naughtiness, but it's good clean fun,''
a Heineken USA spokesman, Dan Tearno, said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads play up Austin Powers' comical penchant for sexual
innuendo and double entendre, which is all part of the film comedy
about a mod 1960s spy who is ``cryogenically'' unfrozen in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Take the billboard for Virgin Atlantic Airways, which has Powers
announcing a new fifth flight daily from New York to London. ``Five
times a day,'' says the headline. ``Yeah, baby.'' And then there is
the Heineken commercial, which shows a beautiful woman giving
Powers a massage when she stops suddenly. ``Why'd you stop?'' he
asks. ``I was admiring your Heiney,'' the woman responds, and the
spot quickly cuts to a bottle of the imported beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to use a property, you have to be true to
it,'' said the head of Heineken's agency, Lee Garfinkel, chairman
and chief creative officer of Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York, part
of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   New Line saw long before the latest film release that it had a
hot property in Austin Powers and approached promotional partners,
marketers said. But Mott's sought out New Line independently, after
developing the retro cocktail mixers, when a marketing executive
saw the Austin Powers promotional materials at last year's
licensing show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the big `ta-da,''' the executive, Mike Judlowe, said.
``It is everything we were trying for: to be younger, to take
advantage of the retro trend, to be fun and naughty. You couldn't
dream up a fit like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Virgin jumped on the opportunity as part of its campaign to
become known for its London destination, and also because, like
Austin Powers, the quirky airline and its impish owner, Richard
Branson, are known for ``serious fun,'' Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin was also aware of the growing underground popularity of
the original Austin Powers film. The film's phrases are now so much
a part of the American lexicon that phrases like ``Yeah, baby'' and
``Oh, behave'' are seen on placards at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it becomes part of the culture, it becomes sort of
de-sexed,'' said Barbara Lippert, advertising critic for the trade
publication Adweek in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lippert said the advertising tie-ins were appropriate and
did fit. ``The whole thing is aimed at the sensibility of a
12-year-old boy and that's who advertisers want to reach, even if
that 12-year-old is 24,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the milk board came by Myers because he spoofed
its milk mustache campaign in the first film without its
permission, Schulberg said. Now, it is using him to reach young
people, one of its four key audience segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you have very targeted marketing _ everything is sliced
and diced,'' Schulberg said. ``It's the same with the movie _ he's
going after a very specific niche and it's totally appropriate for
that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a writer and co-producer of the film, was involved in
much of the advertising, the agency executives said. He went on
shoots, did radio voiceovers and signed off on the final product.
In one instance, he outright rejected a Virgin ad that he
considered ``over the line,'' Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very conscious of where the line is and not going over
it,'' Moriarty said. ``Once you go over the line, it ceases to be
funny.''

SERB WITHDRAWAL IS MONITORED FROM THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE JSTARS SURVEILLANCE PLANE OVER ALBANIA _ Almost as
soon as their battery of radar screens locked onto Kosovo shortly
after dawn on Saturday, it was obvious to everybody here that the
Yugoslav forces were on the run.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors told the story in Technicolor: a stream of magenta
and yellow dots _ representing vehicles ranging from tractors and
trucks to tanks _ inched along Highway 17 and Highway 11 through
the Kosovo capital, Pristina, and north toward the province's
border with the rest of Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Both roads are NATO-approved retreat routes for the Yugoslav
forces, but they had been almost empty just on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as NATO troops moved into Kosovo for the first
time, the team of Air Force and Army technicians watched the
minute-by-minute progress of convoys that stretched as far as 20
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like day and night,'' said Indy, one of this flight's
two senior directors, who like other crew members would identify
himself only by his nickname. He studied some of the 18 computer
screens on this rebuilt Boeing 707. ``If we had seen this the last
time, we would have sent aircraft in immediately. It would have
been a turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   This aging airplane carries the U.S. Air Force's newest and most
advanced system for watching enemy troops from the air. The system
has assumed a key role in picking targets and monitoring the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There are clear limits to how much can actually be seen from
this distance. The radar system tries to distinguish between tanks
and ordinary trucks, but its guesses are often incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women in this plane are miles from the combat zone,
generally out of range of missile attacks and protected by a shield
of fighter jets. Yet as they crouched before their screens in the
darkened fuselage, they followed the humblest movement on the
ground with an almost haunting degree of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   They scrutinized a small caravan of trucks that had wandered off
the main highway. They zoomed in on the areas where Serbian forces
are allowed to congregate before leaving. They watched as NATO
vehicles moved north from neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is information warfare,'' said Kujo, the flight's other
senior director. ``The key to success for troops on the ground has
always been the ability to look over the next hill, and this takes
it to a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Though used experimentally during the Persian Gulf war, the
Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Systems are still so new
that the Air Force and Army have only four of them worldwide _ two
of them now in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its better-known predecessor, the Airborne Warning and
Control System, or AWACS, this system was designed to scrutinize
events on the ground over a wide geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   The radar aboard this plane, housed in a canoe-shaped hull on
the bottom of the fuselage, can see all of Kosovo in one view. It
can also zoom in on scores of small patches simultaneously, serving
up images demanded by the on-board technicians as well as requests
from commanders at the Combined Air Operations Center in Vicenza,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Jstar planes fly some of the longest missions of any
aircraft used in the Balkans. A typical flight lasts more than 17
hours, and the longest mission so far lasted 21 hours. All flights
require two midair refuelings as well as backup pilots and crew
members. Takeoff is usually before dawn from Rhine-Main Air Force
Base in Frankfurt, Germany. Given the preparation beforehand and
the debriefings afterward, crew members routinely work 24 hours
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Once in position, they transmit not only images but analytical
reports all day long. Ken, a burly technician sitting next to the
senior leader, banged out hourly reports describing scores of
activities along all the Serbs' approved ``egress routes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the very rear of the plane, a small group of Army technicians
ran their searches on behalf of ground forces in Macedonia.
Specially equipped Humvees allow Army units to receive the full
stream of Jstar images and radar mapping and to convey information
requests to the plane.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the dramatic movements back toward northern Yugoslavia
were Saturday's big news, much of the effort here was to spot
unusual or quirky behavior that might be a tipoff to unexpected
problems.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Indy had locked the system onto a curious parade of
trucks, nine big ones and six small ones, that were traveling well
wide of the authorized road between Prizren and Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Though heading parallel to the approved road, it was wandering
suspiciously. Indy instructed the system to take a close look every
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to watch the main roads,'' said Indy. ``But really
good surveillance, I think, comes from looking for things that
don't seem quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many weapons in this war, the Jstar missions embody a
curious blend of extremely advanced technology mounted on almost
shockingly old equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, the Pentagon decided to build the Jstars
surveillance system into 35-year-old Boeing 707s. This one, Kujo
said, had been a cargo plane for the Australian airline Qantas.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials say this decision made good sense, because
the 707s remain reliable workhorses.
</P>
<P>
   The system, including the plane, cost about $250 million,
officials said, but one commander on the ground said, ``Buy a radar
and get the plane for free.''
</P>
<P>
   But the creakiness of this plane became apparent. Fumes,
probably from the plane's overloaded air-conditioning system,
required the entire crew to strap on oxygen masks twice on
Saturday. To solve the problem, the aircraft commander shut off all
extra electricity for the last hour of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real heroes in this are the maintenance guys,'' a crew
member said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the headaches, the Jstar has become immensely popular
with NATO commanders and even with fighter pilots who were once
dubious about accepting guidance from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war started, people didn't know quite what to do with
us,'' said Indy. ``But after they started getting our flow of data,
they wanted more and more sorties. The biggest problem now is that
we can't fill all the demand.''

PHO, VIETNAM'S NATIONAL DISH, STIRS UP WARM MEMORIES OF SOOTHING
SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nothing recalls home for me quite like a steaming bowl
of pho.
</P>
<P>
   Fragrant and comforting, this Vietnamese beef noodle soup is
made from a stock of slow-simmered beef bones.
</P>
<P>
   Rice noodles are topped with thin slices of raw beef and choice
meats, ladled with steaming broth, then garnished with a medley of
crisp bean sprouts, sprigs of sweet basil, slices of green chili
and a squeeze of lime.
</P>
<P>
   The national dish of Vietnam, it is the one meal I must have
when I find myself in an unfamiliar place.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese get sentimental, even giddy, when it comes to
pho, and I count myself among the most egregious offenders. Indulge
in this delicate soup on a weary day and it is easy to see why
poems have been penned in its honor.
</P>
<P>
   Pho is a part of my pysche even though I spent most of my life
in the United States. (I was born in Saigon, but my family
immigrated to the United States in 1975 when I was almost 4).
</P>
<P>
   Pho (pronounced ``fuh'') sustained me through blustery winter
days in Chicago. It offset stress during graduate school in
Michigan. Eaten in a run-down, questionable shop in Munich, it was
a salve for homesickness. Short of curing heartaches, pho has done
much to alleviate disappointments over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the one meal that cements my family _ more than any
fat-breasted turkey on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I visit my family in San Jose, Calif., where pho shops
abound, we religiously pile into the car and drive straight to our
favorite restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   We order from memory. The bowls arrive, crowding every inch of
the table, and a silence ensues as we perform the ritual of
seasoning the soup with herbs and condiments.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, squeeze of lime, touch of hoisin sauce, a bit of
Sriracha chili sauce. Handful of raw bean sprouts. Pluck of basil
leaves and other herbs. A slice of green hot pepper for spiciness.
</P>
<P>
   These days I seek out pho for the joys of slurping bowls so
large they're dubbed ``train-sized'' in Vietnamese. I also seek it
for the associations with family, culture and my mom's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I still negotiate the lines between my two cultures with
clumsiness and uncertainty, but put a bowl of pho and a glass of
iced coffee in front of me and there is little doubt about who I
am: Vietnamese to the core.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants now make pho so efficiently and cheaply that fewer
and fewer people feel the need to cook it at home.
</P>
<P>
   My mom never taught me or my older sister how to make pho, but
we learned enough from watching her on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up, I awoke most Saturday mornings to the sweet
smells of her pho simmering on the stove. My mom already had
returned from the Asian market with a bag of beef neck or shank
bones and prepared the stock.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping careful watch over it, she dispensed tip after
cooking tip.
</P>
<P>
   She raved about a market where rice noodles were made fresh
daily, or told me to freeze the beef so it is easier to slice. Be
sure to clean the bones, she said, and don't let the broth boil too
much or the anise may break.
</P>
<P>
   Those tidbits stay with me now, despite my ambivalence to them
back then.
</P>
<P>
   My mom never kept a recipe. The process was ingrained in her
mind, taking root there by watching her own mother cook pho in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   I made pho for the first time on a bitingly cold day in Ann
Arbor, Mich., when I couldn't bear to drive the hour to the nearest
restaurant and couldn't endure my craving.
</P>
<P>
   Several Vietnamese friends and I gathered in one friend's
kitchen that afternoon and recalled how our mothers prepared pho.
We fumbled with the measurements; one friend phoned her mother to
beg step-by-step instructions.
</P>
<P>
   As we cooked pho that day, mimicking our mothers' gestures, we
swapped childhood stories and wistfully recreated our homes.
</P>
<P>
   Then we sat down and slurped.

SIMMERING FOR HOURS ESSENTIAL FOR THE BEST PHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pho begins with beef bones, extracting its flavor during several
hours simmering with onions, ginger and star anise.
</P>
<P>
   Star anise is a star-shaped, brown, slightly bitter pod that
gives pho its unusual fragrance. Store-bought fish sauce (nuoc mam)
adds flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The broth is simmered for several hours. Packaged rice noodles
are boiled, drained and topped with slices of raw beef that cook
and curl in the bowl once steaming broth is ladled on top.
</P>
<P>
   A tangle of fresh basil, bean sprouts and green chili peppers
make the soup a savory, healthy meal. Or try lime wedges, fresh
sprigs of cilantro and, for pungency, Asian basil (smaller and with
more of a licorice flavor than its Western counterpart).
</P>
<P>
   Several Asian supermarkets in Seattle's International District
stock these ingredients. Some sell packaged, ready-made pho, or
pho-flavoring for the broth.
</P>
<P>
   You should also have a jar of dark sweet hoisin sauce and a
squeeze bottle of Vietnamese chili sauce. Mix them together to make
a dipping sauce for the meat.
</P>
<P>
   A splash of the fish sauce _ a condiment made from pickled
anchovies _ is optional, taking the place of salt.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe takes some shortcuts or makes slight
adjustments to the ``traditional'' method of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Pho
</P>
<P>
   (Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup)
</P>
<P>
   For Pho:
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces rice sticks
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions, white part minced, green part finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 cups beef stock (preferably homemade)
</P>
<P>
   6 thin slices fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar or to taste
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter cup fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces beef tenderloin or sirloin, partially frozen
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-size white sweet onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   12 fresh Thai or regular basil leaves, thinly slivered
</P>
<P>
   For Vegetable Platter:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh mung bean sprouts
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2 jalapeno or serrano chilies, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 limes, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   Hoisin sauce and Vietnamese chili sauce for serving
</P>
<P>
   To prepare Pho, soak rice sticks in cold water until soft and
pliable, 30 minutes. Combine white part of green onions, beef
stock, ginger, star anise, cinnamon, brown sugar and fish sauce in
large pot and simmer until well flavored, 10 minutes. With slotted
spoon, remove star anise, cinnamon and ginger and discard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, slice beef across grain as thinly as possible. (This
works best if meat is partially frozen. It's even easier if you
have a meat slicer.)
</P>
<P>
   To prepare Vegetable Platter, arrange sprouts, mint, cilantro,
chilies and lime wedges on platter.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, bring broth to boil. Add rice sticks and
simmer until soft, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in beef and remove pan from
heat. (The heat of the broth should be sufficient to cook the meat.
If not, cook until beef is done.) Stir in onion slices. Ladle soup
into bowls. Garnish each bowl with shredded basil and chopped onion
greens. Serve at once with Vegetable Platter on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Have diners add bean sprouts, mint and cilantro, chilies and
lime juice to their soup to suit their taste. Mix equal parts
hoisin sauce and chili sauce in small dish and use mixture as dip
for beef.
</P>
<P>
   Makes four servings.
</P>
<P>
   Rice sticks are noodles made from pureed cooked rice, ranging in
size up to one-half inch in width. (I prefer one-quarter-inch-wide
noodles for this soup.) They can be found at Asian markets, gourmet
shops or in the Asian food section of most supermarkets. If
unavailable, in a pinch you could make this soup with conventional
wheat noodles.

</P>
<P>
   Shrimp Spring Rolls
</P>
<P>
   (Goi Cuon)
</P>
<P>
   with dipping sauce
</P>
<P>
   1cup (approximate) vermicelli rice noodles
</P>
<P>
   8 to 12 medium shrimp
</P>
<P>
   4 sheets rice paper, 8 to 10 inches in diameter
</P>
<P>
   4 lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   20 or more mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch cilantro sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Soak the rice noodles in hot water for about 15 to 20 minutes or
until soft. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile boil the shrimp for several minutes until just pink,
then peel and slice in half lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   Gather all ingredients in the same area to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   Moisten the rice paper by soaking it in a bowl of hot water for
20 seconds or until softened. Place the rice paper on a plate and
let dry slightly before working with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the rice paper, place 2 or 3 shrimp. Try to
form a neat 3-inch row. Add a quarter of the noodles, some lettuce,
mint leaves and a few cilantro sprigs. Do not overfill. Roll up the
rice paper (like a burrito), trying to keep the contents inside
fairly tight as you roll.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat the steps. Makes four rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Spicy Dipping Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 small garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter teaspoon red (serrano) chili peppers, seeded and
minced
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons nuoc mam (fish sauce)
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients. Test and adjust to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese style iced coffee
</P>
<P>
   (Ca phe sua da)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dark-roast coffee
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sweet condensed milk
</P>
<P>
   Ice cubes to fill an 8-ounce glass
</P>
<P>
   Strong dark-roast coffee is brewed in a stainless steel
percolater that rests on the coffee cup. Buy the coffee and
individual percolaters in any Vietnamese market.
</P>
<P>
   Place the milk in the bottom of a coffee cup. Place coffee
grounds in the coffee press and screw lid. Rest the percolater on
top of the cup and pour boiling water into it. It will take about
10 minutes to drip through.
</P>
<P>
   Can be served hot or cold.
</P>
<P>
   For iced coffee, fill a separate glass with ice cubes. Once the
coffee drips through, stir the coffee and milk in the cup and then
pour into the glass of ice and stir again.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Russian soldiers occupying Pristina's
airport blocked the entry of British troops Sunday in an
embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton discussed the stalemate with his Russian
counterpart, Boris Yeltsin, by telephone, British officers fumed in
private that the place they had picked for their headquarters had,
in effect, been confiscated. Commanders spent much of the day,
without apparent success, searching for an alternative location.
There was no triumphal news conference on the airport tarmac, as
had been expected, by Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overwhelming might of seemingly endless columns of
NATO soldiers and machines spreading out through the battered
province, it was a somewhat faltering start to the first full day
of the effort to restore peace to a land where Yugoslav forces and
the conduct of war have driven more than a million ethnic Albanians
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, some 2,000 American soldiers were supposed to enter
Kosovo. But the progress of their heavy, rumbling convoys was slow,
and several hundred Marines got only as far as a refugee camp back
in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers shot a Serb policeman dead here Sunday
afternoon after he fired gunshots near one of their patrols. In
Prizren, to the south, German troops came under sniper fire, then
killed two Serbs who tried to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the peacekeepers began to enter Pristina, departing
Serbs torched Albanian houses and the home of the imam of
Pristina's oldest mosque. Albanian gunmen killed at least one Serb
policeman, and there were unconfirmed reports from local Serbs that
10 Serbs had been abducted and at least six killed in Pristina
suburbs and around the province. A Yugoslav police general, Obrad
Stevanovic, was talking to British forces to try to get the
kidnapped Serbs released, local Serbs said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, a German journalist was shot dead south
of here by unknown gunmen. A second German journalist was severely
wounded and later died, the German foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina's airfield was the scene of genteel contention
throughout the day, as British and other NATO officers gritted
their teeth and left it to the politicians and diplomats to try to
wrest the airport from the Russians and find them a niche in the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians number only about 200, under the command of Col.
Gen. Victor Zavarzin, who was promoted to that rank only Saturday.
They had hastily painted a ``K'' on their armored vehicles over the
first letter of the acronym for the U.N. Bosnian peacekeeping
mission, SFOR, to match the mission here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing what they're told,'' said Capt. Martin Gorwin, a
British commando officer at the head of a long column of armored
vehicles and troops who had spent the night outside the Russian
roadblock at the edge of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't just push through with his superior force,
Gorwin replied: ``I'm not going to bully my way through. I'm not
going to escalate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian presence, represented by an armored personnel
carrier parked sideways across the road, created a strange
situation. Yugoslav soldiers were inside the airport perimeter and
were helping to man the roadblock, and loitering around the nearby
village, studiously ignoring the British troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces also set up roadblocks on the other side of the
airport, nearer the city, where they turned back journalists,
saying they were doing so on Russian orders.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the morning, the Russians also turned back a French army
convoy, which was on the way to its sector in northern Kosovo. As
the officials argued, a French commander, in frustration, turned to
a journalist to ask the codes for dialing Macedonia on his cell
phone so he could ask his superiors for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's in charge,'' shrugged a Yugoslav army officer
standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The military agreement signed last week by NATO and Yugoslav
generals required the Serb-dominated army and police units to
withdraw from clearly delineated parts of Kosovo over 11 days, but
it never said in what order.
</P>
<P>
   So even as some 10,000 NATO troops poured into the province over
the last two days, there were still plenty of Yugoslav troops in
Kosovo, intermingled with the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In several areas around the airport, the Yugoslav forces _ and
many civilians _ were packing up to leave. Most Serb men by the
roadside, in uniform or not, seemed to be carrying a rifle of some
kind. One stocky man wearing a black leather vest leaned in the
door of a bar with crossed bandoliers of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serbs were leaving in military trucks, but others
were almost a mirror image of the Albanian refugees, joining
convoys of sputtering farm tractors dragging carts piled high with
belongings, except that several of the Serbs perched on top were
heavily armed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the armed Yugoslav
forces will have until Wednesday to withdraw from Zone I, which
includes Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   As they left, plumes of smoke marked torched buildings. Bursts
of gunfire were heard.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Sofalia, near the airport, Serbs had set fire
to most of the houses around 1 p.m. Sunday. British troops trying
to reach the area were turned away at a Serb roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10 a.m., neighbors said, Yugoslav army soldiers set fire
to the house of the Hoxha, or Muslim priest, attached to the Sultan
Murat mosque, the oldest in the city. A plaque on the mosque says
it is a historic monument protected by the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning the downtown streets of Pristina were still
filled with armed Serb police and soldiers, apparently on duty. In
the Grand Hotel, gunmen with bandanas on their heads and
Kalashnikov assault weapons dangling down their backs on long
slings leaned on the lobby counter.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually throughout the day, the British military presence
increased on the city streets. More and more heavy Challenger tanks
and Warrior fighting vehicles took up position, covering most major
intersections by dusk.
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers began building a camp in a park atop a
hill, setting up radio antennae and tents amid a swarm of ethnic
Albanian children and more reserved, but equally admiring, older
people. A large house nearby flew the black and red Albanian flag.
</P>
<P>
   The paratroopers, in their distinctive maroon berets, began
sending out street patrols to make their presence felt. Columns of
soldiers in full gear stalked through the streets, some wheeling
and walking backwards, weapons at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of these patrols that on Sunday afternoon shot dead a
uniformed reserve Interior Ministry policeman. A preliminary
report, said Capt. Cameron Jack of the paratroopers, was that the
man had opened fire on the patrol, was given a warning and then was
shot dead. There was also a possibility that the man was shooting
in the air, a common practice among Serbs here. After paratroopers
sealed off the shooting scene, British military police and Serb
police began a joint investigation.

DO NOT LET AGING MUSHROOMS GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many hog uteruses they sell at
Uwajimaya.''
</P>
<P>
   You could hear necks crack from four different directions when
Richard Sieger dropped that bit of information into a casual
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later he was giving us his recipe for goat's head
with lentils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to try things and I'd always heard that goat eyes
are supposed to be a delicacy,'' Sieger confessed. ``Actually, I
suspect the lentils would have been better without the goat's
head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Agnes eat everything you cook?'' Sieger was asked. His
wife answered the question with a nod. She edits papers on advanced
physics at the University of Washington. That explains her
forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband designs kitchens and was attracted to the writings
in this column several years ago, when a recipe for horse jerky was
included. I became aware of him when he sent me a newspaper
clipping about a man who sought lasting fame by eating a bicycle _
gear shift, rubber tires, red reflector and all. Sieger wanted to
know if I had any expertise in bicycle cookery.
</P>
<P>
   If I had said yes, Agnes might have had another surprise on her
plate for dinner that night.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise to learn that Richard Sieger is
also an expert on the collection and cooking of the tuberous
polypore, the shaggy parasol, the wood blewit and blue legs. Which
is to say he is a prominent member of the Puget Sound Micological
Society and as such is able to exercise his curiosity on all
varieties of fungi. He is also able to steer neophyte mushroom
gatherers away from stinking parasols, weeping slime veils and
blue-footed scaly-tooths.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his proudest possession is a hat he discovered in
Europe. It looks like a felt fedora. It was actually made out of
one giant forest mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner ever faces a mushroom emergency in his kitchen, he
can probably pull a ``feather'' out of his hat.
</P>
<P>
   Sieger knows just what to do with all kinds of mushrooms,
including aging ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with that cheap bag of aging button mushrooms
from the supermarket?'' Sieger asks, then answers his own question.
``I bought some meat that was on sale and made sausage. The Polish
butcher who sold me the hog casings asked what I was going to make.
I told him `mushroom sausage.' He assured me that mushroom sausage
isn't Polish. Neither am I. I'm German, but I was afraid to tell
him that. Patrice Benson, who taught me how to make sausage, is
Polish, however, and that should count for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Sieger's recipe for:
</P>
<P>
   It Isn't Polish Sausage
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds boneless pork shoulder
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds lean beef roast
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds agaricus bisporus (button mushrooms)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 head garlic
</P>
<P>
   One and one-half tablespoons salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half tablespoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Hog casings (optional)
</P>
<P>
   The hog casings are optional because you can make bulk sausage,
cook it in patties then wrap and freeze the remaining sausage in
one-pound packages.
</P>
<P>
   Sieger says to cut the pork, beef and mushrooms into pieces that
will fit into your meat grinder. Crush the peppercorns and add them
to the mixture. Put all the garlic cloves through a garlic press,
then mash the pulp with the salt.
</P>
<P>
   Add the garlic, salt and nutmeg to the meat mixture and blend
with your hands. Grind the mixture with a coarse blade. If the
patties don't hold together, moisten the mixture with a little
wine, he advises.
</P>
<P>
   How do I dispose of button mushrooms from the supermarket? I
might stir up a batch of:
</P>
<P>
   My Mustard Mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup butter
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup dry vermouth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a skillet and saute the onion two minutes. Add
the mushrooms and saute another five minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the vermouth and stir-cook until most of the wine
has boiled away.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pan from heat, stir in the mustard and add salt and
pepper as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Pass as a side dish or spoon the mushrooms over cooked pork
chops or chicken breasts. In fact, these mushrooms are so good you
could probably serve them over barbecued bicycle tires.

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ On a day that saw hulking NATO armored
cars bedecked in flowers of gratitude, the sunburns sported by
ethnic Albanians explained both the euphoria and the anger visible
on the streets of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened ethnic Albanian residents of this picturesque valley
city said they had rarely ventured outside their homes during the
78 days of NATO bombing and the Serb oppression rampant here.
</P>
<P>
   They came into the light Sunday morning to greet German NATO
peacekeepers and by mid-afternoon, the men in T-shirts and women in
sundresses were bright red from searing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are free. The Serbs are going back to Serbia and can't
come back,'' said Blerim Mydyti, 28, who brought a video camera to
record the thousands celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   It was a feeling echoed and a scene repeated all over Kosovo
Sunday as the second wave of NATO forces made their way into the
war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Kosovo village of Jerli Prelez, some ethnic
Albanians cheered and others wept tears of gratitude as U.S. Brig.
Gen. John Craddock's helicopter touched down in a field where
American troops from the Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR) are
planning to establish an operations base.
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-minute briefing, the general walked out to greet
about 100 local villagers, many of whom said they had not been out
of their houses for three weeks out of fear of Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had been in hiding without food since Serb forces
swept through the village several weeks before and shot dead three
villagers in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very happy because the Serb criminals are going
home forever,'' said Avni Rejebi, a 27-year-old professional soccer
player from the nearby village of Tankovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Prizren, security was clearly not restored by Sunday night.
Gunfire could be heard around the city and people were hunkered in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a continuation of a way of life they hoped was ending
with the arrival of NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said most shops and businesses had been closed since
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia began March 24, and the
Serbs intensified their ethnic cleansing campaign against Kosovar
Albanians. Many windows in downtown shops were broken. Classes had
been suspended in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Phone service had been cut off to ethnic Albanians, though not
to ethnic Serbs. Sunday night, phone lines were open to all and the
circuits were jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Families had stocked up on food before the bombing; surviving on
bread often baked at home. They said elderly people were sent into
the streets for purchases with the expectation that they were less
likely than younger relatives to be arrested by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimate that more than half of the 150,000 ethnic Albanian
population of the Prizren area had fled to neighboring Albania. But
there were still large, relieved crowds, to greet German troops.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered soldiers and tossed them in the air. Adolescent
girls asked them to sign their names on the their forearms. They
sang, danced and punctuated chants of ``NATO!'' ``Clinton!'' and
``Albright!'' with three sharp claps like a basketball crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But, even with the arrival of several thousand German troops,
there was fear, hatred and death in Prizren Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said about 3,000 Serb police and military were
still in the area, as their deadline for withdrawal does not come
until Tuesday. And they were angry.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that German NATO troops killed a man who threatened
to shoot them from an approaching car. Non-uniformed Serb militia
posted checkpoints -- in violation of the Military Technical
Agreement with NATO -- and brandished guns at journalists and aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Serb civilians, a minority of about 10,000 in the city, lined
the streets with their belongings stuffing their cars as they left
in fear of Albanian reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Though thousands of ethnic Albanians celebrated in the day, by
nightfall the streets were quiet and ethnic Albanians were back to
the habits of the previous two months. Windows were shuttered in
fear that Serbs would see lights on and force themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   Especially under wraps during the last 78 days were young men.
Throughout Kosovo, Serbs have rounded them up as a way to strike at
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA seeks to make Kosovo
independent from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a group of young friends greeted each other for the
first time in weeks, though they were neighbors in hiding. Some
said they knew young men killed or arrested and said many houses in
surrounding villages were burned. They said that, in fact, central
Prizren was let off easier than other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope next week we can start to live like normal,'' said
Kastriot Bajraktari(CQ both), a 29-year-old who hopes to re-open
his J&AMP;B Bar soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Prizren said that, as the withdrawal became inevitable,
Serb soldiers had come to their homes demanding money or cars. They
also said that Serb police had come asking for the names and ages
of all residents, perhaps a way of checking on whether they had
lowered the numbers of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time today since the NATO bombing began I am out
walking,'' said Violet Gashi, a 30-year-old English teacher. Her
brother, fearing arrest, had fled the country, but she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to die in your house, in your mother land than in
another country,'' she said.

GOOSSEN SAYS HE WON'T BE PUNCHING BAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ P.J. Goossen was prepared to give up a year and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood resident had broken his foot four days
before he was scheduled to fight Roberto Duran in November of 1997.
He lost a rare opportunity to beat a big-name opponent and his
career was in jeopardy because of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   He was so pessimistic about his future that he considered
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Well, things have a way of working themselves out: Goossen is
scheduled to fight another major figure _ Hector ``Macho'' Camacho
_ on Friday in Struthers, Ohio, in a bout that will be televised on
ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't believe it's happening,'' said Goossen, 29.
``After all I've put into this, finally, something good is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``... No matter what happens, at least I will have had the
opportunity to show what I can do, to see if I have it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have it?
</P>
<P>
   Goossen (19-1, with 13 knockouts) understands that he's been
hired as a foil. Camacho (68-4-1, 33 KOs) has more big paydays
ahead of him. Goossen's job is to keep the former four-time world
champion sharp until a !ital!real opponent comes along.
</P>
<P>
   And who could blame Camacho? His four losses have come against
some pretty heady talent _ Greg Haugen, Julio Cesar Chavez, Felix
Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya _ and he's never been knocked out.
Journeyman Pat Lawler is probably the best fighter Goossen has
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because of the foot injury, Goossen sat out 15 months. He
has fought only once _ a third-round knockout of Stacey Goodsen
last September _ in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 37, Camacho has to be considered a significant favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think I pose no threat,'' Goossen said. ``I'm
sure he thinks that, too. I've boxed (in the gym) for years with a
lot of really good fighters, though: Ike Quartey, Shane Mosley,
Reggie Johnson, Steve Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's a veteran, but I think I have some skills, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Goossen wins, he could find himself in position for a
big-money fight and/or a world title shot.
</P>
<P>
   He's marketable: He has a good record, he has a well-known last
name, his blond hair sets him apart and, if he beats Camacho, he
will have bolstered his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Goossen, P.J. father/trainer/manager, said he already has
spoken with promoter Bob Arum about a possible matchup with WBC
super welterweight champion Javier Castillejo.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Duran disappointment doesn't seem as devastating
as it once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all worked out for the good,'' Pat Goossen said.
``No one would have seen the Duran fight (which wasn't to be
televised) and I think Duran was already being dismissed as an old
man. This is Camacho and ESPN. A national TV audience will get to
see P.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   It's his time: Heavyweight Michael Grant, who faces Lou Savarese
on Saturday in New York, is one of the nicest guys in boxing. After
all, how many fighters say ``God bless you'' to opponents before
every bout?
</P>
<P>
   However, it's time for him to speak up about what he perceives
as an injustice: Grant, 29-0 (21 knockouts) and the heir apparent
to the heavyweight throne, sees marginal fighters like Vaughn Bean
and Zeljko Mavrovic getting title shots and now he wants his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he wants WBC champ Lennox Lewis but acknowledges
it could take a while.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the best heavyweight in the world, is negotiating a
rematch with Evander Holyfield and has a mandatory due against No.
1 contender John Ruiz. He also reportedly has a few others ahead of
Grant on his to-fight list.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he knows that's the fight that could propel him to
stardom and he wants it badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fight I want,'' he said. ``They could pay me
$100,000 if they want. I don't care. That's the fight I want,
that's the fight people want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I see (the likes of Bean and Mavrovic) fighting for the
title and then I look at myself and ask: `How many young fighters
do you have to fight to get a shot at the belt?' It can be very
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's Savarese (39-2, 32 KOs), a plodding
15-1 underdog but an experienced opponent.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is simple: Show the world why he deserves an
opportunity to fight for a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's !ital!how I beat Savarese that will leave its mark on the
public,'' he said. ``If I stop him between the first and third
rounds, I think the public will gravitate to me a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, heavyweight Jeremy Williams of Long Beach
faces Hasim Rahman.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bear confrontation: The Oscar De La Hoya-Fernando Vargas
feud is progressing.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, who will defend his IBF junior middleweight title
against Raul Marquez on July 17 in Lake Tahoe, was the special
guest at a well-advertised promotion at a Big Bear restaurant that
was televising the Roy Jones-Reggie Johnson fight two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who showed up: First Marquez and then De La Hoya, Olympic
teammates in 1992 who also train in Big Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, who had his championship belt as part of the promotion,
challenged Marquez to take it from him and also directed ``one or
two'' insults toward De La Hoya, whom he has said he doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   There were no fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `C'mon, take it right now, come and get it right
now,'' Vargas said in reference to Marquez. ``That was it. We left
it at that. Then we were watching the fight and De La Hoya comes
in. He never once turned to look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez said he and De La Hoya were there simply to watch the
fight and no head games were intended.
</P>
<P>
   Sure.

SWISS VOTERS TIGHTEN RESTRICTIONS ON REFUGEES LOOKING FOR ASYLUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Fearful of too many refugees flooding into the country,
Swiss voters overwhelmingly approved tighter rules Sunday for
asylum-seekers and trounced a government proposal for paid
maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Voting as part of Switzerland's direct democracy system,
citizens cast more than 70 percent of ballots in favor of the
government measures to cut down on the number of refugees to be
given permanent asylum. Already home to some 180,000 Kosovar
Albanians, Switzerland has been experiencing an enormous influx of
refugees fleeing the Serbian province. Switzerland is expecting as
many as 60,000 refugees by the year's end _ giving it the highest
number per inhabitant in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The government measures allow collective admission for certain
groups of refugees, such as the Kosovo Albanians. But this limits
refugees' right to make a case for individual persecution, which is
necessary to be granted permanent asylum. Refugees without identity
papers can be ejected more quickly under the new controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a side to Switzerland that is very generous, giving
millions to refugees and a stricter side that wants to make sure
that people coming in are not abusing the law,'' commented
Christian Levrat, of the Swiss Organization for Aid to Refugees in
Bern.
</P>
<P>
   Voter approval was strongest in the German-speaking part of
Switzerland, where Kosovo Albanians have been denounced in
newspapers as criminals and drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The geographical split also surfaced in the vote on giving Swiss
women maternity benefits similar to those in other west European
countries. Although Switzerland requires by law that women take
eight weeks off after the birth of a baby, it has failed four times
to put fiscal muscle behind its policy, which was first adopted in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point with voters appeared to be financing,
estimated to cost $333 million a year, initially from surplus
government funds, then a small sales tax increase. Employers
battled the proposal, arguing the additional cost would encourage
jobs to leave Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   President Ruth Dreifuss, interviewed in Bern after the vote,
said the defeat reflected a combination of fear of adding a new
social benefit, and indifference to the economic plight of new
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said they would like to launch a new proposal
that such benefits be paid by the employer. Some Swiss women
receive such coverage from their workplace, but the benefits are
not mandated by law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss also voted, for the third time, to approve the
government's program that allows subsidized heroin treatment. &QL;

CLINTON, YELTSIN AGREE TO LET MILITARY LEADERS SETTLE TROOP
CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin failed Sunday to end the standoff between NATO troops and a
small group of Russian troops in Kosovo but they agreed that NATO
and Russian military commanders should meet quickly to try to
resolve the issue, White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After an hourlong telephone conversation, the two leaders
decided that commanders should find a solution ``military to
military and general to general,'' said Mike Hammer, a spokesman
for the National Security Council. He described the tone of the
conversation as ``constructive'' and said Clinton and Yeltsin were
scheduled to speak again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But while the American and Russian political leaders are
apparently expecting their military commanders to hammer out a
deal, NATO's chief military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said
Sunday that the negotiations are in fact ``a political problem
first and foremost'' and that ```this is not the kind of issue that
military commanders on the ground or their troops are going to be
able to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just telling you at this point it is really sort of a
nonmilitary issue,'' he said of the early arrival of about 200
Russian troops in Kosovo last week, speaking on the CBS News
program ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution is not here. The solution is wherever this
problem originated _ Moscow perhaps. But it is not here,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what appeared to be an obvious contradiction between
Sunday's statements from the White House and those from Clark,
Hammer, the National Security Council spokesman, said that in fact
there was no difference in their views.
</P>
<P>
   While military commanders might work out the details of how to
end the standoff between NATO and the Russians, he said,
``ultimately the practical arrangements would have to be blessed at
the political level in Moscow and NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials and uniformed military
leaders continued to play down the potential threat posed by
Russia's decision to send a small but determined group of soldiers
into Kosovo without warning before NATO troops arrived in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we should get overexcited about what is
going on,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.'' ``They want to be part of the KFOR force,'' she
said, referring to the NATO-led peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
``We want them to be part of it. I think they got a little bit
ahead of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that 10,000 to 15,000 troops under NATO commanders are
heading into Kosovo. ``The Russian component is about 200, so I
think we don't want to overestimate all of this,'' she said. ``It
is being handled in the proper channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the movement of the Russian troops into Kosovo, a
violation of assurances made repeatedly to NATO and to the United
States, reflected ``some political confusion'' in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was her ``conviction'' that Yeltsin ``is in control,
but I think that what happened here was that he said he wanted
Russian forces to be a part of the peacekeeping operation. This was
his plan, and I think that the military kind of got a step ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that a resolution of the standoff
would probably involve placing about 2,000 Russian troops in a zone
of operations within one of the five NATO sectors in Kosovo:
American, British, French, German and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal, the Russians would not answer directly to
NATO but instead to military commanders of a non-NATO country that
is friendly to the alliance, such as Finland, who would in turn
answer to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would allow the Russians to turn down NATO orders to
carry out missions but would require the Russians not to intervene
when NATO forces carry out the same orders in the Russian zone.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that it would be impossible to give the Russians
their own sector, as Moscow has demanded, ``because one of the
things we want to avoid and will avoid is a partition of Kosovo,
and that would contribute to it.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials fear that if the Russians fully control a region
of Kosovo, it could become a de facto Serb state within Kosovo,
given the close cultural and political ties between Russians and
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think culturally, historically, they still side with the
Serbs,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said of the Russians on
CNN's ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have to be very careful. We have to make sure that this
agreement stands. And it cannot stand if there is going to be a
posture struck by the Russians that they are there to defend the
Serb population against the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their participation, though welcomed, has to be under the
aegis of the authority of the NATO command structure,'' he added.
``There can be no separate command structure. So we are working
through those details.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that the NATO deployment was going ``according to
plan _ actually slightly ahead of plan.'' The Russian troops at the
Pristina airport were ``no impediment,'' he said. Clark said there
had been ``no plans at this point to make any substantial use of
that facility anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   While several hundred American troops have already begun moving
into Kosovo, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said Sunday that the deployment of the full American
contingent of nearly 7,000 troops would probably not be completed
until midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing on CNN, he said troops of the 1st Infantry
Division, who are now stationed in Germany, would begin to arrive
``within about 30 days and then complete that probably within about
the 45- to 60-day time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Cohen would provide any timetable for the
departure of American troops from Kosovo, a deployment that many
diplomats and military officials feel could last for years, given
the ethnic hatreds that have shattered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can predict how long,'' Cohen said.
``It's going to be some time. We shouldn't have any short time
frame. It's going to take time. It's going to take money. But we
went into this conflict with the purpose of achieving a just
result, and we are going to have to stay the course.''

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ Two Serbs in a small yellow car opened
fire Sunday evening on a group of German peacekeepers who had just
arrived. The peacekeepers fired back, killing both men in a tense
and unsettled second day of NATO's arrival in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The body of one of the Serbs, wearing civilian clothes, still
sat slumped late Sunday night in the bullet-ridden car facing the
barrel of a German tank, a bloody reminder of the dangers of this
peacekeeping mission as it moves into Kosovo before the heavily
armed Serb troops have yet moved out.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs do not have to withdraw from this region until
Tuesday, German officials here said. That created one problem after
another in this mostly Albanian city in southern Kosovo, where
gunfire rang out repeatedly during the day. Serbs set up at least
one illegal checkpoint here and a riot nearly broke out after
Albanians began stoning the cars of Serb civilians fleeing the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly under control, I think you can see,'' Patrick
Pogelt, a corporal in the German army, said in downtown Prizren,
which was covered with broken car glass and filled with cheering
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 German troops who arrived here handled the situation
with, at times, exceptional bravery.
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon, more than a dozen Serb soldiers, angry
at the stoning of civilians' cars, marched abreast up Vidovdanska
Street toward the German troops and began firing their automatic
rifles into the air. People dived to the ground, into shops and
under cars.
</P>
<P>
   An army reservist, Maj. Dr. Harald List, rushed alone up to the
Serb soldiers, batted a rifle butt away, and then herded the
soldiers back down the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans spent the rest of the afternoon negotiating the
escape route of Serb troops. Several thousand of the Serbs are now
south of the city, and they have demanded to march out on foot
through the crowds of ethnic Albanians who, many of the Germans
feared, might try to seek revenge for Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tense situation,'' said 1st Lt. Marc Huhnholz, who
worked as a monitor in Kosovo for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe earlier this year. ``The people are very
happy to be able to go out again. They are very happy not to live
in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are turning very aggressive against the Serbs,'' he
said. ``Normally they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   There was jubilation as well as anger here. The crowds wildly
cheered the Germans, covering their tanks with purple, yellow and
orange flowers. Women asked the soldiers to autograph their arms,
and at one point, the crowd bounced three German soldiers,
struggling to balance their automatic rifles, into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people described months of terror here; In late May, they
say, at least 30 people were massacred near the hospital in the
Tusuz neighborhood of Prizren. Nazli Tyfekci, 22, said he was one
of 150 young men arrested by Serb soldiers three months ago and
forced to dig trenches near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Verin Badallaj, 22, said they were stoning the cars for the Serb
civilians for a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all our cars,'' he said. ``They stole our cars last
night and the day before.'' People said that Serbs were also
looting houses around Prizren for the last few days, as they began
to flee the city in numbers. Residents say about 10 percent of the
130,000 people who live here are Serbs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The NATO entry into southern Kosovo got off to a rowdy start
Sunday morning, when hundreds of Kosovar refugees and other
Albanians crossed a fence into Kosovo before the border with
Albania was opened.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it was an emotional moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy,'' said Syl Shala, a 22-year-old refugee from
Prizren as he crossed the border to the Serb customs house. ``The
worst thing was this border checkpoint. When we crossed the border,
they said to us: You'll never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, most of them apparently Albanians from inside
Albania, it was an opportunity for destruction. People ripped to
shreds Serb and Yugoslav flags. Then they looted the customs house
itself, smashing the glass and stealing everything.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Prizren on Sunday evening, the car with two Serbs drove
quickly up to the peacekeepers stationed next to the Hotel Theranda
and a crowd of celebrating Albanians. Martin Fletcher, a
correspondent with NBC, who is staying at the hotel, said the men
opened fire on the peacekeepers from the car. One German soldier
was hit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the impact of the bullets on the pavement while
people were running away,'' he said. ``So it was really quite lucky
no one else got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The German troops then opened fire on the car, killing the
driver instantly. Nick Jennings, an NBC producer, said that as he
was giving first aid to the gravely wounded passenger, who later
died, someone pulled a hand grenade from the man's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs in town did not want to be interviewed, so it was
unclear if the troubles of the Germans troops were related at all
to the historical hostility between Serbs and Germans
</P>
<P>
   The last time German troops came through here was in 1944, as
they retreated from Greece through Albania in World War II. On
Sunday, Sgt. Jens Schluender, surrounded by girls, bragged that the
platoon he commands became the first to be deployed by air _ in a
helicopter drop Sunday morning from Macedonia _ since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very new for us,'' Schluender said. ``For me it's a very
great, very special thing.''

SERBS LEAVE AND THE FIRST ALBANIANS RETURN TO THE MOST RUINED TOWN
IN KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA REKA, Kosovo _ This is the most ruined town in Kosovo, a
city of Albanians where, before this war began in late March, the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army was strong and Serbian police
rarely entered.
</P>
<P>
   Armed troops of the Kosovo Liberation Army were back in Suva
Reka Sunday, in their uniforms, watching the mass exodus of Serbs
and the entrance of Italian NATO troops who are supposed to
demilitarize the Kosovar force.
</P>
<P>
   But the town itself, which once had 12,000 inhabitants, is
empty. Nearly every building has been looted and burned; few panes
of glass are unbroken. Brick walls have holes from artillery and
anti-aircraft shells. The bus station is a ruin, the buses
vandalized and pocked with bullet holes. Wrecked and burned cars
line the side of the road, along with spent rifle cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   There has been sniping in Suva Reka throughout the war, where
the rebels resisted the Serbian army and police and held out in the
steep hills around here and Jezerce nearby. Few civilian cars have
passed this way during the war, and in this interim period when
Yugoslav authority is rapidly receding and NATO peacekeeping troops
have not yet established theirs, Suva Reka remains a dangerous
place.
</P>
<P>
   There was a report that snipers fired on fleeing Serbs in Suva
Reka Sunday, but that report could not be confirmed. Two German
journalists were shot, one killed and one badly wounded, on this
same road, near Stimlje.
</P>
<P>
   When a foreign reporter pulled his car off the road in the
center of town, a group of Kosovo Liberation Army troops emerged
from a building 200 yards away and watched, their guns ready.
</P>
<P>
   Then an Albanian man in dirty clothes and broken shoes ran
toward the car. Musli Kuci, 49, said he had just returned Saturday
night to Suva Reka after hiding from the Serbs for three months in
the surrounding hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few of us here,'' he said nervously, ``maybe
200 civilians have come.'' Many fled abroad, he said. ``It will be
horrible for them to see when they return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those in Suva Reka now are very old or sick,'' Kuci
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA is all around,'' he said. ``They took the town and
they came to protect what is left.'' There is not much, in truth,
to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Serbs who are leaving, Kuci said he wanted the
innocent to stay. ``I came out to the road to tell the Serbs to
stay,'' he said. ``But they did not want to stop and talk to me.
They just kept going. They were afraid, I know they were afraid of
the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuci looked around again, toward the Kosovar troops. ``They have
been careful of the Serbs passing by this road,'' he said. ``I know
they are afraid. But we're not that kind of people.''

 &HT;    Maine residents flash back to first Bush presidency
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, MAINE _ Most folks here didn't complain when
former President George Bush's motorcade snarled traffic. And when
an anti-Gulf War protestor disrupted a church service attended by
Bush, congregants simply drowned him out with an impromptu
rendition of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   The drum-beating broccoli on the village green, however, was a
little much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold here at the time and we were hoping they'd turn
into frozen broccoli and go away,'' town manager Jane Duncan said
of the anti-war demonstrators who _ costumed as former President
George Bush's least favorite vegetable _ beat their drums 24 hours
day for as long as the president was in town.
</P>
<P>
   Because George and Barbara Bush own a home here, Kennebunkport
served as a sort of summer capital during the Bush administration.
On Sunday, residents had a flashback _ and possibly a taste of
what's to come _ when Texas Gov. George W. Bush rolled into town
with a media horde of presidential proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush, the early favorite to win the White House in 2000,
was taking a break from his first out-of-state campaign swing to
spend time with his parents. His visit reminded people here of the
first Bush administration _ and got them talking about the
possibility of a second.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan said a presidential presence creates certain challenges
for a small town, and some residents ``hope all the tourists stay
away, whether they're politically related or not.'' Overall,
however, she believes most of Kennebunkport would welcome regular
visits by a second President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Labelle of Kennebunkport's Shawmut Inn said dealing with
the media horde that followed President Bush ``became a routine.''
This weekend, many of the approximately 200 reporters covering Gov.
Bush's campaign stayed at the Shawmut.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it gives you a pride in your heart again,''
said Labelle, who is confident that a second President Bush would
vacation in Kennebunkport.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Athens, Texas, hope not. The governor has a
vacation home of his own in Athens, and Mayor Jerry King says the
East Texas town would love to be a second presidential home. In
fact, city officials are already talking about expanding the
airport and sprucing up downtown to get ready. They've even
discussed plans for a presidential museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling around here is that Governor Bush is really
president-elect,'' King said. ``We're very hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   King proudly noted that ``laid-back'' Athens residents don't
hassle Bush when they see him at Brookshier's Grocery Store or
Mazzio's Pizza. And he is confident that the governor, an avid
fisherman, can't do any better than nearby Rainbow Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty well known for our big bass that we have,'' King
said.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The implications of the malicious software
program that wove its way around the globe last week struck home
for Bernardo Huberman, a physicist at Xerox, in the form of a terse
voice mail he received at work on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our computer system administrators sent me a message saying,
`The worm has hit Xerox, but we've hunted it down and killed it,'
'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   To Huberman, a researcher who has studied the behavior of
computer networks for more than a decade, the biological allusions
were an apt and perhaps chilling reminder that the explosive growth
of the Internet has numerous parallels to natural systems _ and
many are not reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we are indeed living in a computational
ecosystem which is more and more globally cross-linked,'' he said.
Or to put it more simply, ``It's an amazing system, and it's very
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where computers, once isolated work tools, are
increasingly the very engine driving modern business life, computer
researchers say they are detecting an ominous trend toward programs
that mimic viruses and pestilence in the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   The latest focus of concern is a program known among computer
researchers as a worm. The recent one was apparently conceived in
Israel and quickly spread to Europe and the United States, mailing
itself from computer to computer and destroying its victims' files
along the way. Called Explore.exe _ for the name of the file it
contained that set off the damage _ the worm has affected thousands
of computers worldwide and forced a number of corporations to
abruptly shut their e-mail systems, in a frantic effort to control
the spread of the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Like biological diseases, which exploit the most basic mechanism
of life _ the power of DNA to replicate itself _ a subculture of
modern virus-writing now manipulates that same power of replication
within the world of interconnected computers.
</P>
<P>
   While the dominance of a single computing environment _ the one
powered by Microsoft software and Intel chips _ offers the benefits
of compatibility among machines, some say it may share the
vulnerabilities of fields planted with just one crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The analogies are extremely close,'' said Richard Dawkins, a
biologist at Oxford University. ``When you make machines that are
capable of obeying instructions slavishly, and among those
instructions are `duplicate me' instructions, then of course the
system is wide open to exploitation by parasites.''
</P>
<P>
   Some computer scientists believe that in the rise of the
Internet and the World Wide Web, society has struck a Faustian
bargain _ gaining the potential of robotic software agents, which
can flit from computer to computer to do their masters' bidding
almost intelligently, but accepting as well the darker prospect of
software infections that can sow the destruction of cybernetic
plagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may simply be the price you will have to pay for having
the flexibility, adaptability, autonomy of this new networked
world,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out of Control: The New
Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the Economic World''
(Addison Wesley, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Biological metaphors used to describe the hostile software are
only that, and the analogies do break down because the so-called
computer viruses are man-made, not natural, and are frequently
designed to be destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers assert that such diseases are a direct
outgrowth of the remarkable complexity emerging in the realm of
networked computers. Increasingly, they say, Internet viral issues
will come to resemble the modern world's perpetual public health
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at this the way the Centers for Disease
Control approach things,'' said Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist
at San Diego State University. ``There are always new problems on
their threat board.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists have known about these risks since the first
worm programs were written by researchers at the Xerox Corp.'s Palo
Alto Research Center in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Experimenting with the power of networked computers, scientists
fashioned a wide variety of helpful programs, ranging from
``vampire'' worms that kept the network's computers laboring late
at night to ``diagnostic'' worms that efficiently spread software
repairs around the research center.
</P>
<P>
   But a software error in one of the lab's early worms caused the
program to run amok, crashing computers everywhere in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Today computer researchers debate what distinguishes worms from
viruses, both metaphors drawn from science fiction. The term
``worm'' first appeared in John Brunner's 1975 novel ``Shockwave
Rider'' (Del Rey Books) while ``virus'' first appeared in a
computer context in David Gerrold's ``When Harley Was One''
(Ballantine, 1972).
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the term ``virus'' has been used to describe
software codes that infect computers by attaching themselves to
documents or programs that are passed along. ``Worms,'' by
contrast, have been self-propelling, that is, a program sent within
the attachment can then send itself along without any action by the
person who receives it.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent generation of malicious programs _ like the
Melissa virus, which spread rapidly around the world in late March,
and Explore.exe, the worm that emerged in Israel last Monday _
blend aspects of both.
</P>
<P>
   The world of computer networks has not yet produced the most
telling biological analogy _ evolution. But a particular class of
hostile programs known as polymorphic viruses has been designed
since 1993, with the ability to mutate to evade the pattern
detection capabilities of modern antivirus scanning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, antivirus researchers are also turning to
biological solutions to face down hostile software codes. For
example, last month the Intel Corp., IBM and the Symantec Corp.
jointly released a new antivirus software technology they call a
``Digital Immune System.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as a biological immune system offers a systemic approach to
illness, the new software shifts the antivirus response from the PC
to an entire corporation's network, automatically relaying suspect
programs for inspection and directly immunizing individual
computers.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other attempts to build systems that are immune
from security threats. For example, the original intent of the Java
programming language was to prohibit the kind of file destruction
wreaked last week by creating a ``sandbox'' that limits a program's
destructive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, the rapid spread of last week's outbreak was made
possible because most of the world's users of personal computers
now run Microsoft software. The destructive program was written to
destroy documents written in widely used Microsoft applications
like Word, Excel and Power Point and certain programming files.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the classic result of a computer monoculture,'' said
W. Daniel Hillis, a computer scientist at Walt Disney's
Imagineering unit. Like agricultural ecologies that become fragile
and unstable when relying on only one or a few different crops, so
the modern computer world is vulnerable to the degree it relies on
Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the worm had attacked large American military
contractors, including Boeing and General Electric, Art Amolsch,
editor of FTC Watch, a Washington policy newsletter, suggested that
the government should insure software diversity among its agencies
and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I propose that no government agency be allowed to run more
than 34 percent of its personal computers on one proprietary
operating system by a date certain,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To Hillis, who in the 1980s experimented with advances in
software programs using ``evolutionary'' techniques in which the
programs adapt to their environment, a transition is under way in
which computers will be viewed less like mechanical devices and
more like biological organisms, which more easily accommodate
imprecision and failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have the fragility of an engineered system where
every part works'' but the system itself can fail, he said. ``But
in the future we're going to engineer systems with the expectation
that everything is broken all the time. That's how we treat
biological systems today.''

NATO TRIES TO GET RUSSIANS TO GIVE UP AIRPORT `BARGAINING CHIP' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The chief negotiators for Russia and NATO haggled for a
fourth day to no avail Sunday over how and where Russian troops
would serve in a Kosovo peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russia's foreign
minister, Ivan Ivanov, met for only about two hours before the
talks broke up. Talbott said he was hopeful that the two sides
could make progress. President Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin also discussed the peacekeeping issue by telephone Sunday
afternoon, but agreed only to talk again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some suggestions of progress, it was apparent that the
Russians' murky decision two days ago to send 200 troops to Kosovo
and occupy the airfield NATO had marked as its headquarters had
soured the atmosphere surrounding the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials reacted with exaggerated courtesy to the Russian
occupation, even after the Russian troops used armored personnel
carriers to block a convoy of 15 French army vehicles from entering
the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the alliance's spokesman, Jamie Shea, insisted that
there was ``nothing confrontational'' about the Russians' behavior
and that, indeed, NATO never really had its heart set on the
airport at all.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the airfield had been the initial choice of the field
commander in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, but that officials
were looking at other options.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzling question of who ordered Russian troops to leave
their posts in Bosnia and rush to Kosovo still lacked a compelling
answer Sunday, even as various officials said Yeltsin had approved
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, who went on American television Saturday morning to call
the deployment a mistake, admitted Sunday that nobody had told him
that it had been approved beforehand at high levels, even though he
is the Kremlin's chief negotiator on the structure of the
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said he was not disturbed by the omission, in part
because a couple hours' delay in notification was not all that
important in his job.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow Sunday, a parade of officials insisted that Russia's
occupation of the airport was a defensive move to keep NATO from
assuming complete control of what is supposed to be a U.N.
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Who ultimately commands the force is a major area of contention
between the two sides, as NATO insists that the force operate under
its command and Moscow demands control by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified senior Russian military official told the
Interfax news service that the occupation of the airport gave
Russia a bargaining chip in negotiations, in which Russia had been
placed in ``a humiliating, subordinate position and under NATO
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of the international affairs
committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, called the rush to
the airport ``an attempt in a quite dramatic and bold form to
demonstrate that there is the U.N. and understandings that have to
be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations in Moscow Sunday between Talbott and Ivanov
failed to make headway on the issue of command of the peacekeeping
force. But Talbott seemed to hint at compromise on the second
crucial issue, whether Russian troops should serve throughout
Kosovo or be confined to one sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who see their role as a protector of the region's
Serbs, want a Serbian-populated sector. NATO has refused, saying it
would amount to a partition of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott straddled the two sides Sunday, saying Russia would have
an ``important and manifest'' role in parts of Kosovo. ``I don't
think there is any question that Russia should have an area in
which its responsibility is manifest, evident for all the world to
see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In London and in Washington, senior government officials floated
essentially the same proposal. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, said on CNN that a ``zone of
responsibility'' could be arranged for Russia. And the British
foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said each nation's troops would have
a zone of responsibility, including Russia. No one was saying yet
how or whether a zone differed from a sector. &QL;

   NEW RELEASES: ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' _ Pat O'Connor's
respectful adaptation of Brian Friel's play concerning five Irish
sisters in the '30s features a crafty performance by Meryl Streep.
It's a bit too sentimental, but the acting is superb, and O'Connor
wisely cut the play's length down to a manageable size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' _ Michael Caine deserved the
best-supporting-actor Oscar for his portrayal of an ambitious and
shady yet touching theatrical agent. Jane Horrocks shows off her
gift for vocal mimicry in the title role, as the reclusive girl who
may have a career reproducing the sounds from the records who have
been her only friends. But it's worth the price of the rental to
hear Caine's rendition of Roy Orbison's ``It's Over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane Doe'' _ ``Ally McBeal'' fans might be curious to see
Calista Flockhart in this downbeat tale of drug addiction.
Self-destructive Jane (Flockhart) starts going down from the

with much of the dialogue boring and tedious.

THE MONEY CHASE IN CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS GETTING MORE INTENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
 (rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As campaign finance legislation languishes,
Congress has gone on an all-out fund-raising binge driven by the
battle for control of the House, competition for money with the
presidential campaigns and an early push by incumbents to scare off
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of just how intense the money chase has become, all
four Senate and House campaign committees have for the first time
created their own special programs to court and cater to donors
willing to give them $100,000 in each of the two years of the 2000
campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashed by the debate over President Clinton's use of the
White House to court deep-pocketed donors in 1996, the committees
are offering generous contributors an array of incentives, like
access to party leaders, special issue briefings and meetings in
lush locales.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
which is led this year by Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island,
that even includes a weekend at the Kennedy family compound in
Hyannisport, Mass., as close as it gets to a Democratic shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to raise more money,'' said Kennedy, the son of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., ``we're going to have to do it in
bigger chunks.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the groups is a sign of how the 2000 battle for
Congress is causing an escalation in the pursuit of so-called soft
money, the kinds of unrestricted contributions from wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions that the parties have
used to get around the post-Watergate contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   By law, an individual can give only $20,000 a year to the party
committees to use for the direct purpose of electing a federal
candidate. So the bulk of these $100,000 donations would be
considered soft money, which can be used for activities like party
building or advertisements advocating issues.
</P>
<P>
   Once such money was largely the purview of the national
political parties, not their congressional arms. But last year the
congressional committees became more aggressive in pursuit of the
money, and these programs show that they are now going even
further.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the big-donor programs on Capitol Hill were largely
tailored for the $15,000 and $25,000 contributor. (The Republicans
had a $100,000 ``Majority '98'' program for the House and Senate
elections last year but divided the proceeds among several party
committees.)
</P>
<P>
   For those trying to staunch the flow of money into politics,
these are bad omens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've ended up with an absolutely `anything goes' attitude,''
said Fred Wertheimer, an advocate of stalled legislation that would
ban soft-money contributions. He called the $100,000 groups a
``qualitative expansion of soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, the chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, accused the Democrats
of being hypocrites by raising such donations since they have
rallied around the bill to ban them while Republican leaders have
staunchly opposed it. ``The difference is they profess to oppose
soft money,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats say they will not disarm until the law changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are hoping for campaign finance reform, but we are
also preparing for the worst,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey, who as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee is in charge of fund-raising and recruiting contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising flurry is driven in large part by an unusual
political season in which not just the White House but the House
could change hands. A few even argue that control of the Senate
could be in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to predict which party will control which
institution,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate campaign committees are also pushing to
raise money before they go into head-on competition with the
presidential race. And they want to show the kind of high-dollar
strength that gives the air of victory and draws even more donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high whatever the outcome,'' said Gary J.
Andres, a lobbyist who is working closely with the National
Republican Congressional Committee to advise endangered Republicans
and help them raise money. ``So I think you're going to see an
expanded effort on both sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising is particularly aggressive in the House, where
a shift of just six seats in the next election could return the
Democrats to the majority. Congressional leaders say the narrowness
of the Republican majority is not only bringing in more money to
each party, it is causing some donors and interests to give to
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny dynamic,'' Davis said. ``You have some people
scared to death the Democrats will take the House and they will
give you more. And there are groups that will hedge their bets. If
they didn't think the Democrats had a chance they would probably
just give to us.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are bluntly telling the lobbyists and corporate
interests with offices along K Street that they had best take out
some insurance should the Democrats take back the House.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy said that Democrats in this cycle would be
``expecting much more from those who haven't traditionally been
supporters of us but have been giving large contributions to our
opponents and can't be expected to not at least meet us halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to balance out the sheets a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first quarter of 1999 the House Democrats' campaign
committee brought in a record $6.8 million. By the end of this
month, its officials hope to hit about $14 million _ what it took
House Democrats the entire year to raise in 1997, the last
comparable nonelection year. In three separate events last week,
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton all
appeared at fund-raisers for House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' campaign committee will be posting its
first contribution figures at the end of this month. But the
Republicans say they beat the Democrats in the first quarter in
traditional donations by a 2-1 ratio, raising over $7 million, and
also topped the Democrats in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, Republicans are planning to raise more than $7
million in a fund-raising gala for both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans traditionally bring in far more money than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising drive is equally intense for individual
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the House, any incumbent who could face a
competitive race in 2000 is working overtime to raise as much money
as possible by June 30, which is the next filing deadline with the
Federal Election Commission. Almost every night there is at least
one fund-raiser going on somewhere in the vicinity of Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission reports are used by political
strategists and donors to judge the potential strength of
candidates. And in many cases the size of these bank accounts can
draw in more donors _ or scare them away from a competitor, helping
determine whether a strong challenger jumps into a race.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are pushing about three dozen incumbents who
already face significant challengers or drew under 55 percent of
the vote in 1998. The goal is to try to have $200,000 in their
campaign accounts by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he knows the importance of the June 30th filing
deadline. When he was trying to decide whether to challenge the
incumbent Democrat, Leslie Byrne, in 1994, he looked at her
campaign bank account. ``She had only 25 grand in the bank and I
said, `maybe I can do this,' '' he said. ``If she had had $250,000
in the bank, I guarantee I wouldn't have run.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats are trying to make sure that all of their
freshmen in seats that may not be safe have about $150,000 in their
accounts by the end of the month. ``It's a real focused and intense
effort,'' said David Plouffe, the executive director of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some cases the House Democrats say they have challengers
already lined up and are helping them too.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Casey &UR; , &LR;  who lost by a whisker to Rep &UR; . &LR;  Donald L.
Sherwood, R-Pa., in one of the closest House races of 1998 &UR; , &LR;  came
to Washington last Wednesday for a fund-raiser where House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri helped him raise $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders have also joined the sweepstakes. Speaker
Dennis Hastert, for example, is now spending his Mondays, Fridays
and weekends raising money for House members, hopscotching the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weekend of the month, he plans a four-day tour of
California designed to raise $2 million at 16 events, most of it
for House candidates. His aides say he has raised a total of $5
million this year for candidates and the party.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who would supplant Hastert as speaker if the Democrats
win the House, is also on the circuit. Last week he helped raise
money for Casey and for Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., attended a
Rhode Island event with Gore and flew home to Missouri to appear
with Mrs. Clinton. His aides say that by June 30, he will have
raised $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, has mobilized
his entire whip organization of House members to help the
Republicans' ten most vulnerable incumbents. In a program he has
dubbed ROMP, for Retain Our Majority Program, he has asked these
members to raise $2,000 each for all 10 of these incumbents. The
goal is to raise about $60,000 for each of the 10.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

   And all the House Republican leaders have helped raise money for
a new group called the Republican Majority Issues Committee, which
is trying to raise $25 million to get out the conservative vote in
key congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have called for an investigation of the group
because it is not registering with the Federal Election Commission
as a campaign organization or disclosing its donors.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Gallant, an ally of DeLay, who is forming the group, said
it did not need to register because it will not be endorsing
candidates.

   ``We are not giving money to candidates,'' he said. ``We are
going to be an independent committee that will educate voters on
where candidates stand on conservative issues.''

PRACTICING DEMOCRACY FROM A BUNKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His office is a bunker, inside a maze, within a fortress. At
day's end, 30 bodyguards, four armored cars, and several police
motorcycles escort Alfonso Gomez Mendez home. Gomez Mendez is
Colombia's chief prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when Gomez Mendez entertained friends on
the terrace of his Bogota apartment. Today he cannot step out there
for a breath of air; the doors are sealed and bulletproofed. The
doors to his bedroom are reenforced with steel.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's cumulative and intermingling violence _ a 40-year
insurgency, 20 years of narco-corruption; 15 years of dirty war,
and a decade of a war on drugs _ has shredded most of the country's
democratic institutions. The prosecutor's office is among the few
that have survived, and it has done so despite Gomez Mendez's
probes into the most sensitive political crimes, and his insistence
on justice for those who routinely stage assassinations and
massacres.
</P>
<P>
   But the price of survival is astronomical, too high for most
Americans to imagine. In the last two years, 19 of his staff have
been murdered; 10 have been driven into exile by death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is on the eve of long-awaited peace negotiations that,
despite a rocky prelude, many still hope will end the violence.
Gomez Mendez, on a visit to Washington this month, talked with
writer Ana Carrigan about what his life is like, and what's in
store for his country. Here are edited excerpts from their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can a Colombian chief prosecutor ever relax? When was the
last time you went to a restaurant with friends?
</P>
<P>
   A. I rarely go. If I do, the owner lets me know he would like me
to leave because he fears he will lose his customers. He will offer
to send meals to my office just to keep me away. So I lunch
everyday in my bunker.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the reason I cannot travel on a commercial flight.
Even 10 years ago, when I was attorney general, I boarded a
commercial flight one day and this woman said, ``Senor Gomez, why
are you exposing us to danger? Why can't you travel in your own
private plane?'' So I don't go out much. I spend the weekends shut
up in my apartment, like a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the hardest thing?
</P>
<P>
   A. The loneliness. I can have no personal life. I can't even
keep my family with me. My eldest son just had to leave the country
because of threats from (paramilitary leader) Carlos Castano. And I
feel very isolated. I know some democrats in Colombia understand
what I am doing and support me, but they are afraid to say so in
public. So the only things that appear in the press are the lies,
the personal attacks, to which I cannot respond.
</P>
<P>
   Take our struggle to combat the paramilitaries. In Colombia many
people believe that because the paramilitaries fight the guerrillas
they should be supported. Often, even important people come to me
and say: ``How is it possible that you are putting the
paramilitaries in jail when they are helping us to fight the
guerrillas?''
</P>
<P>
   I think Colombians have not understood the gravity of the
paramilitary menace. Ten years ago, when I was attorney general, I
said that the problem of the self-defense groups _ as they were
known then _ was extremely serious and that unless something was
done about the tolerance for these people among certain sections of
the armed forces the problem would spin out of control. Today I
believe it is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Two weeks ago, the sudden resignation of the minister of
defense appeared to bring Colombia close to a military coup. Then
spokesmen for the army and and the government denied that anything
had happened. What is the truth?
</P>
<P>
   A. What happened on that day should not be minimized. In spite
of what has been said, I do not consider it normal that half the
generals and most of the colonels should all resign on the same
day. I think the Army was upset by the way the peace process has
been handled, and I agree that the president needs to bring them
into the process with him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the time, there were reports that the generals were
angered by your investigations of army officers allegedly complicit
in paramilitary massacres and high-profile assassinations. It was
also reported that President Pastrana agreed to the generals'
demands that no officers would be retired from active service
because of ongoing investigations by the prosecutors, and that he
would not press for passage through Congress of the military penal
code reforms. What will be the implications for your work?
</P>
<P>
   A. The prosecutor's office is independent of the executive, and
we will continue working in our own, solitary way. I know I am
rowing upstream against the current. I know there are many circles
in Colombia who think I am wrong to investigate members of the
armed forces. Yet I consider that there is no alternative. We
cannot retreat. We are not _ as our enemies claim _ ``persecuting''
these officers, nor presuming their guilt. But these investigations
must be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the question is whether it is possible to
investigate criminal actions which are alleged to have been
committed by members of the armed forces or not. My position is
that in a ``rule of law'' country, a democracy which respects the
law, it must be possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a conflict between the struggle to combat impunity
(for those who commit crimes) and the peace process?
</P>
<P>
   A. I said at the start of the peace process that impunity should
not be the price of peace. At least not for all crimes. Not for
massacres. Nor for crimes against international human rights laws.
I know this is unpopular. The guerrillas consider me an obstacle to
peace. Colombians say to me, ``Look, we've been fighting for 40
years, we must do everything in our power to have peace.'' But I
think giving amnesty to people who have kidnapped, tortured, and
killed civilians is not the way to build a stable and lasting
peace. Even peace should have its limits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What, in your view, are the main pitfalls ahead for the peace
process?
</P>
<P>
   A. Colombians were led to believe at the start that just because
the president and Tiro Fijo (leader of the guerrillas) had met,
peace would somehow follow automatically. Now people have grown
impatient. They think peace has failed. Colombians don't want to
understand that a peace process is very long, very difficult, and
very complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly: There is no consensus in Colombia concerning the
concessions which will have to be made in return for peace. If you
look at the agenda (for negotiations) . . . everyone is agreed
about the need for social justice, the urgency to combat
corruption, to defeat impunity, etc. The problem comes with the
``how.'' How do you achieve these objectives? No one is preparing
Colombian society for this ``how.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there has not been enough discussion about the
necessity that the state should not lose its legitimacy by
employing the same methods the delinquents use. I am referring to
the paramilitaries and the problems of combating them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. International human rights organizations like the
Inter-American Commission and the United Nations have called for
the abolition of Colombia's ``faceless'' courts (in which judges,
prosecutors, and witnesses are masked). They charge that the use of
anonymous, or ``faceless'' judges, prosecutors, and witnesses does
not provide due process guarantees for criminal defendants. Why are
you opposed to abolishing these courts?
</P>
<P>
   A. As a law professor, I too would oppose them. But you must
recognize the Colombian reality; 211 judicial workers were murdered
in this country before we had the faceless courts.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to testify in Paris against ``the Jackal'' and
then go for a quiet stroll on the Champs Elysees. It's quite
another to go to a town in Colombia run by the paramilitaries and
testify against Carlos Castano. Or can you imagine a witness
testifying against the guerrillas in a zone controlled by the
guerrillas?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to say: The witnesses must be identified and the state
should protect them. Do you have any idea how much it costs when
the witness says: You must not only protect me, you have to protect
my family, you have to take my children and my brothers and sisters
and find them homes outside Colombia?' That's not possible for
Colombia. I think the international community has initiated this
debate without an adequate understanding of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In March, guerrillas of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of
Colombia (or FARC) admitted to abducting and murdering three young
American activists in a region close to the Venezuela border. Your
office has since issued an arrest warrant for the guerrilla
commander of the region. In Washington, there have been calls for
his extradition. How do you feel about extradition?
</P>
<P>
   A. If we succeed in arresting the people who committed this
crime, then I prefer to put them on trial in Colombia. That, for
me, is the ideal. They should go on trial for murder and
kidnapping, and if guilty they should be sentenced to the maximum
penalty allowed by the law in Colombia. That is 60 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You admit you get little support or even understanding for
the job you are doing. Yet you risk your life daily. Why do you go
on?
</P>
<P>
   A. (A long pause) Because I love my country.

A REFUGEE RETURNS TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ A refugee from this town of old mosques
and cobblestone streets crossed the border from Albania and drove
home on Sunday. Zeqe Cocaj, 25, a prosperous baker, was cheered
like a returning hero by the crowds of Kosovo Albanians who lined
the streets here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeqe!'' shouted a friend who spotted Cocaj as he arrived in
town behind the German tanks that had rolled in 20 miles from the
Albanian border. ``Are all of you alive? Are you all OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Farther along in the mayhem of the streets, where children threw
flowers at the tanks and men happily shouted ``Bill Clinton,
Albright!'' to American reporters, Cocaj was stopped by a friend
who grabbed his hand through the car window and cried: ``We have
electricity! We have water!''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later he honked his horn and pulled over to greet a big
group of friends, who shouted ``Zeqe! Zeqe!'' as they madly pounded
on the roof of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned up a side alley to 66 Vuk Karadjic, the big house
in which he grew up and that he left in fear with his pregnant wife
and two children on May 1, at 8:27 a.m., a moment he noted on his
watch as he closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he parked in front of the white stucco house with a
tile roof, saw to his relief that it was undamaged, and was
embraced by clamoring relatives and friends who had taken refuge in
his house for the past two months and only on Sunday felt it was
safe to go out. One 20-year-old neighbor, Skender Krasniqi, grabbed
Cocaj in a bear hug, and then broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that I'm home,'' Cocaj said Sunday evening
over a dinner of fried beef, his own bread and a salad of tomatoes
and onions as he watched crowds cheer NATO tanks in the capital,
Pristina, on the family's television set.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were bullet holes in neighborhood doors and
windows, and Serbian troops in tanks were still driving close to
Cocaj's street, his city, considered the most beautiful in Kosovo,
was largely spared the 78 days of NATO bombing and the burning and
destruction by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the next three months, hundreds of thousands of poor Kosovo
villagers are expected to return from Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro. But in these first days of open borders, most are too
afraid of still-retreating Serbs and land mines in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   A typical returning refugee right now is someone like Zeqe Cocaj
(pronounced ZE-cha CHO-chai) _ a businessman driven to check on the
state of his shops and his house and to see if it is safe to return
with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaj turned up at 8:30 Sunday morning under hot, sunny skies at
the Albanian border post 15 miles from Kukes, a decrepit and
lawless town that is the temporary home of 120,000 Kosovo refugees.
The border was to open at noon, when German tanks were scheduled to
roll ahead of a huge convoy of news media.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other refugees, he had not been stripped of his
passport and and driver's license, because he had paid about $1,000
to Serbian police and border guards, but he was still not sure if
he would be able to re-enter. He had come with his father, Avdyl
Cocaj, 45, the patriarch of the family's three bakeries, to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father wants to see our house and the condition of the
bakeries, so we can reopen as soon as we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The family's troubles began in late March, shortly after the
start of the NATO bombing, when Serbian police began shooting into
the second-floor windows of one of the bakeries. Cocaj's father and
a colleague dropped to the floor and then crawled into a storeroom,
where they slept overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Cocaj's father was ordered out of town by Serbian
police and soon wound up in Kukes, although Cocaj did not know
where his father was until he saw his name on a list of refugees on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my father was dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaj remained in Prizren as the Serbs stole his flour _ worth
$4,500, he said _ demanded free bread daily and expelled his
relatives from the countryside. By May the situation had become so
dangerous that Cocaj and his family joined the long line of
refugees to Kukes, a town he grew to despise.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is the poorest country in Europe, and Kukes has bandits
and potholes instead of Prizren's affluent merchants and walkways
along the Bistrica River. His Kukes landlord charged $650 a month
for a small three-room apartment, a price in the stratosphere
there. ``I wish to go as soon as possible,'' Cocaj said. ``I've had
enough of the local Albanians. They are idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish shortly after 2 p.m., when German soldiers let
him through with the press convoy. Meanwhile, gangs of local
Albanians looted the border post and burned Serbian uniforms in the
roadway, unheeded by any local authorities. Cocaj took the main
road home, driving carefully to avoid any land mines on the edges.
</P>
<P>
   He passed land of striking beauty _ fields with poppies and
villages of large red-roofed houses nestled into the hillsides.
Then he saw a ruined building. _ ``That was a very good
restaurant,'' he said _ burned buildings, a large dead dog in the
middle of the road, broken-down buses and an enormous crater in a
field where a NATO bomb was apparently dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the destruction was not as bad as reported from
other parts of Kosovo. Close to town Cocaj passed a long column of
Serbian troops, still armed, although looking bedraggled. By 2:45
p.m., he had arrived in town _ a journey that had seemed impossible
but that on Sunday took only half an hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He was stunned to be greeted by the cheering crowds, who had
gathered at the entrance of the town around a German tank and had
been celebrating since the night before, when the first troops
arrived. The next thing he knew, an old woman, a family friend,
stuck her head into his car and gave him a big kiss.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night after dinner Cocaj sat smoking and talking with
his father, relatives and friends in the central courtyard of his
house, surrounded by potted pink geraniums, a grape arbor and
fledgling tomato plants. He could still hear gunshots outside his
house _ Serbs shooting into the air, he insisted _ and the streets
had been tense in the afternoon when busloads of Serbs, fearful of
revenge from returning Albanians, left town.
</P>
<P>
   But Cocaj's plans were still to go back on Monday to Kukes, pick
up his wife and children, and then return home for good.
</P>
<P>
   How has he changed after all that has happened? ``It's a strange
feeling,'' he said. ``I feel sometimes that I've lost 10 years of
my life.''

3 VOICES INSISTING ON GUN CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost every day, the three lawmakers hold a news
conference, resurrecting the same pleas and plaints and seeming
never to tire of their mantras.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. McCarthy, D-N.Y., begs Americans to think about
all the children killed by gunfire. Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y.,
decries the influence in Congress of the National Rifle
Association. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn., urges common sense over
abstract ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes other Democrats join them, sometimes not, but these
three are always there, perhaps the most insistent voices and the
most public faces attached to their party's battle in the House for
new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that they are all women.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye not only on the fate of legislation scheduled to
come to the House floor on Wednesday but also on the pivotal 2000
elections, Mrs. McCarthy, Ms. Lowey, Ms. DeLauro and their party
leaders are betting that gun control is a sure winner among women
voters and that it makes sense to have women sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it from party polling, and I know it from personal
experience,'' Ms. Lowey said. ``In the supermarket, they're the
ones who stop me with one kid in one hand, another kid in the
other, and say, `What are you going to do about this?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially good news for Democrats at a time when their
party's most likely presidential candidate, Vice President Al Gore,
has not come close to sewing up the kind of backing from women
voters that swept President Clinton into office.
</P>
<P>
   In one national poll last month, Gore had less support among
women voters than either of two contenders for the Republican
Presidential nomination: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
front-runner, and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists are hoping that Gore's firm stand for gun
control will help. At a Capitol Hill news conference to promote the
issue just before Memorial Day, Gore positioned himself beside a
mother whose son had been killed by gunfire, and the tableau of
House Democrats around them was disproportionately female.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are leading the charge on this,'' Ms. DeLauro said.
</P>
<P>
   That is true outside the Democratic Party as well. Mrs. Dole has
spoken out more loudly and frequently in favor of new restrictions
on firearms than any of her Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Among moderate House Republicans who support the gun-control
provisions that were passed by the Senate, Rep.e Marge Roukema of
New Jersey and Rep. Constance A. Morella of Maryland are
particularly prominent, and both have been invited to join the
president at a White House rally and news conference on Tuesday
that will feature female lawmakers who favor gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats have been most assiduous about framing and
promoting the issue of gun control in a manner that pivots off the
school shooting in Littleton, Colo., and that is intended to appeal
directly to women.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding alarms about the prevalence of guns in America, they no
longer talk of crime but of child safety, with the presumption that
the phrase will resonate especially strongly with women. They seem
to miss the irony that the same political party that claimed
ownership of the position that women could be more than mothers is,
in this instance, casting them primarily in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that affects children,'' Mrs. McCarthy said,
``and I think women find they have a maternal instinct about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is the explanation or not, polls taken by Democrats
show that women care more about gun-control legislation than men do
and are more likely to let their votes be influenced by a
candidate's position on gun control, according to several
Democratic aides.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, Ms. Lowey and Ms. DeLauro were not recruited for
their current roles in light of those findings. Rather, they said,
they stepped to the foreground of an issue they had long been
passionate about and that party leaders almost immediately
encouraged them to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   They form an interesting trio.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, whose husband was killed by gunfire on the Long
Island Rail Road, speaks softly but carries a heavy burden of
sorrow that seems to tug downward on her features, giving her a
world-weary mien.
</P>
<P>
   It is she who, in addition to appearing at a never-ending string
of news conferences, makes the most frequent trips across the aisle
of the House to solicit support among moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they see me as someone who is not on a political
agenda,'' said Mrs. McCarthy, whose grown son, Kevin, her only
child, was critically injured by the same hail of bullets that left
her a widow. ``This is personal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey, whose decade in the House makes her the most senior
member of the three, radiates an assurance and serenity that helps
veil the partisanship of her verbal attacks. Ms. DeLauro is
preternaturally intense, a live wire whose words rush out like
sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, these three have become central players in
the lobbying effort to make sure as few Democrats as possible leave
the party's fold on gun control and as many Republicans as possible
side with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democratic aides grumble that the job has been thrust upon
Mrs. McCarthy, Ms. Lowey and Ms. DeLauro because many senior
Democrats have been reluctant to assume aggressive roles on an
issue that they believe helped cost them their majority in the
House in 1994. During that election, the NRA backed Republicans
against Democrats in a number of crucial Congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are differing opinions in our caucus,'' Ms. Lowey
acknowledged. ``But if the House doesn't pass gun control, that
failure will be on the doorstep of Republican leaders.''

   TEACHERS-MEMORIES (Seattle) _ The Class of '99 is graduating
after about 30 years, facing a new millenium without chalkdust,
school bells, upraised hands and reverberating hallways. The grads
will miss the toothless grin of a beginning reader, the
``lightbulb'' glow on the face of a kid who finally ``gets'' long
division, the troubled teen who discovers he's an artist, the
junior chemist whose experiment trips the smoke alarm. Yet, say

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With all the cuts and bruises he bears from the
Clinton incumbency _ five grand jury summonses and a searing
banishment by the president himself _ Harold M. Ickes would seem
the last guru in town to be advising Hillary Rodham Clinton on the
joys of the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is, attracting hail-fellow backslaps and waves in a
restaurant a block from the White House, a man restored to his
combative element as he eagerly maps out the first lady's approach
to a Senate run from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee that Hillary Clinton will go toe to toe with the
best of them,'' Ickes says as exuberantly as a prize fight
corner-man summoned back to the championship canvas. ``In any ring,
I'd put my money on Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   As he relishes that possibility, Ickes' own passion for politics
is glaringly clear, all the way back to clubhouse fights in New
York with the likes of the late former congresswoman Bella Abzug, a
beloved politician in his memory. ``Listen you, I'll mash you into
Broadway!'' he recalls threatening Ms. Abzug as they exchanged
brickbats in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   No less will Mrs. Clinton be up to whatever Abzugian
cut-and-thrust might still be required in the streets and rural
hamlets of New York, Ickes firmly insists, even against the
pugnaciously ambitious Republican contender, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Creatively profane and fiercely partisan, Ickes is a 59-year-old
Democratic warhorse and former deputy chief of staff at the White
House. Through thick and thin, Whitewater and campaign finance, he
labored in the West Wing _ only to be dropped by the president in a
power squeeze two years ago as Ickes hoped for the chief of staff's
job. Thereafter, as he sought to establish a consulting business,
Ickes &AMP; Enright, he has been relentlessly summoned and vetted a
dozen times by prosecutors and Republican congressional committees
searching for administration scandal.
</P>
<P>
   After such rough times, Mrs. Clinton's evolving candidacy is
presenting him a note of grand redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, they're my friends,'' Ickes said, spiritedly
responding to the question of why, after all his travail in
associating with the Clintons, he would be there for them now.
``I've known them for 25 years,'' he said, describing them as two
of the most progressive and effective Democrats he has known in 35
years of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Years back, he had avoided politics and sneered at Washington
power-tripping as the teen-age son of Secretary of the Interior
Harold Ickes in the Roosevelt administration. He became a dropout
who preferred working at the family's bluegrass sod farm in Olney,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running away from my father for years,'' he admitted,
noting he drifted west to become a horse wrangler and get a pilot's
license, and then finally went to college at Stanford. There, he
signed up for the 1964 summer protest tour against racial
segregation in the Deep South, where he lost a kidney in a mob
beating. By 1967, at the side of Allard K. Lowenstein, the storied
liberal organizer, Ickes was fully hooked, plunging deeply into the
Democratic insurgent politics that, in 1968, toppled President
Lyndon B. Johnson over the issue of the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, he worked for assorted candidates, scuttling
about convention halls, raising money and becoming a specialist in
campaign law arcana that he refers to as ``the incumbents
protection act.'' In a way, Ickes has now come full circle,
operating as an unabashed political insider in the capital he once
shunned. He and his wife, Laura R. Handman, a lawyer, have a
13-year-old daughter, Charlotte Jane, who attends Sidwell Friends,
the exclusive school spurned by the young Ickes (and which Chelsea
Clinton attended).
</P>
<P>
   But friendship and ideas, not clinging to power, is the true
stuff of politics for him, he maintains. His shepherding of Mrs.
Clinton in what he calls her ``great adventure'' is a matter of
abiding friendship, he says, stressing she is deep into the
venture, ready to rebut all carpetbagging notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know _ Hillary just told me _ that Orange County is
the largest producer of onions east of the Mississippi?'' Ickes
asked with an innocent grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Hillary the only time I would urge her not to run was
if I felt she could not deal with the press,'' Ickes said,
admitting concern and foreseeing a ``trial period'' if she runs,
when ``the Fourth Estate will see if she can take the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a hazing period,'' he said, insisting Mrs.
Clinton would weather it favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the chutzpah and the grit,'' he said with the panache
of the wannabe cowpoke. ``Even if she loses it will be worth the
candle _ for her and her supporters. The cautious side of our
nature says, don't do it; the bold says, go for it. You know what?
You've got to give her credit: she'll probably go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swearing happily at the idea, Ickes exulted that all the shared
trials and tribulations of the Clinton incumbency might yet prove,
for Mrs. Clinton, to be mere roadwork for a match with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view?'' he said, hunching in like a corner-man before the
bell. ``Keep her cool. Her initial instinct might be to take him
head-on. But I suspect she'll end up feinting, sidestepping, and
then coming back at him,'' he said, flashing a jack-o'-lantern grin
as he envisioned his fresh prospect. ``As you grow older, you learn
to feint more.''

<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ Finding herself once again at the spot where
she and more than a million other Poles gathered 20 years ago to
greet Pope John Paul II, Anna Jamroz, 42, could not help comparing
the two Masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought of freedom when he spoke,'' she recalled of
that historic moment when the newly elected pope gave his first
homily in Poland and gave spark to the Solidarity workers'
movement, which eventually brought down Communism. ``I remember so
well the spontaneity, the enthusiasm. We were so joyful, we wept.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same Warsaw square Sunday, once again there were at least
one million people and tears as the ailing pope, wearing a small
bandage over the cut he received when he fell on Saturday, repeated
the same words he delivered on June 2, 1979, which sent a frisson
of rebellion throughout Poland: ``Let the Holy Spirit bring renewal
on the face of the land _ this land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the pope instructed Poles to use their hard-won freedom
to follow God and the church. As if to set the standard, he then
beatified 108 Catholics killed by the Nazis during World War II as
martyrs who died defending their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jamroz, a hospital psychologist, said her thoughts at the
Mass were mostly about those who were suffering under Poland's
newly minted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is freedom, and so many of us think only about our
own business,'' she said. The nurses at her hospital have been on
strike, along with nurses throughout Poland, protesting low wages
that rarely exceed about $180 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to think more about the poor, unemployed and the
homeless,'' she said. ``We need to use our freedom to understand
each other better.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope himself came close to tears a little later in the day,
when he knelt to pray in a military cemetery in Radzymin, where
more than 1,000 soldiers died in 1920 repelling an advance by
Soviet forces seeking to spread the Communist revolution further
west.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted, ``Speak to us, speak to us,'' prompting the
pope to scrap his plans for a silent tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you are right,'' he replied. ``You know, I was born in
1920 at the time when the Bolsheviks were on their way to Warsaw. I
feel I have a heavy debt to those who fought against the Bolsheviks
and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian A. Hendler, 94, said he viewed the pope as still quite
young. He sat in the front row with fewer than a dozen other
veterans in faded uniforms covered in medals, basking in
acknowledgments that were not allowed under Communist rule and that
even today are dimmed by fresher memories of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920 he was a 15-year-old Boy Scout who volunteered for the
front. ``I would like people to remember that it wasn't just young
men,'' he said. ``There were also Boy Scouts in the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who held four events Sunday, has kept up a grueling
schedule. His voice has stayed firm, but age and Parkinson's
disease have taken their toll, and Poles cannot help noticing.
``You can tell he is very weak,'' noted Lukasz Kadzinski, 22, a
third-year seminarian in Warsaw. ``What is extraordinary is that he
makes a lot of jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has command of close to a dozen languages, but Polish
is his mother tongue. On many occasions he has broken through the
solemnity of the moment to tease his audience.
</P>
<P>
   He did it again at his last event, a prayer service in
Warsaw-Praga, on the eastern side of the Vistula River. As a huge
crowd chanted over and over, ``We love you,'' the pope smiled and
said, ``Since you are busy shouting now, I will take a short
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to insure a wholesome visit for the pope, the
Polish government banned alcohol sales in every town he visited. In
Torun local officials prevented the sale of vodka, wine and beer _
and also ice cream and mayonnaise, fearful that sober pilgrims
might somehow contract salmonella poisoning and disgrace their
town.
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw has been under strict prohibition for four days. The
nuptuals of Anna Sztampke, 26, and Barlomiej Golab, 27, may well
have been the first dry wedding in the capital's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to book the restaurant a year ahead of time,'' said
Malgorzata Sztampke, the mother of the bride. A few couples danced
listlessly. Other guests wistfully sipped orange soda while eying a
fully-stocked bar guarded by a fierce waiter. ``The pope and my
daughter's wedding are two very special events,'' Mrs. Sztampke
said firmly. ``I am happy they could coincide.''
</P>
<P>
   Storefronts of every book shop in Warsaw are filled with John
Paul II _ biographies, the pope's own many writings, colorful
coffee table books and calendars. But inside, Polish intellectuals
can find the kind of trendy modern philosophers the pope deplores _
Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Terry Eagleton, the
post-postmodernist author of ``The Illusions of Postmodernism.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who relied heavily on former colleagues at his alma
mater, the Catholic University of Lublin, to write ``Fides et
Ratio,'' his encyclical on the ills of contemporary philosophy,
seems eager to stamp out at home the kind of moral relativism that
flourishes in the West. Archbishop Jozef Zycinski of Lublin, a
philosopher of science, recently came to the pope's aid by
publishing several articles attacking Polish postmodernism.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the empiricist has no clothes, though. ``There are
almost no postmodernists in Poland,'' explained Cezary Wodzinski, a
philosophy professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw.
``Postmodernists are for church theologians what Jews are for the
nationalist Catholic extremists,'' he said dryly. ``In Poland they
are both an imaginary enemy.''

RUSSIAN ASTRONAUTS PLEAD TO SAVE THE MIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government couldn't do it. A shadowy
British entrepreneur couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the job of saving Russia's space station Mir _ the aging,
and doomed, symbol of a once-proud space program that was the first
to send a man into orbit _ has been given to the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to rescue an enduring, if accident-prone,
exhibit of Russian national pride, a committee of former astronauts
last week opened a special bank account and asked a hard-pressed
population to send in their rubles to preserve the 13-year-old
space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a chance to save the station, the prestige of
the country and the Russian space program,'' the committee said in
its appeal for the People's Charitable Fund to Save the Space
Station Mir. ``The fund appeals to every Russian, to every
organization with a call and a plea to keep the Mir station in
orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Strapped for cash, the Russian government this month announced
that it would bring the station's last crew _ its 27th _ back to
Earth in August, and prepare the station for unmanned flight,
before sending it to a fiery death in Earth's atmosphere sometime
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to keep the Mir afloat, Russian space officials have
searched everywhere for financial support. They even briefly
considered a proposal by a British businessman, posing as a
waste-disposal magnate, who offered to pump $100 million into the
Mir in return for a weeklong joy ride in space.
</P>
<P>
   But that bizarre offer quickly vanished when the businessman _
dubbed the ``English garbage man'' by the Russian press _ was
exposed as an international scam artist, known to the police in
Pittsburgh and Ohio. In the end, he skulked away from Star City,
the Russian astronaut training center, after being declared unfit
for space flight, leaving behind a trail of unpaid bills, the
Russian press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Now the task of saving the Mir has been tossed to ordinary
Russians, at a time when more than a third of the country is living
below the poverty line, when schoolteachers, doctors and army
officers are made to wait months for their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for any contributions to have landed in the
Mir's special account, but Vitaly Sevastyanov, a former astronaut
and a Communist deputy in the Parliament, is banking on the space
station's special appeal as a national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a symbol because of what it is,'' he said. ``What is it?
It is a space station made in the Soviet Union that is continuing
to work after the Soviet Union is gone; it is a symbol of what we
could once do.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, smoking an Apollo-Soyuz cigarette, a Russian brand
named after the famous American-Soviet joint space mission. ``Then
we could build such a station,'' he said. ``Today we cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Podolsk, outside Moscow, some patriotic
businessmen have already signaled their readiness to help.
Alexander Fokin, director of the Podolsk food-processing plant,
said the group's first plan _ formulated in the wake of NATO's
bombing of Belgrade, Yugoslavia _ was to offer financial support
for a new generation of Russian ballistic missiles, but he said
they were persuaded by parliamentary leaders to focus on the Mir
project instead.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1986, the Mir station began as the pride of a
triumphant space program, where Soviet and foreign astronauts
arrived on regular shuttles, conducting scientific experiments and
testing human limits for endurance in space: Astronaut Valery
Polyakov holds the record at 438 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Mir station was expanded over the years, but after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the now-Russian program ran into
continuous budget problems. To make ends meet, more foreign
astronauts were invited to pay their way on board the Mir. Of the
103 astronauts who flew on the Mir, 41 were Russians and 62 were
foreigners, including a Japanese journalist whose television
station paid $12 million for an exclusive from Mir.
</P>
<P>
   If in Russia the Mir is treasured as the reminder of a space
program that once was, in the United States it is remembered for a
fire, a collision and a series of hair-raising computer
malfunctions that took place in 1997 and 1998, when American
astronauts were on board. That was when Mir became the butt of
running gags on late-night talk shows, setting the prototype for
images of decrepit Russian spacecraft that later cropped up in
Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   Relayed back here on Russian movie screens, those images are
typically dismissed as American propaganda and have done little to
dim the pride that most Russians, of all political stripes, feel
about a space program that in its heyday summed up their country's
scientific prowess and its status as a great power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The drive to pull the plug on the Mir began several years ago,
as the Russian government tried to concentrate its space efforts on
Russia's contribution to the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts _ including the launch of the space module Zvezda
now scheduled for November _ have also been plagued by financial
difficulties, and while American space officials have stayed away
from debates over the continuing viability of the Mir, they have
strongly encouraged Moscow to make participation in the new
international project a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the International Space Station, which will be four times
the size of the Mir, could never capture the national imagination
the way the Mir did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when the Mir is taken down, Russia will lose its
independence in manned flights,'' a commentator in the newspaper
Sevodnya wrote recently. ``Whether we want it or not, the
international project is a kind of communal flat in space where you
have to be considerate of your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   What galls former astronauts like Sevastyanov is that the Mir,
having overcome its computer problems, has several good years left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 12 tons of scientific equipment on board the Mir,
produced by Russia, the United States, France and others,''
Sevastyanov said. ``It is a treasure trove that should not be
thrown away.''
</P>
<P>
   If the charity drives fall short of the mark (an estimated $20
million is needed to keep a crew on board the Mir until next
spring), Sevastyanov and his committee are already thinking of
other ways of saving the station.
</P>
<P>
   One, he said, would be to ``privatize'' the station, by selling
shares to foreign governments, with management kept in the hands of
Russia's Energya rocket corporation. Another is to wait for
Russia's parliamentary elections in December when, he said, more
patriotic-minded deputies may go ahead and vote the money _
estimated at $250 million _ to keep the station in orbit for
another year.

PLANE MAKERS EXPECT ORDERS TO FALL SHARPLY THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Commercial airplane orders will be down significantly
this year because of the global economic slowdown, executives of
The Boeing Co. and rival Airbus Industrie warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see substantially fewer orders for the industry than we saw
last year,'' Boeing Commercial Airplane President Alan Mulally told
reporters at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason is a slowdown in the economy, especially in
Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Asia also offers hope of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that leveling out next year.... We are cautiously
optimistic because of Asia that we will see orders start to come
back in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday, Mulally also said Boeing will stick
with its 100-seater 717.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very bullish on the airplane,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales have been slow for Boeing's newest and smallest plane, and
many industry analysts have speculated the 717 will soon get the ax
if sales don't pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has 110 firm orders for its 717, with options for 110
more.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran (formerly ValuJet), the launch customer for what was a
McDonnell Douglas plane until the 1997 merger with Boeing, will get
its first 717 in September. Boeing flew one of the planes that will
go to AirTran to the Paris show as part of an aggressive marketing
campaign to win new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said executives
were reviewing the 717 project as part of a companywide initiative
to seek out ``value destroying'' programs and either fix or get rid
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have completed our analysis, and we are going to go forward
on the 717, the 737, the 757, the 767, the 777 and the 747 because
they are all value-creating projects,'' Mulally insisted.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came during a news conference where he and other
executives gave an overview of Boeing's three divisions _ the
Commercial Airplanes Group, the Military Aircraft and Missile
Systems Group and the Space &AMP; Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   When asked after the news conference if he were certain the 717
program would not get the ax, Mulally replied ``absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 100 percent behind it,'' he said. ``We are absolutely
committed to the 717.''
</P>
<P>
   And he reaffirmed his earlier comments that the value analysis
was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have completed it with all our airplane programs, and we
are going ahead with the lineup that we showed today.''
</P>
<P>
   That lineup included all Boeing planes now in production other
than the MD-11, MD-80 and MD-90. After the 1997 merger, Boeing
announced it would phase out production of those McDonnell Douglas
planes that are built in Long Beach, Calif., along with the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing is cutting production of its flagship 747 to
two planes a month, mostly because of the Asian economic slump,
Mulally said the plane has plenty of orders left.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has delivered about 1,200 of the jumbo jets over the past
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think customers will want another 1,000 over the next 20
years,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may want a 747 with greater range as well as one that
can carry more people, and Boeing is prepared to build a newer
version 747 if that's what the marketplace decides, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep upgrading the 747,'' he said. ``If customers want
a little bit more range and a little bigger girth, we will make a
bigger 747 for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Boeing has ``a lot of option'' with the 747.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step probably will be a little more range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Boeing briefing, Airbus Managing Director Noel
Forgeard took the same auditorium stage to talk about the European
airplane maker.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said Airbus will go ahead with the development of a
super jumbo that it has dubbed the A3XX. It will carry as many as
600 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has long maintained that its analysis of the market shows
there is not enough demand for a plane the size of the A3XX that
would justify its huge development costs.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said Sunday that development of the A3XX will cost
about $11 billion. That is up a billion dollars from a year ago,
when Forgeard told reporters at the Farnborough air show in London
that development of the A3XX would be about $10 billion. Until
then, Airbus had maintained that the plane could be developed for
only $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is convinced there is a market for 1,500 planes the size
of the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of four European partners is working with 20
airlines to define the plane. Those airlines, including United,
Japan Air Lines and British Airways, all want Airbus to build the
A3XX, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Airbus hopes to launch the A3XX next year and have it
ready for market entry by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least 15 percent more efficient than Boeing's
747-400, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But Forgeard said the decision to go ahead with development will
not be made until he's certain Airbus will get a 20 percent return
on its investment.
</P>
<P>
   For Europe, the biggest news at the air show Sunday was an
announcement by Forgeard that two of the four Airbus partners had
made peace in what had become something of a civil war over where
the new A318 would be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   The A318 will compete with Boeing's 717 in the 100-seat market.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale Matra, the French Airbus partner, wanted the A318
to be assembled in Toulouse, where it builds the A320 and the
widebody Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   The German partner, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG, _ which Friday
acquired a controlling interest in CASA, the Spanish partner in
Airbus _ wanted to assemble the new plane in Hamburg. The A318 is a
shortened version of the A319, which is assembled in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement reached in the past few days, Forgeard
said Hamburg will get to assemble the A318, but some A319 assembly
work will be shifted to Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   At the Airbus news conference, Forgeard was asked about
Mulally's bleak 1999 order assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not as pessimistic as our competitor,'' Forgeard said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Airbus should land at least 300 new airplane orders this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Paris show, Airbus had a total of 153 orders in
1999. Like Boeing, it will add to that number over the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally had told reporters at Sunday's press conference that
1999 orders will be down as much as 40 percent from 1998, when
Boeing customers ordered 656 airplanes. Boeing later issued a
clarification, saying Mulally was talking about the overall airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Mulally, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group,
said that he thought airplane orders in dollars would be 30 percent
to 40 percent less than they were in 1998 for the entire commercial
airplane industry,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Boeing has only 52 firm orders worth about
$3.9 billion at list prices. That number, though, will increase
sharply over the next few days during the world's oldest and
largest air show. Boeing is expected to announce several orders
here, including one for about 100 Next Generation 737s by
International Lease Finance Corp. Forgeard said Airbus, which
launched its first plane, the A300 at the Paris show 30 years ago,
said Airbus is now Boeing's equal in market share.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the world's two remaining makers of commercial jets
with more than 100 seats put their spin on who's the top dog.
</P>
<P>
   While Airbus has gained market share against Boeing, Mulally
noted that Boeing delivers more planes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 560 planes and expects to
deliver 620 planes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus delivered 229 planes in 1998 and will deliver fewer than
300 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of all planes delivered last year were Boeing
planes,'' Mulally said, adding the same will be true in 1999.

2 VILLAGES YIELD EVIDENCE OF MASS KILLINGS BY SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLAC, Yugoslavia _ After weeks of unconfirmed reports from
terrified refugees, the first direct evidence that Serb forces
carried out mass killings in Kosovo _ and have tried to cover them
up _ emerged Sunday at this village, where freshly turned dirt lay
just feet from a bullet-pocked wall.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Albanian refugees who fled the village reported
that Serb paramilitaries had killed 46 people during a two-day
rampage in mid-April here and in a nearby hamlet, called Ribar.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of recent digging here, along with 26 new graves in
the local cemetery at Ribar, may mean that a mass grave was
excavated and the bodies reburied. Two dozen burned houses in the
area also stand as evidence of some form of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Ward, an investigator with Human Rights Watch who has
been collecting witness accounts of the attacks in the area, said
the graves support accounts he has heard of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents one of the first direct confirmations of witness
statements describing the killings of civilians,'' he said. ``Now
we have the first evidence confirming that it has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hallac said that in recent weeks local police
exhumed a mass grave holding 20 men, carried out autopsies on the
victims and then ordered local villagers to rebury the bodies in
individual graves in the local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Ribar, the victims were exhumed from individual
graves, examined and then reburied.
</P>
<P>
   Reburying bodies in individual graves and producing autopsies
giving an explanation for the killings could make it more difficult
to prove in court that people were executed instead of killed in
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers also said that in the days prior to the arrival of
NATO forces in Kosovo, Yugoslav officials transferred as many as
1,500 Albanian prisoners from the prison in the nearby town of
Lipljan to a Serb jail outside Kosovo. Ejup Pajazi, a 56-year-old
taxi driver released from the jail Saturday, said he was told the
prisoners were taken to a jail in the city of Nis in southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Pajazi's allegation could not be confirmed, but no large group
of prisoners from Lipljan has entered Macedonia in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Former prisoners released into Macedonia last week said they
were rounded up after NATO airstrikes began, accused of having ties
to the Kosovo Liberation Army and charged with ``terrorist''
activities. Severe beatings to force confessions were a daily
occurrence, the former prisoners said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hallac and Ribar, the evidence of killing was strikingly
different. In Hallac, a 10-by-30-foot swathe of freshly turned
earth in an empty lot near the village center was by far the most
dramatic evidence. Two men's shoes and what appeared to be a torn
shirt lay on the surface of the dark soil.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers, who gave accounts mirroring those given by refugees
last month, said the Hallac killings occurred on April 19th. A
dozen Serb paramilitaries shot dead 11 men in the vacant lot, they
said, including a 23-year-old father of two who was shot in the
face after he repeatedly asked to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other men were killed in their homes, the villagers said.
Hafize Gashi, 19, gave a painstaking tour of the killing ground
around her home. Her father, she said, was killed in the garden,
her uncle beside the well, her other uncle in front of his adjacent
home, and her 26-year-old cousin and a 70-year-old uncle inside her
home. The paramilitaries then set the bodies on fire, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the charred remains of the family's living room, she
pointed out what appeared to be a charred human knee joint lying on
the floor. ``We tried to gather all of the bones for burial,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries forced local gypsies to bury all 20 corpses,
villagers said. Police from Lipljan then arrived on May 2 and
ordered the graves exhumed. Blaming the killings on paramilitaries
they could not control, the police said the victims should be
buried properly. But they then barred the villagers from burying
all twenty victims together in the graveyard, the villagers said.
On Sunday, twenty freshly made graves could be seen in the
community cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Just a mile up the road in the village of Ribar, 26 freshly made
graves could be seen in the community cemetery. The victims there
included men, women, children and the elderly, according to the
grave markers. The village's oldest and youngest victims died
together, residents said, when paramilitaries shot a 7-year-old
girl and her 73-year-old grandfather as they ran across a field to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers' accounts of the attack, which they said occurred on
April 18th, a day before the Hallac attack, mirrored those given by
refugees who fled into Macedonia last month. Shemsije Vishesella, a
38-year-old widow still wearing a bandage from where a bullet
shattered her jaw, led two reporters on a tour of the gutted house
where her two sons and husband were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the living room, seemingly in a daze, she described
how the family had been going through its morning routine when
shots rang out outside, signaling the arrival of the
paramilitaries. ``My husband said, `Don't be afraid,' '' she said.
``He said, `They are coming but don't be afraid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries kicked the door in and hustled her husband
and 17- and 14-year-old sons outside. She was led outside and found
each of them lying face down on the ground. As she demonstrated
where each one lay that morning, she stroked the grass as if she
were stroking their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered by the paramilitaries to leave, she hid behind a fence,
peered into the yard and was spotted. When the bullet hit her jaw,
she passed out. The paramilitaries then shot her husband and sons
dead, she said, as they lay beneath apple and cherry trees in the
family garden.

BUSH, THE ELDER, PASSES THE BATON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ With the craggy Maine coastline at his
back, former President George Bush _ poised, animated and
displaying not a bit of regret _ stepped aside Sunday to advance
the presidential ambitions of his son, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas. It was a poignant, if staged, familial passing of the baton,
suggesting that a victory by Governor Bush in 2000 might redress
the lingering memory of his father's defeat by Bill Clinton seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chance,'' former President Bush said, standing with
his son on the lawn of his family compound as the wind blew in from
the ocean. ``And I got some things right. Maybe I messed some
things up. But it's his turn now in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it did not quite turn out to be the younger Bush's day.
For all his attempts at deference to his son, the older and more
seasoned Bush dominated their joint appearance, which came as the
former president held a family celebration of his 75th birthday,
which actually was on Saturday, and a day after Governor Bush
declared his presidential intentions in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush was reflective, light-hearted and charming. He
grinned and waved from the microphone as he caught sight of
familiar faces from his old White House press corps. He confessed
his own errors as a campaigner and said he would stay out of his
son's campaign. ``He doesn't need a voice from the past,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the younger Bush retreated to the house for a
nap, the former president lingered on the lawn, inviting question
after question until a young aide, tugging on his coat sleeve,
pulled him away.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the former president, who seemed startled at the
size of the press corps that turned out _ 28 television crews,
including some from Japan and Germany _ had a chance to reflect on
the changing in the Bush family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I was unpopular,'' Bush said to a reporter who had
asked about his defeat. ``And I was. But what goes around comes
around, and I guess I was elected president once back in 1988. And
then I see George out in Iowa and I say, Hey _ I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush allowed that his son might be the better campaigner. ``I
used to get a little uptight from time to time, mainly in the last
year of my presidency,'' Bush said. ``I think I was better earlier
on. But I got _ I knew I was in a very difficult fight. Maybe I let
it show too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as he promoted his son, Bush recoiled when a
reporter suggested this was the start of a new American dynasty.
``Family,'' Bush responded firmly. ``I don't like the dynasty
concept. We never felt that we were entitled to something.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president repeatedly said he had no intention of
telling his son how to run for president. ``He doesn't need advice
from me,'' he said. ``I'll be there to support him if he just needs
help and someone to love him. But we're not, I'm not, in the advice
mission business.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Bush's syntax collapsed in on itself. The former
president stopped himself, grinning at the memories of White House
press conferences gone by. ``I'm the same guy,'' he said.

AD-BLOCKING SOFTWARE WORRIES SOME E-COMMERCE, MEDIA COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since the invention of the remote control, television
viewers have had little trouble ignoring commercials. It's as
simple as turning the channel, hitting the mute button or heading
to the bathroom for a three-minute pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding advertising on the Internet, however, has never been
that easy. Online banner ads, which command a prominent position on
many Web sites, are facts of life in the cyber-marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the introduction of software from companies such as
Siemens AG, WRQ Inc. and Junkbusters Inc., Web surfers have the
ability to simply turn off Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a mute button (for the Internet),'' said Anne
Marshall, product marketing manager at Seattle-based WRQ, which
last July released ad-blocking software called AtGuard.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which sells for $30, works as a filtering device,
blocking advertisements before they are downloaded on a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   That has several benefits for computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it give them control over the marketing messages
they receive, it also speeds up Internet performance by eliminating
clunky banner ads and graphics. In some instances, download times
can be cut from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   While the ad-blocking technology benefits consumers who feel
bombarded with product pitches, it is causing a stir among
e-commerce and media companies that hope to generate revenue
through online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that could be a concern for us,'' said Andy
Liu, chief executive of FreeDollar.com, a new Seattle startup that
plans to make money by selling targeted advertisements and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering technology, which also blocks unwanted e-mail and
Web identification tags known as ``cookies,'' has forced some
e-commerce companies to re-evaluate their business models and
advertising strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to the blocking technology, Bellevue-based
Altrec.com, an Internet retailer of outdoor gear and apparel, has
decided to focus more on print, radio and television advertising in
an upcoming national marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These blocking issues are just another reason why it is
important to build brand awareness offline,'' said Erick
Soderstrom, vice president of marketing at the 25-person startup.
``We are keeping a keen eye on the resources we spend on online
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad-blocking issue recently landed Seattle-based RealNetworks
in a bit of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle pioneer of streaming media software last month
canceled an agreement to distribute the AtGuard product after some
of RealNetworks' key customers, which include major e-commerce and
media companies, complained that the software could hurt their
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said WRQ's software is not designed to damage
advertisers or companies that make money through online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``WRQ buys advertising, so we are not against it,'' she said.
``What this product does is allow the user to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Avenue A, which coordinates online advertising
efforts for e-commerce companies, could feel a big impact from the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old Internet startup generates revenue by placing
online advertisements for top-tier clients such as Eddie Bauer,
Soma.com and uBid. But Mike Leo, co-founder of the 90-person
company, is not too concerned about ad-blocking products such as
AtGuard, Web Washer and InterMute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get this question all of the time,'' said Leo. ``But the
fact is right now there are very few people who are using this
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall would not disclose revenue figures for AtGuard. But The
New York Times recently reported that the popularity of the
software is on the rise and that Siemens' Web Washer product is
being used by about 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a small percentage of the estimated 76.5 million
Web users in the United States. And it is not yet a threat to the
$4.4 billion that research firm Jupiter Communications estimates
companies will spend on online advertising by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The software is not curtailing Eddie Bauer's online advertising
plans. Steve Kahn, marketing manager for interactive media at the
Redmond, Wash. retailer, said Eddie Bauer is planning to ``ramp
up'' its banner ads on Internet shopping sites in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kahn believes consumers should have the choice to block
advertisements, he added that many shoppers want information on new
products, discounts and other services delivered through
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Even if more people adopt the ad-blocking technology, Avenue A's
Leo believes advertising will continue to drive e-commerce and
media Web sites. The alternative _ paying subscription fees to
access Web sites _ is a model that has failed in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this issue becomes larger _ at this time it is a small blip
on the radar screen of publishers _ 99.8 percent of people will say
give me an advertisement over paying for content,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: THE WRONG WAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many of my readers are, in S.J. Perelman's phrase,
``afflicted with total recall.''
</P>
<P>
   They remember that one week ago, under the heading ``Lessons of
Kosovo,'' the lead sentence in this space was ``In Kosovo, the
Western world is doing the right thing in the wrong way.'' My
conclusion: ``Civilization is more civilized for having intervened
to do the right thing. Next time we are more likely to do it the
right way.'' Emphasis was added in the subhead: ``Right thing,
wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   With that nicely balanced opinion off my chest, I settled back
to watch the president of the United States address the nation. One
of my Bernese mountain dogs, Emily _ a hundred pounds of wriggling
love _ was at my side.
</P>
<P>
   (Emily is no ordinary bitch. Last month, she was Chairbitch of
the Washington Humane Society's annual ``Bark Ball,'' and impressed
500 black-tied owners and their 200 canine companions with her
incredible response to a complex command. When I said ``Sit!''
Emily actually sat, to the cheers and excited yapping of the
audience.)
</P>
<P>
   There was President Clinton on the tube from the Oval Office.
Over one shoulder was the Robert Berks bust of Lincoln, over the
other the Jo Davidson bust of FDR, both castings evoking memories
of great wartime presidents. Behind him was an array of 400
medallions presented to him by members of the armed forces, proof
that the defense establishment is devoted to him.
</P>
<P>
   On this serious occasion, Clinton's demeanor was formal and his
tone suitably solemn. I was part of the vast American public
listening to our elected leader _ until he came to the last line:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo,'' he concluded, ``we did the right thing. We did it
the right way. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking to me, personally,'' I said to Emily. ``He
disagrees with what I wrote were the lessons of Kosovo, and he is
sticking it in my ear in front of the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily put a large paw on my arm and gave me a look that said:
``There's nobody there. All that flickering light on the screen is
not accompanied by a human scent. You only imagine somebody is
talking directly to you, but my nose assures me nobody is there.''
</P>
<P>
   She's ordinarily sensible, but in this case she's mistaken.
Maybe the president does not deign to read op-ed pages, but his
speechwriters surely do, and this was Clinton's most direct
engagement of my position since he threatened to punch me in the
nose for calling his wife a congenial lawyer, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Pleased with his ringing refutation of my judgment, the proud
possessor of 400 military medallions repeated it to Jim Lehrer in a
PBS ``Newshour'' interview the next day: ``I'm confident that I did
the right thing in the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus has the president found his phrase to reject any error. Was
it ``the right way'' to promise Milosevic no ground war from the
start? Turning truth on its head, he told Lehrer: ``Repeatedly . .
. I said I thought we ought to be planning for ground forces.''
There goes that old compulsion to prevaricate when it's not
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Was bombing at little risk from three miles up the best way to
save innocent Kosovars being killed on the ground? That lesson was
slyly twisted by Clinton into ``the suggestion that our moral
position would have been improved if only a few Americans had
died.'' Low blows do not get any lower _ even as he suggests that
his critics ``lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it ``the right way'' to trust Russia, NATO's opponent, to be
NATO's negotiator? Because Clinton naively believed Yeltsin, the
airfield of Kosovo's capital _ our designated command center of the
occupation _ was pre-emptively seized by pro-Serbian Russian troops
as if opening a Templehof. (Now we learn that one quick-stepping
company of the Red Army might have taken Paris during the Cold War
before musclebound NATO could ever get its gear in gear.)
</P>

   This stonewalling leaves me trying to explain to Emily that the
man on the screen is personally taking me on because he refuses to
admit he was fallible on anything. She continues to insist that
nobody is there and she may be right.

JOHNSON SAYS HE'LL PLAY, BUT CAN'T SAY WHEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Larry Johnson pulled into the parking lot and
creakily eased his way out of his car soon after the sun rose
Sunday. It was 6:30 a.m., but Johnson, in pain from his sprained
right knee, had alerted the team's trainer Mike Saunders to be
ready to start treatment early. So Johnson, hooked up to an
electronic stimulation machine, then to an ultrasound, then packed
with ice, then trying on braces, whiled away his morning, finally
peeking at a videotape of the collision with Indiana's Travis Best
that had put his availability for the National Basketball
Association finals in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors had told Johnson that he probably saved himself
further injury because, after Best rolled into him, Johnson picked
up his right leg right away. It was that instinct _ instead of
planting the foot _ that may have salvaged his chances of playing
when the Knicks face the San Antonio Spurs in the
four-of-seven-game series that begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``About Game 1, I don't want to say no and then play,'' Johnson
said. ``It's sore now. I can't straighten it. But this is the
finals, so I've got to get out there. The doctors reassured me that
it's not torn and that, with a brace I can't _ knock on wood _
reinjure it by playing. That's all I needed to hear. With pain,
we've just go to fight through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wore no brace as he talked. He was annoyed by the bulky
one that had hobbled him Saturday and he later took it off to do
some pool exercises on the day after the Knicks clinched their
series against the Pacers. He watched the final two minutes of that
game while awaiting his magnetic resonance imaging test at a
hospital. He was mad and glad at the same time, bothered that he
was missing the celebration, thrilled that he was going to his
first NBA finals in his eight-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But the joy has been tempered by this latest setback. Johnson
has played the season in almost constant pain from knee and back
injuries, but it has been nothing like this. He thought, when he
was curled up at the baseline, screaming, that his season was over.
He thought it on the way to the hospital. Only when the doctors
told him that it was just a sprain, that he could be ready in a
week or two, did Johnson believe he would return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he cannot jog, cannot even straighten the leg. He did not
practice with the team today, and nobody knows when he will again.
Johnson said the knee felt better on Saturday, when he worked out
in the pool, but not so good today. That is why he called Saunders
and why he will let the doctors put a time line on his recovery.
Game 3, the first in Madison Square Garden, is next Monday _ 10
days after the injury. Whenever it is, Johnson is convinced that he
will play in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pain is pain,'' he said. ``What I hate more than sitting out
is being on the floor and not being 100 percent. You know you can
make this move, or guard this guy better, but something is
hampering you from doing it, and in the NBA finals I hate that more
than sitting out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks need Johnson. San Antonio, which has won 42 of its
last 48 games, has been so dominant since starting the season 6-8
that Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said: ``I told our video
coordinator to put up all their losses; I want to see the teams
that beat them in the last three months. And he gives me this
little stack of tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson, who is averaging 12.7 points a game in the playoffs,
cannot play on Wednesday, Van Gundy has a hard decision to make: to
start Marcus Camby or Kurt Thomas. Either one is an enormous gamble
against a team that features the extraordinary tandem of Tim Duncan
_ whom Van Gundy calls the best player in the league _ and David
Robinson. With a starting lineup that pits Thomas and Chris Dudley
against the twin towers, the Knicks risk getting into foul trouble
quickly. The Spurs would surely pound the ball down low to exploit
the absence of Patrick Ewing and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Start Camby instead, and Van Gundy loses the burst of energy
that a revitalized Camby has provided coming off the bench in the
playoffs. If all three big men pick up quick fouls, the Knicks,
already down to nine players, will be faced with the prospect of
getting minutes from 41-year-old Herb Williams, who has appeared in
just two minutes of one game of this playoff run. If Johnson does
become available, does Van Gundy put Latrell Sprewell back on the
bench so Johnson can play small forward instead of power forward?
Van Gundy also has to decide whether the Knicks should double-team
Duncan and Robinson and dare the Spurs' backcourt to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Indiana, Rik Smits will draw a foul, but he's more of a
jump shooter, so you're not going to get in real foul trouble with
him,'' Van Gundy said. ``Antonio Davis did a good job of drawing
fouls against us. But these guys play both guys who can draw fouls.
Obviously, we're going to have to do a good job of playing post
defense and trying to manage our foul situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson is lost for any significant time, his absence may
be felt even more acutely in the locker room, or during a practice,
than on the floor during a game. Then, no game plan Van Gundy can
devise will make up for his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means we're going to have to post-up the guards more if
he can't play,'' guard Chris Childs said. ``But it's not just his
play, it's his leadership. He's our captain; he's the first guy
here. We're going to miss his points, but more, his character. All
I would tell him is `Rub some dirt on it.''' &QL;

EXPECTATIONS RUN HIGH FOR U.S. TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was ignored by NBC's live cameras during its
gold medal-winning victory over China at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the time has come for the U.S. women's national soccer team
to unleash eight years of relative obscurity when it visits Giants
Stadium in front of a national television audience Saturday against
Denmark in its opening game of the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the gold medal, the women's team has grown in
popularity, becoming what U.S. coach Tony DiCicco describes as the
``standard'' for the rest of women's soccer to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Even though China has beaten the U.S. twice recently and Norway
or Germany can defeat the team on any given day, the American women
are expected to raise the FIFA Trophy this summer when the third
Women's World Cup final is concluded at the Rose Bowl on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a fair expectation? Not really. But the U.S. women are
playing at home, coming off an Olympic gold medal and have the
revenge factor fueling those expectations after losing the 1995
World Cup to champion Norway.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the U.S. also has the best training facilities,
best farm system (college talent) and has the benefit of keeping
its women together on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Factor all that together and one can see why the U.S. is
considered the world leader in women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are distant to what the men's Brazilian team
faces in terms of the pressure to win, but, in some respects, we
share their expectations on a world level,'' DiCicco said. ``No
matter where they (Brazil) take the field and no matter who's on
their team that particular day, they're expected to entertain and
expected to win. Not just by the Brazilian fans, but by every fan
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful expectation that is to carry. And at some
levels we carry that expectation also. And to tell you the truth,
we absolutely love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Brazilians, the American's expectations were built on
tales rather than television.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. team won the inaugural 1991 Women's World Cup in
China following a 2-1 victory over Norway, they had to send faxes
and make phone calls to get the word out to friends and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one met us at the airport; there were no ticker-tape
parades,'' said striker Mia Hamm, laughing. ``One of our sponsors
took an ad out in the papers to let people know we had won.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicicco had two images from that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we arrived at JFK after we won it, there were literally
less than five people there to greet us. One was Bora Milutinovic
(U.S. men's coach at the time) and the others I'm not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other image comes from Michelle Akers. She was sitting
next to an older American woman on the ride home. The woman asked
her what she had just done, and Michelle told her we had just won
the first Women's World Cup in China. The lady said, `That's nice.'
I mean, there was no significance to the event outside of our
little world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. failed to recapture the 1995 World Cup in Sweden,
few noticed their 1-0 loss to Norway in the semifinals, either.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was hoping its popularity and women's soccer in general
would reach a larger audience during the 1996 Olympics, but NBC
failed to show the team's thrilling 2-1 victory over China on live
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very disappointing,'' said U.S. forward Tiffeny
Milbrett. ``I don't know how many people on this team would say it,
but our team was very upset it wasn't shown. We felt like here you
have a gold-medal contender and it seemed like they just didn't
care enough to put us on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all changed now. Every minute of every game building up
to the final will be aired nationally on either ABC, ESPN or ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is grouped in the first round with unlikely challengers
in Denmark, Nigeria and North Korea, but as the tournament gets
into the later stages the parity among the final eight teams will
be closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of differences between the first two World
Cups and this one,'' said Hamm. ``So many more teams out there can
compete for this title. I think in 1991 there were maybe four or
five teams. But now you have to adjust tactically and make
different decisions on how you attack and defend in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be a walk in the park. A lot of people are
expecting us to win, but this is the most competitive tournament
we've ever played in.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defender Brandi Chastain said the pressure to win isn't
as high as the media is making it out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win the tournament, that's our goal. We wouldn't
have started training in January if we thought for one minute we
wouldn't win,'' said Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the expectations that communities across the United
States are placing on us are much greater than the expectations
we're putting on ourselves, because we have control of the
situation,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure we feel is only coming from within. It's not
coming from the media. It's not coming from our families. It's not
coming from soccer communities. It's coming from the 18 players
participating in the World Cup. We know what we're capable of
achieving so the pressure in that sense is lessened.''

COMMENTARY: KURT THOMAS, STEPPING UP AND RETURNING TO TEXAS IN
TRIUMPH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The Knicks gathered and practiced Sunday. This
was Day One of a final championship push, a difficult day of coming
down from the thrill of Friday's Eastern Conference championship
victory, preparing for Game 1 on Wednesday against mighty, rested
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward framed the coming struggle as a battle between
David and Goliath: the undermanned Knicks against the thunderous
Spurs with the twin towers Tim Duncan and David Robinson. The story
of the conference championship was the transformation of the
Knicks' front-line players. The National Basketball Association
finals depend on the blossoming of lesser players in undetermined
yet critical roles. The blossoming of players like Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   As his teammates left Sunday after exhaustive interviews with
the news media, Thomas, the Knicks' 26-year-old power
forward/center, stayed late and took waves of medium-range jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several weeks, Thomas played his role; he has been
the Knicks' amorphous big body, grabbing rebounds and battling the
likes of Mourning, Mutombo and the Davises. He has played defense,
and he has played aggressively, while trying to stay out of foul
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With 6 minutes 3 seconds left in the first half on Friday,
Thomas' importance to the team escalated: Larry Johnson, the
Knicks' third wheel of a self-styled scoring triangle, went down
with a knee injury. Even if healthy, the 6-foot-5-inch Johnson was
going to have difficulty against the Spurs' tall, active, agile
front line. The Knicks need a 6-9 presence to mix, to defend and to
score perhaps as many as 12 points. Enter Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to help us win,'' Thomas said. ``If it's no
points, I'll do that. If it's playing defense, rebounding, I'll do
that. I've never won a championship at any level. Whatever it takes
to win, I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his ``aw, shucks'' demeanor and inoffensive
corporate-speak, Thomas does not lack confidence. During a team
meeting last April when the team was slumping at a crucial
juncture, Thomas, apparently feeling that none of the other Knicks
were willing to step up, told his teammates that he wanted the
ball. They looked at him as if he were crazy, but he got the
message across: somebody had to make it happen or it wasn't going
to happen. Two games later, the Knicks came from 20 points down to
beat the Heat in Miami in a game most players credit with
catapulting them through the Eastern Conference playoffs. With
Johnson injured, the Knicks need size and point production, and
Thomas will have an opportunity to walk the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' realistic confidence was built in his college days in
Fort Worth, where he was facing players of NBA quality. ``If the
ball comes to me and I have an open shot, I'll take it,'' he said.
``But I'm not going to force anything. I'm not coming in thinking
I'm going to score 20 points.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior at Texas Christian University, Thomas became one of
only two players to lead the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in scoring and rebounding. He enjoyed an outstanding
rookie season with Miami, which selected him 10th over all in 1995.
The next season, Thomas injured his ankle and played only 18 games.
He was traded to Dallas in midseason and played just five games
because of the same injury. At the end of the season he was a free
agent. He chose the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is really like my second year in the NBA,'' Thomas
said. ``I'm still trying to find my groove. I just feel so thankful
to be able to run up and down the court, to be able to jump and not
be injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas earned a degree in psychology from TCU with a minor in
criminology. He freely uses psychological ploys in competition. His
wild-eyed, no-holds-barred approach is part of the mind games that
make the opposition increasingly leery: everyone fears a wild man.
Indiana's Antonio Davis complained that Thomas ``has really taken
it upon himself to just be dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the referee has to step in and take care of it,'' he
added, ``or we'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in control,'' Thomas said. ``I know what I'm doing. I play
hard. Somebody elbows me, I'm going to elbow them back. My daddy
taught me that if someone hit you, you hit them back.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Texas will be Thomas' triumphant return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people told me, `Don't go to New York,''' he said.
``They said that I won't play, that I won't do what I want. Now I'm
coming back for the first time; I'm coming home the right way.''

CONSERVATIVES GAIN IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Europe's center-left governments suffered a sharp
setback Sunday as conservative parties gained votes and won enough
seats to become the largest group in elections to the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was particularly crushing for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's governing Social Democrats in Germany, whose share of
the vote plunged to 31 percent compared to 40.9 percent in national
elections just nine months ago, computer projections showed.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right Christian Democrats advanced to 48 percent, a
sharp gain from 35.1 percent last September, as voters registered
their unhappiness with a stagnant economy and Schroeder's failure
to have an effect on high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   With center-left governments in office in the four largest
European countries _ Germany, France, Britain and Italy _ the
results suggested an electorate unmoved by what has been portrayed
as NATO's victory in Kosovo and more concerned with a European
economy that is scarcely growing while America's booms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there was no evidence of any war euphoria carrying
the governing parties to victory. But voter turnout for elections
to an assembly whose real power remains limited was extremely low,
suggesting that the importance of the swing to the right should not
be exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Early projections showed that center-right parties _ gathered in
a grouping known as the European People's Party _ would gain about
219 seats, 18 more than in 1994, and become the largest political
force in the 626-member assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The socialists, who emerged from the last elections in 1994 as
the strongest party with 214 seats, appear certain to lose at least
30 seats and might finish with as few as 179 seats, the projections
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those center and socialist parties are certain to remain by far
the largest groupings, trailed by the pro-market liberals with
about 48 seats and the environmentalist Greens with about 39. Other
seats were split among extreme-right and extreme-left movements and
a number of regional parties.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly, which generally meets in the eastern French city
of Strasbourg, has limited powers, but is able to veto the European
budget and also call for the dismissal of the European Executive
Commission, a power it exercised for the first time earlier this
year when several commissioners were accused of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This flexing of parliamentary muscle against the officials who
propose policy and run the community's affairs day-to-day was
widely seen as a boost for greater democracy in the European Union.
But voters were apparently unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in Britain was just 23 percent, a mere 27 percent in
Finland, 47 percent in France and 56 percent in Germany. This
suggested that neither the Parliament's greater prominence nor the
arrival of the common currency, the euro, had convinced people that
voting in Europe-wide polls is important.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative gains reflected a devastating defeat for
Schroeder in Germany and what appeared to be a poor showing by
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor party in Britain. Voter turnout
in traditional Labor areas was very small, while conservative
constituencies voted in larger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The French vote, marked by the highest abstention rate in any
nationwide poll, was extremely fragmented. The Green vote surged to
more than 10 percent from less than 3 percent in the last European
poll in 1994, while pro-European and anti-European conservative
parties shared close to 25 percent of the vote. The socialists of
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin gained about 20 percent, exit polls
showed.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the result amounted to a stark warning to Schroeder
that his military and diplomatic efforts in Kosovo have not
impressed the people who voted for him because he promised to
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The German unemployment rate, still more than 10 percent and
close to 20 percent in many parts of the former East Germany, has
not come down since he took office.

ARRESTS FOR DRUNKEN DRIVING ARE DOWN, REPORT SAYS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal report says that arrests for drunken
driving have declined about 18 percent since 1986, suggesting a
lessening of the problem, but a campaigner against drunken driving
said people would continue to die on the roads unless more
preventive measures were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued Sunday by the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics, said the number of people arrested for driving
while intoxicated had fallen to about 1.5 million in 1997, the last
year in which statistics were tallied, from about 1.8 million in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of arrests fell from 1,124 per 100,000 licensed drivers
in 1986 to 809 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the decline in arrests came in a period when the
number of licensed drivers increased by about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the decline in arrests might be attributed
partly to the aging of licensed drivers. The older the driver, the
report noted, the lower the rate of arrests for driving while
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the period in which arrests declined, there were major
campaigns against drunken driving, notably that of Mothers Against
Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Schiavone, president of the National Commission Against
Drunk Driving, a private organization, said that the campaigns have
had an impact in reducing deaths and injuries caused by social
drinkers but not those caused by persistent or problem drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-five to 70 percent of people say in surveys that they
have used a designated driver or have been one themselves,''
Schiavone said, referring to the practice of selecting one member
of a party to be a nondrinker who can drive the others home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more people need to be aware of it,'' he said. ``It has
to reach 90 percent because that will get to the hard-core
persistent driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiavone said, ``The hard-core drunk drivers make up only 1
percent of drivers on weekend nights but are responsible for 50
percent of the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the deaths caused by persistent drunken drivers,
Schiavone said, there must be mandatory alcohol treatment programs
for those convicted of driving with high levels of alcohol in their
systems, as well as devices that can prevent an intoxicated person
from starting a car.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report also found that there had been an
increase in the number of drunken drivers in what it called
correctional supervision _ on probation or in jail or prison _ from
270,000 in 1986 to 513,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews conducted by the Justice Department, people in
jail or on probation gave answers that seemed to support
Schiavone's contention that hard-core drinkers constituted the
major problem.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the drunken-driving offenders in the jail survey said
they had consumed the equivalent of at least 12 beers or six
glasses of wine when arrested. Half of those on probation said they
had consumed the equivalent of at least eight beers or four glasses
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The average blood-alcohol concentration was 0.24 percent for
offenders in jail, the Justice Department found, and that of those
on probation was 0.19 percent. A concentration of 0.10 percent is
the legal limit in most states.
</P>
<P>
   The report will be available on Monday at www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs,
the Web site of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ With the craggy Maine coastline at his
back, former President George Bush _ poised, animated and
displaying not a bit of regret _ stepped aside Sunday to advance
the presidential ambitions of his son, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas. It was a poignant, if staged, familial passing of the baton,
suggesting that a victory by Governor Bush in 2000 might redress
the lingering memory of his father's defeat by Bill Clinton seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my chance,'' former President Bush said, standing with
his son on the lawn of his family compound as the wind blew in from
the ocean. ``And I got some things right. Maybe I messed some
things up. But it's his turn now in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it did not quite turn out to be the younger Bush's day.
For all his attempts at deference to his son, the older and more
seasoned Bush dominated their joint appearance, which came as the
former president held a family celebration of his 75th birthday,
which actually was on Saturday, and a day after Governor Bush
declared his presidential intentions in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush was reflective, light-hearted and charming. He
grinned and waved from the microphone as he caught sight of
familiar faces from his old White House press corps. He confessed
his own errors as a campaigner and said he would stay out of his
son's campaign. ``He doesn't need a voice from the past,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the younger Bush retreated to the house for a
nap, the former president lingered on the lawn, inviting question
after question until a young aide, tugging on his coat sleeve,
pulled him away.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the former president, who seemed startled at the
size of the press corps that turned out _ 28 television crews,
including some from Japan and Germany _ had a chance to reflect on
the changing in the Bush family fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I was unpopular,'' Bush said to a reporter who had
asked about his defeat. ``And I was. But what goes around comes
around, and I guess I was elected president once back in 1988. And
then I see George out in Iowa and I say, Hey _ I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush allowed that his son might be the better campaigner. ``I
used to get a little uptight from time to time, mainly in the last
year of my presidency,'' Bush said. ``I think I was better earlier
on. But I got _ I knew I was in a very difficult fight. Maybe I let
it show too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as he promoted his son, Bush recoiled when a
reporter suggested this was the start of a new American dynasty.
``Family,'' Bush responded firmly. ``I don't like the dynasty
concept. We never felt that we were entitled to something.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president repeatedly said he had no intention of
telling his son how to run for president. ``He doesn't need advice
from me,'' he said. ``I'll be there to support him if he just needs
help and someone to love him. But we're not, I'm not, in the advice
mission business.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Bush's syntax collapsed in on itself. The former
president stopped himself, grinning at the memories of White House
press conferences gone by. ``I'm the same guy,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: AT THE TURTLEBACK OPEN, WINNER MAY BE OVER PAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its formal title is the 99th U.S. Open Championship, but it's
really the Turtleback Open.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the scraggly rough and glassy greens that usually
define the Open, the primary protector of par 70 over the 7,115
yards of Pinehurst No. 2 will be the greens that resemble the hump
of a turtle's shell, a snapper turtle that will devour stray
approach shots. Any shot that is less than precise will trickle off
the slippery crowned greens into shallow fairway-like areas
requiring delicate chip shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the greens stay firm,'' said Tom Meeks, the Open's marquis
de sod, ``I think the winning score will be two or three over par.
If rain softens the greens, it could be anywhere from four to eight
under.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open hasn't had a winner with a 72-hole score over par since
1978, when Andy North shot one-over 285 at Cherry Hills, outside
Denver. In the 1974 massacre at Winged Foot, in Westchester County,
N.Y., just outside New York City, Hale Irwin won with a seven-over
287. At Olympic in San Francisco last year, Lee Janzen had an
even-par 280 for his second Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the Open golfers have played Pinehurst No. 2, but
Janzen knows it from the 1992 Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied every green and made notes on where the best places
were to chip from, and where the places were that absolutely could
not be chipped from,'' he said recently. ``I shaded the best areas
in my course book. That week I pretty much looked at certain pin
placements and if they were near the shaded areas, I went for the
pin. If they were in areas that if I hit the green on the short
side, it was difficult, then I aimed for the middle of the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen shot a five-under 279 in that Tour Championship, tying
for second to Paul Azinger's winning eight-under 276. Since then,
Pinehurst No. 2, designed originally by the legendary Donald Ross,
has been renovated slightly for its first U.S. Open, starting
Thursday in the sandy pine forests of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We added some length and we expanded the greens to Ross'
original dimensions,'' said Rees Jones, the Open's architectural
consultant. ``But the most important thing is, we re-established
the chipping areas where Ross wanted the ball to go if the approach
shot isn't precise enough to stay on the green. It's a course that
I think will favor the international players more accustomed to
recovery shots.''
</P>
<P>
   If Seve Ballesteros were still in the prime of his genius at
recovery shots, he would be the golfer to beat. But his protege,
the two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal, has the finesse
to be the first European to win the Open since Tony Jacklin of
England in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip shots can be played with a putter, a sand wedge, a 7-iron
or an 8-iron, even with the 3-wood that Tiger Woods sometimes
uses,'' said Meeks, the U.S. Golf Association's director of rules
and competitions. ``The scariest green is the fifth, the par 4
that's now 482 yards. The left front of that green is very hard.
We'll be careful with the pin position there. We don't want another
San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   At Olympic last year, Meeks' pin position on the back left of
the 18th green in Friday's second round turned into a travesty for
some golfers. When Payne Stewart missed a sidehill 8-foot birdie
putt, he watched his ball trickle 20 feet below the cup. He missed
that par putt and eventually lost to Janzen by a stroke. Tom Lehman
four-putted there that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the greens at Pinehurst to be faster than 10
1/2,'' said Meeks, referring to a relatively gentle Stimpmeter
reading. ``As for the Bermuda rough, the game plan is to keep it at
three inches. We don't want guys having to hit a sand wedge out of
it to get back on the fairway. We want them to be able to at least
hit a 7- or 8-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   For a century, Pinehurst has been considered America's first
golf resort. James Walker Tufts, a wealthy Bostonian, purchased
6,000 acres (at $1 an acre) in 1895 and laid out a nine-hole course
that evolved into Pinehurst No. 1. He hired Ross, who used metal
scrapers pulled by horses to build the greens on No. 2, long one of
America's best courses; it's currently rated ninth by Golf Digest
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord made golf courses,'' Ross once said. ``Golf
architects merely discovered them. A hole should look as if nature
left it there.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, Pinehurst No. 2 was the site of the 1936
Professional Golfers' Association Championship and the 1951 Ryder
Cup matches. It was an annual PGA Tour stop for the North and South
Open (won by Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead) and later for
the World Open and the Hall of Fame Open.
</P>
<P>
   As some courses do, No. 2 slowly deteriorated. But in 1984,
ClubCorp purchased what is now the Pine-hurst Resort and Country
Club (with eight courses) and restored No. 2 to Ross' concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 2's greens are designed to repel shots, not accept them,''
said Don Padgett, a former PGA of America president, who is now
Pinehurst's director of golf. ``And when the ball rolls off the
green, it will roll as far as its momentum will take it.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it rolled off a snapping turtle's back.

SEARCHING FRUITLESSLY FOR FLAWS IN THE SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy has kept a bit of
his long years as an assistant coach with him. Preparing for a
playoff series, he has always been able to dissect hours of tape,
finding a slight flaw in an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But when he picked up his stack of videos on recent losses for
the San Antonio Spurs, he found a few problems. First, the stack
was not very tall, with the Spurs dropping just four games since
April 1, including just one in the post-season, an opening-round
loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Since then, they have swept
through the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers.
There was no glaring weakness he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their losses came on back-to-back games or when they had more
travel,'' Van Gundy said today. ``There wasn't anything San Antonio
didn't do well. That's what I was looking for, some nugget. What
there was was no nuggets.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs boast talented players like Tim Duncan and David
Robinson, one trait that Van Gundy saw in the Spurs this season is
the same resolve that he believes carried the Knicks through hard
times all the way to the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy today to point the finger and blame,'' he said.
``Everybody gives you the opportunity. The resolve that built up,
we became a team that really, truly was only focused on the team,
instead of saying that you're a team, but really only caring about
individual accomplishment. I think that really gave us a resolve in
close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only get to that point when you're tested. San Antonio
did the same thing. They started out 6-8. They could have started
blaming and pointing fingers. Now they've obviously been more
dominant than we have and they got it earlier, but I think they got
it earlier only because they didn't have personnel changes like we
had. We had major personnel changes and injuries that had us backed
up early.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs changed their fortunes quickly, turning a 6-8
start into the NBA's best record at 37-13, the Knicks are still
enjoying the underdog role that they have carried throughout the
post-season. Told that his team had been installed as a
double-digit underdog in Game 1 of the finals, point guard Chris
Childs said he would not have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can say whatever they want to say,'' Childs said.
``We're here. We're confident in our abilities. I'm glad they're
underestimating us. Each series they have, and we won. I don't want
them to change their mind and pick us as favorites now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dudley sees the adversity that the Knicks have faced as a
part of everyday life for a New York team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Dudley said. ``You get kind of, not
immune, but battle-tested. In New York, everything that happens is
magnified, and after a while it doesn't bother you. In the two
years I've been here we've had to go through so much, it doesn't
faze us.''

BRADLEY WON'T PHIL-IBUSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The question hardly stumped the stumping Bill
Bradley, who shoulda seen it coming all the way from Inglewood as
he shook babies and kissed hands at the famed Farmer's Market on
Third and Fairfax during a prez campaign visit Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way you can convince Phil Jackson to take the Lakers
job?'' someone asked about his former New York Knicks teammate and
huge supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll make up his own mind,'' Bradley said before
breaking out a smile. ``You know, that's the real reason why the
campaign goes through here this week.''...
</P>
<P>
   _Dennis Rodman was the best thing that happened to the Lakers
last season, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how Rodman was owner Jerry Buss' force-fed addition to
the roster, despite the misgivings of exec Jerry West? So when that
mission aborted and Buss' image started to drift back to that of a
meddling owner who goes over the heads of his own well-paid experts
(nixing the Mitch Richmond trade, hiring Randy Pfund and Magic
Johnson as coaches), you know darn well he listened when West
insisted Jackson was the Zen Master needed for this team without a
soul.
</P>
<P>
   The reported $24 million that Buss will pay to the son of a
preacher man from North Dakota not only goes to the coach's salary
but toward restoring Buss' persona....
</P>
<P>
   _Besides, Buss must figure that with Jackson in charge, it'll
improve Rodman's chances of a return engagement....
</P>
<P>
   _In Bradley's extraordinary ``Values of the Game'' book of
essays (which Jackson writes the forward), one of the few he
singles out in the dedication is West....
</P>
<P>
   _Jackson in L.A. could boost Bradley's campaign financially and
give it a higher profile. Michael Jordan has already chipped in a
grand to the fund and will make appearances for Bradley. Other
supporters, according to Washingtonian magazine, are Pistons star
Grant Hill and his dad Calvin Hill, Padres president Larry
Lucchino, Wizards owner Abe Pollin and ProServ founder Donald
Dell....
</P>
<P>
   _By the way, Rodman's TV series, ``S.O.F.: Special Ops Force,''
has been canceled. After one season. Which is longer than he lasted
as No. 73....
</P>
<P>
   _John Elway told the Rocky Mountain News last week that his
involvement with an L.A. NFL expansion group has been greatly
exaggerated. ``The media has it a lot further ahead than it is...
much, much, much further,'' he said....
</P>
<P>
   _New York Daily Newies say Wayne Gretzky and family have vacated
New York and are moving back to L.A....
</P>
<P>
   _Is Janet Jones still a wannabe actress?...
</P>
<P>
   _Post-Agassi activity from future ex-wife Brooke Shields: She
was filming this weekend off Melrose in a chick movie called, ahem,
``After Sex.''...
</P>
<P>
   _Tony Mota _ yup, another one of Manny's kids _ is hitting .352
with 10 homers and 47 RBI for the Dodgers' Double-A San Antonio
squad. All three stats rank fifth in the Texas League....
</P>
<P>
   _Dick Enberg is, as expected, genuinely humbled by the NFL
bestowing upon him the Pete Rozelle Award for his lifetime work as
a broadcaster, which will be presented in August at the Pro
Football Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the award alone makes it fantastic,'' Enberg said
Sunday before heading out to cover the U.S. Open golf tournament
for NBC this week. ``There was a time when I was just a lonely
little Rams announcer for KMPC when Rozelle sent me a handwritten
note saying, `What a good job you're doing and the NFL is proud to
have people like you broadcast their games.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, how much is that worth at that time when you're wondering
if you're any good at all and the commissioner of the National
Football League writes you a personal note.'' &QL;

MARLINS DEFFEAT YANKEES, 8-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Andy Pettitte's coat-hanger shoulders slumped forward
while he tried explaining another loss and the reason he
surrendered many hits and runs to the Florida Marlins. Between his
sullen answers, he stared like a 10-year-old peering outside on a
rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the New York Yankees wore this particular expression
after their 8-2 loss to the Marlins on Sunday; even while winning
enough to be in first place in the American League East, the
Yankees have suffered so many ugly defeats this year that it's as
if they pull these death masks out once or twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter had a single and a double in his first two at-bats,
accounting for his sixth consecutive multiple-hit game; he had 13
hits in 27 at-bats on the road trip and increased his batting
average to .380. Jeter did not finish the game well, though: He
struck out with runners at first and second in the fifth inning and
again in the eighth with a runner on first and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Yankees had won three straight games before Sunday,
and yes, they passed Boston in the standing on this six-game road
trip. But the consistency that made the Yankees proud and distinct
last year has eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   They began this trip with a horrible performance against
Philadelphia and ended it with another on Sunday. As a result, they
will begin a weeklong homestand on Monday still trying to put
together a solid monthlong stretch of baseball in which they pitch,
hit and catch well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was our record on this road trip, 3-3?'' Jeter asked
rhetorically. ``Well, I don't think anyone here is happy with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said, ``This was a bad game today.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pettitte, who permitted nine hits, two walks and six runs in
five-plus innings, did not know why; his stuff was pretty good, he
said. Pettitte (3-5) was able to throw strikes with his curveball
when he was behind in the count, and he had decent control of his
fastball inside and outside. But he and the Yankees made enough
mistakes to lose again. ``I'm just disgusted right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte retired the first two batters in the second inning.
Danny Bautista then blooped a hit between right fielder Paul
O'Neill and second baseman Chuck Knoblauch _ the first example,
catcher Joe Girardi said, of how Pettitte was hurt by bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte walked the next batter, Mike Redmond, and then the
Marlins' pitcher, Alex Fernandez, singled through the middle. It
was a garbage run that left Pettitte wondering why he threw
Fernandez a fastball, not something off-speed.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again the next time through the lineup. Two outs,
runner on second, and Pettitte walked Redmond and Fernandez smacked
a run-scoring single through the middle. In the fifth inning with
the score tied at 4-4, Pettitte tried ramming a fastball inside to
Bruce Aven, who bashed the first of his two home runs. Girardi said
the pitch Aven hit represented perhaps the only physical mistake
Pettitte made all day.
</P>
<P>
   If only Bautista's hit didn't fall in. If Pettitte hadn't been
quite so careful with Redmond. If only there was more run support.
Pettitte sat in front of his locker, shoulders bent forward,
staring blankly.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds here at the weekend comprised mostly Yankees fans,
some transplanted from the north, others attracted by the success
of the franchise, all of them expecting more of the same. When
Pettitte was relieved with nobody out in the sixth, he walked off
the mound and into a shocking hurricane of boos.
</P>
<P>
   His ERA is 9.88 over his last three outings, and he was booed
after his most recent outing at Yankee Stadium. Pettitte may have
had that great season in 1996 and important World Series
performances in '96 and '98, but the fans seem to have put him on
notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees didn't look any better after Pettitte departed. They
failed to score in the last five innings, O'Neill broke back and
let a fly ball fall in front of him and Bernie Williams overthrew a
cutoff man. They looked tired, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees are a funny team, a high-ranking member of the
organization mused last week. In 1998, they would bury bad teams
like Florida, hammering away until they were certain to walk away
with a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But the '99 Yankees haven't demonstrated a killer instinct; if
they were baseball lions last year, then they are more like hyenas
this year, doing just enough to get by. They play well for a few
games and give the impression they are about to embark on a
significant winning streak, and then have an awful day. The
questions about just how good the Yankees are this year linger.

MARCUS CAMBY AND TIM DUNCAN MEET AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass., Texas)   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The first time they met, it was billed as the
next big matchup, on a level with the battles between Wilt
Chamberlain and Bill Russell. Now, when Marcus Camby sees Tim
Duncan across the floor on Wednesday in the National Basketball
Association finals, he sets it up as a matchup more like David
versus Goliath.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the league,'' Camby said of Duncan.
``I'm just trying to get up to where he's at. I'm just taking the
same approach as our team has been taking, as the underdog. They're
supposed to be the best team with the best record, and he's
supposed to be the best player. But we still have to play the game
and we're going to show up on Wednesday.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the uncertain status of Larry Johnson, Camby is still not
sure just what his role will be. Will he start or remain on the
second unit? Will it be Duncan or David Robinson that he must try
to contain? Coach Jeff Van Gundy may not be so sure of those
answers yet, either, so for now, Camby is like an anxious student,
politely but excitedly raising his hand and hoping that the teacher
will call his name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camby has been tied to Duncan since they met on Dec. 6, 1995,
when both were juniors in college. Camby got the better of Duncan
that day, with his University of Massachusetts team beating
Duncan's Wake Forest squad, 60-46, behind Camby's 17 points, 9
rebounds and 3 blocked shots. Duncan had just 9 points that day on
4-of-18 shooting, grabbing 12 rebounds and blocking 4 shots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was four years ago; it seems like an eternity now,''
Camby said. ``I don't remember that much about the game. I know
that we won. There was a lot of hoopla being built up. They were
trying to make it a Chamberlain-Russell, Olajuwon-Ewing, stuff like
that. They were really hyping the game up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was a long time ago. We were both young, young pups.
It was different, with double- and triple-teaming, and zones. All I
remember is the hype. It seems like in college it was a bigger
level. They made a big thing of it. We were both high-profile. I
was more of a scorer then, getting plays run for me. Right now,
it's definitely different roles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has also been different paths for the two, almost from that
day. Camby finished out that season, winning national honors as
player of the year and leading UMass to the Final Four. He joined
the NBA after that season, leaving a scandal behind him. Duncan
remained in school was the No. 1 pick in the draft in 1997 and
quickly ascended to the top of the sport. Camby, who was drafted by
Toronto as the second overall pick, underachieved for the Raptors,
and after being dealt to the Knicks during last year's draft, did
little of notice before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan has the Knicks' attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is he the best player in the NBA,'' Van Gundy said,
``but fundamentally, he is so sound in the way he plays the game.
It's not a flashy, highlight reel. It's a coaching clinic. He has a
fundamentally sound approach to the game. It's not an athletic
game. To me, from a coach's standpoint, that's the beauty.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Camby have met twice in the NBA, both last season
when Camby was still with the Raptors. The Spurs won both games,
with Duncan (15 and 24 points, 8 and 11 rebounds) decisively
outplaying Camby (8 points and 5 rebounds each game).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes everything look effortless,'' Camby said. ``He gets
his points, but he also rebounds the ball extremely well. He's a
presence on the defensive end. Definitely from four years ago when
I played him to now, he's a totally different player, definitely a
better player.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if Duncan is the best player in the game, Camby accelerated
his growth in the Indiana series, becoming one of the dominant
players on the floor after Patrick Ewing went down with a torn
Achilles' tendon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Camby, the recent success brings back memories of college
and the run to the Final Four. While he cherishes the ride he is
on, he realizes that his own part in it is far different from his
days in college. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more of knowing my role on this team,'' he said.
``College was different. I was the go-to guy, the guy getting the
majority of shots, getting a lot of attention. Now on this ball
club I've learned to accept my role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good and healthy, and my teammates are looking for
me. That's key. You always want to feel wanted on a ball club and
you always want to be a part of something special. Right now,
that's how I feel.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camby is bringing his youthful enthusiasm to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just active, like a little kid out there enjoying the
game,'' his teammate Chris Childs said. ``Each day, from the
beginning of the season, he's improved. The more time he gets the
better he performs.'' &QL;

HERSHISER AND AGBAYANI LEAD METS OVER BOSTON, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One is 40 years old and needs seven pages in the
Mets' media guide to paint the corners of a sturdy pitching career
that has taken him to all-star and World Series games. The other is
27 and barely rates seven paragraphs to recap what, until now, has
been an unremarkable professional journey.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser showed all those pages were deserved by throwing
six solid innings against the Red Sox Sunday. And Benny Agbayani
continued to pile up type, banging his ninth home run in his last
14 starts. Hershiser and Agbayani combined to anchor a 5-4 victory
over Boston before 46,473 fans at Shea Stadium, the Mets' sixth
victory in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has played only 38 major league games in his
seven-year career dating to last September, Agbayani may soon need
to borrow manager Bobby Valentine's dark glasses and tape mustache
to avoid being swarmed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the fifth inning, he crushed a changeup from Red
Sox starter Mark Portugal 383 feet into the left-field bleachers
for a 1-1 tie. It was his 10th home run in 73 at-bats this season
and his second in two days after missing a game with an eye injury
sustained in a batting-practice accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really sparked us when Benny hit it so solid,'' Valentine
said. ``It was one of the first solid hits, and it lifted us.''
</P>
<P>
   It ignited a three-run, five-hit rally.
</P>
<P>
   First Rey Ordonez, then Hershiser _ a career .206 hitter _
singled up the middle. Ricky Henderson slapped a line drive to
right, scoring Ordonez, and Edgardo Alfonzo tailed one past
second-baseman Jose Offerman to bring Hershiser lumbering home from
second and put the Mets up by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets did not acquire Hershiser last March for his bat.
They signed the 15-year veteran and free agent to turn in the kind
of effective and efficient performance that could give the team's
overworked bullpen some time in the shade. Coming into the game,
Hershiser (6-5) was second only to Masato Yoshii in innings pitched
with 59.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser scattered five hits and struck out five over the first
six innings, Boston scoring on doubles by John Valentin and Troy
O'Leary in the fourth. Although O'Leary homered into the Mets'
bullpen with two out in the sixth, narrowing the margin to 3-2,
Hershiser appeared strong enough to pitch deep into the game.
</P>
<P>
   He was also getting help. The Mets answered O'Leary's homer in
the bottom of the sixth after Piazza led off with a double,
extending his hitting streak to 17 games. Portugal was replaced by
Jim Corsi who, after retiring Robin Ventura, gave Brain McRae an
0-1 fastball to drive 391 feet over the right center-field fence
for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser opened the seventh by walking shortstop Jeff Frye
and giving up a single to Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   With the set-up man, Armando Benitez, and the closer, John
Franco, unavailable after back-to-back days of strong work,
Valentine intended for Turk Wendell to pitch in the seventh.
Instead of him, however, Valentine opted at the last minute for the
left-hander Dennis Cook, knowing that the Red Sox had the
right-handed-hitting Nomar Garciaparra, who took the day off,
available to pinch-hit in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cook walked the bases loaded, which allowed Offerman to knock
Frye in on a fielder's choice and move Nixon to third. Then Jason
Varitek hit a sacrifice fly to send Nixon home to cut the Mets'
lead to 5-4 before Cook struck out John Valentin to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel was fabulous,'' Valentine said afterward. ``If he didn't
have to score from second, he may have had enough gas in the tank
for the seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser insisted his own mistakes got him in trouble. ``I
almost wasted good stuff today _ I grooved a fastball that gets
knocked out and I walk a .228 hitter,'' he said of the O'Leary
homer and Frye's base on balls.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Greg McMichael, in only his second appearance
since returning on June 11 after rehabilitating a right rotator
cuff strain, held the Red Sox despite an error by Ordonez and a
single by O'Leary. The Red Sox left two men on base when McMichael
struck out Brian Daubach and Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was very good considering where he's coming from,''
Valentine said. ``Cook's stuff wasn't as good as it usually is, but
we got by with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Wendell's turn in the ninth and, as expected, Garciaparra
pinch-hit for pitcher Tim Wakefield. He doubled down the left-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   But the right-hander then got Offerman to pop out, whiffed a
swinging Varitek to end the inning, and in the ninth it was once
more Agbayani time. Wendell, in search of his second save, watched
Valentin lace a ball into left. Agbayani, hardly a graceful
fielder, broke in, realized the swirling winds were blowing the
ball out, circled back and gathered the ball in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Valentine tried to argue that Agbayani's
background _ his father was a ballroom dancing instructor _ endowed
him with balance and movement. But the rookie wasn't thinking of
his father. He was thinking of Mets coach Mookie Wilson, his
unofficial fielding adviser, as soon as the ball was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and thought, `When is this ball going to come
down?' '' Agbayani said. ``The wind was blowing it around pretty
good. I just wanted to keep moving my legs _ that's what Mookie
told me to do, and he's played a lot of outfield in this stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks pretty much as though Agbayani will, too.

RUFF OFFERS TOUGH LOVE TO THE STRUGGLING SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In his long career as a National Hockey League
player, Lindy Ruff was one tough customer. He collected 1,264
penalty minutes, roughly 12 for every goal he scored. He even
fought a guy named Ted Bulley. Ruff's suggestive surname, blond
mustache and high hairline could fit well in a roster of
professional wrestlers like Hulk Hogan or Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   The mouth below the coach's mustache wore a little frown on
Sunday, and Ruff's words were not soothing. Because his Sabres lost
by 2-1 to Dallas on Saturday night to fall behind, two games to
one, in the Stanley Cup finals, Ruff was ready to rumble, at least
orally. He criticized several Sabres, a few by name and one in
particular. It is a risky motivational tactic that sometimes
backfires on coaches. But Ruff, a second-year coach, is running out
of ideas and games.
</P>
<P>
   His harshest words were for Miroslav Satan, a forward who scored
40 goals in the regular season, missed most of the playoffs with a
broken foot and has no points in this round. Satan (pronounced
shah-TAN) is from Slovakia, and it is not uncommon for North
American coaches and reporters to find fault with European players
when a team slumps. (By contrast, North American players who do not
perform well in the playoffs are usually described as ``tired'' or
``playing over injuries.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the added ice time might get him going,'' Ruff said
of Satan, who played 26 minutes 36 seconds. ``Obviously, we need
him. If we are going to win the series, we need our big players to
do something for us. The added ice time didn't result in a big plus
for us. We tried everything. We didn't get a lot out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff tried to get Satan away from Dallas defensemen Derian
Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, but that is hard because they play
so much. ``He's going to have to fight his way through it,'' Ruff
said of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   But Satan and other Buffalo forwards were also frustrated by the
Dallas forwards, who scurry to backcheck against rushes going the
other way. ``There were a couple opportunities where it looked like
Satan might be able to beat a defenseman one on one,'' Ruff said,
but ``he had a forward in his back pocket lifting his stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Satan got two of Buffalo's 12 shots against Ed Belfour. After
Stu Barnes gave Buffalo a 1-0 lead, Joe Nieuwendyk of the Stars
scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars lost their sniper Brett Hull in the first period with
a groin strain. Coach Ken Hitchcock said Hull would probably not
play in Game 4 on Tuesday and might not be back until Game 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   Satan was asked about the pressure. Like many of the European
players who speak English as a second or third language, he was
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do feel the pressure,'' Satan said. ``I try to respond
the best way I can. But right now, they are backchecking hard.
There is not too much room. Not only me but the whole team. It is a
problem to create anything in their zone. That's the key why we had
only 12 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Satan said he did not think his teammates were down. ``We're
going to try to play the best game we played ever in the regular
season or playoffs,'' he said. ``That's going to be on Tuesday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ruff briefly and lightly criticized the first line, centered by
Mike Peca, the Ontario-born captain who has one goal and no assists
in the series. Ruff also defended his matchup of Peca as a checker
while suggesting he might revise it. Ruff continued to put Peca
against Dallas center Mike Modano, who has an injured left wrist,
instead of against Nieuwendyk, who did the most damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line as a whole hasn't got much done for us offensively,
which has hurt us, with the amount they've been playing,'' Ruff
said of Peca's line. ``He's played a lot. Is he worn down? I think
there's a lot of players that are a little bit worn down.''
</P>
<P>
   As for matchups, Ruff said he still thought Curtis Brown could
cover Nieuwendyk, but he added, ``We might have to switch the
matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca said: ``We didn't have our greatest game. We lost, 2-1. The
guys are still positive. This is the greatest adversity we've
faced. This team seems to thrive on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano complained that the Sabres slashed his injured wrist on
face-offs, but Peca said, ``Well, he had a wrist protector on, so
it didn't matter if we whacked at it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca and his teammates professed optimism that was belied by
their glum expressions. Rob Ray, the senior Sabre, discussed the
pessimism in Buffalo, where the football Bills lost four Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were unsuccessful it was like a major letdown for
the city,'' Ray said. ``You not only feel the pressure for yourself
but of everyone else when you are walking down the street. They
make such a big thing of it. There's a lot of added pressure
because this city has never been able to win a major championship.
Each time you get this chance, you get this close, you start
thinking about it, and they start bringing it up. That added
pressure is there. It's something you just can't avoid. They don't
allow you to avoid it.''

CLINTON, YELTSIN UNABLE TO SETTLE KOSOVO MATTER &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle &HT;    WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Russian President Boris
<TEXT>
Yeltsin failed Sunday to resolve the confusing issue of Russian
troops in Kosovo, but the United States continued to downplay the
importance of the surprising deployment.
<P>
   The two presidents spoke by telephone for one hour Sunday
morning and agreed to talk again today after NATO and Russia
generals resume negotiations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should get overexcited about what is going
on. It is being handled in the proper channels,'' said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on NBC's Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian dash into Kosovo on Friday, beating allied troops
into the Serbia province, continued to baffle Western leaders. Some
200 Russian soldiers now control the airport in Pristina, the
Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   The development left the allies wondering who was in control of
the Russian military and whether it signaled greater problems in
Moscow for Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Clinton and Yeltsin discussed ways to ``advance Russian
participation'' in the peacekeeping efforts known as K-For for
Kosovo Force. He said they agreed Russian and NATO generals should
continue the discussion about ``suitable arrangements'' for Russian
troops to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin issued a statement saying, ``Both sides emphasized
the need for intensive dialogue, including between military
officials, with the aim of quickly finding an agreement on the
implementation of the peacekeeping operation.'' It said the
presidents would probably talk again today.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin now claims to have endorsed the troop deployment.
However, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday initially
assured the White House that Russian troops then on the move would
not enter Kosovo. Once they did cross the Kosovo border, he called
their deployment a mistake and pledged their withdrawal. The troops
were thought to be under orders from Russian generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, quite frankly, making them appear a little inept, as
opposed to what they're attempting to do and demonstrate they have
some international muscle,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,
senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Fox
News Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which helped broker the peace plan, now wants to play a
greater role in the peacekeeping force. It balked at Western
demands that its soldiers must be under NATO command and that it
would not be allowed its own sector. NATO had created five sectors
to be patrolled by specific allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be a part of a K-For force. We want them to be a
part of it. I think they got a little bit ahead of themselves but
there are now military-to-military discussions going on and
obviously political discussions going on,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said NATO will not relent on the issues of unity of
command and a Russian sector. She said to give Russia its own area
to patrol could lead to the partitioning of Kosovo, which the West
will not allow.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, called the
Russian action ``a bizarre incident.'' He told CBS' Face the Nation
that the issue must be resolved politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still there. We are in the area with a sizable number
of troops. This is and has been a political issue first and
foremost. There is no desire to have any confrontation and we're
doing everything we can to avoid such an unfortunate event.
Instead, we're going to resolve this through political means,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said NATO had no plans to ``make substantial use'' of the
airport and the K-For's deployment into Kosovo is unaffected. Some
10,000 allied soldiers, out of an expected force of 50,000, were in
Kosovo
</P>
<P>
   ``They were to be an advance party in the event that Russian
troops were flown into the airfield,'' he said, dismissing any hint
of danger in their deployment. ``Your dealing with the actions and
the intent of some very high level people in that capital (Moscow)
and really they have to account for what happened. All we know is
we have a very small number of Russian troops there. They are not
impacting on our move.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander estimated that about 11,000 of the 40,000 Yugoslav
forces have withdrawn so far. ``There's every indication that
they're doing their best to pullout on schedule,'' he said.
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must remove all his forces
from Kosovo by next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best face on the Russia advance was Jamie Shea, the
NATO spokesman, who appeared on ABC's This Week. ``I think we were
surprised, quite frankly, but on the other hand it's good the
Russians were in such a hurry to join us,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said British Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson, commander of NATO
forces in Kosovo, would not order the Russians to leave. ``This
issue is being worked at a number of levels and I have no doubt
that within the very near future we will find effective
coordination arrangements to get the Russians fully on board,''
Shea said.

WOMEN'S SOCCER ON WORLD STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who are these girls of summer? You've probably
heard of Mia Hamm, but how about Nigeria's ``Marvelous'' Mercy
Akide? Or Mexico's Laurie Hill?
</P>
<P>
   Looking for funny stories? How about Ghana, which calls its team
the Black Queens. China jokingly accused the Ghana players of
climbing coconut trees after their fitness played a big role in two
close friendly matches with the heavily favored Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mango trees, too,'' joked Wolanyo Agrah, the general
secretary of the Ghanaian soccer federation.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup less than a week away, its
theme _ ``If we build it, they will come'' _ is looking more
dignified each day. This actually may become the breakthrough event
that WWC president Marla Messing has been talking about. The
tournament gets under way Saturday in New York and San Jose, with a
doubleheader scheduled for the Rose Bowl on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it has all the personalities of a big event, which is
being billed as the single largest women's sporting event ever in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   WWC and FIFA officials have sold more than 388,000 tickets for
the 10 venues throughout the country. WWC hopes to sell 400,000 to
500,000 tickets before the tournament ends.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also believe they can put a half-million spectators
in the seats by selling out the 77,716-seat Giants Stadium for the
American and tournament opener Saturday and the 92,542-seat Rose
Bowl for the championship game July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers easily exceed the total of 112,000 tickets sold
for the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden or any other single
women's event held here previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well beyond what we expected it to be,'' said Messing.
``The demand is greater than we had projected. It's one of two
things: The people we thought would buy are buying a whole lot
earlier, or a lot of people are interested in coming to the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy said they will prove wrong the
naysayers who believed a women's event such as this shouldn't be
held in large stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said when we started this World Cup, `You can't do it
on a big stage; you can't do it in big stadiums. You won't draw,'''
Foudy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us what we can't do and we'll do it. We love these types
of obstacles. This is the opportunity for us to show the world our
sport and what we've done with it. Women's athletics needs to know
it can put on a big event and be successful. The hardest part is
they don't want to take the risk. We were fortunate enough that we
had great backing to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, president of the 1994 World Cup held in the
United States, said staging the final at the Rose Bowl
distinguishes the granddaddy site of college football as the
granddaddy of soccer worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the (1984) Olympics and put the soccer final in the
Rose Bowl and sold it out,'' he said. ``We had the (1994) World Cup
and put the soccer final there and sold it out. And now, with the
Women's World Cup, we've put the final there again. What we're
going for is the soccer hat trick.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's on. Sixteen countries will play a total of 32 games
during the tournament, which will be aired nationally by ABC, ESPN
or ESPN2, in addition to overseas television.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., China, Norway and Germany are the top seeds in the
four four-team groups; it is being billed as the most competitive
World Cup of the three that will have been staged since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the top team to the bottom, it is a lot closer and in the
middle it is a lot more bunched,'' said U.S. coach Tony DiCicco.
``There are so many iffy teams capable of having a tremendous
tournament that the chance of upsets are tremendous. Even those
lower tier of teams are emerging as dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. dominated the inaugural Women's World Cup eight years
ago by outscoring its opponents 25-5. U.S. defender Brandi Chastain
says that won't happen again, namely because other countries have
continued to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, defending World Cup champion Norway defeated the U.S.
1-0 in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden. The
U.S. avenged that defeat by capturing the gold medal at the 1996
Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are a lot more teams like Norway that can defeat
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is not the U.S. getting worse or people
catching up,'' Chastain said. ``It's other countries becoming more
involved with women's soccer. These countries always had the
potential to have good teams, it was just a matter of their
federations getting behind them and letting them play. The battle
was never, `Could they play soccer?'; it was always about who would
allow them to play soccer.''

SPORADIC VIOLENCE ACCOMPANIES NATO'S ENTRY INTO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Outbursts of violence marked NATO's second day in
Kosovo, as peacekeeping troops shot and killed two Serbs and some
Serb soldiers appeared to be torching ethnic Albanian homes on
their way out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a small contingent of Russian forces blocked a
British peacekeeping mission from entering the airport in the
provincial capital of Pristina, a product of the ongoing dispute
between Russia and NATO over what role Russian troops should play.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin spoke
Sunday for the first time since Russian troops unexpectedly entered
Kosovo ahead of NATO, apparently at Yeltsin's command. Despite what
aides said was a ``constructive'' conversation, the main sticking
point _ whether Russians should be allowed to patrol their own zone
outside NATO control _ remained unresolved, and Russia refused to
back down from what a day earlier had been dismissed as a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rest of the peacekeeping mission appeared to be
moving rapidly ahead, with Yugoslav troops retreating out of Kosovo
at a pace US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright described as
``terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching the fact that the Serb withdrawals were
happening on or ahead of schedule,'' Albright said. In Macedonia,
NATO's top commander, General Wesley Clark, said Serbs had given
``every indication they're doing their best'' to exit the province,
which, according to the peace agreement, they have seven days left
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's incidents of violence seemed the result of isolated
attacks. In the southern town of Prizren, German troops shot and
killed a Serb, and critically wounded another, after the men sped
past in a car and fired shots out the window. A German soldier was
injured by a bullet that hit his arm.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, British forces said they killed an off-duty Serb
police officer who began firing on them. Some 25 miles to the
south, two German reporters were killed when unidentified snipers
shot at their car in a Canadian-controlled sector, according to a
Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Pristina suburb of Sofali, which is mostly inhabited by
ethnic Albanians, several houses were seen burning from the road,
where Serb troops blocked Western troops and journalists from
proceeding. The library of a historic mosque in Pristina was set on
fire after the explosion of a gasoline bomb.
</P>
<P>
   One German soldier said armed Serbs were everywhere, calling
them ``drunks with guns and grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   However, no casualties were reported in the streets of Pristina
or Prizren, despite the enormous crowds of ethnic Albanians who
gathered to form a gauntlet for departing Serb troops _ and a warm
and cheering receiving line for NATO. Gunshots rang through the
air, and some Kosovars hurled stones at departing Serbs before
showering roses on arriving NATO tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States also added to the 60 US troops
already in Kosovo, sending in 400 soldiers from the US Army's 82d
Airborne Division along with nine tanks and several Bradley armored
vehicles, according to Pentagon officials. In general, NATO troops,
who will ultimately number 50,000, kept moving into their specific
sectors continued as planned despite the confrontation with the
Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``No plans have been disrupted whatsoever by this bizarre
event,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   But the British Army did appear to have lost time setting up
camp at the Pristina airport, where a Russian armored personnel
carrier Sunday refused to let a group of 50 British soldiers travel
to the airport, provoking the commander of the British unit,
Brigadier Adrian Freer, to shout and gesture. His efforts were in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian refusal to allow NATO to set up its headquarters at
the airport came as US officials refused to let Russia even
consider its main objective: patrolling a separate zone in the
north of Kosovo, where most of the province's Serbs live.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, speaking Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, insisted the
Russians ``will not have their own sector and the unity of command
must be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added: ``The Russian component is about 200, so I
think we don't want to kind of overestimate all of this. They got
in. They got in ahead of themselves, is my sense about this. I
don't think that we should get overexcited about what is going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Sunday that Clinton and Yeltsin agreed in their
phone conversation ``to continue an exchange of opinions'' on
Russia's role in the international peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone will stay where they are during the
transitional stage,'' said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Clinton are expected to meet next Sunday in Cologne,
Germany, at a summit of the leaders of Russia and the Group of
Seven industrial powers called to discuss the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's takeover of Pristina's airport stunned NATO and put new
strains on diplomatic relations already badly frayed by Moscow's
opposition to the alliance's airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, talks in Moscow ended without a conclusive agreement. US
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said the United States was
ready to concede Russia a ``zone of responsibility'' in Kosovo
under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials expressed frustration with the US
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mentality is still, unfortunately, not aimed at
partnership,'' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev
told Russian television. ``American diplomacy does not want to meet
Russia halfway, to let it have a worthy place'' in the peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news agencies reported that the military would like to
add to the force in Kosovo, but Talbott said Russia promised not to
deploy any more troops in Kosovo without NATO approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect any more surprise steps from the Russian
side,'' he said after his meeting with Ivanov. It was Ivanov who
promised Friday that Moscow would not order its troops to enter
Kosovo, hours before the Russian peacekeeping troops did just that.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ivanov had called the move a ``mistake'' and said the
troops would be ordered out of Kosovo. But Sunday, Ivanov shrugged
off the fact that he had been unaware that Russian troops were
about to enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the chief of the general staff, and I don't give
orders to troops,'' Ivanov said. ``Someone gives orders. Why do I
have to know about that?''

GERMAN SOLDIERS KILL SERB IN SHOOTOUT

<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ German soldiers shot and killed one Serb
gunman and wounded a second in a firefight here Sunday, a deadly
end to a tense first day of the international peacekeeping presence
here.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the Serb gunmen were
paramilitaries or civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings followed a day of intense hostility between
Albanians and Serbs, and Serbs and peacekeepers, on what was the
first day of a scheduled three-day Serb military pullout from
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians who thronged the streets of the old town for the first
time in months were stunned to have the fresh peace broken by the
shootings, which occurred at about 9 p.m., just after Albanians
were jubilantly celebrating the foreign troops' entrance into town.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the center of the city on a main street along
the Bistrica River, sniper fire crackled from a hill and houses.
German soldiers took cover and began shooting back.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans' heavy fire blasted a yellow Lada car with two
occupants. One was killed immediately, the other was critically
wounded. German soldiers said that the men shot first and that
grenades and semiautomatic weapons were found in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's ZDF television showed video of the two Serbs shooting
from inside the car close to a German army checkpoint. The arrival
of 1,200 German and Dutch Kosovo Force troops was meant to turn
over control of the Prizren region from the Serb military to
international peacekeepers. The shootings were a disturbing sign
that some Serbs will not withdraw quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon, marauding Serb soldiers stormed Prizren's
central square, beating ethnic Albanians and barely quelling a
stone-throwing attack by ethnic Albanians against a group of
outnumbered Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb soldiers hit chanting Albanians with the butts of their
guns, and fired two shots into the air before German soldiers
persuaded them to lower their weapons and retreat. Some Albanians
had been pelting rocks at the packed cars of departing Serb
civilians, who were afraid to stay in the almost-liberated southern
Kosovar city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come back again, and we will kill you!'' a retreating
Serb soldier yelled at a crowd of Albanian residents, who were
spitting and shouting epithets.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3,000 Serb police, army soldiers and
paramilitaries, considered the most brutal of the Serb military
contingents, are supposed to be out of Prizren by Tuesday. The city
is in the west of Kosovo, where some of the heaviest fighting
occurred, and where some of the worst atrocities are believed to
have been committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like cowboys, going through the streets, shooting
into some house,'' said Armid Berisha, a 40-year-old car mechanic.
Many residents also reported that the Serb paramilitaries had been
looting in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Serb paramilitaries posted a checkpoint on main road leading out
of Prizren, stopping many civilians from entering or leaving. An
Albanian translator was pulled out of a car and harassed by a
gun-wielding paramilitary soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an action like this, we will always have personal
friction and emotional problems that will impede a very quick
carrying-out'' of the transition of power, said German Brigadier
General Fritz von Horff. But ``while we may not have everything
under complete control at the moment, we have enough of a presence
in town to have a safe withdrawal of all forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, virtually imprisoned for months by the
overwhelming presence of the Serb military, threw flowers at the
K-FOR tanks, waved and chanted ``NATO! NATO'' as the tanks cruised
the winding streets. They lined up to have their photos taken with
the foreign soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs made their displeasure obvious at the peacekeepers'
arrival. They erected illegal checkpoints for K-FOR and Western
vehicles as they made the trek from Kukes, in northern Albania, to
Prizren. German and Dutch K-FOR tanks and vehicles were not stopped
from rolling into town. But paramilitaries glared at the NATO
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In town, the streets were filled with nervous Serbs. ``I love
Albanians. I want to stay, but I am very afraid,'' said 76-year-old
Kustist Zorka, weeping softly. She wanted to deliver some bread to
her son, a Yugoslav soldier who was leaving town, but she could not
make it through the crowds and the Serb checkpoint to find him, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was soon surrounded by young Albanians. ``How many Albanians
did your son kill?'' Ilir Morina, 19, shouted at her.
</P>
<P>
   Then he shrugged. ``The old woman is safe,'' he said. ``How can
I do anything to her? But I don't know how they can stay here,''
Morina said of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees trickled across the Kosovo border with Albania, against
the urgings of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The UN agency is warning ethnic Albanians that it is not yet safe
to go back _ a point that was made clear by Sunday's activity in
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   The area between Albania and Prizren is a stark picture of the
ravages and damage of war. The streets are pocked with holes from
de-mining, and KFOR says many more mines have been planted only
inches off the road.
</P>
<P>
   House and restaurants were burned and gutted. NATO bombs have
left huge craters in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians went at least as far as the border Sunday
morning, camping out early to greet the peacekeeping troops. By
mid-day, the Albanians had raced over the border crossing and
looted the Serb border checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   One man from Prizren was delighted to find his own license
plates, which Serb police had confiscated from him when he was
forced over the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put these on my car,'' said 60-year-old Kurtish
Krasniqi. ``And if I can, I will go back to Kosovo tomorrow.''

ALBANIAN SISTERS THANK SERB POLICEMAN FOR SURVIVAL

   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Pale and shaking with excitement, the
Veliu sisters, Fikrete and Sadete, emerged into the sunlight
Sunday, strolling through their hometown for the first time in 12
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They were giddy that the war was over, appalled at the looted
shops, hopeful that their loved ones would return from exile.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town, anxious Serbs like Ranko Davidovic, a
23-year-old student, stood in the square, arms folded as NATO tanks
rumbled by.
</P>
<P>
   For the Veliu sisters, who are Albanian, and Davidovic, who is a
Serb, the arrival of NATO troops means different things and
inspires different emotions. Ethnic Albanians see the NATO troops
as liberators, as guarantors that the 850,000 refugees forced to
leave Kosovo will be able to return home soon.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in this town of 60,000 are not quite sure what to make of
the new occupying army. They bristle at foreigners replacing their
own troops. But there is also a grudging acceptance that NATO
troops are needed because Serbs fear that without the soldiers they
will be driven out by Albanians seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Urosevac Sunday is happening throughout Kosovo,
as the Kosovo-Force, or K-FOR, peacekeepers fanned out across this
province and residents adjusted to the shifting balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Like every town in Kosovo, Urosevac is in transition, as an
occupying army rolls in, a defeated one rolls out, and those who
briefly ruled the roost worry about how their former neighbors will
react when they get back.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians who stayed here, mostly hidden, seemed to
appear from nowhere Sunday, lining the main road just outside town
to cheer the British troops that are part of the K-FOR vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Little boys used mud to spell NATO and UCK, the Albanian letters
for the Kosovo Liberation Army, on discarded pieces of styrofoam as
a greeting for the British soldiers. Little girls brought forth
bouquets of flowers and kissed soldiers on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The Veliu sisters, Fikrete, 22, and Sadete, 25, said they and
five other members of their family spent the war in their house on
the outskirts of the town. Their pale white skin lent credence to
their story.
</P>
<P>
   The family had stockpiled food, but they were virtual prisoners
in their home. Most other Albanians, who make up about 75 percent
of the town, fled, including their sister and her seven children.
But they decided to take their chances and stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons they decided to stay was that a Serb
neighbor named Dragan, a local police officer, promised he would
protect them. He kept his word Saturday night. As NATO troops
prepared to enter the town, some masked Serb paramilitary police
came into their neighborhood, determined to torch the Albanian
homes.
</P>
<P>
   As the terrified Velius huddled inside, listening to the
conversation, they heard Dragan convince the paramilitaries, who
were not from Urosevac, that the homes around his were not
Albanian. Those same paramilitaries were blamed by residents here
for looting shops before they left town Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Dragan packed his car full of clothing and his wife and
four children. He and all other Serb police and troops must leave
the province under terms of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to us and said, `I'm sorry, I have to go. I can't live
here anymore.' It was very hard to say goodbye. If he wasn't there,
we wouldn't be alive,'' said Sadete.
</P>
<P>
   The Velius vowed to protect Dragan's home if any Albanians come
looking to burn it in revenge. Fikrete, however, said she doubted
that such reprisals would be common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do what they did to us,'' said Fikrete.
</P>
<P>
   Fikrete said their existence during the war was a combination of
sheer boredom and, when they heard gunshots outside or thought the
police were moving in, sheer terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed home, watched TV, waited for NATO,'' said Fikrete.
</P>
<P>
   As the Albanians come back, the Serbs leave. On the road that
led out of this town, a half-mile convoy of Yugoslav army vehicles,
and passenger cars filled with civilians, waited to leave. The
troops were withdrawing from Kosovo, some with their families. The
main road into Pristina was choked with NATO armored vehicles and
Serb refugees from the countryside, fleeing north to get away, they
said, from the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA was very much on the minds of Serbs in Urosevac Sunday,
too. Zvonko Janicijevic, 42, was one of several refugees from the
nearby village of Stimlje who showed up in town saying that he and
his family had been chased out of their homes by the KLA Saturday
morning, as British troops were on their way north from Macedonia.
He said the Albanian rebels sprayed houses with gunfire, and that
he was barely able to get out with his two children.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA ``took advantage of the vacuum,'' said Janicijevic,
whose story spread like wildfire through an already worried Serb
population. ``They are not terrorists, they are bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here are ready to believe that the KLA has been given a
free hand by NATO. And yet there was little animosity expressed
toward NATO troops by Serbs. On the contrary, many came out to wave
and shake hands with members of the Royal Highland Fusilliers of
the British Army.
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO tank rumbled through the town center, Janicijevic
waved enthusiastically at a soldier whose head was outside the
tank. The Scottish soldier waved back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see them,'' Janicijevic said. ``I want K-FOR in my
village.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish soldiers said they had been warmly greeted by most
local residents. But they said some withdrawing Serb troops had
shouted, ``NATO go home!''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Scottish soldiers, Daryl Gibson, said he appreciated
the humiliation felt by the retreating Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute they're holding out, the next they're told to clear
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the local water plant, who would not give his
name, said Saturday's heavy thunderstorms had knocked out water to
the town, but that repairmen could not get to the site 4 miles away
because the area was crawling with KLA rebels. He said he appealed
to K-FOR for an armed escort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general told me they didn't have enough people to go up,''
he said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Nemanja Stefanovic, 35, said that local Serbs were watching the
K-FOR troops, which he called ``UN troops,'' to see how they act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the UN troops will guarantee our safety,'' he
said.

WASHINGTON'S MAYOR FACES A CAMPAIGN-FINANCE INQUIRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So far Anthony A. Williams, mayor of the District
of Columbia, has committed few of the ethical and managerial
blunders that characterized the previous administration, but now
campaign-finance charges are threatening his squeaky-clean image.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Williams took over a city plagued with financial
crises and began making striking changes. But now the city's office
of campaign finance is asserting that Williams violated city law by
not promptly disclosing two consulting arrangements in July and
August 1998, when he was running for office. A hearing on the issue
is set for this week.
</P>
<P>
   A clause in the campaign law requires candidates to report
changes in their income or alterations to their financial
disclosures within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Williams served as the city's chief financial officer for three
years before quitting to run for mayor, a race he won last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has shown confidence in Williams, passing bills that
would shift authority for the day-to-day operation of the District
government back to its elected officials from the control board
that Congress created to oversee its finances in 1995. In a speech
this spring at the National Press Club in Washington, Williams said
that ``restoring faith and confidence in the government'' was a
major focus of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Marion S. Barry, who did not seek re-election last year,
preceded Williams as mayor, serving three terms from 1978 to 1990
and returning to office in 1994 after a six-month prison term on
drug charges. Barry's personality and politics shaped the District
for almost two decades, establishing a reputation for
out-of-control government.
</P>
<P>
   Williams filed a financial statement on July 17, 1998, about a
month after resigning as the city's chief financial officer and
announcing his candidacy for mayor. The statement indicated no
outside income. But two weeks later, on July 31, Williams accepted
a consulting fee of $30,000 from the Arthur Andersen accounting
company. On August 6, he signed a contract with Nationsbank Corp.
for $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until April, in financial statements that all
District officials are required to file annually, that Williams
disclosed information on his outside employment. After that filing,
the office of campaign finance asked for more information, and on
May 28, Williams complied.
</P>
<P>
   Williams issued a statement saying that ``nothing improper
occurred'' in the work he conducted for the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have disclosed the fact of my outside employment
earlier and inadvertently failed to do so,'' Williams said. ``For
this oversight, I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has been ordered to appear at a hearing before the
director of the campaign finance office and the District's board of
elections and ethics on June 16. The campaign finance office could
impose a $1,000 fine, $500 for each violation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams contends that his work was not a conflict of interest,
and that the work with the two companies did not ``involve their
relationship with the District of Columbia.'' However, Peggy
Armstrong, the mayor's spokesman, said Williams would provide any
information that would be helpful. The city agency has asked for

<P>
   ESCANABA, Mich. _ As the House of Representatives prepares to
vote this week on gun-control legislation, the popularity of
hunting and the nearly universal ownership of guns in many rural
areas has put congressmen from these areas at special political
risk _ particularly Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat whose district
encompasses Michigan's northernmost reaches.
</P>
<P>
   Shootings in schools have alarmed millions of Americans over the
last several years, but here and in many other northern Michigan
communities, the first day of deer hunting season each November is
an official school holiday so that children as young as 5 can join
their parents in the woods. While the minimum legal age for
shooting a deer in Michigan is 15, the law is widely flouted, with
boys and girls as young s 10 often bagging their first buck during
their holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hunts that day,'' said Jason Malner, a ninth grader
who owns three rifles and two shotguns. ``I use the 0.243 for deer,
I use the 12-gauges for rabbits and partridge and I use the 0.22s
for fooling around and shooting at targets,'' he said as he ate a
steak at the Buck Inn Restaurant here with his mother, Pam, who
confirmed his gun inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Stupak, a four-term Democrat whose wooded district is three
times the size of New Jersey, shares his constituents' love of deer
hunting, going out every year with his 19- and 16-year-old sons. A
former police officer in Escanaba who also spent a decade as a
Michigan State Police trooper, Stupak was one of about 30 Democrats
who crossed party lines to oppose gun-control legislation _ at
least, until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the recent school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,
Stupak has publicly suggested that he would vote for legislation
this month to require child-proof safety locks on guns, mandate
background checks at certain gun shows and ban the import of
high-capacity ammunition clips. But Stupak said in an interview on
Saturday that he would vote against any broader legislation, like
raising the minimum age for buying a handgun to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   Because most members of Congress staked out their positions on
gun control long ago and have not changed them much, Stupak's
openness to any new legislation at all has brought national
attention and lobbying by gun control advocates and opponents
alike.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has sent out at least three
rounds of letters to members living in Stupak's district, asking
them to try to persuade him to change his mind, and has paid for
advertisements on a radio station in Traverse City, said Stupak,
who received copies of the letters because he is a member of the
rifle association. The association declined to comment. Stupak said
he had also heard that gun-control advocates would start taking out
opposing radio and newspaper advertisements in his district on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews over the weekend with two dozen of Stupak's
constituents here in this logging town of 15,000 people, 320 miles
northwest of Detroit, and with seven constituents in Marquette, a
shipping and tourism town 60 miles north of Escanaba, suggest that
Stupak is running some political risks by showing an interest in
gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents are leery of anything labeled gun control. Yet
when asked about the specific rule changes favored by Stupak, many
said they were in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest opponents of gun control seem the most willing to
base their vote in next year's election on Stupak's gun legislation
vote. Keith Grabowski, 47, a burial vault salesman who attended a
walleye fishing tournament over the weekend with his 10-year-old
son, said he had known Stupak since high school. Stupak grew up in
a nearby town and had dated, and later married, the best friend of
Grabowski's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of friendship and consistent political support,
Grabowski said he would probably not vote for Stupak again if he
endorsed a broad gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here, people have lived with guns, and sure, there's an
occasional accident, but if the kids are taught right there's no
problem at all,'' Grabowski said, adding proudly that his son,
Justin, had shot 12 partridges during hunting season last year.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near Grabowski at the fishing tournament's headquarters
at the local fairgrounds on Saturday were Jeff and LeeAnne Iverson.
Iverson, 30, a truck mechanic who hunts deer and bear, said the
government should enforce existing laws better instead of drafting
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Iverson, 25, a nursery school teacher who accompanies
her husband on hunts but does not do any shooting, said she favored
safety locks on guns and more background checks because ``too many
guns that aren't used for hunting get out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In Marquette, Diane Botsford, 42, a nurse who has a 13-year-old
son, said that she wanted all the restrictions favored by Stupak
and more. ``Definitely we need to crack down. Guns should not be in
the hands of kids,'' she said as she walked her labrador next to
the marina.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Buck Inn Restaurant in Escanaba, Mrs. Malner said
that she favored more checks on the backgrounds of gun buyers.
``You're never in that much of a hurry to get a gun that you can't
wait for a background check, unless you want it for something
bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Malner, who cleans offices at night, said that
teen-agers like her son Jason would inevitably own and handle guns,
so safety locks were useless. ``If they want the gun, they're going
to get it off of there,'' she said, later adding that though the
family's guns were not locked up, Jason was allowed to use them
only while hunting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant's bar, across from a stuffed black bear head,
four drivers of cement mixers agreed that it was pointless and
unnecessary to put limits on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to go shoot someone, I'm not going to buy it in a
shop, I'm not going to buy it at a show or anywhere I have to give
my name,'' said one driver, Donald St. Cyr. ``I'm going to buy it
on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But St. Cyr said that he would vote again next year for Stupak
regardless of the congressman's votes on gun control. Stupak
frequently tours the district, and among politicians, St. Cyr said,
``he's the only one I see other than at election time.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Another driver, Mel W. Hanson, 58, said he had never run into a
problem with guns in a lifetime of hunting deer, partridge and
rabbits. ``I've never been threatened up here by anyone with a
gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles away, on the shores of a bay of Lake Michigan, a city
park ranger on a bicycle, Robert Freidhoff, 20, said that he and
some of his friends thought something should be done to limit the
availability of guns to children but that the issue divided the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're split right down the middle,'' Freidhoff said.
``You ask one person, they'd say yes; you ask another person,
they'd say no.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Stupak said that his biggest concern was that if he voted for
even a limited bill, he would be accused at the next election of
restricting people's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' he said. &QL;

EX-PRESIDENT VOWS TO SIT ON SIDELINES DURING SON'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ For months, George W. Bush has fretted
over the legacy of his father, the former president. While the
younger Bush made his fortune and was elected governor of Texas
partly on his father's name, he worried that his chances of
becoming president would be hurt by the mixed memories of his
father's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on the eve of Governor Bush's visit to New Hampshire,
which holds the nation's first primary, father and son seemed to
strike a deal. Former president Bush vowed to stay out of his son's
campaign and said, ``I don't care about the issues.'' Governor Bush
responded by saying that he didn't care about losing because he had
his father's love.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure no one missed the message, the two George Bushes
discussed the matter in one of the most unusual press conferences
in their family's history before a throng of 300 journalists at the
family compound, at the edge of a flower-scented promontory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unpopular. I was,'' the former president said with
uncommon bluntness, when asked why his low standing in 1992 has
been followed by his son's rapid rise. ``Maybe I'm a little
egotistical, but surveys I've seen have been rather pleasant about
me. . . . Let him find his own way. He doesn't need a voice from
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both Bushes have a common ground that helps explain the
son's ambition: Both were shaped by the father's 1992 election
defeat. While receiving little coverage at the time, George W. Bush
played a key role in the campaign, serving as a go-between with
campaign officials and his father and often offering strategic
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sky high after Desert Storm, only to sink . . . pretty
darn low,'' the former president said. ``He was with me in the ups
and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's friends say he is still stung by his father's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first-son syndrome,'' said Mary Matalin, the
political director of President Bush's 1992 campaign, who often
worked in coordination with George W. Bush. ``George W. always was
his father's most trusted, first-among-equals son. He was the one
we all went to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, George W., who last November was elected to a second
term as governor, said his father's loss had ``liberated'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have half his friends and all his enemies,'' the governor
said. ``If things don't work out, I'll still have a father and a
mother and a wife that love me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to the family estate on Walker's Point, where
Texas and US flags snapped in the ocean breeze, he said: ``This is
an appropriate place to talk about this because this is the place
we find love and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his White House years, former President Bush had come
to this sprawling, shingled home by the sea to seek a month-long
respite from the turmoil of Washington. He would race in his
cigarette boat, power-walk on Goose Rocks Beach and play endless
rounds of golf. He usually kept the press at bay, meeting perhaps a
few times each season with a small group of reporters. By the time
he ran for reelection, one of his slogans was ``Annoy the media _
Reelect Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, with many of the news media who had covered his
presidency now focused on his son, the mood was giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were you in '92?'' Barbara Bush asked by way of
greeting. The ``photo opportunity'' of the two Bush couples turned
into a 30-minute question and answer session that focused almost
entirely on why the elder Bush had been unpopular and his son is
not. Throughout it all, the former president seemed reflective and
tranquil. When he tripped on his syntax, just as in the old days,
he exclaimed, ``I'm the same guy!''
</P>
<P>
   All around this quintessential Yankee tourist haven, the Bushes
are not just back in town; they also seem to be back in power, even
though George W. Bush has a long way to go before winning the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father was never comfortable in this role,'' said one top
adviser who has worked for both Bushes and who asked not to be
identified. ``George W. clearly is. His father would make joking
references to the `vision thing,' like saying, `Is this the place
where I have to insert this vision part into the speech?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said, ``I can't tell whether (former President Bush)
is more delighted that his son is running for president or that he
doesn't have to be in the middle of it and take all the
hurly-burly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor came here to celebrate his father's 75th
birthday Saturday. But the timing of the visit attracted far more
attention, tucked between campaign visits to Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing about the two George Bushes is how
differently they prepared for the presidency. Both men started out
in similar ways. George H. W. Bush gained notoriety because he was
the son of the former senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush. Both
went to Phillips Academy, the elite prep school in Andover, Mass.,
and Yale University. Both men went to West Texas hoping to strike
it rich in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   But here the similarities end. The senior Bush spent much of his
life preparing to be president, as a congressman, ambassador to
China, Republican Party chairman, and vice president. The junior
Bush, who never thought much about politics during his youth, lost
a race for Congress, got rich partly as a result of deals with his
father's friends, and became governor partly because of his
father's fame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, then-President Bush spent much of the fall campaign
ridiculing the idea that a governor with no foreign policy
experience could aspire to the White House. Bush, asked Sunday
whether his son has properly prepared to be president, said that
``everybody has his own experience. I had no comparable executive
experience . . . running the state of Texas as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush, who always touted his past when running for
president, made fun of such a strategy Sunday. ``I was called the
`resume president,' but I never felt people were saying that with
awe and respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are many ways in which Governor Bush is emulating
his father. Former president Bush's call for a ``thousand points of
light'' has turned into Governor Bush's proposal for ``armies of
compassion.'' The former president's push for a ``kinder, gentler''
America has morphed into the governor's declaration that he is a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Bush is trying to avoid some of the problems
encountered by his father, who was goaded into running to the
political right in the '92 race in an effort to beat Patrick
Buchanan and other conservatives in the primaries, and then was
unable to reposition himself in the political middle for the
general election against Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the surprise of some aides, Governor Bush last week
appeared to set himself up to repeat one of his father's most
famous mistakes by declaring that he would oppose any tax increase
if elected president, echoing former President Bush's famously
broken vow, ``Read my lips, no new taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how the former president vividly recalls that he was
unpopular when he left the White House, he said that he doubted he
would appear at many more events with his son. But if all else
fails, he said he had a backup plan: ``Unleash Barbara.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Sitting in the balcony of
his unfinished mansion high on a hill that overlooks the Arroyo
Hondo River here, Johnny Ventura was the picture of contentment
recently as family members came and went around him.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter-in-law brought his baby granddaughter over for some
cuddling as he ate lunch, his doting wife kept ordering dishes to
the table, and one of his seven children came over to chat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of a life Ventura, 59, had crafted for himself
in semiretirement after more than 40 years in show business as the
Dominican Republic's most popular merengue singer. He dissolved his
band in 1992 and cut down on performances and decided, he said, to
pay more attention to his business as a distributor for Amway.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed last year when his friend and fellow longtime
politician in the Dominican Revolutionary Party, Jose Francisco
Pena Gomez, died of cancer in the middle of a campaign to become
mayor of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was Pena Gomez's running mate, for the job of vice
mayor. Ventura had filled the position before and describes it as
``almost decorative.'' He had little choice but to step in as
mayoral candidate, with Peggy Cabral, Pena Gomez's widow, filling
in for vice mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ventura is Santo Domingo's reluctant mayor _ not as
contented or as universally adored anymore after his first year in
office. And he is deeply involved in the city's most pressing
issue: trash.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the magnitude of the problem, and so visible is the
uncollected garbage around here _ in gutters, on medians, in
rivers, on hillsides _ that a cruise line dropped Santo Domingo
from its itinerary this year after passengers complained of the
city's filth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trash is killing us _ there are mosquitoes, mice,'' said
Demetrio Bobea, 43, a handyman here. He said he still dances
Venturo's merengues, but in a bad mood.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is no stranger to politics, having for decades combined
musical stardom with commitment to his political party, a social
democratic group he joined 37 years ago and calls ``the party of
people's hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Juan de Dios Ventura Soriano to a poor Santo Domingo
family, Ventura worked odd jobs while going to school before he won
a radio amateur contest in 1956 and abandoned dreams of becoming an
architect to find fame as a performer.
</P>
<P>
   With a deep baritone and an elegant stage presence _ he is a
slim 6-foot-1 _ Ventura, who is also an arranger and composer, is
internationally recognized for merengue of picaresque lyrics and
blistering dancing and for infusing music of rural roots with urban
grit.
</P>
<P>
   He still manages to sneak in performances, making appearances on
a daily television variety show here, ``Super Afternoon,'' and
playing at weddings, private parties and, in April, at a campaign
rally in Panama for a losing presidential candidate, Martin
Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura, who also acquired a law degree, said that after
growing up apolitical under the military dictatorship of Rafael
Trujillo, he counted himself among the youth emboldened to demand
and work for change after the dictator died and his abuses became
well known.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to help in his country's transition to democracy,
Ventura said, he served as Santo Domingo vice mayor and in the
Dominican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But being mayor is another matter. ``The mayor gets the
complaints of citizens,'' Ventura said. ``People don't think their
problem will be solved unless they see the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   While recognized by both critics and fans as honest and well
meaning, he presides over a city government with scarce resources
and a bureaucracy bloated by political patronage. He has also
wrestled with the central government, which is ruled by a different
party, over control of municipal matters, including garbage
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura sees disorderly population growth in Santo Domingo, now
home to about three million, as a fundamental flaw that generates
the trash problem and many others.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that the city is short at least 675,000 housing
units and that ``the immense majority of the people of Santo
Domingo live in inadequate housing.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour of the city he pointed at the illegal housing
that has encroached even in expensive neighborhoods _ clusters of
structures made out of a patchwork of cement blocks and scraps of
wood and zinc that sit perilously along riverbanks and hillsides or
are wedged in under bridges and other housing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which Ventura attributes to the influx of Haitians
and Dominicans from the countryside coming to the city for jobs,
was blamed for many of the deaths during Hurricane Georges last
year. But squatters have rebuilt in many of the same spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police realize what's going on, there are 600 little
houses'' Ventura said. ``Look how they throw the trash everywhere
because garbage trucks can't get in. And they blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he needs control of the contract that the national
government has with the company that picks up trash in 80 percent
of the city for better oversight. He contends the collections often
are incomplete in the coverage area. But his critics note that he
could use the city's resources in the meantime to at least clean up
tourist areas like the old section known as the ``colonial zone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They also fault him for failing to use his popularity as an
entertainer to rise above political warfare and to summon support
for this and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who said he was working on blanketing the city with
trash receptacles, said he was also seeking an inventory of
government properties, looking for space to build affordable
housing to sell to people and ``turn squatters into homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My great dream is the reurbanization of the city of Santo
Domingo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public grumbling, some city dwellers still honk and
wave when they see him. ``People still love me a little,'' the
mayor said half-jokingly as two young men pulled alongside to wave
hello with big smiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he said, he is still asked to perform. His
latest recording, to be released this year, is his 100th. Last year
he published a book about his rags-to-riches story titled ``Johnny
Ventura: A Little Bit of Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't retire until my faculties'' fail me, he said. ``I feel
I'm a better singer now.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about his political ambitions after four years as
mayor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather finish my term,'' he said, ``and go play with my
grandchildren.''

   LE BOURGET, France _ Perhaps it is just the home turf advantage.
But at back-to-back news conferences at the biennial Paris Air Show
here Sunday, the contrast between Boeing Co. and its archrival,
Airbus Industrie, could not have been more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   While Alan Mulally, the president of Boeing's commercial
airplane business, politely answered questions from the packed
auditorium of reporters, Nokl Forgeard, the French chairman of
Airbus, was mobbed by photographers who treated him like a visiting
rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally repeated Boeing's view that there was no need for a new
superjumbo jet carrying 600 passengers and he caused a stir when he
predicted that Boeing's orders this year would be just 30 to 40
percent of what they were in 1998. Boeing later said that what
Mulally meant to say was that orders for commercial jets from both
manufacturers would be down 30 to 40 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard was much more loose and upbeat. He said Airbus, which
is owned by four European partners, expected to see sales rise to
$17 billion this year from $13.3 billion in 1998. He also
reiterated a commitment to build its proposed A3XX superjumbo and
to transform itself from a consortium into a single company like
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed A3XX is a 600-seat craft and would cost $12 billion
to develop. Asked about an investigation by European and American
regulators into accusations that Airbus and Boeing conspired to
raise prices, Forgeard, who began his career as a French
bureaucrat, dismissed the charge with an English obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the executives reflects the recent fortunes
of the two competitors. Boeing, which is the world's biggest
aerospace company and America's single-largest exporter, is still
trying to recover from its decision to sell a record number of
airplanes at bargain prices. The action resulted in production
chaos two years ago that erased Boeing's earnings and sent its
profit margins tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, on the other hand, has cut costs while seeing the
popularity of its airplanes steadily grow over the last five years,
bringing it close to its goal of achieving a 50 percent share of
all new jet orders. So far this year, Airbus has sold 153 jets to
Boeing's 52. That may change later this week when Boeing is
expected to announce an order for 100 single-aisle planes from
International Lease Finance Corp. But Airbus, too, will be
announcing another 40 new orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not as pessimistic as my competitor,'' said Forgeard, who
added that complacency was now Airbus' worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Airbus faces a distinct set of challenges. Ending the
latest reports of wrangling among the four partners, Forgeard said
a deal had been worked out between Aerospatiale Matra SA of France
and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG of Germany that cleared the way
for production of the A318, a new, single-aisle 100-passenger jet
that would be the smallest in the Airbus family.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Airbus already has more than 100 orders for the
A318, Aerospatiale executives balked at investing in the new plane
because they were concerned that Aerospatiale was getting too
little of the work. Forgeard said the new jet would be assembled by
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, or DASA, in Hamburg, Germany. But at the
same time, DASA agreed to shift some assembly of the larger A319
from Hamburg to the Aerospatiale factory in Toulouse, France, which
is also where Airbus has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard praised the agreement, saying that it would give Airbus
more flexibility by insuring two strong assembly lines for its
single-aisle jets. The Airbus single-aisle family, which also
includes the A320 and A321, has been selling strongly over the last
18 months, surpassing Boeing's rival 737.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Aerospatiale and DASA, which each hold a stake
equal to 37.9 percent, Airbus is owned by British Aerospace PLC and
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain. The rift over the A318 is
the latest example of the tensions between Airbus partners that has
delayed its transformation into a single corporation from a
consortium that farms out production of different sections of every
plane to the four partners.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard, who became leader of Airbus last year, has insisted
that the airplane maker must make the change if it is to continue
to compete effectively against Boeing. But efforts to move forward
with the privatization have foundered because of disagreements
about how to value each partner's assets and because of the
dizzying pace of European aerospace consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Construcciones Aeronauticas, which had been wooed by
all three of the other partners, announced that it would merge with
DASA. And DaimlerChrysler is considering selling a minority stake
in DASA to the public to pay for further expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said that DASA's deal with Construcciones Aeronautics
would have little effect on the consortium and that both companies
would continue to keep their seats on the Airbus board.

SEEKING WAYS TO CUT THE WEB-PAGE WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The word ASTERISK in parentheses has been used instead of the
symbol, which is non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(lb) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In high-tech business circles, people often talk about how
things happen faster in ``Internet time'' _ deals are made faster,
technology changes more rapidly and companies succeed or fail in a
much shorter time frame.
</P>
<P>
   But for most consumers, ``Internet time'' is a much slower
concept _ the often interminable wait for a Web page to show up on
a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The bottleneck is bandwidth _ the capacity of Internet services
to deliver Web pages and other data to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies, while constantly adjusting to operating at
lightning speeds to keep pace with Internet technologies, must
reconcile themselves to the fact that their customers are living in
what amounts to slow motion on the other end of the line. As a
result, these businesses have to make difficult decisions about how
to attract and keep customers within the limited bandwidth
available.
</P>
<P>
   For all the growth experienced by e-commerce sites in the last
year, ``speed is still clearly a limitation,'' said Cliff Sharples,
founding chairman of Shop.org, an e-commerce trade group, and chief
executive of Garden.com, a gardening supplies site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to quantify the business we're not doing because of
it, but I'd have to say it's pretty significant,'' Sharples said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and telecommunications companies are working furiously to
deliver high-speed connections to more consumers, but in the
meantime, Internet retailers are not sitting idly by.
</P>
<P>
   For one, they have put an emphasis on designing pages that load
quickly. E-commerce executives and site designers say they
generally try to adhere to the eight-second rule _ after eight
seconds of waiting for a Web page to load, consumers become much
more likely to abandon the effort. But no matter how strenuously
online businesses work to reach or exceed that goal, they often
fail, especially with users who connect at home through dial-up
modems.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen/Netratings, which measures Internet
audiences, home users had to wait an average of 28 seconds to load
Web pages of the 109 most visited e-commerce sites last month. And
Keynote Systems Inc., an Internet performance measurement firm,
reported that business users wait an average of eight seconds to
load each page, typically through faster T1 lines.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives across all categories know they must beat
those times or face an exodus of customers. Jonathan Morris,
executive vice president of Bluefly, a discount apparel retailer,
said the need for a fast site forced the company to change or delay
the development of certain features. ``There are things we could do
that we're holding off on because it might adversely affect the
consumer's experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company had a zoom feature, which allowed
customers to look more closely at a product's fabric _ an important
capability, because a computer screen cannot convey fabric texture
nearly as well as a catalog can. However, Morris said users
``didn't love the feature, as it did put an additional strain on
our servers'' and subsequently slowed the service.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting such features, he said, gives the company more chance to
employ a sophisticated database that can track inventory as a user
enters the site and can serve registered customers images of items
they might like. On a site already heavy with graphics, such a
system could slow page loads long enough to lose a customer. ``It's
a balancing act, maybe more in our category than others,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   That balancing act applies to other aspects of Web design as
well, said Andrew Sather, senior vice president of Sapient, an
Internet design and consulting firm. Bandwidth concerns, he says,
force Internet companies to make hard choices about optimizing
their sites to appeal to certain customer groups, such as those
with higher-speed connections, while possibly alienating users who
connect at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sather says that Sapient recently designed the
Virgin Megastore Web site (www.virginmega.com), ``and we optimized
it for a higher-end user.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made assumptions _ about things like screen resolutions,
browser, modem speed _ that were pretty ambitious,'' he said,
``because the company wanted to push the envelope with what they
could do on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the site is heavier on graphics than, say,
E(ASTERISK)Trade, another site Sapient designed. ``With
E(ASTERISK)Trade, you want to cater to the super high-tech day
trader,'' Sather said, ``but also the older couple who are dialing
in with an antiquated laptop from an RV somewhere in the Grand
Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather said that among the e-commerce categories hurt by slow
connection speeds are those that are ``more lifestyle-intensive,
such as anything trying to target the youth culture with moving
images _ that sort of thing.'' In such cases, he said, ``there's
more competition for bandwidth between product presentation and
lifestyle presentation, but at some point you have to be King
Solomon, and split the baby and decide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For other e-commerce categories, too, a sluggish Web ``can have
serious economic impact,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist at Zona
Research, an Internet research firm. ``Those most at risk are the
sellers of apparel, where visual presentation is so important, and
technology products that require more explanation on the pages,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce sites willing to spend money can, however, find ways
to increase speed without making compromises on site design. For
instance, through applications developed by companies like Akamai
Technologies, Staff said, sites can cut the time it takes to
download a page to a range of half to a tenth of the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai generates a global map of Web traffic conditions and
serves the pages of client Web sites over the most efficient route,
using more than 600 servers on 25 networks in Europe, the United
States and the Pacific Rim. David Goodtree, an Akamai spokesman,
said the service cost between ``a couple of thousand and tens of
thousands of dollars'' a month, depending on the traffic served,
and its clients include Yahoo and Apple Computer, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Such technologies may be crucial even if companies like
Motorola, Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems and AT&AMP;T succeed in their
quest to deliver faster connection speeds to Internet users using
digital subscriber telephone lines and cable modems within the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But even if they do, the increase in bandwidth may continue to
be canceled out by an equal or greater increase in the number of
Internet users, cautions Fritz Mueller, director of product
marketing for Keynote Systems. That, in turn, could leave
e-commerce companies precisely where they are today: hoping for new
technological breakthroughs as they scramble to make the experience
worth the customer's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like disk space,'' Mueller observed. ``No matter how much
you get, you use it up.''

POLITICIANS PUSH TAX CUTS, BUT VOTERS SAY DON'T BOTHER
</HEADLINE>
   (Previously budgeted at NY-TAX-CUTS) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANSONIA, Conn. _ A $50 gift from the state Capitol for every
adult might seem a welcome bonus on the steep streets of this
blue-collar town, which has been the victim of a depressing parade
of fires, strikes and bankruptcies in the century since its now
ghostly riverfront factories churned out anything molten, from
bayonets to thimbles.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual per capita income here, about $23,000, ranks
157th out of Connecticut's 169 towns. Even Ansonia's leading
conversation piece, a plaque marking the high-water mark from the
still lamented flood of 1955, corroded away and is now just a
memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the sales-tax rebate that Connecticut lawmakers approved
with much self-congratulation before adjourning on Thursday is seen
by many here as wasteful and even insulting, considering what they
say the state could buy if the whole $110 million were used in one
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take $50 and think, `whoop-de-do,''' said David Ings,
31, a construction laborer. ``They're just paying us off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ings' feelings reflect what some pollsters are calling a waning
appetite for tax cuts in the New York metropolitan area, eight
years after fury over Connecticut's new income tax produced a
stream of death threats to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   With a booming economy producing a happy electorate, many voters
are telling pollsters they want government to use this time of
plenty to rebuild schools and roads, instead of returning the
bounty a few dollars at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Legislatures in 36 states cut taxes last year, according to the
National Conference of State Legislatures, and with revenue in most
states running ahead of projections, at least that many are
expected to do so again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is New Jersey, where Gov. Christie Whitman described
a property-tax rebate as ``from the State House to your house''
when she signed it in April.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, lawmakers continue to wrangle over a budget that
was due on April 1, but significant tax cuts remain part of all
three competing proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As irresistible as tax cuts may seem to politicians, polls have
found that voters are increasingly skeptical. In one of the
starkest findings, 78 percent of respondents to a University of
Connecticut poll said they would rather have the state use its
surplus on services for citizens, while just 18 percent said they
would prefer a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken from April 6 to 13, surveyed 500 adults and had
a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do tax questions, we don't find much hostility to the
tax levels that exist in the tri-state area,'' said Maurice
Carroll, the director of the polling institute at Quinnipiac
College in Hamden, Conn. ``People are saying: `The state has a lot
of stuff to do. They have the money, and they should spend it on
that stuff instead of sending it to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican who proposed the Connecticut
rebate, was elected in 1994 in part on his 26-page plan to
eliminate the state income tax over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But with the tax-cut fever broken, he has retained high approval
ratings despite having abandoned that promise long ago, and it was
not even an issue during his re-election campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick S. Yang, a partner in a Democratic polling firm,
Garin-Hart-Yang Research Group, said that even today, few voters
would turn down a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are not as interested in that as they have been in
the past,'' Yang said. ``In good economic times, people feel they
can look beyond their own pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, agreed. ``In today's
economic environment,'' he said, ``the demand for tax cuts is not
as great, because money is more plentiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz said that apathy about taxes is most pronounced at the
state level, where people are less concerned about wasteful
spending than they are when they think about Washington. ``The
closer you are to home, the more willing people are to pay taxes,''
he said.

COMMERCIAL PUTS REPORTER IN TIGHT SPOT  
 ESQUIRE EDITOR HELPS UNCOVER CARVER STORIES  
 HOPES FOR A BEST SELLER ABOUT AGING NUNS

   It's not real news, but it looks and tastes just like real news!
</P>
<P>
   In a national commercial that began showing over Memorial Day
weekend, Mary Civiello, a reporter for WCBS-TV news in New York
City and, until recently, an alternate anchor on CNBC, stands in a
grocery store, suited up and coiffed as if for a television
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   A microphone appears in front of a man and then a woman, who
declare their approval of Benecol, a Johnson &AMP; Johnson margarine
product that the company says helps to lower cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   After the consumers offer their testimonials, Ms. Civiello looks
into the camera and with on-the-scene newscaster aplomb, says,
``Benecol actually helps promote lower cholesterol levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial has been shown during local news broadcasts in
New York on WCBS and WNBC; on the national networks NBC, ABC and
CBS, and on the NBC cable networks, MSNBC and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Should a television news reporter promote a product in
commercials? Tom Goldstein, the dean of Columbia University's
Graduate School of Journalism, said, ``Everyone should be forgiven
one lapse, but she has to decide whether she wants to pursue a
career in serious journalism or in something else, it seems to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Civiello defended her appearance in the commercial. She has
been a freelance reporter appearing on WCBS as often as twice a
week, since leaving a job as anchor on WNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is pretty savvy these days,'' she said. ``I
have taken this time in my life to look around at all the
possibilities, and this commercial happens to be the most visible
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial's visibility has deprived Ms. Civiello of her
freelance anchor job at CNBC. Martine Charles, a spokeswoman for
CNBC, said that Bruno Cohen, senior vice president of business news
for CNBC, had told Ms. Civiello that she could no longer appear on
CNBC. ``We don't feel that on-air journalists can be both on-air
talent and pitch product,'' Ms. Charles said. ``It's a conflict of
interest. CNBC can't appear to endorse any one product.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Carey, the news director of WCBS-TV, said, ``It is
clearly a slippery slope when reporters start endorsing products
and end up in commercials.'' He would not comment on Ms. Civiello's
fate but said, ``We are not interested in running this commercial
on any news broadcasts that she appears on in the future.''

   Esquire Editor Helps Uncover Carver Stories
</P>
<P>
   The stories sat there for more than a decade, unseen and unread,
in a writing desk that Raymond Carver's widow, the poet Tess
Gallagher, could not bear to open. But now they are out, at last:
three previously undiscovered stories by Carver, the noted author
of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   The first of them, ``Kindling,'' about a man ``between lives,''
appears in the July issue of Esquire. The other two, ``Dreams'' and
``Vandals,'' will appear in the magazine over the the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   It was the prodding of a senior Esquire editor, Jay Woodruff,
that finally brought the stories to light. ``I was always reluctant
to do it,'' Ms. Gallagher said about opening the desk, which sits
in her home in Port Angeles, Wash., just as it did in 1988, when
Carver died of cancer at age 50. ``I knew that there would be a big
disruption once it was opened.''
</P>
<P>
   But she changed her mind when Woodruff asked her last year
whether there might be anything of Carver's ``still around'' that
could be used to commemorate the 10th anniversary of his death.
``That's when she asked me if I'd be interested in helping her go
through his desk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Port Angeles in March. Together they went through
Carver's papers, finding lots of scraps and other ephemera. Inside
a drawer of folders were drafts of the three stories, as well as
long fragments of others that were ultimately deemed too incomplete
to publish.
</P>
<P>
   Carver became well known for his stories portraying the lives of
those he called ``the working poor.'' He published 10 books of
prose and poetry during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Gordon Lish, Carver's one-time editor, has said
he was responsible for the quality of Carver's early works by
virtue of the enormous revisions he says he made. Ms. Gallagher has
disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff said that the new stories needed very little editing,
just ``typical housecleaning for grammar and typographical errors,
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are stories he was actively working on in his prime,''
Woodruff said.

   Hopes for a Best Seller About Aging Nuns
</P>
<P>
   As a young schoolboy at the Sacred Heart Catholic School in
Redlands, Calif., David A. Snowden learned his lessons from stern
nuns with a penchant for giving him ``a piece of their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that endured. His exploration of the brains and
the aging patterns of an elderly group of nuns from the order of
the School Sisters of Notre Dame has turned into his life's work _
a career of research, lectures and an unlikely book proposal about
centenarian sisters who provide some tantalizing clues to resisting
the ravages of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Oliver Sacks meets the Delaney sisters,'' said Snowden's
agent, Gail Ross. ``It's really cutting-edge science writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowden's proposal has already provoked a fierce bidding battle
among 11 New York publishers _ with Bantam Books paying more than
$560,000 to publish ``Aging with Grace,'' which will be promoted
with much more than a prayer from the nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Deals have already been struck with publishers in England and
the Netherlands, Ms. Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the
Sanders-Brown Center on Aging at the University of Kentucky, has
pledged to donate half of the profits to the School Sisters of
Notre Dame. More than 600 nuns have participated in his research
project. Some sisters will donate their brains to the study after
they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten my career from their generosity,'' Snowden said.
``And to be honest, I don't see anything else in my career for the
rest of my life. They've been incredibly generous to me. And with
this I can sleep at night.''

KELLER, REYNA LEAD THE WAY AS U.S. TOPS ARGENTINA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two plays will forever be etched in the memories of
the players and the crowd of 40,119 in Sunday's international match
between the United States and Argentina at Robert F. Kennedy
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a penalty-kick save by Kasey Keller of the United
States and the other was Joe-Max Moore's goal that gave the
Americans a 1-0 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a formation of three defenders, five midfielders and
two strikers, the United States, 24th in the world in the latest
FIFA ranking, won because of individual efforts by Keller, Moore
and Ernie Stewart, who made the pass that led to the game's only
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Keller's save on Gustavo Lopez's penalty kick came in the 40th
minute. The goalkeeper dived to his left to grab the thunderous
shot, delighting the Americans in the crowd, who met the challenge
from Argentina's supporters with loud cheers of ``USA! USA!'' in a
stadium decorated by American and Argentine flags.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest cheers by the American supporters came in the 88th
minute, when Moore's left-footed blast from 15 yards, after a
marvelous back-heel pass from Stewart, eluded the Argentine
goalkeeper German Burgos. It was the 19th international goal for
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest goal I've ever scored,'' Moore said. ``When
the result is 1-0 against Argentina and you score the only goal, it
doesn't get any bigger than this. I'm glad I came on and had an
impact on the game.'' Moore entered the game as a substitute in the
60th minute in place of the injured Eddie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Moore into the game was one of several brilliant moves
by Bruce Arena, whose record is 4-1-1 in 1999. He replaced Steve
Sampson as coach of the national team this past autumn. It was
Arena's first game back here after leading D.C. United to two Major
League Soccer titles.
</P>
<P>
   Arena and many of his players took the triumph against one of
the world's powers in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this means is that we're rebuilding our program,'' Arena
said. ``It's a good win against a good team. Does it say we're
going in the right direction? Yes, but not more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena said the national team will be better a year from now. But
the team will have to be on top of its game next month in the FIFA
Confederations Cup in Mexico, where the United States will play
Brazil, Germany and New Zealand in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find the right combinations of players as we go along,''
Arena said. ``We have a lot of other players to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Reyna will be the key to the national team no matter how
many players Arena sees. Reyna was the best player for the
Americans Sunday; he worked tirelessly offensively and defensively.
Reyna has always had the skill, acceleration and vision, but his
game has been elevated to a higher standard since he has been
playing a key role for the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland after his
transfer from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claudio was outstanding,'' said Arena, who coached Reyna at
the University of Virginia for three years before the player left
for Germany. ``The game featured great battles and we won a share
of those battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna seemed to win all his battles in the bright sunshine.
Wearing the captain's armband, Reyna sprayed the field with passes
and made a number of key plays defensively in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing against Argentina for me is the most special game,''
said Reyna, whose father, Miguel, played in Argentina before moving
to Springfield, N.J. ``I was obviously motivated to play well
because some of my family still lives in Argentina and I knew they
were watching.''

MORE OF THE SAME FOR DISNEY ONLINE CHIEF  
 A BIT OF FLAMBOYANCE FOR AN INTERNET CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   After seven years at Walt Disney Co. developing new Internet
businesses, Jake Winebaum has decided to call it quits to do
something different. His goal? To develop new Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old head of Disney's Buena Vista Internet Group
resigned last week to form a start-up incubator, Ecompanies, along
the lines of the entrepreneur Bill Gross' Idealab, which has
overseen the creation of dozens of thriving Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum, along with Sky Dayton, the 27-year-old founder of
Earthlink Network Inc., said that at Ecompanies he would focus more
on the start-up and operations of the businesses rather than the
initial ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently at least 150 Internet start-ups, operating
on venture capital, that are seeking chief executives, Winebaum
said. He suggested that the number of ideas had outpaced the
availability of management skill.
</P>
<P>
   While Idealab, which started Citisearch and Goto.com, casts a
wide net in its search for start-ups, Winebaum said Ecompanies
would focus its activities more narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum and Dayton met at an industry conference two years ago
and discovered they had something in common besides a passion for
start-ups: extreme snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   They have been snowboarding together ever since, often
discussing start-up ideas on trips.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Winebaum called Dayton to say he was
thinking of quitting Disney to focus on one of his ideas. Like
Winebaum, Dayton was ready to start all over again, having seen
Earthlink, an Internet access provider, grow to $176 million in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum and Dayton hold majority stakes in Ecompanies, while
Disney and Earthlink are investors, an arrangement that will give
the two entrepreneurs the kind of control they both miss. The next
step is to find someone to oversee the company's venture-capital
fund. ``Sky and I both really like the start-up phase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum joined Disney in 1992 when it acquired his magazine,
Family Fun. From there, he started several online ventures for
Disney, including Disney.com.
</P>
<P>
   A Bit of Flamboyance for an Internet Conference
</P>
<P>
   What has Dennis Rodman got to do with the Internet industry?
Until this week, almost nothing. But on Thursday, the flamboyant
professional basketball star will take the microphone at the Web
Attack Internet marketing conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tchong, producer of the conference, said he hoped to get
Rodman to talk about his coming electronic commerce venture, which
Tchong stumbled upon in the course of a trademark search on the
term Webzilla.com. The search turned up Rodman's venture,
Rodzilla.com.
</P>
<P>
   The point of inviting Rodman to the conference, Tchong said, is
to illustrate to Web marketers that they need to be outrageous to
be heard above the noise. ``There's got to be hundreds of pro
basketball players today, but ask anybody to name two and they'll
say Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman,'' Tchong said. ``Now that's
brand marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman has not been asked by the conference organizers to make
any prepared remarks. But he has been instructed on precisely what
to wear. The contract for his appearance requires Rodman _ who
apart from his hair color is perhaps best known off the court for
donning a wedding dress and other outrageous attire _ to wear a
T-shirt bearing the logo of Iconocast, the Web marketing consulting
company that is sponsoring the conference.

TWA REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trans World Airlines and the union
representing 16,000 employees, including flight attendants and
mechanics, reached a tentative agreement on new contracts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by TWA's Machinists union members, the new contracts
will avert the possibility of a strike that could have devastated
the St. Louis-based carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement comes less than one week after voting
began on contract proposals that TWA described as its ``best and
final'' offer. Machinists union leaders had recommended its members
reject those proposals, and TWA employees in Kansas City and St.
Louis appeared to have voted down the company's $350 million
package last week.
</P>
<P>
   Company and union officials declined to disclose information on
the new pacts Sunday, saying they will first be presented to TWA
workers. Details are expected to be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new contracts cover three employee groups at TWA: mechanics
and related workers, flight attendants and passenger service
employees. About 2,300 mechanics work at TWA's overhaul base at
Kansas City International Airport. TWA has about 40 customer
service employees in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Driscoll, lead negotiator for the union, said the
negotiating committee will recommend that its members accept the
latest package. Once again, union workers at various TWA locations
will be meeting to vote on the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to complete the voting by July 10,'' O'Driscoll
said. ``Then we can get back to helping run the airline.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA and the Machinists began meeting again on Tuesday, said
William F. Compton, the airline's president and chief executive
officer. He said talks continued around the clock until a tentative
agreement was reached Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the employees,'' Compton said of the new
agreement. ``And it's one the company can live with, so we can take
the company to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether employees last week voting and apparently
rejecting TWA's ``best and final'' offer prompted management to
return to the bargaining table, Compton said: ``There's always been
an interest in having a package endorsed by the Machinists. It's
always better to have a deal endorsed by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA's effect on the Missouri economy is significant. The airline
operates a hub in St. Louis and has nearly 9,000 employees there.
TWA has about 3,500 employees in Kansas City, operating the
maintenance base and an administrative center.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of the new contract proposals were not released
Sunday, TWA had said its previous offer would bring its employees'
wages to 90 percent of the industry standard by July 2001. For
mechanics, that would have been a maximum wage of $23.16 an hour
from the current top pay of $17.93 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders had stated for several months that a contract
bringing wages up to the 90 percent level of industry standard was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, meanwhile, had said that TWA's financial
condition was such that it could not afford anything more.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years of negotiations, a federal mediator
declared an impasse on May 10, triggering a 30-day countdown after
which the Machinists would be free to strike TWA. That deadline had
been extended until the end of June while voting was conducted on
TWA's ``best and final'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   With TWA holding about $200 million in cash and given its shaky
financial state, company officials and airline analysts alike
agreed that TWA could not survive a full-scale strike. But the
threat of a shutdown at TWA was beginning to affect decisions made
by the flying public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indications that travel agents and corporate travel
planners are beginning to book away from TWA, especially in the
first half of July,'' said David Levine, airline industry analyst,
in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Compton said that while TWA's passenger loads have remained high
in June, it was evident that business travelers were beginning to
look to other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation like this, you tend to lose the
higher-yield customers, which are the business travelers,'' he
said. ``Certainly, that has a negative effect on the company. But
with this tentative agreement, we can avert that in the future and
continue to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local 1650 in Kansas City,
said it will be up to the members to decide whether the new
contracts are good for them. However, he said it was crucial to get
an agreement that the union's negotiating committee endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic,'' Nelson said. ``We've been waiting for this a
long time. We've had to live under three concessionary contracts,
so these improvements are long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Company and union officials said they hoped the new agreement
will go toward healing wounds that had been created by the arduous
negotiations. Many of TWA's employees have expressed frustration
with what they perceived as the company's unwillingness to bring
wages up to industry standard. Meanwhile, TWA officials contended
the Machinists were unwilling to agree to work rule changes that
are in place at all other major airlines, keeping TWA at a
competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   One employee said a banner was hung prominently last week at the
overhaul base next to the TWA logo, stating: ``The concession stand
is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Driscoll said the new agreement should soothe labor-management
relations at TWA.

`AUSTIN' SEQUEL IS BEHAVING VERY WELL AT BOX OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Maybe it's the dumb sex jokes. Maybe it's the
bathroom humor. Maybe it's the awful teeth and equally awful
cranberry-colored crushed-velvet suit proudly displayed by the
goofy hero.
</P>
<P>
   Or quite possibly it's the blizzard of promotions, publicity and
advertising tie-ins by the comedian Mike Myers, the star of
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' his sequel to the
successful 1997 homage to James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel opened to nothing less than the extraordinary
box-office tally of $57.2 million, including Thursday night
previews, a result that underlined not only the strength of the
teen-age audience but also the hunger of the older crowd for
raunchy, seriously silly and over-the-top jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's caught the Zeitgeist,'' said Mike De Luca, president of
production at New Line, which made the film. ``People want to laugh
right now. The movie is extremely uncynical. It's almost innocent.
In a world where we're saturated with hypocrisy, there's something
about this that's refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Friedman, who oversees New Line's marketing with Rolf
Mittweg, put it another way. ``He's so politically incorrect,''
Friedman said of Powers. ``He says what he wants. Young people love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film itself, written by Myers and a former ``Saturday Night
Live'' colleague, Michael McCullers, is a sequel to ``Austin
Powers: International Man of Mystery.'' That spoof of 1960s spy
movies cost $18 million and earned $54 million at the box office.
The sequel cost $33 million and by Monday night will have earned
more at the box office than the first film in its entire run. No
other sequel has matched that.
</P>
<P>
   What the new Austin Powers is actually about is not entirely
clear. It's something about a mad-with-power Dr. Evil (also played
by Myers), who has drawn up a scheme to steal Austin's libido,
known as his mojo. Austin seeks to reclaim his mojo.
Double-entendres stamp almost every scene.
</P>
<P>
   The characters include a beguiling agent, Felicity Shagwell
(Heather Graham); Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), an extremely evil
midget, and Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), whose last name, a
Yiddish word for sourpuss, sums her up.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is mainly the '60s in their most madcap form. ``It's
absurdly silly, irony-free,'' said Jay Roach, who directed both
Austin Powers films. ``There's a nostalgia involved, filtered
memory through which everything seemed really bright, uninhibited,
free-spirited.'' With a laugh, he added: ``It's not accurate. It's
not authentic. It's the theme-park version of the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the film's success so unusual is that it rests
largely on the success of the video of the first Austin Powers.
That video was released in late 1997 and turned into a cult hit.
The movie was Billboard's top-selling video in its category in 1998
and has been in the top 10 since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video served as a two-hour marketing tool for the new
film,'' Friedman said. ``People viewed the video repeatedly. A lot
of kids couldn't get enough of that video.'' (In the process, lines
from the film like ``yeah, baby,'' ``shag you, rotten'' and ``oh,
behave'' became commonplace at high schools around the United
States.)
</P>
<P>
   What helped too, of course, was the relentless promotion for the
movie by Myers. According to Daily Variety, New Line has spent more
than $40 million promoting the new film, but these costs have been
offset by fees from various licensing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Promotion campaigns for the movie involve toy makers and
fast-food chains, and the list of marketing partners includes
Virgin Atlantic, Starbucks, Heineken and Philips, the electronics
concern. Myers has appeared in virtually any magazine and
television show that would have him, although New Line's publicity
chiefs refused to show the film to journalists until the last
minute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roach, the director, said that in both Austin Powers films he
wanted to convey the free and sometimes reckless spirit of
comedians as varied as Peter Sellers, the Monty Python troupe,
Jonathan Winters, Woody Allen and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in all of these comedians,'' Roach said, ``the pure
delight of finding absurd, silly, ironic-free associations that's
sometimes clever, sometimes primitive and always delightful to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Has New Line approached Roach about a third Austin Powers?
``They've brought it up,'' he said.

GOP CONTINGENT GETS READY TO FIGHT GUN CONTROL IN HOUSE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ A trio of House Republicans who managed the
effort to impeach President Clinton predicted they will
successfully defend gun owners' rights in a House fight this week
over proposed gun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is using the National Rifle
Association as a ``red herring'' in an effort to slap more controls
on gun-owning Americans, said the GOP congressmen during a weekend
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee Republicans predicted Saturday
that Democrats living in rural areas will join them in trying to
block gun restrictions passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is expected to spark verbal fire in the House this
week when the House takes up the Senate-passed juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the votes: You are going to see a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats fight for Second Amendment rights: They
will vote against extreme measures and defend the right to bear
arms,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott countered that
recent school shootings have turned public opinion in favor of gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans used to accept that there were shootings in our
cities,'' McDermott said. ``They felt that, if you moved to a
suburban area, you would be protected from gun violence. The
Colorado and Georgia shootings show that you are not protected.
Your children are not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he expects Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
longest-serving House Democrat and former board member of the NRA,
to lead the fight for a softer gun-show provision than the one
passed by the Senate last month on a dramatic 51-50 vote. Vice
President Al Gore, as the Senate's presiding officer, broke the
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The three GOP impeachment managers _ Graham, Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. _ visited the
Puget Sound area Saturday to speak at a rally and fund-raising
dinner for the King County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carried with them our strong belief that this president
should be impeached,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in a fiery
warmup speech for her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn voiced hope that after the 2000 election, ``representatives
like Jim Rogan and Asa Hutchinson will populate the Republican side
of the House of Representatives.'' (Graham was not at the rally,
but spoke at the dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   While looking back proudly at the impeachment effort, the House
Republicans' main focus was the upcoming House firefight over gun
restrictions. Hutchinson later took a ``redeye'' flight to
Washington, D.C., so he could appear Sunday on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert voiced hope last month that the
House would go along with provisions of the Senate bill. But he has
since retreated under fire from GOP troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert comes from ``an anti-gun state'' _ Illinois _ and took
his initial position without consulting Republicans from the South
and West, traditional strongholds of the NRA, Hutchinson said at a
GOP reception here.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Rules Committee have drafted a bill
that includes several Senate-passed provisions _ mandatory child
safety locks and a juvenile Brady law provision barring for life
gun ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans left out other Senate provisions. Gone is
a ban on the import of ammunition clips holding 10 or more bullets.
Another omitted amendment would direct the Federal Trade Commission
to look into marketing of guns to children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require background checks on all purchases
at gun shows where 50 or more guns are available. The House bill
exempts gun shows with fewer than 10 vendors, no matter how many
guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would delay transfer of a gun to a buyer for up
to three business days so a federal tracking system can check for
any felony convictions. The House bill would give the system 72
hours _ even on holiday weekends when records might not be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will sign the bill as passed by the Senate
even though it does not contain all the gun control measures he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens should not be prevented from making ``legal gun
purchases'' when technical means are available to quickly check for
any criminal background, Graham said in arguing for the House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., took a different view. Inslee lost his
central Washington House seat in 1994 after backing a ban on
semi-automatic assault rifles. He was elected last year to a
suburban Seattle seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic purpose of the Senate bill was to close a
loophole,'' Inslee said. ``Background checks work. They have kept
firearms out of the hands of thousands of convicted criminals. The
question is, do we let people avoid the safety net by walking
around the corner to a show where there are a hundred guns sitting
on a table for sale?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a former judge and gang-crime prosecutor, rejected
Democrats' contention that the Littleton, Colo., killings and other
school shootings make the case for tighter gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20,000 gun laws on the books in this country that did
not stop what happened at Columbine High School,'' Rogan said in a
weekend interview.
</P>
<P>
   The California Republican charged the Clinton administration
with ``scapegoating,'' and added: ``Taking deaths in schools, and
blaming it on the NRA, is unfortunate and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson drew prolonged applause at Saturday's rally as he put
the issue in stark terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constitutional liberty that gives citizens of this
country the right to bear arms. We should not make it impossible
for citizens, men or women, to defend their family, home and
property,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   A private poll, conducted last month for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, found 80 percent support for expanded
background checks on gun purchases. In results leaked to the press,
it also found 45 percent of all voters less inclined to support a
member of Congress linked to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't place much stock in those polls,'' Rogan said. ``I
know a poll can be skewered by how you word the questions. I know
this: If you ask if people believe in the right to defend
themselves and their families, the answer is an overwhelming yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inslee, by contrast, said he detects that public opinion is
``moving away from ideology'' on gun safety issues. He described
measures pending in Congress as ``modest'' compared with the 1994
assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are many, but basic to it is the steady
accumulation of victims,'' he added. ``Since 1994, more than 1,000
little kids have died in accidental shootings. Those are as much a
part of the carnage as mass homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Littleton so much as one tragedy at a time driving
people toward common sense,'' said Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   The House gun debate this week is likely to be a free-for-all.
``Denny Hastert is just throwing it out to the House to let it go
any way,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have their eyes on suburban Republicans,
including those who have voted with the NRA. ``Jennifer Dunn is a
perfect example: She is a person who represents a district with
towns like Littleton, Colorado,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Behrens-Benedict, a Democrat who took 40 percent of the
vote against Dunn in 1998, said last week that she is running again
on a gun control platform.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Republicans will join in passing mandatory trigger
locks, and barring lifetime gun ownership for any juvenile who
commits a violent crime. He predicted that the NRA will score
victories as well as suffer defeats on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this is over, the Democrats will join us in
addressing the media culture of violence that is more responsible
(than guns) for this problem,'' he added.

SICKLY SABRES HAVE NO CURE FOR STARS FLU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Contrary to expectations, the sun did come up
yesterday in the birthplace of chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the Buffalo Sabres didn't seem to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Their swagger is gone. The coach no longer is announcing that
the opposing Stars cheat. If there's a game plan for Game 4 and
points beyond, the Sabres appear to still be searching for it.
</P>
<P>
   They've got the Stars Flu. Tightness in the offensive zone.
Congestion at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff's playoff goatee, which rode so proud
and snide after Game 1, has turned cold and clammy.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. The Stanley Cup Finals are not yet a week old, and
the Sabres have already played the they-cheat-on-face-offs card,
the they're-running-our-goaltender card and the always-popular
Stars-are-old-and-too-slow card.
</P>
<P>
   With a desperate Game 4 facing them tomorrow night, the Sabres
have an empty hand and maybe one option left:
</P>
<P>
   Go fish.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams that were once alleged to be so alike are
starting to show their differences. The Stars are confident,
focused, invigorated by the reassurance that the system _ the
almighty, seasonlong system _ still works.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, on the other hand, were shaken by losing and by
being thoroughly squelched in Game 3 on their home ice.
</P>
<P>
   You heard the Sabres. After the 2-1 loss, Ruff said, ``I thought
we were pretty tight. We were squeezing the sticks ... They gave us
a darn good lesson there. They suffocated us.''
</P>
<P>
   They sounded frustrated, but more confounded than anything.
Which is odd, because if the Stanley Cup playoffs have taught us
anything over these past three seasons, it is that the momentum in
postseason hockey can change in a eye-blink or, better still, a
goaltender's heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   One wrist shot. One errant skate. A goal by Craig Ludwig, of all
people.
</P>
<P>
   What happened yesterday, the Stars have proven conclusively, has
only vague bearing on what likely will happen today.
</P>
<P>
   So why the long snout on Team Buffalo?
</P>
<P>
   Stars Flu, it says here. And this dose may linger for, oh, three
or four months.
</P>
<P>
   The question posed for Ruff yesterday was what he planned to do
to get his offense kick-started.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's rambling reply mentioned power plays, and then how the
Stars like to fall to the ice and block shots, and then how a
thicket of black-and-green trees seems to have sprouted up in front
of Ed Belfour, and finally, ``The key here is getting the shot
through somehow, to get it on the net and look for rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop the presses! Wake up Toe Blake!
</P>
<P>
   It is that simple. But the Stars have made it seem so hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres appeared stunned last Saturday night that they could
have been held to only a record-tying 12 shots on goal. Actually,
it's also only 16 shots over the past four periods.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what the Stars do. They want to snuff your
opportunities and sap your enthusiasm. They want to get inside your
40-goal scorer's head. They want to wilt your coach's moustache.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how impressions tend to flow. To a goodly share of the
Canadian and U.S. media at these finals, the Stars' Ken Hitchcock
was thought to be a whip-cracking, stubborn maniac of a coach who
ruled by the credo, ``Presidents' Trophy or bust.''
</P>
<P>
   But day by day, the same media has discovered that Hitchcock may
be more ``Captain Kangaroo'' than his haircut. He is affable and
intelligent, giving thoughtful answers to even the most inane
hockey query. What other coach in the NHL chases away his P.R. man
so that he can answer a few more questions?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock could probably say anything at this point of the
playoffs and find it in headlines the next morning. But now he
holds the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hitch will ``turn loose'' the Mike Modano-Jere Lehtinen
line, and maybe he won't. Maybe Benoit Hogue will rejoin the
playoffs, and maybe he won't. Maybe Michael Peca should check the
Joe Nieuwendyk line, or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, on the other hand, began the finals by bleating something
about Brian Skrudland's face-off habits. Then he whined about
officiating. Then he whined about the Stars' rough play.
</P>
<P>
   But after one loss at home, the former Sabres' captain sounds
like a whipped puppy. He talked yesterday about how ``worn down''
his players were.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I thought that was supposed to be the Stars' fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a doctor _ Dr. Stanley, I presume _ I'd say he has the
Stars Flu.
</P>
<P>
   I'd advise the coach to take two aspirin. Have some more whine
and chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, it'll all be over.

   BICYCLIST (Seattle) _ The sound of her jaw pounding into the
pavement sounded like a potato chip crunching underneath someone's
foot. Carrianne Pullar still remembers the morning rush-hour
traffic whizzing by as she and her mangled bicycle lay helpless on
the side of the road, her jaw shattered. It's an experience the
29-year-old Pullar has understandably tried to push out of her
mind. Yet this week _ three years after Pullar crashed while riding
her bicycle to work in West Seattle _ she is competing for the
Saturn of Bellevue, Wash., team against some of the world's top
cyclists in the HP LaserJet Women's Challenge in Boise, Idaho.

2 VILLAGES YIELD EVIDENCE OF MASS KILLINGS BY SERBS 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLAC, Yugoslavia _ After weeks of unconfirmed reports from
terrified refugees, the first direct evidence that Serb forces
carried out mass killings in Kosovo _ and have tried to cover them
up _ emerged Sunday at this village, where freshly turned dirt lay
just feet from a bullet-pocked wall.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Albanian refugees who fled the village reported
that Serb paramilitaries had killed 46 people during a two-day
rampage in mid-April here and in a nearby hamlet, called Ribar.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of recent digging here, along with 26 new graves in
the local cemetery at Ribar, may mean that a mass grave was
excavated and the bodies reburied. Two dozen burned houses in the
area also stand as evidence of some form of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Ward, an investigator with Human Rights Watch who has
been collecting witness accounts of the attacks in the area, said
the graves support accounts he has heard of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents one of the first direct confirmations of witness
statements describing the killings of civilians,'' he said. ``Now
we have the first evidence confirming that it has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Hallac said that in recent weeks local police
exhumed a mass grave holding 20 men, carried out autopsies on the
victims and then ordered local villagers to rebury the bodies in
individual graves in the local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Ribar, the victims were exhumed from 26 individual
graves, examined and then reburied.
</P>
<P>
   Reburying bodies in individual graves and producing autopsies
giving an explanation for the killings could make it more difficult
to prove in court that people were executed instead of killed in
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers also said that in the days prior to the arrival of
NATO forces in Kosovo, Yugoslav officials transferred as many as
1,500 Albanian prisoners from the prison in the nearby town of
Lipljan to a Serb jail outside Kosovo. Ejup Pajazi, a 56-year-old
taxi driver released from the jail Saturday, said he was told the
prisoners were taken to a jail in the city of Nis in southern
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Pajazi's allegation could not be confirmed, but no large group
of prisoners from Lipljan has entered Macedonia in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Former prisoners released into Macedonia last week said they
were rounded up after NATO airstrikes began, accused of having ties
to the Kosovo Liberation Army and charged with ``terrorist''
activities. Severe beatings to force confessions were a daily
occurrence, the former prisoners said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hallac and Ribar, the evidence of killing was strikingly
different. In Hallac, a 10-by-30-foot patch of freshly turned earth
in an empty lot near the village center was by far the most
dramatic evidence; villagers said it once held the bodies of 20
people killed by Serb paramilitaries. Two men's shoes and what
appeared to be a torn shirt lay on the surface of the dark soil.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers, who gave accounts mirroring those given by refugees
last month, said the Hallac killings occurred on April 19th. A
dozen Serb paramilitaries shot dead 11 men in the vacant lot, they
said, including a 23-year-old father of two who was shot in the
face after he repeatedly asked to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other men were killed in their homes, the villagers said.
Hafize Gashi, 19, gave a painstaking tour of the killing ground
around her home. Her father, she said, was killed in the garden;
one uncle was shot beside the well, another in front of his
adjacent home; and her 26-year-old cousin and a 70-year-old uncle
were killed inside her home. The paramilitaries then set the bodies
on fire, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the charred remains of the family's living room, she
pointed out what appeared to be a charred human knee joint lying on
the floor. ``We tried to gather all of the bones for burial,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries forced local gypsies to bury all 20 corpses,
villagers said. Police from Lipljan then arrived on May 2 and
ordered the graves exhumed. Blaming the killings on paramilitaries
they could not control, the police said the victims should be
buried properly. But they then barred the villagers from burying
all twenty victims together in the graveyard, the villagers said.
On Sunday, twenty freshly made graves could be seen in the
community cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles up the road in the village of Ribar, 26 freshly made
graves could be seen in the community cemetery. The victims there
included men, women, children and the elderly, according to the
grave markers. The village's oldest and youngest victims died
together, residents said, when paramilitaries shot a 7-year-old
girl and her 73-year-old grandfather as they ran across a field to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers' accounts of the attack, which they said occurred on
April 18th, a day before the Hallac attack, mirrored those given by
refugees who fled into Macedonia last month. Shemsije Vishesella, a
38-year-old widow still wearing a bandage from where a bullet
shattered her jaw, led two reporters on a tour of the gutted house
where her two sons and husband were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the living room, seemingly in a daze, she described
how the family had been going through its morning routine when
shots rang out outside, signaling the arrival of the
paramilitaries. ``My husband said, `Don't be afraid,' '' she said.
``He said, `They are coming but don't be afraid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries kicked the door in and hustled her husband
and 17- and 14-year-old sons outside. She was led outside and found
each of them lying face down on the ground. As she demonstrated
where each one lay that morning, she stroked the grass as if she
were stroking their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered by the paramilitaries to leave, she hid behind a fence,
peered into the yard and was spotted. When the bullet hit her jaw,
she passed out. The paramilitaries then shot her husband and sons
dead, she said, as they lay beneath apple and cherry trees in the
family garden.

GOP CONTINGENT GETS READY TO FIGHT GUN CONTROL IN HOUSE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ A trio of House Republicans who managed the
effort to impeach President Clinton predicted they will
successfully defend gun owners' rights in a House fight this week
over proposed gun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is using the National Rifle
Association as a ``red herring'' in an effort to slap more controls
on gun-owning Americans, said the GOP congressmen during a weekend
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee Republicans predicted Saturday
that Democrats living in rural areas will join them in trying to
block gun restrictions passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is expected to spark verbal fire in the House this
week when the House takes up the Senate-passed juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the votes: You are going to see a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats fight for Second Amendment rights: They
will vote against extreme measures and defend the right to bear
arms,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott countered that
recent school shootings have turned public opinion in favor of gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans used to accept that there were shootings in our
cities,'' McDermott said. ``They felt that, if you moved to a
suburban area, you would be protected from gun violence. The
Colorado and Georgia shootings show that you are not protected.
Your children are not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he expects Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
longest-serving House Democrat and former board member of the NRA,
to lead the fight for a softer gun-show provision than the one
passed by the Senate last month on a dramatic 51-50 vote. Vice
President Al Gore, as the Senate's presiding officer, broke the
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The three GOP impeachment managers _ Graham, Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. _ visited the
Puget Sound area Saturday to speak at a rally and fund-raising
dinner for the King County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carried with them our strong belief that this president
should be impeached,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in a fiery
warmup speech for her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn voiced hope that after the 2000 election, ``representatives
like Jim Rogan and Asa Hutchinson will populate the Republican side
of the House of Representatives.'' (Graham was not at the rally,
but spoke at the dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   While looking back proudly at the impeachment effort, the House
Republicans' main focus was the upcoming House firefight over gun
restrictions. Hutchinson later took a ``redeye'' flight to
Washington, D.C., so he could appear Sunday on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert voiced hope last month that the
House would go along with provisions of the Senate bill. But he has
since retreated under fire from GOP troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert comes from ``an anti-gun state'' _ Illinois _ and took
his initial position without consulting Republicans from the South
and West, traditional strongholds of the NRA, Hutchinson said at a
GOP reception here.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Rules Committee have drafted a bill
that includes several Senate-passed provisions _ mandatory child
safety locks and a juvenile Brady law provision barring for life
gun ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans left out other Senate provisions. Gone is
a ban on the import of ammunition clips holding 10 or more bullets.
Another omitted amendment would direct the Federal Trade Commission
to look into marketing of guns to children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require background checks on all purchases
at gun shows where 50 or more guns are available. The House bill
exempts gun shows with fewer than 10 vendors, no matter how many
guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would delay transfer of a gun to a buyer for up
to three business days so a federal tracking system can check for
any felony convictions. The House bill would give the system 72
hours _ even on holiday weekends when records might not be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will sign the bill as passed by the Senate
even though it does not contain all the gun control measures he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens should not be prevented from making ``legal gun
purchases'' when technical means are available to quickly check for
any criminal background, Graham said in arguing for the House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., took a different view. Inslee lost his
central Washington House seat in 1994 after backing a ban on
semi-automatic assault rifles. He was elected last year to a
suburban Seattle seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic purpose of the Senate bill was to close a
loophole,'' Inslee said. ``Background checks work. They have kept
firearms out of the hands of thousands of convicted criminals. The
question is, do we let people avoid the safety net by walking
around the corner to a show where there are a hundred guns sitting
on a table for sale?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a former judge and gang-crime prosecutor, rejected
Democrats' contention that the Littleton, Colo., killings and other
school shootings make the case for tighter gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20,000 gun laws on the books in this country that did
not stop what happened at Columbine High School,'' Rogan said in a
weekend interview.
</P>
<P>
   The California Republican charged the Clinton administration
with ``scapegoating,'' and added: ``Taking deaths in schools, and
blaming it on the NRA, is unfortunate and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson drew prolonged applause at Saturday's rally as he put
the issue in stark terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constitutional liberty that gives citizens of this
country the right to bear arms. We should not make it impossible
for citizens, men or women, to defend their family, home and
property,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   A private poll, conducted last month for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, found 80 percent support for expanded
background checks on gun purchases. In results leaked to the press,
it also found 45 percent of all voters less inclined to support a
member of Congress linked to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't place much stock in those polls,'' Rogan said. ``I
know a poll can be skewered by how you word the questions. I know
this: If you ask if people believe in the right to defend
themselves and their families, the answer is an overwhelming yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inslee, by contrast, said he detects that public opinion is
``moving away from ideology'' on gun safety issues. He described
measures pending in Congress as ``modest'' compared with the 1994
assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are many, but basic to it is the steady
accumulation of victims,'' he added. ``Since 1994, more than 1,000
little kids have died in accidental shootings. Those are as much a
part of the carnage as mass homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Littleton so much as one tragedy at a time driving
people toward common sense,'' said Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   The House gun debate this week is likely to be a free-for-all.
``Denny Hastert is just throwing it out to the House to let it go
any way,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have their eyes on suburban Republicans,
including those who have voted with the NRA. ``Jennifer Dunn is a
perfect example: She is a person who represents a district with
towns like Littleton, Colorado,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Behrens-Benedict, a Democrat who took 40 percent of the
vote against Dunn in 1998, said last week that she is running again
on a gun control platform.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Republicans will join in passing mandatory trigger
locks, and barring lifetime gun ownership for any juvenile who
commits a violent crime. He predicted that the NRA will score
victories as well as suffer defeats on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this is over, the Democrats will join us in
addressing the media culture of violence that is more responsible
(than guns) for this problem,'' he added.

NIEUWENDYK WOULD LIFT THE CUP TO HIS MOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Joe Nieuwendyk is just two victories away from
the waltz every player in the National Hockey League dreams of
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   He can almost taste it now, can see it happening in his dreams.
Spinning around the ice, the great silver cup held high, eyes
gleaming in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   God willing, he will lift hockey's holy grail to the heavens,
offering it up to the person whose face he sees whenever he closes
his eyes:
</P>
<P>
   His mother's.
</P>
<P>
   Every game night, even in the midst of the tumult and frenzy of
the Stanley Cup Finals, Nieuwendyk drags himself wearily off the
ice to his seat on the Stars' bench between shifts and sees her
face in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   She smiles, and the strength begins to pour back into his arms
and legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if she's there with me, and I'm sure she is,'' said
Nieuwendyk, who has led the Stars to a 2-1 lead over Buffalo in the
best-of-seven race for Lord Stanley's Cup. ``I can feel her
presence. I think of a her a lot, especially when I'm on the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been gone almost four years now, dead of cancer just
three months after doctors diagnosed the dreaded disease, but not a
day goes by that Nieuwendyk, who grew up only about a two-hour
drive from here in Whitby, Ontario, doesn't think about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always there for me, supporting me in whatever I
did,'' he said on the morning after his two goals, including his
record-tying sixth game-winner of the playoffs, carried the Stars
to the 2-1 victory against the Sabres that puts Dallas back in
control of the series.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of 13 months, Nieuwendyk has gone from tragic
figure to budding hero of the Stanley Cup playoffs, a favorite for
the Conn Smythe Trophy, which goes to the postseason MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget watching San Jose's despicable Bryan Marchment
run Nieuwendyk, his leg held up off the ice and unable to slow his
momentum, into the boards at Reunion Arena in Game 1 of the
quarterfinals? The damage was immense: torn ACL and cartilage in
his right knee. End of playoffs, career hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   With their leading scorer and team MVP out, the Stars' bid to
reach the Finals would die on the ice at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena
in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals, leaving fans wondering,
``What if Joe had been there?''
</P>
<P>
   Stars officials, meanwhile, wondered if Nieuwendyk would even
play again and if so, would he be the player he had been before the
injury?
</P>
<P>
   Already playing with a detached ACL in his left knee since 1991,
Nieuwendyk, at 31, faced incredible adversity. He would have to
have surgery on both knees.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the daunting physical rehabilitation process that lay
ahead, Nieuwendyk was also psychologically shattered as he watched
his teammates struggle against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting so much inside, I couldn't even watch the
playoffs at first,'' he said. ``I wanted to be out there so badly
to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as low a moment in his life as he'd experienced since his
mother died. But he knew what she would expect of him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nieuwendyk hadn't raised her son to be a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said there was no way Nieuwendyk could expect to be
ready by the beginning of the 1999 season. They didn't know Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was forced to find out how hot it was in Dallas all summer,
that's for sure,'' said Nieuwendyk, remembering how he dragged
himself out of bed each morning to follow his rehab program. ``It
was a tough summer, I won't lie about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once our season ended last year against Detroit, it was
kind of like a new beginning for me. That was my focus all summer.
I didn't venture from it and as the season went on, I started to
feel better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's typical Nieuwendyk. He didn't exactly get into all the
gritty details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe downplayed that,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Joe worked
hard in the gym but \Rstrength and conditioning coach\S Jimmy
McQueen put Joe through hell. It was painful for me to watch,
because when it was 100 degrees outside, Jimmy made Joe put a
harness on and haul him around in the parking lot on a tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe hauled him all of August in Texas and all through
\Rtraining camp at\S Vail, up and down the hills. Nieuwendyk came
back 31/2 weeks early not because of the rehab work, but because of
the extra work he went through, which was really the football
mentality borrowed from the Cowboys, all of this harness work that
Joe was willing to do. Jimmy just pushed the hell out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, his mother's face always in front of him, simply
bowed his head and dug in, never asking for mercy. It was Hitchcock
who pleaded for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go out there and say, `Look, it's 104 degrees, let's
calm this down a little.' It didn't matter if it was 6 or 7 o'clock
in the morning, Nieuwendyk had to do the stuff, and I think it made
him mentally tougher, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players would do their thing and there would be Joe, all
by himself, up and down and all over the place. He deserves a lot
of credit because he pushed the envelope big time, but he did it
the natural way. The machinery left after a while, and he just did
it the old-fashioned way, hauling tires with people sitting in them
and hauling guys hooked to harnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nieuwendyk, who has taken his game to another level in the
playoffs as the Stars try to survive injuries to Mike Modano, Brett
Hull, Benoit Hogue and Grant Marshall, has hauled his team to the
cusp of a waltz with the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate when I first started my career to be on a
good Calgary team in the late '80s,'' said Nieuwendyk, who was an
integral part of the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup champions. ``It
taught me the value of hard work. When you're just 22 and you have
the type of success our team had, you think it's going to happen
every year. When you do get back you want to take full advantage of
it and just play for your teammates every night and play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember winning the Cup and what it felt like, but now that
I know how hard it is to get here, I'm trying to absorb more this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 32 now. That first time, a decade ago, Nieuwendyk's mom
was alive and Bryan Marchment was merely a thug-in-training. Life
looked like it could be full of waltzes with the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Now a much wiser Nieuwendyk knows better. Maybe that's why this
one means so much to him.
</P>
<P>
   He wants this dance, wants it so bad he can taste it.
</P>
<P>
   That one glorious spin around the ice, the Cup, glistening in
the lights, lifted to the heavens, held high above his head while
the crowd roars.
</P>
<P>
   He's been saving this dance for a long time now, you see.
</P>
<P>
   For his mom.

ILYA MUSIN, 95, RUSSIAN CONDUCTOR AND MENTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ilya Musin, the Russian conductor who taught a generation of
maestros while remaining relatively unknown outside his own
country, died on June 6 in St. Petersburg, Russia. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   During his six-decade tenure at the St. Petersburg State
Conservatory, formerly the Leningrad Conservatory of Music, Musin
was considered the country's foremost teacher of conducting,
instilling in his students expressiveness and exactitude. Denied a
considerable conducting career by Soviet anti-Semitism, he turned
to teaching, nurturing maestros like Valery Gergiev, Yuri
Temirkanov, Rudolf Barshai, Yakov Kreizberg and Semyon Bychkov.
</P>
<P>
   Though his reputation in the Soviet Union was legendary, Musin
did not travel abroad until 1991. His first foreign public concert
was in London in 1996, when he conducted the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra, to critical acclaim, in a program of Mozart,
Rimsky-Korsakov and Prokofiev.
</P>
<P>
   Ilya Aleksandrovich Musin was born in the provincial town of
Kostroma on the Volga River. His mother died when he was 6; his
father, a watchmaker and music lover, encouraged him to put aside
his painting aspirations and become a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Musin moved to St. Petersburg in 1919, shortly after the
Bolshevik Revolution, and enrolled at the Petrograd Conservatory.
There he attended symphonies and operas for the first time _ more
than 80 in his first year alone, often accompanied by his classmate
Dmitri Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing throughout one brutally cold winter in an unheated
room, he wrapped himself in boots, sweaters, scarf and coat,
leaving only his hands exposed and causing so much permanent damage
to them that he was forced to abandon any hopes of a career as a
pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1926, Nikolai Malko, the principal conductor of the
Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, opened a conducting faculty at
the conservatory. After an unsuccessful audition, Musin pleaded for
acceptance and was admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He embarked on a painstaking study of the art of gesture and its
influence on orchestral sound, a process that remained the basis of
the Leningrad School of conducting for the next 60 years. His
method was presented in a book, ``The Technique of Conducting.''
</P>
<P>
   In class Musin was less regimented, illustrating the movements
he desired by picking up chairs or miming such gestures as eating
soup. Much of his approach derived from natural motions and body
language, which he supplemented with more formal theories gleaned
from the writings of the acting teacher Konstantin Stanislavsky.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stalin, Musin never had charge of a leading Russian
orchestra, a sacrifice he willingly made, he said in 1996, because
of his refusal to join the Creative Union of Musicians and
Composers, and also because he was Jewish. As Malko's star pupil,
he logically would have succeeded his teacher as conductor of the
Leningrad Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he became Malko's assistant jointly with Yevgeny
Mravinsky, a member of the Communist Party. After conducting 30
concerts in 1937, Musin was abruptly sent to the Minsk
Philharmonic, well away from the center of Soviet cultural life. In
his absence, Mravinsky was appointed to the Leningrad post. Musin
was never asked back.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the conservatory after World War II, his dreams
of a conducting career dashed as he watched his former students and
less talented rivals elevated in stature above him. ``I decided
that I would have to live without the Great Hall of the
Philharmonic and concentrate on my teaching,'' he wrote in his
memoir, ``Lessons of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   His devoted and reverent students frequently invited him to
appear as a guest conductor across the Soviet Union. When he made
his Western debut, he was 92, conducting the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra in a concert arranged by his former pupil Sian Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had suffered four heart attacks since the early 1990s,
Musin maintained a rigorous schedule, teaching regular classes at
the conservatory (including one shortly before his death),
conducting orchestral sessions and giving master classes in Europe,
Japan and Israel, which he usually ended with a concert.
</P>
<P>
   Musin married Anna Aronovna in 1931. She died before he did, as
did a son. He is survived by another son, Edward, in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The art of conducting, Musin said, lay in ``making music visible
with your hands.'' A conductor ``must have expressiveness and
exactness,'' he continued. ``These are incompatible. The
conductor's challenge, therefore, is to find a way of combining
them.''

ELIE BACK IN THE NBA FINALS WITH ANOTHER TEXAS TEAM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In January, after the NBA lockout ended and teams
were scrambling to fill their rosters, the San Antonio Spurs' coach
and general manager, Gregg Popovich, looked at his club and saw a
hole the size of one of his marvelous 7-footers.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a talent gap, because in Tim Duncan and David
Robinson the Spurs had the best low-post tandem in the league.
Their point guard, Avery Johnson, was serviceable, and their
two-time All-Star small forward, Sean Elliott, was returning in
good health after two injury-marred seasons.
</P>
<P>
   What San Antonio needed was intangible. Notoriously nice and, by
NBA standards, almost saintly, the Spurs were Exhibit A for the
leaguewide notion that without a ruffian, a club could only go so
far.
</P>
<P>
   So in an effort to add some nastiness to his team's demeanor,
Popovich joined the crowded bidding war for Latrell Sprewell,
reportedly offering Elliott, Will Perdue and Vinny Del Negro. The
attempt proved fruitless, with Sprewell instead taking his fire and
grimace to the Knicks. So Popovich signed Mario Elie, a less
talented but equally hard free agent.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth-year veteran, Elie has not played spectacularly _ no one
expected him to _ but the 35-year-old shooting guard has been the
edgy, restless court tough that Popovich wanted. After going 5-5
with Elie playing in a reserve role early in the season, the Spurs
have gone 40-9 with him as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Elie has become the Spurs' Charles Oakley, and they
recognize the link between his arrival and their first trip to the
NBA finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the angriest guys I've ever met _ on the court,''
Johnson said. ``Off the court, he and I are good and we spend time
together working out in the summer. But on the court, he's got this
edge, this angriness about him. He's bitter about a lot of things
when he's out there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added: ``He's always telling me that he doesn't touch
the ball enough, and I've got to remind him that he's not Tim or
Dave. So he stays mad all the time, and we kind of needed that
little edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, a member of the Houston Rockets' championship teams in
1994 and 1995, did not waste time feeling out his new teammates or
trying to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs were on their way to a 6-8 start, he tore into
Robinson and Duncan for what he perceived to be their lack of
intensity and heart. Elie has since amended his views of the Spurs'
two big men, realizing that their placid ways on the court are an
extension of their personalities, not evidence of a lack of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   But Elie's misjudgment of Robinson and Duncan is understandable.
A New York City native, he was not accustomed to their
tranquillity. Having grown up five minutes from Madison Square
Garden, he was used to hustling, rushing, tension, to physical and
oral confrontation on the court. He played in the vicious 1994
finals series against the Knicks that led people to criticize the
brutish state of the post-Jordan NBA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my second time playing in the NBA finals in Madison
Square Garden,'' said Elie, obviously pleased to be returning home
in style again. ``But this time is a little different in that I'll
play a more integral part. My first year with Houston, I only
averaged 8 or 10 minutes a game. Now I have a bigger role as a
starter. And Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Puff Daddy and everybody
are all going to be at the game, so it's going to be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the starters in this series, which begins Wednesday, no
one comes close to matching Elie in finals experience. He is the
only starter on either team who has played for an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   His Spurs teammates Steve Kerr, acquired in a pre-season trade,
and Will Perdue won three championships apiece with the Chicago
Bulls, but neither is expected to play much of a role against the
Knicks, although Kerr has received more playing time recently.
</P>
<P>
   While Elie was a bit player in his last finals trip to the
Garden, he has since proved to be a clutch performer when the stage
is large.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he saved Houston from a second-round exit at the hands
of the Phoenix Suns by hitting a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left to
give the Rockets a 115-114 victory in Game 7. Then, in the finals
against the Orlando Magic, he nearly doubled his regular-season
scoring average with 16.3 points a game in Houston's four-game
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Elie has been less heroic in these playoffs, making only 23.5
percent of his 3-point attempts (4 of 17) after leading the Spurs
at 37.4 percent during the regular season. He is averaging 6.4
points in the 12 playoff games _ 11 of them victories _ after
averaging 9.7 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But defensively, he has been strong, shutting down Portland's
Isaiah Rider in the Western Conference finals. Elie will guard
Allan Houston, with the understanding that slowing him down is
vital to San Antonio's success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan Houston is a terrific talent and I'm looking forward to
the challenge,'' Elie said. ``I've played against Grant Hill and
Michael Jordan over the years, so this is just another challenge
that I relish. If I can just do my job on my guy, it gives my team
a chance to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Popovich had in mind when he acquired Elie five
months ago.

OLYMPIANS SEEK VOICE IN CHANGING IOC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Athletes, like most other people, agree that the
International Olympic Committee needs changes, and they have
finally formed an organization to make themselves heard.
</P>
<P>
   For 2 1/2 days, 80 people with Olympic backgrounds met at the
Regal U.N. Plaza Hotel in New York to formulate an agenda to make
athletes heard. The group included 46 recent Olympic athletes from
more than a dozen nations, including 12 gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions ended Sunday, and Mark Tewksbury, the Canadian
swimmer, 1992 Olympic gold medalist and co-founder of the athletes'
movement, said he was encouraged. When the recent illegal-payment
scandals involving IOC members erupted, Tewksbury quit three
Olympic-related positions in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to return the Olympics to their old ideals,'' he said.
``We want to return the IOC to what it said it always wanted to be.
We plan to send a positive statement to them.'' He said they
planned to begin sending the message with the IOC meetings this
week in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The participants here included speed skater Johan Olaf Koss of
Norway, distance runner Zola Budd of South Africa, swimmer Dawn
Fraser of Australia, sprinter Grace Jackson of Jamaica and three
Americans: swimmer John Naber, triple jumper Willie Banks and the
skater Peter Carruthers.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes call their organization Olympic Advocates Together
Honorably. It is financed by Magna, a Canadian corporation that
supplies auto parts to manufacturers. The athletes and Magna say
they have no hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to get a piece of the pie,'' Naber said, ``just
to assure that the pie tastes as good as the recipe says it
should.''
</P>
<P>
   Koss added, ``We want to show the youth of the world there is
fair play and a higher standard for athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson said: ``We need a communications link between
athletes and the IOC. I think this organization can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC already has an athletes advisory board that includes
seven men and women elected by fellow athletes at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics and three elected by athletes at the 1998 Nagano Winter
Olympics. That board has proposed that the 10 elected athletes
become IOC members until the next athletes' election.
</P>
<P>
   Tewksbury said this was no attempt to grab power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take over management of international
sport,'' he said. ``The principles in the Olympic charter are good.
They have not been upheld.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 14:
</P>
<P>
   Russia may no longer be a superpower, but it still has the means
to bedevil the United States and NATO. It took the unexpected
movement of only 200 or so heavily armed Russian troops into Kosovo
over the weekend to disrupt NATO peacekeeping operations and to
remind everyone that Moscow can thoroughly complicate the postwar
scene in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no place in Kosovo for freelance Russian forces,
but Moscow can play an important peacekeeping role if it will work
in cooperation with NATO. The White House and the Kremlin urgently
need to devise a way to make that coordination possible. To that
end, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin talked by phone for an hour
Sunday and plan to speak again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A small contingent of Russian soldiers and tanks parked at the
airport outside Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, may not seem like
a serious impediment to the 50,000 NATO peacekeepers now starting
to fan out across the province. For the most part, the arrival of
British, French, German, American and Italian troops has gone well,
though there have been several minor confrontations with retreating
Serbian units.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians, with the help of Serbian soldiers, peacefully
blocked the British from taking control of the airport, which is
needed for the delivery of military and relief supplies. More
important, their presence serves as an emphatic statement by Moscow
that it intends to assert its influence in Kosovo, whether NATO
likes it or not, and is in no mood to take orders from the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the Russian move may have been designed to
counter intense criticism at home about the Kremlin's help in
negotiating an end to the war mostly on NATO terms.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians believe Moscow betrayed its Slavic allies in
Belgrade, and some top military commanders have made little secret
of their contempt for the Russian diplomacy. It was unnerving on
Friday night to find the Russians troops rolling into Kosovo just
hours after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov assured Washington no such
step would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington should not buy Ivanov's explanation that the move
was a mistake, and should be wary of speculation that Yeltsin is so
politically weakened that the generals are dictating policy. The
Russian military, however diminished it may be by budget cuts and
sinking morale, remains a professional institution with a clear
chain of command and a strong tradition of civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   It seems more likely that Yeltsin quietly approved the march
into Kosovo and did not bother to tell Ivanov. That impression was
reinforced by the promotion on Saturday of the Russian commander in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, there is not much NATO can do to evict
the Russians or to prevent reinforcements from arriving. Escalating
military tensions with Moscow would serve no one's interest. That
means the problem must be resolved by Clinton and Yeltsin and their
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is right to insist on a unified command for
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. The risk of chaos and accidental
confrontation is too great if Russian troops roam freely about
Kosovo. Nor should Russia be given exclusive control over a
separate sector of the province. That could be tantamount to
partition, a step that should be avoided and certainly not taken by
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO should recognize that the Russian military, at this
sensitive moment, cannot be seen as taking direct orders from the
alliance. Some kind of face-saving procedure must be developed that
gives Russian forces considerable latitude within the peacekeeping
operation. That might involve giving them responsibility for some
portion of territory within one or more of the five allied sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia is over, but the events of the weekend
show how hard it will be to produce an enduring peace. Securing the
cooperation of Russia is essential to everything else.

DREIFORT STRUGGLES WITH CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The concern and talk is about Carlos Perez, and
whether the Dodgers lefty will be removed from the starting
rotation. Obviously, it's given the Dodgers fits.
</P>
<P>
   But right-hander Darren Dreifort isn't pitching much better
these days. It's just that the reason for his failures are much
easier to identify. The former No.1 pick, known for being erratic
around the plate, is having more trouble than ever before throwing
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's undoing wasn't the seven hits in Sunday's 9-3 loss to
the Oakland Athletics. It was the six walks, plus a hit batter,
that spelled doom for Dreifort. Of the seven runs he allowed in
41/3 innings, only Miguel Tejada reached via hitting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept reminding him to keep his front side closed,'' said
Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley. ``It was flying open toward the end.
He was yanking some pitches away to right-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   It cost Dreifort (5-5) his place on the mound when he walked
three straight A's to set up the five-run fifth inning. Dreifort
opted not to speak to reporters after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort entered the day tied for fifth in the National League
in walks. He's now walked 46 in 671/3 innings, or 6.1 per nine
innings. Last season Dreifort walked 2.85 per nine innings and,
before this season, walked 3.59 per nine innings in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's frustrated probably more than anything because he knows
he's better than that,'' said Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen.
``Some of these younger guys are not far enough along to know
themselves when they know how to make corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort, he came to me (between innings), and he said the
pitches were doing something he didn't want them to do. He said,
`What am I doing?' The ball was cutting a way he didn't want it to
cut. We've got to recover from it and we have to (during) certain
facets of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was forced to go to reliever Jamie
Arnold for 31/3 innings of relief. But Johnson said it wouldn't
keep him from using Arnold to start in Perez's place Wednesday if
such a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth pushed back again: One thing that's hampered
Johnson's style is the lack of a left-handed hitter off the bench.
Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth was supposed to provide it, but he's
been injured most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson said it'll be at least another week before
Hollandsworth can return to the lineup because of a torn muscle on
his right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt good the other day, but that's before he did
anything,'' Johnson said. ``It's a little different when you try to
throw and try to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long ordeal for Hollandsworth, who missed the first
16 games of the season with a strained right hamstring. He injured
his side swinging at a pitch in Cincinnati on May 28 and was
supposed to miss only a few days. He's missed the last nine games.
It also puts a strain on Johnson, who likes to use his bench to
rest the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called matchups,'' Johnson said. ``It helps to have
matchups to strengthen the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing grand about it: Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
averages 25 home runs a season and went three straight seasons with
at least 30 homers and 100 RBI. He's hit 10 homers this season and
Sunday had his streak of hitting a homer stopped at three games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, one thing Karros is yet to do is hit a grand slam. He's hit
187 homers in his career, but none have come with the bases loaded.
Karros had an opportunity to change that Sunday but grounded out
with the bases loaded in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   This season Karros is 1 for 8 with the bases loaded; in his
career, he's 25 for 76 (.329).

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Congress primed to pass gun-control legislation,
New Yorkers may be tempted to feel smug. The rest of the country is
finally starting to share the prevailing distaste in the city for
guns. Urbanites seem to be triumphing over the plaid-shirted guys
driving the back roads in pickup trucks with NRA decals.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to remain smug if you talk to John R. Lott. He
believes that thousands of New Yorkers, particularly women in poor
neighborhoods, are victims of violent crimes each year because of
the city's strict controls on guns. And he is not one of those guys
in the pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is an economist who teaches at the University of Chicago
Law School. He grew up in a home without guns and never wanted to
hunt. He did not object to the domestic gun controls imposed by his
wife, who would not let their four sons have even toy pistols.
</P>
<P>
   But then he did a study that persuaded him to buy a real gun _
with his wife's blessing. As a fellow economist, she too was
converted by the data in the study, which tracked crime rates in
every county in America for 18 years. The results were summarized
in the title of his book, published by the University of Chicago
Press last year: ``More Guns, Less Crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott found that crime drops after a state enacts a
right-to-carry law, which guarantees citizens a gun permit as long
as they have no criminal records and meet a few specific
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more citizens carrying guns, it becomes riskier for
criminals to operate,'' Lott said. ``Some of them switch to safer
crimes _ you see an increase in larceny as they switch from robbing
people to stealing cars. Some will shift to other jurisdictions, so
there'll be an increase in violent crime in the counties just
across the border of the adjacent state.''
</P>
<P>
   What if New York City, which now gives permits only to citizens
who demonstrate a compelling need for a gun, was to adopt a
right-to-carry law? Extrapolating from his research, Lott estimated
that after the law had been in effect for five years, there would
be about 100 fewer murders a year, 300 fewer rapes, 5,000 fewer
aggravated assaults and 9,000 fewer robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest beneficiaries of right-to-carry laws are
residents of high-crime urban neighborhoods, especially women,''
Lott said. ``A woman who behaves passively when confronted by a
criminal is 2.5 times more likely to be seriously injured than a
woman who has a gun. It's rare that she has to use the gun _ just
brandishing it is usually enough to protect herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott argues that right-to-carry laws are particularly effective
at discouraging shooting sprees in public areas.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the restrictive policy on gun permits in the Denver
area did not avert the killings at Columbine High School, Lott
cited examples of armed citizens stopping students in shootings at
schools in Pearl, Miss., and Edinboro, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a state passes a right-to-carry law,'' he said, ``there's
an 84 percent drop in the rate at which multiple-victim shootings
occur, and there are fewer fatalities when they do occur. If
someone tries to start shooting in a crowded public place, there's
a good chance that someone there will also be armed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott does not advocate arming high school students, but he
thinks that Congress made a mistake in 1995 by banning adults from
having guns within 1,000 feet of a school. ``We're trying to create
safe cover for our children,'' he said, ``but my concern is that
we're creating safe zones for those interested in harming our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   In academia, debate has been lively over the meaning of Lott's
research. Gary Kleck, an eminent criminologist at the University of
Florida, terms it ``mandatory reading for anyone who is open-minded
and serious about the gun-control issue,'' but he cautions that the
reductions in crime may be largely because of unknown factors other
than right-to-carry laws.
</P>
<P>
   Outside academia, Lott's work has driven gun-control advocates
to desperate measures. Many have spread false accusations that he
is financially beholden to the gun industry. The most surprising
development, Lott said, has been dozens of death threats from
gun-control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected this much attention,'' he said, ``although I
can understand why people instinctively want to get rid of guns.
Bad things can happen with guns. But guns can also be used to stop
bad things from happening, and the net effect is that they save
lives.''

6-13 -- Harold M. Ickes, 59, finds ``grand redemption'' in Hillary
Clinton's candidacy, as he eagerly maps out the first lady's
approach to a Senate run from New York. Ickes' own passion forpolitics is glaringly clear, especially since he was forced out as
deputy chief of staff at the White House in a power squeeze two
years ago. ``Hillary Clinton has the chutzpah and the grit,'' he
says. ``Even if she loses it will be worth the candle -- for her
and her supporters.'' (Dith Pran/New York Times Photo)

problem with guns.'' As The House of Representatives prepares to
vote this week on gun-control legislation, the popularity of
hunting and the nearly universal ownership of guns in many rural
areas has put congressmen from these areas at special political
risk -- particularly Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democrat whose district
encompasses Michigan's northernmost reaches. (Mike Roemer/New York

Bush on Saturday, the front-runner for the Republican nomination.
Setting the theme for his campaign upon arriving in Cedar Rapids,

using the nation's prosperity to help its downtrodden. (Andrea

George W. Bush speaking at a fund-raiser for Rep. Jim Nussle in

it had all the trappings of a full-scale political invasion.

EDITORIAL: THE KNICKS' MAGICAL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 14:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks, a team that nobody thought would outlive
the first round of the NBA playoffs, are now in the championship
round, and their opponents, the heavily favored San Antonio Spurs,
have got to be wondering, who are these guys?
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what the Knicks' dazed and dazzled fans are
asking themselves, and the only sure answer is that they bear no
resemblance to the team they were two months ago, when their record
was 21-21. Necessity, in the form of critical injuries, has forced
them to use different combinations and play a more up-tempo style.
They have become quicker, more creative, less selfish with the
ball, and in so doing have defeated three playoff teams that were
supposed to beat them, including the formidable Indiana Pacers on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Each game has produced a new hero _ Larry Johnson in Game 3,
Latrell Sprewell in Game 5, and, in Game 6, Allan Houston, whose
32-point effort on Friday created pandemonium in Madison Square
Garden. The Knicks may now have to go forward without Johnson, who
suffered a sprained knee, but this is a team that so far has
flourished in adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have survived the demotion of their general manager
and rumors that their coach would be the next to go. They have
surmounted clubhouse bickering and the loss of their star center,
Patrick Ewing, who went down with a torn Achilles' tendon in the
second game against Indiana. Most of all they have survived
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-playoff Knicks always seemed to find ways to
self-destruct at the most inopportune moments, usually the fourth
quarter. The word comeback was not part of their emotional
vocabulary. This team finds ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Ewing hurt and helped the Knicks. It robbed them of
a rebounding force and another reliable jump shot, but it also
forced Jeff Van Gundy, the coach, to give more playing time to
Sprewell, whose explosive moves create chances for himself and
others, and to Marcus Camby, a rapidly maturing player about whom
Van Gundy can no longer have any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Camby has been everywhere, running around like a mad stork _
rebounding, passing, dunking, blocking shots. Without him, without
Sprewell, without a resurgent Houston and without Johnson's
improbable run of three-point shots, Van Gundy and the Knicks would
be on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a magical post-season, mystifying even the Knicks.
``I feel I've been part of a story that is bigger than all of us,''
Johnson said the other day. The question now is, is that story
bigger than the San Antonio Spurs, a tall, strong, versatile team
that has not lost since May 11? Most experts say no. The Knicks
fans are thrilled that the question has come up at all.

DODGERS AT THEIR `WORST'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Manager Davey Johnson said he was too mad to hold a
team meeting Saturday so he waited for Sunday morning to discuss
the many shortcomings of the Dodgers. The meeting took 15 minutes,
though if time permitted it could have lasted 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   So inspired were the Dodgers by the talk that they went out
and... you got it, lost again.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics completed the three-game sweep of the
Dodgers with a 9-3 win at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (the meeting), you should play better,'' Dodgers catcher
Todd Hundley said. ``Right now, I can honestly say, this is the
worst it's been all year. We have to turn it back around. If we
keep going in this direction, it's going to be a long year, and
we're a better team than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (29-32) have lost three straight and six of seven,
were swept for the second time in less than two weeks and
nose-dived to three games under .500 for the first time, They're
also now tied for third place with Colorado and could be in fourth
place by the time they play Tuesday against Pittsburgh, which
happened to wax the Dodgers earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do other things better,'' Johnson said of the
meeting. ``Pitching has to tighten up, we can't make mistakes in
the field and we have to find more ways to manufacture runs.
Baseball is a game where, no matter what your ability, you have to
apply those abilities, apply those talents. We have to do a better
job of it. That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between being good and bad is small. We all
have to be on the same page _ re-apply ourselves and do the things
we're capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were gung-ho for a few innings, scoring first when
Eric Young led off with an infield single and scored on Gary
Sheffield's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The A's scored twice in the third, set up by walks, and the
warm, fuzzy feeling the meeting left was obliterated in the fifth
inning when walk-prone pitcher Darren Dreifort lost his command.
Dreifort, an enigma in that the movement of his pitches is near the
best in baseball, walked three straight batters before being
replaced in the fifth inning. Each of those runners scored,
culminating with an only-in-Dodgerland type of play.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jamie Arnold struck out Ryan Christenson on a ball in
the dirt with the bases loaded. The ball bounced hard off the
backstop and back to Hundley, who instead of running to touch home
for the force threw wildly to first. Two runs scored, the A's had
an 8-1 lead and Dodgers were looking bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I could get to home before the runner and I
wound up throwing the ball into right field,'' Hundley said.
``That, right there, is the first time it's happened with the bases
loaded, the third out. First time in my career I can remember
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by that point the outcome could be pretty well
predicted, though it added a little insult to Dreifort's line. He
allowed seven runs on four hits in 41/3 innings. Dreifort (5-5)
walked six and lost his third straight.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who entered the series with a major-league-low .235
batting average, battered Dodgers pitching. They hit .294 and
scored 25 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a manager has a meeting, it should help guys relax a
little bit,'' Sheffield said. ``He lets you know he's with you, he
backs you. I took the meeting the meeting as a positive _ positive
at all of us. We all have to do the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the A's did all the non-stat-oriented things to
further humble the Dodgers. They took extra bases, worked counts
deep and moved runners over. And they had a pitcher, 23-year-old
Tim Hudson, who threw strikes and relied on his fielders.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (2-0) won his second major-league start with ease. He
allowed two runs on seven hits and struck out eight, mostly with a
nasty forkball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's so much we ran into Hudson or we ran into
ourselves,'' said Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, who went 3 for
4 with two doubles. ``Obviously, it's frustrating. We've got 100
games left and we're playing whether we want to or not. We're
playing those games regardless, so you get out of here and focus on
Tuesday's game.''

JOHN LLOYD, 51, AN ARCHEOLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Lloyd, a British archeologist who unearthed relics yielding
new information about day-to-day living in classical times, died on
May 30 in Oxford, England. He was 51 and had worked with Oxford
University's Institute of Archeology for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He had a brain tumor, said The Independent, which reported his
death on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldwork by Lloyd ``has given us new understanding for ordinary
life in towns and villages and farms throughout the ancient
world,'' Prof. Graeme Barker, head of Leicester University's School
of Archeological Studies, wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Lloyd was field director of excavations at the
site of the old-time Greek and Roman city of Berenice in what is
now a suburb of Benghazi, a port on Libya's Mediterranean coast.
That work produced insights into many facets of life in Berenice,
which was given that name under the Greeks in the third century
B.C. and was acquired by the Romans in the first century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lloyd and others sought information about the ancient
history of the Biferno River valley in Italy. That project included
squads of archeologists walking present-day farmers' fields in
search of bits of old pottery and other remnants of life in the
valley in classical times.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 article he reported that such ``field-walking
archeology'' by ``survey archeologists'' had revealed an
undreamed-of ``busy countryside'' of farms, residences and
communities in what are now nations all around the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Broughty Ferry, Scotland, Lloyd graduated from
Manchester University. He went on to be a lecturer successively at
Sheffield and Oxford universities from 1977 to 1988 and a fellow of
Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1988 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He married Vicky Doughty in 1976, and they had a son and a
daughter.

FOR RETIRING TEACHERS, CLASSROOMS HAVE CHANGED OVER 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBERA CARLTON HARRELL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Class of '99 is graduating after about 30 years,
facing a new millennium without chalk dust, school bells, upraised
hands and reverberating hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The grads will miss the toothless grin of a beginning reader,
the ``light-bulb'' glow on the face of a kid who finally ``gets''
long division, the troubled teen who discovers he's an artist, the
junior chemist whose experiment trips the smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for hundreds of veteran public school teachers statewide,
it's time to retire. Although some admit to burnout, and one said a
``class from hell'' triggered her retirement, most are choosing to
leave on top, memories warm and legacies intact.
</P>
<P>
   Among the retiree Class of 1999 are many whose careers span
decades of cultural foment and change, from Vietnam to the
techno-revolution. Or, as one teacher joked, ``from `Leave It to
Beaver' to `Beavis and Butthead.'''
</P>
<P>
   From former Peace Corps volunteers to take-no-prisoners math
instructors, these retirees, most in their 50s, have survived
reductions-in-staff and recessions and adjusted to curriculum
shifts (phonics to math to state tests), new laws (special
education, education reform) and dramatic demographic changes.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such cultural trends as poverty, substance abuse,
fractured families and violence, they have become counselors,
social service workers and security officers as well as teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when teachers' salary debates and walkouts prompted
some to reconsider their professions, many veteran teachers say
they would make the same career choice today. Said respected
30-year Bellevue teacher Karen Gosch: ``I believe I had an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Garfield High School math teacher Jack Babani likes the
word ``impact'' so much he calculated it: 150 kids a year times 30
years of teaching means 4,500 kids whose lives intersected with
his. That doesn't count parents and teaching interns. For teachers
who also have coached sports, add a few thousand more kids.
</P>
<P>
   For most, those relationships were a matter of quality as well
as quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Diane Kegin, who started teaching kindergarten when kids
merely ``drank milk and rested on a rug,'' is retiring after 37
years in the Hoquiam School District, where efforts to protect the
spotted owl produced timber layoffs and tough times for families.
</P>
<P>
   A former student, a Hispanic girl now in first grade, gave Kegin
a retirement present _ a crumpled piece of paper that said, ``I
want to hold onto your hand forever,'' written painstakingly in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me cry,'' Kegin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kegin and others said one of the biggest changes over the
decades is that kids increasingly look to teachers to fill
emotional gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had many kids, many times, that have asked me, `Can I go
home with you?''' Kegin said. ``They don't want to go home. ...
I've seen a lot more broken homes over the years. The stable family
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hoff, a business education teacher at Kennewick High
School, agrees. Hoff, who survived a heart attack nine years ago,
will retire after 31 years. He said he believes more and more
students want to talk to teachers because ``communication at home
doesn't seem as good as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need someone to talk to, and they turn to teachers _
someone who's kind, non-threatening, someone who will listen,''
Hoff said. ``My students, in a retirement tribute, signed things
like `thanks for being a great teacher and a great friend.' That's
how I like to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring teachers say believing in kids is critical _ and so are
high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers feel very responsible for kids, to prepare them to
live and work in this world,'' said Gosch, who still receives
correspondence from former students living nearby and as far away
as Japan, Australia and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teachers are givers and sensitive people who really care.
I feel like teaching was my mission in life, and I think I
succeeded,'' said Gosch, part of a teaching team at Clyde Hill
Elementary, which had some of the state's highest reading scores
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are high,'' she said. ``I think kids rise to
the expectations of their teachers and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Ensign of Olympia, retiring after 25 years mostly in the
North Thurston School District, recalls ``an 8-year-old boy who
came to class all disheveled. His desk was always a mess, he never
got his work done and just really had a hard time with school.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ensign inquired, the boy said he was living in a trailer
with his mom and younger brother; he slept on the floor and was
responsible for getting everyone up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said she told the ``bright kid'' what she expected of
him, and pushed him to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reached the point where he did his work well ... he later
moved, but when he left, he gave me a big hug and a little note
that said, `Thank you and I'll miss you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grade teacher Sharon Held was hugged and saluted by
grateful students, parents and colleagues at a retirement party
last week. She became teary-eyed as 33 years _ the last 15 at
Bennett Elementary in Bellevue _ drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Held, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Uganda who entered
teaching out of ``a sense of service,'' recalls first meeting one
student when he was trying to escape down a tree after being caught
running on the school roof.
</P>
<P>
   Held was determined to show the self-described ``bad boy'' he
could become ``a productive, valued member of the class not by
misbehaving, but through positive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Much individualized attention and many ``contracts'' later, the
boy settled down, discovered a talent for drawing, and began
helping classmates illustrate their books for a school publishing
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had leadership potential. He had things to contribute,''
Held said. ``One of the most important things a teacher can do is
to find out what each child's gift is and allow him or her to
showcase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees say kids in some ways are like they were 30 years
ago _ ``more interested in friends than school'' _ but their social
skills have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say kids are more rude and less respectful of adults
and peers; they do not look people in the eyes when they speak or
they pass in front of others without saying a word. They often
ignore instructions and yell at their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many retiring teachers also believe attention spans are shorter
(they blame television and electronic games).
</P>
<P>
   Security, once a blank in school budgets, is a huge issue now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, kids fought but they rolled around in the
grass and punched each other,'' Kennewick High's Hoff said. ``Now
you worry about two kids fighting, because one of them could bring
out a knife. Things are scarier.''
</P>
<P>
   But many retiring teachers think self-discipline and personal
responsibility are making ``much-needed comebacks,'' and they plead
for more parental involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Holden, a 31-year veteran and Newport High School science
teacher, has taught through Purple Haze and purple hair, but says
nothing compares to the Vietnam era for student unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, society has changed,'' Holden said. ``I remember at
the Class of '70's graduation, parents and other adults booed a
student speaker off the stage in tears because he made some comment
about Vietnam. We haven't really had anything compared to that
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also say that for all their hard work, some of the
mightiest lessons have come from students.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, who also is a football coach, recalls 16-year-old
student and football player Brad Bowers, who died from cancer in
1977:
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he was healthy, catching a touchdown pass, the next
day he was limping. A week later he had his leg amputated because
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched this kid battle cancer for 18 months before he died.
He taught me about grace, about living, about faith. That kid had
the greatest impact on my life. Anytime anything seemed like a big
deal, I could always look back on that kid and I knew my deal was
not a big deal.''

FOR RETIRING TEACHERS, CLASSROOMS HAVE CHANGED OVER 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBERA CARLTON HARRELL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Class of '99 is graduating after about 30 years,
facing a new millennium without chalk dust, school bells, upraised
hands and reverberating hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The grads will miss the toothless grin of a beginning reader,
the ``light-bulb'' glow on the face of a kid who finally ``gets''
long division, the troubled teen who discovers he's an artist, the
junior chemist whose experiment trips the smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for hundreds of veteran public school teachers statewide,
it's time to retire. Although some admit to burnout, and one said a
``class from hell'' triggered her retirement, most are choosing to
leave on top, memories warm and legacies intact.
</P>
<P>
   Among the retiree Class of 1999 are many whose careers span
decades of cultural foment and change, from Vietnam to the
techno-revolution. Or, as one teacher joked, ``from `Leave It to
Beaver' to `Beavis and Butthead.'''
</P>
<P>
   From former Peace Corps volunteers to take-no-prisoners math
instructors, these retirees, most in their 50s, have survived
reductions-in-staff and recessions and adjusted to curriculum
shifts (phonics to math to state tests), new laws (special
education, education reform) and dramatic demographic changes.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such cultural trends as poverty, substance abuse,
fractured families and violence, they have become counselors,
social service workers and security officers as well as teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when teachers' salary debates and walkouts prompted
some to reconsider their professions, many veteran teachers say
they would make the same career choice today. Said respected
30-year Bellevue teacher Karen Gosch: ``I believe I had an
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Garfield High School math teacher Jack Babani likes the
word ``impact'' so much he calculated it: 150 kids a year times 30
years of teaching means 4,500 kids whose lives intersected with
his. That doesn't count parents and teaching interns. For teachers
who also have coached sports, add a few thousand more kids.
</P>
<P>
   For most, those relationships were a matter of quality as well
as quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Diane Kegin, who started teaching kindergarten when kids
merely ``drank milk and rested on a rug,'' is retiring after 37
years in the Hoquiam School District, where efforts to protect the
spotted owl produced timber layoffs and tough times for families.
</P>
<P>
   A former student, a Hispanic girl now in first grade, gave Kegin
a retirement present _ a crumpled piece of paper that said, ``I
want to hold onto your hand forever,'' written painstakingly in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me cry,'' Kegin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kegin and others said one of the biggest changes over the
decades is that kids increasingly look to teachers to fill
emotional gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had many kids, many times, that have asked me, `Can I go
home with you?''' Kegin said. ``They don't want to go home. ...
I've seen a lot more broken homes over the years. The stable family
is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hoff, a business education teacher at Kennewick High
School, agrees. Hoff, who survived a heart attack nine years ago,
will retire after 31 years. He said he believes more and more
students want to talk to teachers because ``communication at home
doesn't seem as good as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need someone to talk to, and they turn to teachers _
someone who's kind, non-threatening, someone who will listen,''
Hoff said. ``My students, in a retirement tribute, signed things
like `thanks for being a great teacher and a great friend.' That's
how I like to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Retiring teachers say believing in kids is critical _ and so are
high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers feel very responsible for kids, to prepare them to
live and work in this world,'' said Gosch, who still receives
correspondence from former students living nearby and as far away
as Japan, Australia and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teachers are givers and sensitive people who really care.
I feel like teaching was my mission in life, and I think I
succeeded,'' said Gosch, part of a teaching team at Clyde Hill
Elementary, which had some of the state's highest reading scores
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations are high,'' she said. ``I think kids rise to
the expectations of their teachers and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Ensign of Olympia, retiring after 25 years mostly in the
North Thurston School District, recalls ``an 8-year-old boy who
came to class all disheveled. His desk was always a mess, he never
got his work done and just really had a hard time with school.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ensign inquired, the boy said he was living in a trailer
with his mom and younger brother; he slept on the floor and was
responsible for getting everyone up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign said she told the ``bright kid'' what she expected of
him, and pushed him to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reached the point where he did his work well ... he later
moved, but when he left, he gave me a big hug and a little note
that said, `Thank you and I'll miss you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grade teacher Sharon Held was hugged and saluted by
grateful students, parents and colleagues at a retirement party
last week. She became teary-eyed as 33 years _ the last 15 at
Bennett Elementary in Bellevue _ drew to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Held, a former Peace Corps volunteer in Uganda who entered
teaching out of ``a sense of service,'' recalls first meeting one
student when he was trying to escape down a tree after being caught
running on the school roof.
</P>
<P>
   Held was determined to show the self-described ``bad boy'' he
could become ``a productive, valued member of the class not by
misbehaving, but through positive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Much individualized attention and many ``contracts'' later, the
boy settled down, discovered a talent for drawing, and began
helping classmates illustrate their books for a school publishing
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had leadership potential. He had things to contribute,''
Held said. ``One of the most important things a teacher can do is
to find out what each child's gift is and allow him or her to
showcase it.''

skills have plummeted.
</P>

   Wilmina Rowland Smith, the first woman to serve as a guest
chaplain of the U.S. Senate, died on June 5 at a retirement home in
St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Rowland, as she was known, was born in Augusta, Ga., on
March 17, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from Wilson
College in Chambersburg, Pa. She also earned master's degrees from
Yale University and Union Theological Seminary in New York.
</P>

`AUSTIN POWERS' BEATS `PHANTOM' IN `SHAGADELIC' OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers proclaimed ``Yeah, baby!'' as ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' dominated business at the nation's
multiplexes with a stunning $54.7 million at 3,312 theaters during
the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The goofy sequel smashed the record for best opening by a comedy
and fifth-best Friday-Sunday debut ever. The New Line release, with
Mike Myers in the double role as the 1960s British superspy and
arch-villain Dr. Evil, generated sellouts and long lines in all
markets, much like last month's opening of ``Star Wars Episode 1:
The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the business were expecting big numbers for `Austin
Powers' but this is well above expectations,'' said movie analyst
Arthur Rockwell. ``It obviously had a huge cross-over audience
beyond teen-agers and young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' which also took in $2.5 million at
Thursday night preview screenings, has already outgrossed the 1997
original's total box office of $53.9 million and could wind up with
$185 million by the end of its run, according to Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   The film's massive promotional push highlighted Austin Powers
catch phrases _ ``Shagadelic,'' ``Oh, behave,'' ``Yeah, baby!'' _
and turned the expected box office dominance by ``Phantom Menace''
into a positive by running ads spoofing the ``Star Wars'' prequel.
``It was by far the best publicity campaign this year,'' Bucksbaum
said. ``You can't say enough about New Line and how it's gone from
rags to riches.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line, which made its name in low-cost horror films, has
become a major Hollywood player over the last five years. Time
Warner Inc. bought New Line in 1995 as part of its deal for Turner
Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of fun with `Star Wars' and I think people picked
up on that,'' said New Line distribution chief Al Shapiro. ``The
numbers are beyond our wildest expectations and we think a lot of
people want to see it again. We're not facing a direct challenge as
a light, fluffy comedy until Sony opens `Big Daddy' in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend total for ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' trailed only
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' ``Phantom Menace,'' ``Mission:
Impossible'' and ``Godzilla'' for biggest Friday-Sunday opening. It
smashed ``The Waterboy's'' record of $39.4 million for a comedy
opening by 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall weekend box office turned in a robust performance
with ``Phantom Menace'' posting a still-impressive $25.4 million at
3,024 theaters to hit $296.7 million after 26 days. The 20th
Century Fox release, which will become the ninth member of the $300
million club today or Tuesday, continued to show holdover power
with a weekend-to-weekend decline of only 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Disney's ``Tarzan'' and Paramount's ``The General's
Daughter'' opening Friday, ``Phantom Menace'' will pass
``Independence Day,'' ``Return of the Jedi'' and ``The Lion King''
by the end of next weekend and will be near the No. 5 all-time spot
held by ``Forrest Gump'' at $329.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Phantom Menace' is clearly going to travel well into the
rest of the summer,'' Rockwell said. ``Right now, it looks like
we're going to have a tremendous summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum noted that the power of the top two films, which took
in about two-thirds of the overall weekend box office, had led to a
gain of 25 percent over the same weekend last year when ``Six Days
and Seven Nights'' opened with $16.5 million. ``This is not usually
a big weekend for opening movies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Also continuing to perform well was Universal's third weekend of
``Notting Hill'' with $11.2 million at 2,780 theaters as the
romantic comedy lost only 25 percent from its previous
Friday-Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's action-adventure ``Instinct'' posted moderate totals in
fourth with $6.8 million at 2,087 theaters in its second weekend,
followed by Universal's sixth weekend of ``The Mummy'' with $5.1
million at 3,098 theaters, pushing it past $135.9 million to 83rd
on the all-time list over 1996's ``101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's seventh weekend of ``Entrapment'' finished sixth with $2.6
million at 2,147 sites to top $79 million overall, followed by
Warner Bros.' 11th weekend of ``The Matrix'' with $2.1 million at
1,907 sites to reach $161million. Sony's third weekend of ``The
Thirteenth Floor'' continued its fast fade with an unimpressive $1
million at 1,815 theaters, followed by Fox's 10th weekend of
``Never Been Kissed'' with $880,000 and Fox Searchlight's fifth
weekend of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' with $800,000.

GOP CONTINGENT GETS READY TO FIGHT GUN CONTROL IN HOUSE THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ A trio of House Republicans who managed the
effort to impeach President Clinton predicted they will
successfully defend gun owners' rights in a House fight this week
over proposed gun safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is using the National Rifle
Association as a ``red herring'' in an effort to slap more controls
on gun-owning Americans, said the GOP congressmen during a weekend
visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee Republicans predicted Saturday
that Democrats living in rural areas will join them in trying to
block gun restrictions passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control is expected to spark verbal fire in the House this
week when the House takes up the Senate-passed juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow the votes: You are going to see a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats fight for Second Amendment rights: They
will vote against extreme measures and defend the right to bear
arms,'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle's Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott countered that
recent school shootings have turned public opinion in favor of gun
safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans used to accept that there were shootings in our
cities,'' McDermott said. ``They felt that, if you moved to a
suburban area, you would be protected from gun violence. The
Colorado and Georgia shootings show that you are not protected.
Your children are not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he expects Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
longest-serving House Democrat and former board member of the NRA,
to lead the fight for a softer gun-show provision than the one
passed by the Senate last month on a dramatic 51-50 vote. Vice
President Al Gore, as the Senate's presiding officer, broke the
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The three GOP impeachment managers _ Graham, Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. _ visited the
Puget Sound area Saturday to speak at a rally and fund-raising
dinner for the King County Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carried with them our strong belief that this president
should be impeached,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in a fiery
warmup speech for her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn voiced hope that after the 2000 election, ``representatives
like Jim Rogan and Asa Hutchinson will populate the Republican side
of the House of Representatives.'' (Graham was not at the rally,
but spoke at the dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   While looking back proudly at the impeachment effort, the House
Republicans' main focus was the upcoming House firefight over gun
restrictions. Hutchinson later took a ``redeye'' flight to
Washington, D.C., so he could appear Sunday on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert voiced hope last month that the
House would go along with provisions of the Senate bill. But he has
since retreated under fire from GOP troops.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert comes from ``an anti-gun state'' _ Illinois _ and took
his initial position without consulting Republicans from the South
and West, traditional strongholds of the NRA, Hutchinson said at a
GOP reception here.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Rules Committee have drafted a bill
that includes several Senate-passed provisions _ mandatory child
safety locks and a juvenile Brady law provision barring for life
gun ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans left out other Senate provisions. Gone is
a ban on the import of ammunition clips holding 10 or more bullets.
Another omitted amendment would direct the Federal Trade Commission
to look into marketing of guns to children.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would require background checks on all purchases
at gun shows where 50 or more guns are available. The House bill
exempts gun shows with fewer than 10 vendors, no matter how many
guns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would delay transfer of a gun to a buyer for up
to three business days so a federal tracking system can check for
any felony convictions. The House bill would give the system 72
hours _ even on holiday weekends when records might not be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he will sign the bill as passed by the Senate
even though it does not contain all the gun control measures he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens should not be prevented from making ``legal gun
purchases'' when technical means are available to quickly check for
any criminal background, Graham said in arguing for the House
version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., took a different view. Inslee lost his
central Washington House seat in 1994 after backing a ban on
semi-automatic assault rifles. He was elected last year to a
suburban Seattle seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic purpose of the Senate bill was to close a
loophole,'' Inslee said. ``Background checks work. They have kept
firearms out of the hands of thousands of convicted criminals. The
question is, do we let people avoid the safety net by walking
around the corner to a show where there are a hundred guns sitting
on a table for sale?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan, a former judge and gang-crime prosecutor, rejected
Democrats' contention that the Littleton, Colo., killings and other
school shootings make the case for tighter gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20,000 gun laws on the books in this country that did
not stop what happened at Columbine High School,'' Rogan said in a
weekend interview.
</P>
<P>
   The California Republican charged the Clinton administration
with ``scapegoating,'' and added: ``Taking deaths in schools, and
blaming it on the NRA, is unfortunate and unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson drew prolonged applause at Saturday's rally as he put
the issue in stark terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constitutional liberty that gives citizens of this
country the right to bear arms. We should not make it impossible
for citizens, men or women, to defend their family, home and
property,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   A private poll, conducted last month for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, found 80 percent support for expanded
background checks on gun purchases. In results leaked to the press,
it also found 45 percent of all voters less inclined to support a
member of Congress linked to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't place much stock in those polls,'' Rogan said. ``I
know a poll can be skewered by how you word the questions. I know
this: If you ask if people believe in the right to defend
themselves and their families, the answer is an overwhelming yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inslee, by contrast, said he detects that public opinion is
``moving away from ideology'' on gun safety issues. He described
measures pending in Congress as ``modest'' compared with the 1994
assault weapons ban.

   ``The reasons are many, but basic to it is the steady
accumulation of victims,'' he added. ``Since 1994, more than 1,000
little kids have died in accidental shootings. Those are as much a
part of the carnage as mass homicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Littleton so much as one tragedy at a time driving
people toward common sense,'' said Inslee.
</P>
<P>
   The House gun debate this week is likely to be a free-for-all.
``Denny Hastert is just throwing it out to the House to let it go
any way,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have their eyes on suburban Republicans,
including those who have voted with the NRA. ``Jennifer Dunn is a
perfect example: She is a person who represents a district with
towns like Littleton, Colorado,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Behrens-Benedict, a Democrat who took 40 percent of the
vote against Dunn in 1998, said last week that she is running again
on a gun control platform.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Republicans will join in passing mandatory trigger
locks, and barring lifetime gun ownership for any juvenile who
commits a violent crime. He predicted that the NRA will score
victories as well as suffer defeats on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, when this is over, the Democrats will join us in
addressing the media culture of violence that is more responsible
(than guns) for this problem,'' he added.

   BICYCLIST (Seattle) _ The sound of her jaw pounding into the
pavement sounded like a potato chip crunching underneath someone's
foot. Carrianne Pullar still remembers the morning rush-hour
traffic whizzing by as she and her mangled bicycle lay helpless on
the side of the road, her jaw shattered. It's an experience the
29-year-old Pullar has understandably tried to push out of her
mind. Yet this week _ three years after Pullar crashed while riding
her bicycle to work in West Seattle _ she is competing for the
Saturn of Bellevue, Wash., team against some of the world's top
cyclists in the HP LaserJet Women's Challenge in Boise, Idaho.

AD-BLOCKING SOFTWARE WORRIES SOME E-COMMERCE, MEDIA COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

   SEATTLE _ Since the invention of the remote control, television
viewers have had little trouble ignoring commercials. It's as
simple as turning the channel, hitting the mute button or heading
to the bathroom for a three-minute pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding advertising on the Internet, however, has never been
that easy. Online banner ads, which command a prominent position on
many Web sites, are facts of life in the cyber-marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the introduction of software from companies such as
Siemens AG, WRQ Inc. and Junkbusters Inc., Web surfers have the
ability to simply turn off Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a mute button (for the Internet),'' said Anne
Marshall, product marketing manager at Seattle-based WRQ, which
last July released ad-blocking software called AtGuard.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which sells for $30, works as a filtering device,
blocking advertisements before they are downloaded on a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   That has several benefits for computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it give them control over the marketing messages
they receive, it also speeds up Internet performance by eliminating
clunky banner ads and graphics. In some instances, download times
can be cut from 2 minutes to 30 seconds, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   While the ad-blocking technology benefits consumers who feel
bombarded with product pitches, it is causing a stir among
e-commerce and media companies that hope to generate revenue
through online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that could be a concern for us,'' said Andy
Liu, chief executive of FreeDollar.com, a new Seattle startup that
plans to make money by selling targeted advertisements and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering technology, which also blocks unwanted e-mail and
Web identification tags known as ``cookies,'' has forced some
e-commerce companies to re-evaluate their business models and
advertising strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to the blocking technology, Bellevue-based
Altrec.com, an Internet retailer of outdoor gear and apparel, has
decided to focus more on print, radio and television advertising in
an upcoming national marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These blocking issues are just another reason why it is
important to build brand awareness offline,'' said Erick
Soderstrom, vice president of marketing at the 25-person startup.
``We are keeping a keen eye on the resources we spend on online
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad-blocking issue recently landed Seattle-based RealNetworks
in a bit of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle pioneer of streaming media software last month
canceled an agreement to distribute the AtGuard product after some
of RealNetworks' key customers, which include major e-commerce and
media companies, complained that the software could hurt their
advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said WRQ's software is not designed to damage
advertisers or companies that make money through online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``WRQ buys advertising, so we are not against it,'' she said.
``What this product does is allow the user to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Avenue A, which coordinates online advertising
efforts for e-commerce companies, could feel a big impact from the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old Internet startup generates revenue by placing
online advertisements for top-tier clients such as Eddie Bauer,
Soma.com and uBid. But Mike Leo, co-founder of the 90-person
company, is not too concerned about ad-blocking products such as
AtGuard, Web Washer and InterMute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get this question all of the time,'' said Leo. ``But the
fact is right now there are very few people who are using this
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall would not disclose revenue figures for AtGuard. But The
New York Times recently reported that the popularity of the
software is on the rise and that Siemens' Web Washer product is
being used by about 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that is a small percentage of the estimated 76.5 million
Web users in the United States. And it is not yet a threat to the
$4.4 billion that research firm Jupiter Communications estimates
companies will spend on online advertising by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The software is not curtailing Eddie Bauer's online advertising
plans. Steve Kahn, marketing manager for interactive media at the
Redmond, Wash. retailer, said Eddie Bauer is planning to ``ramp
up'' its banner ads on Internet shopping sites in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kahn believes consumers should have the choice to block
advertisements, he added that many shoppers want information on new
products, discounts and other services delivered through
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Even if more people adopt the ad-blocking technology, Avenue A's
Leo believes advertising will continue to drive e-commerce and
media Web sites. The alternative _ paying subscription fees to
access Web sites _ is a model that has failed in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this issue becomes larger _ at this time it is a small blip
on the radar screen of publishers _ 99.8 percent of people will say
give me an advertisement over paying for content,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: JAPAN'S SUDDEN GROWTH MAY EMBOLDEN THE FED
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese economic revival is real, and the chances are good
that it is going to last. That is welcome news for the world
economy, particularly for other Asian countries. But it also makes
it virtually certain that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Japan reported last week that its economy grew at a remarkable
annual rate of 7.9 percent in the first three months of 1999. That
followed declines in five consecutive quarters.
</P>
<P>
   There is still widespread skepticism about Japan's recovery, but
financial markets now seem persuaded, with the yen strengthening
and Japanese stocks rising even though the image of Japan Inc. has
gone from invincible to incompetent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The aura of invincibility led many observers to overlook or
dismiss signs of trouble in Japan in the late 1980s. The new aura
of incompetence has caused them to miss signs of revival now.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fuji Bank, a major Japanese financial institution,
has redefined how it operates. Its old role was to take in money
from depositors and lend it to the companies in its keiretsu, or
group of companies. Fuji did so without a lot of regard for its own
profitability, but so long as the economy was growing rapidly, it
was a cozy relationship that benefited everybody.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese bubble burst almost a decade ago, Fuji and
other Japanese banks tried to act as if little had changed. They
concealed bad loans and remained the piggy banks for companies in
their groups in the belief that growth would surely make everything
better again.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not, and late in 1997 Fuji shocked Japan by failing
to rescue Yamaichi Securities, a member of its keiretsu. In an
interview last week, Toru Hashimoto, Fuji's chairman, said the bank
refused to step in because it was worried about hidden losses at
the brokerage firm stemming from what he called ``dubious
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was not how the public saw it. ``The fact we didn't
bail out Yamaichi was perceived as our weakness,'' Hashimoto said.
Suddenly Fuji was rumored to be in trouble, and its stock price
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the decision to let Yamaichi fail was a signal that
things were changing for the better in Japan. Banks were coming to
understand just how much they had been hurt by the old practices.
By disclosing more information about bad loans than is customary in
Japan, Fuji has since managed to persuade investors that it is in
no worse _ and perhaps better _ shape than other Japanese banks.
Its stock price has rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's system of lifetime employment also is changing, albeit
slowly. Fuji is trying to cut its payroll through attrition, not
layoffs, but Hashimoto said it is changing its pay structure to
reward accomplishment rather than seniority. Fuji also has a new
system of hiring in place in which some people are hired on terms
that pay them more but offer no guarantee of job security. ``The
old system and the new system will coexist,'' he said. He seems to
hope that some workers who are passed over for raises will choose
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics about Japan note that there have been false springs
before. In the first quarter of 1996, the economy was reported to
have risen at a 12.3 percent annualized rate, only to quickly
stumble. This time is likely to be different because growth now
reflects surprisingly strong domestic spending, not the old
strategy of boosting exports. This is ``a home-grown Japanese
recovery,'' says Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a recovery based on old-fashioned stimulus. The
government ramped up public spending and cut interest rates as low
as they could go. It pumped billions into sick banks and came up
with a scheme to provide loan guarantees to small businesses. Japan
has not proved it can grow when such stimuli are removed, but
restructurings like the one under way at Fuji provide good reason
to hope that it can.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Federal Reserve, fearing that Asia's illness would
infect America, cut interest rates three times. Now, with Asia on
the mend and some signs of inflation at home, the Fed is all but
certain to rescind one of those cuts. It may rightly choose to take
back two of them. That would surprise Wall Street, and show that
the Fed is determined to resist inflation.
