<HEADLINE> World Bank Leader Welcomes G-7 Debt Alleviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank welcomed the
G-7 richest countries declaration on the debt reduction for the
heavily indebted poor countries as a constructive step toward the
conclusion of an action plan by the coming autumn.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, World Bank President James
Wolfensohn said the bank in particular welcomes the call for Paris
Club creditors to go beyond the Naples terms in that context.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin revealed that the
G-7 nations were in agreement on the principle of supplying some 6
to 8 billion U.S. dollars in debt relief to about 20 of the
poorest nations, many in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said the World Bank is prepared to provide its full
share to the costs of this initiative, within the framework of
broad and equitable participation by all creditors involved.
</P>
<P>
The exact amounts allocated by the World Bank will be
determined by its Board of Directors, and will depend on
coordination of required action by all creditors involved, and
those countries that will make voluntary contributions to a
special Trust Fund, to be used as the bank's initial contribution,
the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the debt of heavily indebted poor nations to
sustainable levels will only be achievable if bilateral creditors
and multilateral institutions act together to provide a further
reduction beyond current mechanisms, the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
It added that action by multilateral creditors alone is not
sufficient to achieve this goal. Multilateral institutions such as
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) hold less
than one quarter of the debt owed by potentially eligible poor
countries.
</P>
<P>
Further action by Paris Club creditors beyond the current
Naples terms is the key to the real debt alleviation for the
world's poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> Lyon Summit Adopts Political Statement Calling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the G-7
nations and Russia today adopted a Chairman's Statement calling
for greater security and stability in an increasingly
inter-dependent, inter-active and cooperative world.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page statement said major issues such as
non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament as well as combat
of terrorism and transnational organized crime need to be treated
at a global level.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is and must remain the body primarily
responsible for international peace and security in accordance
with the mission assigned to it in the organization's charter, it
said.
</P>
<P>
About the present financial crisis the UN faces, the statement
said the Lyon summit's participants "are resolved to promote in
parallel and as soon as possible a long-term solution based on the
adoption of a more equitable scale of contributions, on scrupulous
respect by Member States for their financial obligations, and on
the payment of arrears."
</P>
<P>
The leaders restated their commitment to "the universality of
all human rights and fundamental freedoms," expressing their full
support for the efforts of the International Tribunals aimed at
the prosecution and trial of persons "indicted for serious
violations of human rights in the Former Yugoslavia and in
Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
The 22nd summit of the G-7 countries -- France, the United
States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain and Italy -- opened here

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leadership Discusses Netanyahu's Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat today reported to the weekly meeting of the
Palestinian Authority cabinet on messages conveyed by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu through various emissaries.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met with Dore Gold, Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser, in
Gaza on Thursday night. Gold delivered a message from the
rightwing Likud prime minister. Netanyahu has repeatedly declared
that the new government is maintaining contacts with the PA
through different channels.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was also attended by members of the
PLO Executive Committee, participants also debated on the results
of the Arab Summit held in Cairo last week, and its effect on the
peace process, which appears to be at a crossroad as a result of
the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the economic implications of the
continuing closure imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and West
Bank. PA officials has said that the autonomous areas lose 6
million U.S. dollars every day as a result.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been mounting between Israelis and Palestinians
since Likud's rise to power. PA officials are very much
sceptical about Netanyahu's peace declarations, pointing to his
tactic to drag on in Hebron redeployment and refusal to meet
with Arafat, let alone his opposition to the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state and negotiations on Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Lyon Summit Calls for Safer, Cleaner, Healthier World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the G-7
countries and Russia today issued a Chairman's Statement calling
for the building of a safer, cleaner and healthier world.
</P>
<P>
The summit's participants affirmed their undertaking to
conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) so as to enable
its signature by the coming 51st session of the UN General
Assembly in September.
</P>
<P>
They also called on all members of the Conference on
Disarmament to agree that the CTBT must prohibit any nuclear
weapons text explosion or any other nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
The statement noticed the signature by the Southeast Asian
states in December 1995, in Bangkok, of the treaty establishing a
nuclear weapon free zone in Southeast Asia and welcomed the
signature by China, France, Russia, Britain and the U.S. of the
protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga establishing a nuclear weapon
free zone in the South-Pacific as well as the signature of the
Treaty of Pelindaba establishing a nuclear weapon free zone in
Africa and of its relevant protocols by the U.S., France, China
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also called on all countries to "spare no effort in
securing a global ban on the scourge represented by the
proliferation and the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel
landmines."
</P>
<P>
The document welcomed the adoption of the program for
preventing and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear materials,
reaffirming the need to strengthen measures to ensure nuclear
material accounting, control and physical protection, and
stressing the necessity of further progress in the establishment
of relevant domestic legislation and in the enhancement of the
international regime of nuclear liability as well as in the
preparation of an international convention on the safety of
radioactive waste management.
</P>
<P>
The leaders regarded environmental protection as "crucial in
promoting sustainable development." In view of the threats such as
global warming, desertification, deforestation, depleting
resources and threatened species, and unsustainable urban
development, the summit's participants were resolved to "place top
priority on integrating environmental protection more completely
into all of our policies."
</P>
<P>
The leaders endorsed a 40-point program to step up fighting
against transnational organized crime and were determined to
intensify efforts to combat "any kinds of drug trafficking and all
forms of criminality in connection with it, including money
laundering."

<HEADLINE> Whites Must Share Their Expertise: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today called on whites to share their knowledge
and expertise with other population groups, saying they had an
important role to play in uniting the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 800 veterans celebrating their contribution
to the demise of apartheid at Mmabatho in North West Province,
Mandela said although whites were small in number, they had the
advantage of expertise.
</P>
<P>
''We want to share that knowledge, skills and expertise with
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Mandela also called on his guests to work for
reconciliation, saying the message of reconciliation was
essential ''if we are to remove the concerns and fears of
minorities''.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the tendency of the different population
groups to look at problems only from their own perspective was
not the correct approach.
</P>
<P>
''We need people who look at problems as being those of South
Africa as a whole,'' said the president.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the delivery of public services of the
government, Mandela said it was not an easy task to solve the
problems of a decade within two years.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, every South African should work towards
removing tensions from society. Only when that was achieved would
talented people be able to serve the country properly, he added.

</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, the Chinese President

here today their support for regional and inter-regional

negotiations resumed at the end of December last year, and pledged
to help "create a climate which will facilitate the resumption of
the negotiations." They also urged all parties to resume their
bilateral negotiations as soon as possible and extended

BANGKOK, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand began to repatriate 4,242

<HEADLINE> Canada Backs U.N. Chief for Re-election Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada will throw its weight
behind U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his bid for
a second five-year term, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chretien was speaking at a news conference at the end of a
two-day summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has done a
very good job under difficult circumstances and we would be happy
to have him re-elected," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Canada is the second Western country taking a line contrary to
Washington's on the future of the 73-year-old Boutros-Ghali, an
Egyptian and the first African holding the top post of the world
body.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Austria has expressed its explicit support for the
re-election bid of Boutros-Ghali, who was also here for the G-7
summit at the invitation of French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, whose current term expires late this year,
announced his decision to run for a second term last week.
</P>
<P>
But his decision was quickly opposed by the United States,
which said it wants a new candidate more intent to reform the
world body and threatened to use its Security Council veto to
block the re-election bid if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Canada, most G-7 governments have refrained from
publicly criticizing Washington over Boutros-Ghali's future.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Ambassador: Egypt Has right to Acquire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny, citing Israeli threats, defended today Egypt's
right to acquire new weapons after the U.S. revealed its purchase
of Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has every right to acquire modern weaponry since Israel
possesses Jericho-3 missiles with a range of 1,500 kilometers,"
Bassiouny was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent issue of Jane's World Air Force, Israel
stations three Jericho ballistic missile squadrons near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Air Force also reaffirmed that Egypt would
seek to purchase anti-missile missiles and other advanced
weapons, citing that Israeli ground-to-ground missiles pose
threats to Egypt "both militarily and physically."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. media last week quoted intelligence sources as
revealing that Egypt has received seven shipments of Scud-related
materials from Korea in March and April, so it would soon begin
producing short-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli TV Channel 1 also reported on Monday that Egypt
recently acquired from Korea via Eastern Europe not only missile
materials, but missiles and launchers that could be turned on
Israel if a regional military crisis developed.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> G-7 Leaders Urge Reforms, New Partnership for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lyon, France, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The G-7 leaders urged the
heads of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to
keep on their drive for institutional reforms and a new
partnership for development.
</P>
<P>
The call was made during a meeting between leaders of the major
industrialized nations and heads of the four international
organizations here today at the conclusion of the G-7 Lyon summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is the first between the G-7 leaders and the
heads of the four organizations, was served to elaborate on ways
of implementing the new partnership for development proposed by the
G-7 leaders in their Economic Communique issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
In their bid to ensure substantial flows of aid and to provide
necessary support for multilateral action in favor of development,
the heads of state and government strongly urged the four
organizations to persevere resolutely in their drive to reform and
rationalize their institutions and enhance their coordination.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed rapid deployment of assistance for
urgent post-conflict, Bosnia's post-war reconstruction in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed on the need to focus grants and
concessional financing primarily on the poorest nations and said
official aid should be directed in particular at education,
health, basic infrastructure and the construction of a state based
on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
They decided to pay special attention to Sub-Saharan Africa. A
medium-term strategy will be framed for this part of the world,
taking as its starting point the initiative launched by the U.N.
secretary-general in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Economy Remains Strong in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cyprus has
forecast that the island's economy in 1996 will remain strong, but
a relative slow growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The bank's 1995 annual report, which was released here today,
shows that domestic demand this year is expected to record a
substantial deceleration reflecting an expected cyclical
downswing of private consumption expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Foreign demand is expected to show some improvement on account,
mainly of the forecast modest recovery of torism. Based on these
expectations, the real GDP growth is envisaged at around 3.5 -
four percent in 1996, says the report.
</P>
<P>
The report says a reversal of the downward trend displayed by
the rate of inflation in the last few years is also forecast, as
the exceptional factors which were conducive to last year's
decline are not expected to repeat themselves in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates indicate that the inflation rate will
increase to three percent from 2.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' rate of inflation declined from 4.9 percent in 1993 to
4.7 percent in 1994, and to 2.6 percent in 1995, thus meeting
comfortably the Maastrict criterion for inflation which stood, in
1995, at three percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report says the current account surpluses recorded during
1993 and 1994 were overturned and 1995 ended with a current
account deficit of the order of 102.8 million Cyprus pounds
(about 205.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Capital flows were again positive in 1995 but lower than in
1994 and, combined with large negative errors and omissions, led
to an overall balance of payments deficit of the order of 110.2
million Cyprus pounds (about 220.4 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit, which in the period 1991-92 averaged 5.9
percent of the GDP declined to 1.4 percent of the GDP in 1994 and
at a low of one percent of GDP in 1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank notes that the year under review can be
characterized as a "landmark" year as far as Cyprus application to
join the EU is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Substantial progress has also been made with respect to
exchange control liberalizations which is another facet of
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank is committed to continue the process of
liberalization with the ultimate objective of completely lifting
exchange restrictions in the new few years," the report says.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Tourists to Jordan Increase in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- About 120,000 Israelis traveled to
Jordan in 1995, accounting for 12 percent of the one million
tourists that Jordan received last year.
</P>
<P>
The local English-language daily Jordan Times today attributed
the increase in the number of Israeli visitors to Jordan to the
fact that the peace treaty signed between Israel and Jordan in
October 1994 enabled the Israelis for the first time in their
history to drive their own vehicles to another country.
</P>
<P>
But in contrast, only 11,000 Jordanians have traveled to Israel
since the peace treaty was signed, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel signed a similar peace treaty with Egypt nearly
20 years ago, the two countries never signed a transportation
agreement allowing for private traffic between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians and Israelis started to across into each other's
country using their own private vehicles as of April 28, this year.
</P>
<P>
The transportation agreement between Jordan and Israel has been
put into full implementation with Israel's first El Al flight to
Amman a few days ago, following the inauguration of Jordan's Royal
Wings regular flights to Tel Aviv last April and the launch of the
first bus service between Jordanian and Israeli cities two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian sources in the tourism industry predicted that more
Israeli tourists will come to Jordan this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar Rifa'i, Jordan's Ambassador to Israel, the
number of Israelis who came to Jordan drawn by business
opportunities represents "a small percentage" of the total of
Israeli visitors.
</P>
<P>
Most Israelis were attracted by the beauty of the Nebatean
Rose-Red city Petra, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanians visiting Israel are, in most cases, driven by
motives different from Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"Many Jordanians who enter Israel could not be defined as
tourists, especially those of Palestinian origin who come to
Israel to see the places of their roots and visit their
relatives," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan's travel agents complained that Israelis
who visited Jordan last year did not contribute much to the
significant increase of Jordan's tourism revenues.
</P>
<P>
They said the Israelis usually neither spend much money nor
much time in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Shalom Tourgeman, a spokesman at the Israeli embassy in Amman,
admitted that Israeli tourists rarely spend more than four or
five days in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President: Norway Visit, Complete Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERGEN, NORWAY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that his current visit to Norway has been a
complete success, which will surely strengthen friendship and
deepen understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during a visit to Bergen, the second
largest city of Norway. He flew here from the capital of Oslo this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president told reporters that "we have been living
in an excellent atmosphere" during the three-day state visit and
impressed by the friendly feelings of the Norwegian people toward
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Norway by a Chinese head of state.
In the past two days, Jiang held talks with King Harald V and
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and exchanged views with the
Norwegian community on developing economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang invited the king to visit China at his convenience. The
king expressed thanks, saying he was looking forward to
re-visiting China.
</P>
<P>
In Bergen, the Chinese president visited the former residence
of Edvard Grieg, in which the great Norwegian composer wrote
incidental music to "Peer Gynt" at the request of the outstanding
playwright Henrik Ibsen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Denies Reports on Strained Egyptian-US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
today denied that relations between Egypt and the United States
are strained.
</P>
<P>
The relations could not be described as "tense" or "lukewarm"
and there are only some differences in assessing certain points of
the Middle East peace process, Moussa was quoted by the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is natural in international relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Egypt's state-run media has accused the
United States of changing its policy on the peace process and
endorsing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's call for
resuming peace talks without preconditions, which the Arabs have
regarded as going against the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The state-run press also accused the United States of adopting
double standards over the issue of armament in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It said that the United States insisted on asking about Egypt's
weapons but would not say anything about Israel's nuclear arsenal
and its refusal to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern
country that possesses nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The accusations against the United States have led to reports
that relations between the two countries are strained.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel have shown special concerns over
reports that Egypt has bought Scud missiles and their components
from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Israel even
accused Egypt of causing instability in the region with its
reported deal with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has responded by saying that any country is entitled to
purchase sophisticated weapons to enhance its combat capabilities
but stopped short of confirming whether it purchased the missiles
or not.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a close ally of the United States in the Middle
East. Egypt, being the second largest recipient country of the
United States after Israel, gets 2.1 billion U.S. dollars of
aid each year from Washington.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Ambassador: Egypt Has right to Acquire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny, citing Israeli threats, defended today Egypt's
right to acquire new weapons after the U.S. revealed its purchase
of Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has every right to acquire modern weaponry since Israel
possesses Jericho-3 missiles with a range of 1,500 kilometers,"
Bassiouny was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent issue of Jane's World Air Force, Israel
stations three Jericho ballistic missile squadrons near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Air Force also reaffirmed that Egypt would
seek to purchase anti-missile missiles and other advanced
weapons, citing that Israeli ground-to-ground missiles pose
threats to Egypt "both militarily and physically," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. media last week quoted intelligence sources as
revealing that Egypt has received seven shipments of Scud-related
materials from Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in
March and April, so it would soon begin producing short-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli TV Channel 1 also reported on Monday that Egypt
recently acquired from DPRK via Eastern Europe not only missile
materials, but missiles and launchers that could be turned on
Israel if a regional military crisis developed.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Israel and the U.S. have been conducting join
research in developing a new way to destroy Scud missiles using
unmanned aircrafts and laser anti-missile system, in efforts to

"adopting a coercive policy on the occupied Golan Heights."
</P>
<P>
This came in an interview with Herman Leonardo Salva, head of
the U.N. commission inquiring into Israeli practices in connection
with human rights in the occupied Arab territories,
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Qaddour made a documented review of
Israel's coercive practices in the occupied Golan Heights,
pointing out that "the occupation is the worst violation of human
rights."
</P>
<P>
Qaddour called on the U.N. commission to pay attention to the
declared attitudes and policy of the new Israeli government
towards the Middle East peace process in general and the occupied
Golan Heights in particular.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government has declared that it will not return
to Syria the Golan Heights it occupied since the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister affirmed that so long as the U.N. efforts
in the region are limited to fact-finding without putting any
international pressure on Israel to compel it to execute
international pacts and treaties, especially the Fourth Geneva
Convention, the suffering of the residents of the occupied Golan
Heights would last and Israel will persist in its serious
violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Salva arrived in Damascus today.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Calls For Cooperation and Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's special
representative for Cyprus Han Sung-Joo stressed today the need
for cooperation and coordination from all parties involved in
solving the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy made the call at a press conference to both
Greek and Turkish Cypriot journalists at the Ledra Palace Hotel in
the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Han Sung-Joo will leave Cyprus Monday for visits to Europe and
the U.S. after six days of consultations with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, as well
as party and trade union representatives from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Han, who arrived here on Tuesday, said that almost everybody he
met expressed urgency "to find a solution or resolution of the
situation in Cyprus", but admitted "it is difficult to expect a
quick magic formula."
</P>
<P>
He noted "a great deal of patience, work and cooperation among
the parties both in and out of Cyprus are necessary."
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be able to cut out the way in which to find the road
toward that goal, which is to achieve peace, security, prosperity
for everybody in the communities of Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions, Han said that "mutual accommodation is
needed" to solve the Cyprus problem and said "it is important that
everyone takes into account the concerns and the minimum
requirements of each other."
</P>
<P>
Han said he is concentrating his efforts on finding the way to
secure common ground between the two sides, adding for the time
being the interested parties could not start negotiating.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island following a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite all U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
With regard to his current visit to the island, which is
the first one since his appointment, the U.N. envoy said he
was "made to feel at home here" and he received the fullest
cooperation which helped him gain "understanding and familiarity
with the situation" and made his visit "quite fruitful".
</P>
<P>
"I did not find a solution but I'm not leaving with
disappointment," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Han was appointed by the U.N. chief as his special
representative for Cyprus in May to replace Joe Clark, former
Canadian Prime Minister, who failed to bring the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides closer to a settlement during his
three-year term.

<HEADLINE> Perry Reaffirms US Determination to Stay in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry expressed today the U.S.' determination to keep forces
staying in Saudi Arabia despite the truck blast Tuesday that
killed 19 American service men and injured hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who is paying a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, told
reporters at a press conference in Dhahran where the blast took
place that "this attack would not drive us away. To give in would
be to betray the brave airmen who died in Dhahran and their
families," according to a report by local Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that an American government official
expressed the determination to continue keeping forces in Saudi
Arabia since the blast.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Wednesday
evening while paying an immediate afterwards visit to the site of
the explosion that the U.S. would not reduce its armed forces
stationed in the Gulf region and would not yield to terrorist
threats and would be very decisive while dealing with such
threats.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the words of Christopher, Perry said a militant force
in the Gulf region is needed to defend Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
countries from any aggression.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who arrived at Dhahran earlier today to stress the
U.S. commitment to remain in Saudi Arabia, vowed to punish those
who masterminded and perpetrated the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to find them and punish them. I don't have any
doubt about that," he was reportedly telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We will also have a much more vigorous program in
intelligence and counter intelligence to identify terrorists and
plots before bombings take place," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the explosion would not affect the
Saudi-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Perry is leaving for Saudi western port city of Jeddah where he
is scheduled to meet with the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz and Saudi Defense Minister Ultan Bin Abdul-Aziz. He is
also likely to meet with King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He and Saudi officials will discuss tighter security measures
for the 5,000 U.S. military personnel serving in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Perry is due to leave Saudi Arabia Sunday to continue his
scheduled trip to Italy, Hungary, Bosnia, Slovenia and
U.S. warships in the Mediterranean before returning to Washington
on July 4.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Diplomacy Brisk in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's diplomatic activities last
month were just as intense as the weather, with frequent visits
between leaders in China and Third World countries, especially the
African and Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
The Presidents of Rwanda and Guinea, and Botswana's Vice
President all visited China, exchanged views and reached a broad
consensus with Chinese officials on bilateral political and
economic relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
These visits embody the principles of Sino-African ties, which
were summarized during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit
to six African countries last month as equal treatment, sincere
friendship, unity, cooperation, and common development.
</P>
<P>
The visits by African leaders indicate that their countries are
eager to reinforce friendly relations and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri also visited China, several days before the Arab
Summit which concluded on June 23.
</P>
<P>
During their visits, the two Arab leaders held talks with their
Chinese counterparts to discuss the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process, and strengthening bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
It was said during the visits that Arab nations regard China as
their most reliable friend, and hoped that China would play a
still more positive role in the Middle East peace process and in
reconstructing some Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
These visits have also shown that it is the cornerstone of
China's diplomatic policies to develop its friendly relations and
cooperation with all of the Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
Another hot issue in June was the agreement reached between
China and the United States over IPR protection, which has avoided
a trade war that would have cost the two countries several billion
US dollars in trade volume.

<HEADLINE> New Continental Bridge Brings Asia and Europe Closer  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The prediction made by some
Chinese and foreign experts that the New Euro-Asia Continental
Bridge will turn into a modern Silk Road has come true.
</P>
<P>
Today, an international train carrying 40 containers from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) pulled out of Lianyungang, the head of the
New Euro-Asia Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The freight brought the total number of containers transported
on the trans-continental railway line in June to 1,000, four
times the annual freight volume in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border container transport on the New Euro-Asia
Continental Bridge has shown vigorous growth since the beginning
of this year. From January through April, 942 ETUs were shipped,
and transport in May surpassed 700, said Xu Shousheng, mayor of
Lianyungang.
</P>
<P>
Countries and regions that ship containers on the railway line
include the United States, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan,
Japan, Thailand and Hong Kong, said Xu Changxiang, who is in
charge of transport in Lianyungang.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang has signed contracts with more than ten thousand
overseas clients so far this year to send containers across the
continental bridge, which links China's eastern coast with
Rotterdam of The Netherlands in Europe. Its total length is more
than 10,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the new rail route resembles the ancient Silk
Road, which was a mercantile route for silk trade between China
and other countries in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Compared to transport on the Siberian Railway, the Euro-Asia
Continental Bridge can lessen the distance travelled from ROK
and Japan to Rotterdam by 1,200 km. Cargo travelling on the rail
can reach its destination one month ahead of schedule, and freight
costs will be reduced by 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Meeting On Hong Kong's Return Held In Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Local personalities from all walks
of life in this east China city today held a meeting to mark
China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
which will take place on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in Jinghai Temple, the site where the
first unequal treaty in Chinese history -- Nanjing Treaty -- was
signed in August of 1842. The treaty yielded Hong Kong to British
rule.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ye, deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Nanjing Committee, said that the the court of Qing dynasty,
intimidated by Britain's war threats, signed the humiliating
treaty and thrust China into the abyss of foreign rule.
</P>
<P>
With the huge amount of work the central government has done to
recover Hong Kong since the founding of New China, Zhang said,
Hong Kong is to return the embrace of the motherland again in a
year's time, and this is a major event for the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
He called on participants to remember the history and
contribute more to national revitalization and the country's
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xu, a research fellow with Nanjing Institute of Geology
and Paleontology, suggested that Jinghai Temple be made a
patriotism education site to enhance the people's awareness of
national disgrace in the past and independence and prosperity at
present.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jianjian, chairman of the Nanjing Overseas Chinese
Association, called for growing contacts with overseas Chinese and
Hong Kong compatriots so as to help with a smooth resumption of
the exercise of Hong Kong's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Fifty 50 people from local party and government organizations,
and business, science and educational circles attended today's
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 100 Million Yuan Transacted in Hanhai Spring Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hanhai Spring Auction, which
ended today, sold out all of its goods and raked in 94.07 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the three-day auction was a success in terms
of both the high transaction rate and prices, which gave a shot in
the arm to the sluggish domestic art auction market.
</P>
<P>
at the sponsorship of the Beijing Hanhai Artwork Auction
Corporation, one of the largest in the country, the auction sold
1,057 items of art (87.9 percent) in five categories: modern
Chinese paintings and calligraphy, ancient Chinese paintings and
calligraphy, rare books, curios, and treasures such as ink and
brushes that are used for study.
</P>
<P>
The highest-priced modern Chinese painting was a landscape by
Zhang Daqian, a famous contemporary Chinese painter, which cost
880,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A price 10 times that was paid for a painting by Shen Zhou, a
well-known painter from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). His work was
modeled after that of Huang Gongwang, the leading painter of the
Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Zhou's piece brought in the top price in
the ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy category.
</P>
<P>
A note written by Liang Qichao, a prominent figure in modern
China, sold for 242,000 yuan, and was the most expensive in the
rare books category.
</P>
<P>
The highest bid in the curios category was 4.8 million for a
jadeite figure of the Buddha of Mercy. Ink made for Emperor
Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) was sold for 462,000
yuan, became the most highest-priced rarity used for study.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin On Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- "Qiushi" (Seeking Truth), the
journal of the Party's Central Committee, will publish in its new
issue Monday the full text of an article written by General
Secretary Jiang Zemin on the importance of politics.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Jiang said that attaching great importance to
politics is not a new issue for a Marxist Party.
</P>
<P>
"But why we should stress the issue right now? The purpose is
to ensure the whole Party has a better understanding of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the Party's basic lines so as to carry them
out correctly and firmly."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out in the article that the overwhelming majority
of leading officials at all levels generally are concerned about
politics. "But we should notice that some comrades in some
departments and localities do neglect or even overlook the
importance of politics, which has resulted in weakness in
political conscientiousness and a decline in political quality."
</P>
<P>
He said that these problems mainly stem from a lack of
education in politics, and limited knowledge of Marxist and
socialist theories.
</P>
<P>
"Socialist modernization is the greatest political issue we
must be aware of at present, because it embodies the greatest and
most fundamental interests of our people," said the article.
</P>
<P>
"The call to leading members to place importance on politics
cannot hinder economic development, neither will we replace
economic development with politics," said the article. "On the
contrary, it will create more adequate political conditions and
provide stronger political guarantees so that the entire country
and its people can build up our economy with one mind and at a
faster pace."
</P>
<P>
"Placing importance on politics is not simply to repeat
political slogans or encourage armchair politicians, but rather to
combine politics closely with the economy and other tasks. It also
is to ensure that economic and other works will proceed in the
right direction and in a better order," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"In general, giving prominence to politics is the necessary
requirement of the Party's basic theory and principle, and is the
precondition necessary to fulfil the great cause of building

Schumacher's Ferrari blew an engine on the warmup lap in Magny
Cours, France.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Encourages China to Help Poor Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will expand a
chain program, which aids impoverished women in many of China's
rural areas, to more regions in the nation and eventually other
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
A non-interest loan is expected to be granted by the WB to the
aid-to-poor-women project in north China's Shanxi Province,
according to Program Analyst Michael Goldberg of the WB's
Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
This year was designated by the United Nations as a year to
eliminate poverty worldwide, Goldberg said. "I'm glad to choose
China as our first cooperation partner and also as the first
country to be rewarded since the establishment of CGAP in 1995."
</P>
<P>
China is expected to receive a one million US dollar bonus from
CGAP for the chain program, which follows an inverted pyramid
organizational style.
</P>
<P>
The program first helps a pilot group of poor families overcome
poverty. They in turn work with other poor families, the third
group aids a fourth, and a chain of assistance is in place.
</P>
<P>
In a small county in the mountain area of Luliang, Zhang Ailan,
a middle-aged woman with a middle school education, has helped 600
poor families prosper by raising pigs. She belonged to the first
group that benefitted from the chain program initiated in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has used 40,000 yuan-worth of low-interest government
loans to assist neighboring women rise from poverty. All of the
families she helped have earned nearly 1,000 yuan per year.

<P>
The chain program has reached its fifth group of poor families,
and 45,000 of them have raised their incomes above poverty
level. There are now more than 4,200 demonstration families who
are sharing with other households their experience in getting rid
of poverty by relying on science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Luliang Prefecture in western Shanxi Province is one of 18
poverty-stricken areas in China. Nine out of 13 counties in the
prefecture are poor, and 1.1 million people, half of them women,
lack food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
"I have witnessed the local women's enthusiasm over the
elimination of poverty. They are bidding farewell to
impoverishment through a new way of granting small loans and
paying them back little by little," said Juergen Voegele, director
of the WB's poverty relief project in Shanxi. He has toured the
area several times since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Voegele proposed spending five million yuan of his 100-million
US dollars relief project on the chain program in the Luliang area
in July.
</P>
<P>
The chain program has been praised by UNICEF, which co-operated
with the area for the women's development project, and volunteered
to recommend the chain program to organizations for poor women all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Xianglian, director of the Luliang
Prefecture's Women's Federation, the area has used 3.8 million
yuan (about 458,000 US dollars) to help women in poverty.
</P>
<P>
She said that they have discovered several ways to provide
assistance for those women in poverty. Methods initiated by her
federation have been adopted by 50 poverty-stricken counties in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that the chain program shows great vitality and
is continually enriched by creative ideas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Residents Celebrate One-year Countdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Local residents today gathered
in different parts of Hong Kong to celebrate the one-year
countdown for the territory to return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong island, about 3,000 residents went to the Victoria
 Park to attend large-scale carnivals sponsored by more than 70
grassroots unions and associations.
</P>
<P>
The residents were entertained with lion dancing prior to the
opening ceremony of the carnivals.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said that with the year
of 1997 approaching, the key work for Hong Kong citizens to
promote Hong Kong's transition is to support the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
He urged Hong Kong residents to carry forward patriotism and
the spirit of loving Hong Kong and to promote Hong Kong's smooth
transition and long term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The major program at the carnivals was artistic performances
focusing on the theme of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour performances given by local artists, artistic
ensembles and school chorus added greatly to the joyful atmosphere
 in the park.
</P>
<P>
At the carnivals, there were also 65 stalls offering amuse
games for people to gain a rough knowledge of the Basic Law, the
history of Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to some entertainment facilities, there was also a
Chinese calligraphy exhibition contest for kids who wrote big
Chinese characters with writing brushes, such as "one country, two
 systems", "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong", "smooth
transition for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
</P>
<P>
In Charter Garden, Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong
Kong organized a large-sized party, calling on people to do one
good thing for Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
At the party which attracted about 1,000 people, Tsang
Yok-sing, chairman of the alliance, said, "We believe Hong Kong's
future is brighter and we are determined to create Hong Kong's
tomorrow with our own hands."
</P>
<P>
Tsang called on citizens to make best use of everyday in the
next 365 days to contribute to Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
In Kowloon and the New Territories, there were also many
gatherings including a large gathering in Kowloon Park organized
by Kowloon Communities, a dancing party in Regent Hotel organized
by the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the Northern Section of the New Territories
erected a huge countdown electric clock at the side of the highway
 near Sheung Shui.
</P>
<P>
The sponsor said the clock serves to remind drivers, passengers
 and pedestrians of the coming of the July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions sent about 3,000
members to Shenzhen City to join in a celebration program for the

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Members Urged to Enhance Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the 75th anniversary
of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the
People's Daily has called for Party members to improve their
ability to implement the Party's cause, and to carry out the
country's economic construction into the next century.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "The Great Cause Spanning over the
Century And the Communist Party of China" to be published Monday,
the national leading newspaper said the CPC has grown in strength
over the past decades, from a weak entity at its birth in 1921
with only dozens of members, to a large, powerful ruling party
with a current membership exceeding 57 million.
</P>
<P>
"This (the growth of the Party) constitutes a historical wonder
as well as a source of pride for the Chinese nation," said the
editorial."Yet it is by no means accidental, for our Party is one
that combines the scientific theory of Marxism with the concrete
practice of the Chinese revolution and economic construction. It
serves the people wholeheartedly while it closely integrate itself
with the masses of people and has enjoyed their full support."
</P>
<P>
"More important, our Party has trained, during the course of
its thorny development process, a great number of high-quality
members and leading cadres who are experienced in handling the
state affairs, the Party's internal affairs and commanding the
army. They are loyal to the Party and ready to give up their lives
to the Party's cause."
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that the CPC faces a special challenge
before the end of the century, namely, to lead the people in a
concerted effort to fulfil the economic goals for the next 15
years that have been submitted by the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The situation ahead is confronted with both opportunities and
challenges, and both advantages and difficulties, the editorial
said. So it is a matter of urgency to further strengthen the Party
building and improve the quality of the Party members, and also to
increase the leadership's ability to manage affairs.
</P>
<P>
It described the quality of Party officials as "an intangible
force," and said that if the Party has a contingent of leading
cadres who are knowledgeable in politics and political ideology,
and are well disciplined and able workers, the Party can further
increase the power of its unity, its combat capability, and the
creativity which it needs to mobilize and unite the people to work
toward its goals.
</P>
<P>
"To a big Party like ours with a membership of more than 57
million, prestige and combat effectiveness lie mainly in the
quality of its members, not in the quantity," stressed the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The goals for this century and the subsequent years cannot be
attained without the Party leadership, the editorial said. "To
keep the Party's basic line unchanged for another 100 years
requires firmly adhering to the Party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concluded with a call for the entire Party
members to rally round the CPC Central Committee with President
Jiang Zemin as the core, and to make every effort to enhance the
Party's quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has formally
entered the international peacekeeping operations arena, the

<P>
An undisclosed number of South African military officers have

South African Defence Minister Joe Modise told the parliament

peace missions came after months of discussion in political and
military circles about whether the country should become a part
of the un peacekeeping operations on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, since its re-admittance into the world family
after the 1994 general election, has experienced an increasing
international pressure, especially from Africa, to get involved
in the world peacekeeping efforts.

HANOI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Vietnam have reached
consensus on many issues, especially on the enhancement and
development of bilateral relations, a senior Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Vietnamese local press, Wen Jiabao, acting
head of the CPC delegation to the Eighth National Congress of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), said Chinese Premier Li Peng and
General Secretary of CPV Du Muoi held talks on June 27, the two
leaders expressed satisfaction with the development of the
relations between the two communist parties and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The talks will certainly have positive influence on the further

beneficial and cooperative relations of the two countries, said
Wen, who is also an alternate member of the Political Bureau and
member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wen expressed optimism on the prospect for Sino-Vietnamese
relations, saying "it is the common aspiration of the two peoples
to promote friendship, strengthen cooperation and seek common
development".
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Vietnamese neighborly relations, based on the basis
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, will be further
pushed ahead," Wen added.
</P>

Asked about his view on the political report of the CPV
congress, the Chinese official said the report embodied the line
of adherence to the socialist path and the leadership of the
Communist Party, which was set down at the Seventh National
Congress of the CPV and reflected the common hope of the
Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that under the leadership of the CPV, the
Vietnamese people will bring a more prosperous and stable
socialist Vietnam into the 21st century," he said.

<HEADLINE> China To Continue Anti-Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's ongoing campaign to crack
down on crime has so far yielded better results than expected, a
high-ranking party official said today.
</P>
<P>
Social stability has been maintained, and the campaign has
drawn wide support in China and enjoyed favorable comments from
the international community, said Ren Jianxin, a member of the
Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party's (CPC) Central
Committee and secretary of the Political Science and Law Committee
under the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ren, who is also director of the Central Commission for
Comprehensive Management of Public Security, made the remark at
this north China resort during a meeting that focused on ways to
continue the campaign to increase policing of crimes, and also the
comprehensive management of public safety.
</P>
<P>
Since the campaign began on April 28, public security
departments nationwide have dealt with several major criminal
cases, captured many criminals, including some fugitives,
eradicated some criminal gangs, closed down entertainment
businesses involved in illegal activities, and confiscated a large
number of illegal firearms.
</P>
<P>
China soon will start the third phase of the crime campaign,
which is critical to the success of the entire campaign, Ren told
those attending the meeting. He asked party committees and
governments at all levels to increase their leadership involvement
in the campaign so as to prevent it from having a weak finish in
spite of a successful beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said the campaign's goals include:
</P>
<P>
-- making greater progress in cracking major cases, pursuing
fugitives and eliminating gangs;
</P>
<P>
-- markedly improving public security in places troubled by
more crimes than others;
</P>
<P>
-- eradicating major social security problems and offensive
social phenomena;
</P>
<P>
-- increasing the people's sense of security and their
initiative toward fighting criminals.
</P>
<P>
Combating crime is a long-term and arduous task, and that
nationwide anti-crime campaigns such as the present one will be
launched periodically in the future, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Jerusalem Call for Efforts to Restore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on Jerusalem today called
for efforts to restore the legitimate rights of the Arabs and
Moslems to Jerusalem, a holy city which hosts Moslem, Christian
and Jewish shrines.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which opened at al-Azhar University here
Saturday, asserted the Arabs and Moslems' attachment to Jerusalem,
the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is an Arab land whose history and culture is
interwoven with the Islamic creed, the seminar said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar, said
in an address to the seminar Saturday that Moslem should do their
best, even with force, to free the holy city from Israeli
occupation. Al-Azhar is a leading institution of religious
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leading Moslem scholar also urged Moslems and
Christians to block Jews from moving into traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem by settling there themselves.
</P>
<P>
The seminar today called for support to the Arabs living in
Jerusalem against what it called arbitrary Israeli measures that
aim at driving the Arabs out of the holy city and changing the
city's identity, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is an explosive issue in talks between Israel and the
Palestinians. Israel claims the entire city as its capital, while
the Palestinians regard east Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has ruled
out any negotiation with the Palestinian side over the future
status of Jerusalem. Israel captured the east Jerusalem in the
1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Admits Receiving S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican opposition leader
Afonso Dhlakama has for the first time admitted receiving
weapons from South Africa in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1984, the Mozambique National Resistance
(RENAMO) received weapons, radios and medicines from the former
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa in its struggle
against the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front Party (FRELIMO),
Dhlakama told a recent party meeting.
</P>
<P>
The local "Domingo" newspaper quoted him as explaining that
his party, which was formed in 1977, was doing so in order to
win freedom and multi-party democracy from the then FRELIMO
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
But Dhlakama stressed his party's present status as a major
opposition in political cooperation with the FRELIMO dominated
government. RENAMO no longer views FRELIMO as an enemy he told
the meeting held in the suburbs of the capital city Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama was convening the meeting in prepatations for local
elections slated for next year.

<HEADLINE> Africa Left Out in Global Economy, Says UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Africa, especially
sub-Saharan Africa, has been left out where foreign direct
investment has become a leading factor in the global economy,
said a United Nations report obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
The UN annual world investment report said sub-Saharan
Africa's share of the world stock of inward foreign investment
grew by a third from 32.9 billion US Dollars in 1980 to an
estimated 43.6 billion US Dollars in 1994, but its share plunged
to only 2 percent from 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said the drop was resulted from two trends:
disinvestment from some African countries, especially South
Africa and Zimbabwe, and the region's diminishing share in the
fast-growing world total of new inward flows.
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and 1988, sub-Saharan Africa attracted an average
of 1 billion US Dollars in new, private foreign investment each
year, just over 5 percent of total flows to all developing
countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
While sub-Saharan Africa's share increased to 1.65 billion US
Dollars in the first five years of the 1990s, the percentage
dropped to less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
A recent assessment by the international finance corporation,
the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, listed the
factors affecting the inflows as poor infrastructure, a
relatively unskilled work-force, macro-economic instability and a
battery of debilitating regulatory and policy influences for the
region's failure to share in the global foreign investment boom.
</P>
<P>
While the region lost ground to the rest of the world as an
investment location, the pattern of flows in Africa was heavily
skewed in favour of oil-producing nations, such as Nigeria and
Angola, which accounted for two-thirds of the total, the report
said.

countries met here today for an international seminar on
Afghanistan and regional security.
</P>

They are expected to present their viewpoints on Afghanistan
and ways of ending the crisis in the country during the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the seminar include scholars from China,
France, India, Russia and the United States, Italy, Iran, Germany,

</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati opened the seminar,

nation and officials to proceed toward peace, stability and unity
while realizing realities in Afghanistan and taking into account
of the regional and international developments.

<P>
Turning to the common Islamic, historical and cultural aspects
between Iran and Afghanistan, he stressed that Iran cannot
overlook the developments in its neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iran will always stand beside the Afghan
nation.
</P>
<P>
During the recent months, Iran has intensified its efforts to
pave the way for creating understanding among Afghan factions and
resolving disputes between the Afghan groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
The repeated visits to Afghanistan by Iranian officials and
their talks with Afghan leaders were aimed at creating the ground
for such an understanding, Velayati said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing content with the recent agreement between
Afghanistan's President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime Minister
Gulbuldin Hekmatyar, he voiced Iran's support for the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also stressed that Afghanistan's security has direct
impact on the security of its neighbors, saying security is the
most important issue that links the destiny of Afghanistan to that
of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that all Afghan parties will work
relentlessly for the establishment of peace and stability in their
country and avoid any discord so that they can embark on
reconstruction of the war-torn country.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today
welcomes the mediation by Syria between Tehran and Manama and Abu
Dhabi, terming the Syrian attempt as "positive."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference:" We welcome Syria's mediation effort. We are
interested in good ties with all our neighbors and the countries
in the region."
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara disclosed on Saturday
that Syria is "mediating between Tehran and Manama" to remove any
existing misunderstandings between the two.
</P>
<P>
He said:" We are using our good offices to neutralize the
current tension between Iran and Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iran and Bahrain have been strained
since Manama accused Tehran of being involved in a plot to topple
the Bahrain government early this month. However, the Iranian
government dismissed the charges outright.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Syrian foreign minister presented a verbal message
of President Hafiz al-Assad to his Iranian counterpart Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani last night.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara, who arrived here on Tuesday, also briefed Rafsanjani
on the latest developments in the region, including the Cairo
Arab Summit held last week and the prevailing situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said at the press conference that Syria is
coordinating the Islamic countries' stance vis-a-vis Israel. Assad
had a meeting with Sheikh Khalifa of Bahrain at the summit.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in direct talks between Iran and the United Arab
Emirates," the Iranian minister added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "Our policy towards UAE is continuation of
talks, elimination of misunderstandings and strengthening of
bilateral relations between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
"We strongly believe that the only way for putting an end to
these problems is through the continuation of direct talks
between the two sides," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran  Hopes New Turkish Government Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities today
sent a positive signal to the new Turkish government headed by
Welfare leader Necmettin Erbakan for improving relations between
Tehran and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference here:"We hope that the new government would succeed
because peace, tranquility and stability in our neighboring
countries is to the benefit of our country too, and the
benefit of our national security."
</P>
<P>
While answering Xinhua, the Iranian foreign minister
said:"There is no crisis between the two countries" despite the
latest rocketing incident and the strained relations between the
two neighbors in the wake of signing of military accord between
Turkey and Israel in February.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Turkey, as two member countries of the
Economic Cooperation Orgnization (ECO), want to have good
relations on the basis of mutual respect without any interference
in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"What's going on inside Turkey is an internal question, an
internal issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "What happened in the border area is
something else. We ask Turkey to respond very clearly to
what we have asked previously after the attack by some Turkish
troops against some border areas between Iran and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"We are very clear in this connection and we strongly
defend our territorial integrity," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted:" we ask the Turkish government to support and defend
the life of the people living in this country, including those
who live in border areas."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said:" We have had two meetings with the Turkish
ambassador to Tehran, once we summoned him and the other time he
came to explain the position of his country."
</P>
<P>
Turkish army had denied the Wednesday cross-border attacks
alleged by Iran. "That means we have to form an investigative
committee," Velayati added.
</P>
<P>
"But, all in all, Turkey is responsible for what has
happened in the border region. Iran is firm about its
territorial integrity, national security and the life of its
people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian report, three Turkish military
helicopters violated the Iranian airspace and fired rockets, which
killed six and injured 15 Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Mandela "Caught Armed to the Teeth With Zulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela, on the wrong side of the government's ban on the
display of traditional weapons in public gathering, was earlier
this week caught "armed to the teeth" at an election rally in
Kwazulu/Natal Province, a local daily "City Press" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In his round-up campaign for Kwazulu/Natal local elections at
Nzinga near Impendle, Mandela was caught holding up a traditional
Zulu shield and stick, apparently violating the government's ban
on dangerous weapons in public gathering.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a government ban announced earlier this year by
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, no traditional
weapons, including sticks, were allowed to display in public
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
The display of traidtional weapons by President Mandela was an
acknowledgement on his part that a Zulu cannot be de-Zulunized,
said Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said: "The Zulus who are the president's followers
remain Zulus. By flaunting the ban on display of traditional
accoutrements, I took it that on his part, he was acknowledging
the fact that he could not de-Zulunize a Zulu."
</P>
<P>
To this regard, however, Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana

Mandela's carrying of traditional accoutrements "can be

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Faces Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fears of a southern African
arms race are escalating sharply in Namibia as a result of the
recent decision by Botswana to buy 13 Canadian F-5 fighter-bomber
aircraft, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, in a move that represents a massive increase in
defence spending, made the 50 million US Dollar Deal in an
attempt to "put Botswana on a par with South African air
capabilities".
</P>
<P>
The Botswana bomber deal came after a previously reported deal
for 36 British scorpion tanks and another deal for 50 German
leopard tanks, 200 troop transport vehicles and a variety of
weaponary.
</P>
<P>
In a response to its neighbour's military buildup, Namibian
Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said Botswana's arms purchase
was "provocative and unnecessary".
</P>
<P>
Gurirab said southern African countries should refrain from
military buildup which could provoke an arms race and cause
tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Botswana, with a population of 1.4 million, said the
military buildup was part of a long-term plan to beef up its
deterrence capability.
</P>
<P>
Botswan earlier announced plans that it would expand its army
from the present 7000 to 10,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma held discussions with German
leaders in his recent visit to that country about Botswana's
purchase of 50 German-made leopard tanks from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Germany has a final say in the
Botswana-Netherlands deal of its arms to third parties and and in
forbidding their export to conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have long simmered between Namibia and Botswana over
a tiny disputed island on the border between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Celebrates 50th Anniversary of Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today celebrated the
50th anniversary of its first shipment of oil to the outside
world, marking its transformation from a small state which depends
mainly on pearls for a living to a wealthy oil state.
</P>
<P>
Attending the celebration ceremony in Kuwait's southern oil
city Ahmadi were Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah,
Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah
and hundreds of diplomats and others from different social
circles.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister and Chairman of the state-run Kuwait Oil
Company Abdul Mohsen Madaj inaugurated the ceremony with a
speech.
</P>
<P>
He said, "On the same day of the year 1946, Kuwait started a
new era in its contemporary economic history and its effective
contribution to the world oil industry when late Sheikh Ahmad
al-Jaber al-Sabah turned open the silver wheel, announcing the
first Kuwaiti oil shipment."
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Kuwaiti oil industry has been progressing and
developing continuously, bringing the country to a stage of life
with all the traces of a modern society.
</P>
<P>
Today, Kuwait has the right to be proud of what has been
accomplished with such a short time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait now occupies a distinguished international place in the
energy and investment markets and a reputed placing as a country
which has made several important mile-stones notably in oil
exploration and production, refining and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Oil was discovered in Kuwait in the 1930's in al-Burgan
oilfield, the second largest field in the world with commercially
viable reserves. Oil was first produced on the field in 1934. The
first shipment of oil was exported through a marine pipeline
built for this purpose aboard a British tanker transporting about
10,565 tones of crude.
</P>
<P>
In the 60's and early 70's, Kuwait was in full control of its
production after negotiations with foreign companies owning
concession rights to explore for oil while in 1980, Kuwait formed
the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation as part of its expansionist oil
policy which caused a fundamental and comprehensive change in the
oil industry in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait Oil Company is now running all administrative
activities related to oil and gas exploration and production
inside Kuwait while the Kuwait National Petroleum Company
supervises refining and marketing oil-products locally.
</P>
<P>
The oil reserves in Kuwait is estimated at about 100 billion
tonnes which is probably enough for the Kuwaitis to extract for
another 100 years at the present rate.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait now export 2.4 million barrels of oil per day and has a
daily refining capability of 840,000 barrels of crude.
</P>
<P>
Oil earnings now represent 90 percent of the state's total
revenues.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Needs 360,000 Tons of Vegetable Oil by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will need some 360,000 tons
of vegetable oil by the year 2000 to supply a population of 80
million with an annual per-capita consumption of 4.5 kilograms,
the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, VNA quoted the Vietnamese Institute of Vegetable
Research as saying the rate will meet only half of the requirement
of the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, 75,000 tons of vegetable oil including 20,000
tons imported were used by consumers nationwide. This means that
the annual per-capita consumption stood at only one kilogram.
</P>
<P>
VNA noted that the big gap between the country's vegetable oil
production and material potential is largely attributed to the
lack of oil processing factories, whose processing technology is
crude.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are three vegetable oil processing factories
across the country with a combined output of nearly 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is considered to be not only a large vegetable oil
market but also a country with favorable natural conditions for
producing oil-bearing crops.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Excludes Nigeria From Debt Relief List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, described by the World
Bank as one of the poorest countries in the world, has been shut
outside a list of beneficiaries of debt forgiveness at the just
concluded G-7 summit in France, the local Sunday Punch reported
today.
</P>
<P>
African countries eligible for the debt forgiveness include
Uganda, Ethiopia, Cameroun, Cote d'Ivoire, Burundi and Tanzania,
according to the "big initiative group" of the World Bank, which
met the G-7 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The countries earmarked to benefit from the debt appeal are
those committed to the improvement of the living standard of
their citizens, the newspaper quoted Ms Maria Karnel, head of the
World Bank group, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karbel's remarks came after a recent World Bank report saying
that due to the political crisis in countries like Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, the Gambia and Liberia, the various structural
reforms have remained unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Ms Karnel said "this move is the first time the World Bank is
trying to deal with the debt of African countries directly and in
a comprehensive way".
</P>
<P>
The G-7 is trying at a collective contribution towards
improving the economies of Africa and they are prepared to
support substantially great reduction of debts owed by these poor
countries making efforts to improve, according to the World Bank
official.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expected to Attract 4 Million Tourists in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 4 million tourists are expected
to visit Egypt this year, an increase of over 30 percent over last
year, Egyptian Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette, Egypt's only English-language daily,
quoted Beltagui as saying that the government has allocated 42
million Egyptian pounds (12.35 million U.S. dollars) this year to
promote the tourism industry, the country's second largest source
of foreign currency income just behind overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
Egypt aims to attract 6 million tourists annually by the year
2000, the minister said, adding that Egypt is now implementing 389
projects in an effort to increase hotel rooms from the current
67,000 to 176,000.
</P>
<P>
Beltagui, who stressed the role of the private sector in the
development of tourism, called for more arts, cultural and sport
events to attract more tourists, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism, which had suffered a slump since 1992 largely
because of a violent campaign launched by Islamic fundamentalist
militants against the government, greatly recovered last year and
is continuing to pick up this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the industry earned the country about 2.7 billion
U.S. dollars with over 3 million tourists coming to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is especially famous for its archeological monuments left
over from the Pharaonic era, religious sites, the mild weather in
winter and unpolluted sand beaches along the Red Sea coast.

<HEADLINE> Iran: World not to Tolerate US Dominance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said today the world "would not tolerate the dominance by
the U.S. in other parts of the world," claiming the end of the
dominance by the United States over the world.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Velayati said, "This trend will continue
in the world," in an apparent response to the G-7 annual summit
held in Lyon, France from June 27 to 29.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw a clear division among the members of the G-7,
which groups the seven rich industrialized states of the U.S.,
Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan. European
members resisted U.S. punitive policy vis-a-vis Iran and Cuba and
invited Iran to cooperate toward curbing international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister quoted French President Jacques Chirac as
saying that "France would stand against any U.S. attempt to impose
its will on European countries."
</P>
<P>
"The European countries would not accept the imposition of
U.S. domestic policies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "We accept the invitation by Europeans on the
issue of terrorism. Rarely has a country been so much and so
deeply affected by terrorism."
</P>
<P>
As to the recent blast which killed 19 Americans and injured
more than 300 others in a military base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
the Iranian foreign minister denied any Iranian involvement in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are against all forms of terrorist acts. We don't
agree with what happened in Dhahran."
</P>
<P>
"(U.S. Secretary of State) Warren Christopher and (Israeli
Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Iran without adequate
information. This is indicative of U.S. foreign policy, making
statements on inadequate information," he noted.
</P>
<P>
One day after Christopher's statement, he added, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry said there is no indication to involve
Iran in the Dhahran explosion.
</P>
<P>
He attacked Christopher for making "baseless and illogical
accusations against Iran."
</P>
<P>
On a question of further relations between Iran and Europe, he
said, "We are optimistic about the future of Iran-Europe ties."
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Iran news published an editorial
on G-7 Summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
The editorial advised the Iranian government to prepare grounds
for a meaningful and beneficial cooperation with European
countries, particularly, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Europe's renewed relations with Iran, led by French President
Jacques Chirac, needs further solid and sound ground with no room
for exploitation," it said, adding that Chirac, unlike his
predecessor Francois Mitterrand, is willing to extend cooperation
with Iran in such a manner to be beneficial to both sides.

<HEADLINE> Polio Reported to Vanish Soon in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Polio may soon be history
in Tanzania with the introduction of the country's immunisation
programme for all children under five in August, according to the
Tanzanian Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Saturday, the ministry said that
the programme is part of the implementation of the declaration by
the World Health Assembly in 1988, which called for the
elimination of polio by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it has planned to conduct National
Immunisation Days twice a year effective this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 51,000 workers would be deployed all over the
country in 17,000 vaccine teams to conduct national vaccination,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
During the Immunisation Days slated for August 10-11 and
September 14-15, a total of 6 million children would be
vaccinated each turn making a total of 12,000,000 children to be
vaccinated each year, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania joins other 28 African countries in such a programme
this year in efforts to make the whole continent polio free, as
what has been accomplished in America and Europe five year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sultanate of Oman will host
the coming ministerial meeting of the Damascus Declaration
signatories, an informed source in the Omani capital said.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) newspaper "Al-Ittihad" quoted
the sources as saying that the meeting due to be held in Muscat
from July 13 and 14, would discuss several questions, including
the Middle East peace process, the resolutions adopted by the Arab
summit recently held in Cairo and the developments of condition
on both the Arab and international scenes.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman
and the UAE, and of Egypt and Syria, meet periodically every
six months in one of the capitals of the Damascus Declaration
signatories.
</P>
<P>
After Kuwait's liberation from a seven-month Iraqi occupation
in the 1991 Gulf war, the GCC states and Syria and Egypt signed
an agreement in Damascus under which Egypt and Syrian were to
contribute a large number of troops to a 100,000-strong defense
force to be stationed in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The plan was to cost the six GCC states 10 billion U.S. dollars
and financial disagreements have stalled its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Iran, which has been pressing for a role in any such
security pact, openly rejects the import of forces from outside
the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time for such a meeting to be held in the
Omani capital of Muscat.

JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new coalition led by
an Islamic party has raised Israel's grave concern about the
possibility of worsened bilateral ties, especially the future of a
controversial military pact.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Islamic Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan formed
Saturday a coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller, leader of
the conservative True Path, under a four-year rotating
premiership deal.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan took office as prime minister for the first two years
while Ciller serving as deputy premier and foreign minister. The
two would swap jobs two years later.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 73 years since Turkey's independence
that an Islamic party comes to power in the traditionally secular
country which has a large Moslem population.
</P>
<P>
The change in Turkish government confirmed Israel's previous
fears for the possible worsening of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey, who witnessed the rapid development of
bilateral ties in the past few years, signed in February a
controversial military cooperation pact which allows pilots from
both sides to fly training flights in each other's airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Turkish military pact has prompted loud protests
from the Arab world, led by Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which
has repeatedly urged Turkey to scrap it in order to protect the
Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been closely following the political situation in
Turkey for fear of the rise to power by an Islamic party. And on
June 11, Israeli President Ezer Weizman paid a visit to Ankara,
where he won promise to honor the military agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the formation of an Islamic government in Turkey
has sounded an alarm bell about the Israeli-Turkish ties.
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot be too pleased about the turn of events in
Turkey, following the appointment of the first Islamist prime
minister since independence," the Jerusalem Post claimed in
today's editorial.
</P>
<P>
"The future of relations with Turkey may now cause some worry
in the Foreign Ministry, until it becomes clear whether Erbakan
intends to stand by the more moderate stance," it added.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the paper asserted, Erbakan is "a reluctant
partner" of Israel and the development of bilateral relations
will unlikely proceed "as enthusiastically as they did under the
previous government".
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that the Welfare Party in April
blasted the Israeli-Turkish military pact as being contrary to
the dynamics of the region and expressed doubt about its
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew daily Ma'ariv voiced the same worry about the
possible worsening of Israeli-Turkish ties, while quoting
officials as expressing doubt about whether Erbakan will have a
free hand in the coalition with the pro-Western Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Following Turkish media reports that the new government
planned to cancel the military pact with Israel, Israeli
officials have contacted a number of Turkish counterparts on the
issue, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Israel is taking a wait-and-see policy
toward the Turkish new government in hope that the pragmatic
Ciller will exert more influence on taming her Islamic partner.
</P>
<P>
"Since Erbakan will be in command for only two years, it must
be hoped Ciller's hand remains firm and steady on the helm of
Turkey's traditional values," the Post concluded.

JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new coalition led by
an Islamic party has raised Israel's grave concern about the
possibility of worsened bilateral ties, especially the future of a
controversial military pact.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Islamic Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan formed
Saturday a coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller, leader of
the conservative True Path, under a four-year rotating
premiership deal.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan took office as prime minister for the first two years
while Ciller serving as deputy premier and foreign minister. The
two would swap jobs two years later.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in 73 years since Turkey's independence
that an Islamic party comes to power in the traditionally secular
country which has a large Moslem population.
</P>
<P>
The change in Turkish government confirmed Israel's previous
fears for the possible worsening of bilateral ties.

<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The feud within the Japanese
coalition government over how to handle the issue of U.S. military
bases in Okinawa might lead to the dissolution of the Diet, a
former prime minister said today.
</P>
<P>
"If the three parties cannot reach an agreement on the Okinawa
issue, it is possible that the coalition government will be broken
up," Yasuhiro Nakasone said on a Fuji television network program.
</P>
<P>
"In that case, all they can do is to dissolve the lower house,"
he declared.
</P>
<P>
Nakasone stressed that the three parties in the coalition
government should cooperate to resolve the Okinawa issue while
maintaining the framework of the Japan-U.S. security accord.
</P>
<P>
But if the parties -- the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social
Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake -- fail to reach a
consensus among themselves, a dissolution and a general election
are inevitable, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in April between Japan and the
United States, the U.S. military will vacate some 20 percent of
the land it now occupies in the southwestern island prefecture of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the Okinawa prefectural government, led by
Gov. Masahide Ota, has not eased its fight against the central
government's plan to continue seizing private land on the island
for the U.S. military's use.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Current Account Deficit to Decrease: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has predicted that the Philippines' current account deficit
will decrease to 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP)
this year from the 3.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In its latest world economic outlook, the IMF said that the
Philippines is expected to improve its current account position
this year and next year as the country further involves itself in
global trade.
</P>
<P>
The current account is part of the balance of payments and is
comprised of exports and imports of goods and services, as well as
unilateral transfer payments such as foreign grants.
</P>
<P>
For 1977, the IMF sees the country's current account position
further improving to a deficit of only 2.3 percent of the GDP, the
amount of goods and services produced by an economy excluding
incomes from abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is targeting for 1996 a current
account deficit of 2.2 percent of the gross national product
(GNP), or the total goods and services produced by an economy
including incomes from abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Otti Lagony, operations commander
of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has express
willingness to denounce rebellion and surrender with about 350
fighters as long as government guarantees their safety when they
return home.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily "The New Vision" published today,
an emissary conveyed Lagony's message on June 21 to Maj. Gen.
Caleb Akandwanho Saleh, special military and political adviser in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Lagony appears to have fallen out with LRA chief Joseph Kony,
the newspaper reported, quoting the emissary as saying that
Lagony accused Kony of persistently relying on witchcraft in
their operations against the government army.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Lagony complained that Kony's continued
reliance on witchcraft would never advance their struggle.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has repeatedly said he will
never pardon Kony or Lagony because of the numerous atrocities
they have continuously committed in Acholi region, northern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni accuses them of mass killings, abductions, chopping
of people's ears and noses, laying ambushes and rape. Up to now,
it's unclear whether Museveni will give Saleh green light to meet
Lagony, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lagony, 38 years old, he was recently dislodged from their
main base in Kilak hills. He is now in the area of Zambia, about

<HEADLINE> Transient Labor Floating to Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A roving workforce of 100,000
laborers from China's inland provinces have found seasonal
employment with farmers in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Most local farmers in the eastern province have entered into
township enterprises, or own their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
This 'migration' of the transient laborers is a new trend for
China's surplus workers in rural areas. Many decided to head in
search of work to the well-off countryside of the eastern coastal
areas, even though most of them wanted to seek job opportunities
in the big cities, a local observer said.
</P>
<P>
The transient workforce come from central and western parts of
China, such as Sichuan, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. And most of
them go back home to join family members during the the Spring
Festival, and return to Zhejiang early the next Spring.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is one of China's provinces where township enterprises
have been fully developed over the past few years, and most local
farmers have become workers in the township enterprises, or owners
of their own workshops.
</P>
<P>
With local labor prices growing in the countryside, local
farmers hire the transient labors to do work in the fields while
providing board and lodging for them in the busy seasons of the
year. Each of the laborers can earn at most 40 yuan a day.
</P>
<P>
In Jinxian County, where nearly 90 percent of local farmers
have left the fields, there are about 6,000 farmers from other
places working on the fields, and selling 70 percent of total
grain that local governments have purchased every year.
</P>
<P>
The increasing returns from planting crops in recent years also
encouraged more transient labors to head to the province.

NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinmhua) --Over 40 elephants with their
calves have been roaming the outskirts of Narok town,
southwestern Kenya, wreaking havoc in the area.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are claiming that they cannot venture out of
their houses after 6.30 pm due to the migration of huge elephants
which have destroyed large acreage of wheat, maize and threatened
their lives.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area told the press today that early this
week they gave the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) a one-week
ultimatum to drive off the jumbos to the nearby Masai Mara
National Reserve.
</P>
<P>
However, Narok District Warden Robert Kitui who has pledged to
control the moving elephants said that the current elephant
movement is normal and is in line with their seasonal migratory
patterns.
</P>
<P>
The elephants whose home is Masai Mara National Reserve
migrate once a year.

<P>
NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's first "Complete Works of
Applied Surgical Graphs" was issued by the Jiangsu Science and
Technology Publishing House earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The series features 10 volumes with 18,000 illustrations and 11
million words of explanatory notes. It also offers surgery
guidelines for doctors.
</P>
<P>
As a major state publication included in an Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995), the "Complete Works of Applied Surgical Graphs"
covers all types of surgical operations: general surgery,
neurosurgery, thoracic, cardiac, orthopedic, urologic, ophthalmic,
gynecological, otolaryngological, cervical, and plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
The 10 volumes collected information on nearly 3,000 common
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
China has developed its own surgical techniques, and its
surgeries for replantation of severed limbs make the country a
leader in this area.
</P>
<P>
However, China did not have a complete set of published works
to introduce its surgical operations.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Jiangsu Science and Technology Publishing House
has invited 37 state-level medical experts, including Wu Jieping,
Wu Mengchao, Qiu Fazhu and Jiang Sen to form an editorial board
for the book.
</P>
<P>
More than 280 experts compiled the 10 volumes based on their
common clinical cases.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Farmers Eager to Participate in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Two million township residents
in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, are
placing their votes in a round of elections for new township
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The participants accounts for 95 percent of valid voters in
Guangzhou's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The election will chose 81 township chiefs, 300 deputy township
chiefs and 5,500 delegates to the local people's congress.
</P>
<P>
Of the candidates, 62 per cent were recommended by voters and
the rest of the candidates were chosen by local governments or
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The final result will be announced after the secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the voters enthusiasm for the election
of township leaders to the sustained income increase of Guangzhou
farmers, thanks to the economic growth based on a collective
share-holding system.
</P>
<P>
They held that the township authorities have played an
increasing role in rural voters' production and daily life.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey by the Guangzhou Statistics
Bureau, the per capita net income of Guangzhou farmers reached
4,482 yuan (540 U.S. dollars) in 1995, 22.13 percent over that of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
About half of the increased income come from rural collective
economy, statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The collective farming and rural enterprises have played a more
important role in rural economy with the weakening of household
management.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's rural area is one of the most developed rural areas
in China.

<HEADLINE> Iran Strongly Reacts to Turkish Air Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran has declared here that it will
take all necessary measures for protecting the "safety and
security" of the country and will not let Turkey get away "so
easily" with airspace intrusion.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement carried by today's English daily
Iran News in its front-page, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said Iran's serious concern has been expressed to Turkey
on its recent violation of the Iranian airspace. The Turkish
ambassador has been summoned by the Foreign Ministry to provide
further explanations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish helicopters violated Iran's airspace and
fired rockets, killing six Iranian nationals and wounding 15
others in its northwestern region Wednesday, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey denied Iran's accusation, dismissing the Iranian
report as a "lie."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said, "We will pursue this matter
to its logical conclusion. This is not something we can ignore,
because it involves our national security and territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Referring to an accord signed by Ankara and Tel Aviv in
February, which allows Israel's Air Force to train its pilots in
the Turkish air and sparked sharp criticism from Iran, Velayati said,
"We have taken serious and decisive actions to neutralize the
potential danger coming from the Turkish-Israeli accord."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not elaborated on the issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The amount of computers for home
use this year is expected to hit 300,000 in Beijing, nearly two
times the 1995 figure, "China Electronics News" reports.
</P>
<P>
Top brand-names and high-performance computers are growing in
favor among individual consumers in the city.
</P>
<P>
The growth is attributed to the price war among computer
manufacturers, which has brought the price of computers down from
15,000 yuan three years ago to the current 6,000 to 8,000 yuan, on
average.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the purchasing power of the city's residents
has grown noticeably, boosting sails in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 percent of Beijing households having members with a
higher level of education background plan to purchase computers in
the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 percent of computers privately owned in Beijing
are owned by people with a higher level of education.

party, KANU.
</P>

<P>
COLOMBO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Indian Security
Authorities took steps to hunt Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels in Madras,
the capital of Tamil Nadu, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Armed Forces, police, Indian Cost Guard
and the Intelligence Agencies in Tamil Nadu Saturday launched a
massive campaign to round up "free moving" Tamil rebel cadres in
Madras, and to catch the fishermen involved in smuggling
activities between India and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
This followed a directive from Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M.
Karunanidhi to "clear the state" from the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) cadres and to stop smuggling activities in the
coastal areas with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Chief ministers of several other states in India would follow
Karunanidhi's action against the LTTE within this week, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the LTTE will be fully implemented all over the
country and the smugglers will be punished, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> New Waste Disposal Technique in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing City in east China's
Jiangsu Province has developed a new fuel-free burning method for
disposing urban domestic waste.
</P>
<P>
The horizontal consecutive furnace, jointly developed by
chemists, machinists, and environmental protection experts over a
two-year period, has a daily burning capacity of 200 tons.
</P>
<P>
The waste is stored for about 15 days of storage, then put into
the special furnace that uses air-blowers to add oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The remaining waste could be used for making building materials
and the smoke from the furnace does not cause air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the heavy oil burning method which is popular
abroad, the fuel-free burning technique is much cheaper: the cost
for burning one ton of waste is six yuan (about 0.7 U.S. dollar),
while the heavy oil method would cost 100 yuan (12 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The volume of waste will also be reduced by two-thirds with the
fuel-free burning, which is considered by experts a good means for
the country to get rid of its waste.
</P>
<P>
China's annual urban waste volume is over 100 million tons. To
date, over 90 percent of the domestic waste is disposed of by
piling up or burying, and the ensuing partial pollution has become
a social problem for local authorities.

TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Police will soon arrest two senior
officials of Japan's major department store chain Takashimaya
Co. for their allegedly payment to racketeers, according to
reports from Osaka today.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Kusumi, 67, a former managing director, and Masaji

<HEADLINE> Japan's Securities Company to Be on N.Y. Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Nomura Securities Co. has
decided to have its stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), possibly in the spring of 1997, the national daily Yomiuri
Shimbun reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The company's measure, which will make it the first Japanese
securities company traded on the exchange, is aimed at enhancing
Nomura's international credit standing and competitive edge
relative to U.S. and European securities houses.
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri said Nomura has already begun preparatory talks
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
If Nomura is eventually listed for trading in the world's
financial center, it will join other Japanese companies already
traded on the New York exchange, such as Sony Corp. and the Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
Nomura, the largest among the so-called "Big Four" securities
companies in Japan, studied a similar listing plan around 1990 but
dropped it in the wake of the collapse of the "bubble" economy.
</P>
<P>
The new plan of the company is in response to its recent
remarkable earnings increase, especially in international
operations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Nomura chalked up an impressive 135.5 billion yen (1.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in consolidated pretax profit for fiscal 1995 to
March, including 40 billion yen (365 million dollars) from deals
in the U.S. and European markets.
</P>
<P>
Nomura has already switched to U.S. accounting methods as part
of its efforts to meet U.S. standards on corporate information
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for a listing on NYSE, the brokerage house must draw
up a specific plan on the disposal of an estimated 400 billion yen
(3.65 billion dollars) in bad loans held by its non-bank
affiliate, Nomura Finance Co.

-- The Japanese were still the top investors in various export
processing zones in the Philippines in the first six months of
1996. Of the 1.584 billion pesos of investment approved by the
Philippine Economic Zone Authority from January to June this year,
most of the amount was wholly or partly owned by the Japanese
investors.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic's Re-election in Party Incurs Strong Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic today was re-elected almost unanimously chairman of the
ruling Serb Democratic Party at a congress held in Pale.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic was thus granted another four-year mandate in the
party despite an increasingly rampant international outcry for his
unconditional stepping down from the "presidency" of Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, High Representative to Bosnia, on Thursday
threatened to revive the potentially disastrous sanctions on
Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia if the Serb leader did not resign
before July 1.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's spokesman added in Sarajevo today that Karadzic's
re-election in the party is nothing but a clear provocation to the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav
Federation President Zoran Lilic demanded that the Bosnian Serbs
stick to the Dayton peace agreement and Karadzic retreat
completely from politics as stipulated in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
They warned they would join in the sanctions against the
Bosnian Serbs if the demand was not met squarely.
</P>
<P>
However, Bosnian Serb Premier Gojko Klickovic announced Monday
that Karadzic had already agreed to resign from, and not to run
for, the "presidency" in the general elections, scheduled for
September 14, but would remain as party chief.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, Bosnian Serb "President" since April 1992, is wanted
for trial by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague
after the 43-month ethnic conflict ended last year.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappings Up 67 Percent in Philippines This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 80 kidnappings have been
committed in the first six months of this year, an increase of 67
percent over the same period of last year, the Philippine Star
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Records gathered by the paper showed that of the 80 cases, 35
involved ransom, and the victims' families forked out some 25
million pesos (about one million u.s. dollars) in ransom for the
safe release of their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that 48 kidnappings were reported last years
with 27 involving ransom.
</P>
<P>
As some policemen were involved in kidnappings in the past,
victims became more fearful of reporting kidnappings, and at least
21 incidents went unreported this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that 113 victims and 274 suspects were involved in the
80 incidents, with the suspects including 19 police officers.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, of the 113 victims, 22 were
rescued, 43 released, five abandoned, seven escaped, two sexually
assaulted and 22 remaining in captivity.
</P>
<P>
At least 91 suspects have been arrested or charged so far this
year, but 194 remain at large while 11 were killed in encounters
with government forces, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The increasing kidnappings have been partly attributed to the
wider gaps between the rich and the poor in the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> China to Reshape the Health Products Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to give a
facelift to its declining health product market by creating
nationwide "game rules" for the products.
</P>
<P>
Health product enterprises have to re-register their products,
and seek approval from local public health departments after
examination of their production operations and the quality of
their products.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises who operate without obtaining permission from the
Ministry of Public Health by January 1, next year, will be taken
out of the market, a public health official said.
</P>
<P>
China has 3,000 enterprises engaged in the production of about
10,000 health products. However, the deteriorating quality of
health products has aroused serious concern of both customers and
the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Today's Chinese customers have become extremely cautious when
buying health products, because they cannot readily identify
reliable products.
</P>
<P>
"Some advertisements on TV and in newspapers are just not
reliable," a local observer said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health put into force the "Health
Product Administration Methods" at the beginning of this month,
which aims at bringing the chaotic market under the rules.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set strict standards for health products in
terms of production, content and safety.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the brands of health products are just common foods,
because they do not have what real health products should
contain," a medicine expert pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The health product market used to have a sales record of 50
billion yuan. However swarms of health products make customers
confused with their quality.
</P>
<P>
As a result the market has started declining.
</P>
<P>
A recent sample test showed that only two of the 200 kinds of
health products reached all of the state's standards. The test was
conducted by the State Bureau of Technological Supervision and the
Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this move can save the declining market, and will kick
out fake health products to help make Chinese people really
healthy," an official said.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified White-Skinned Tribe Sighted in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans to
check recent reports about the sighting of an unidentified,
white-skinned tribe in an isolated jungle of Bintuni subdistrict
in Irian Jaya, the most eastern province of Indonesia, Antara news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The unidentified tribe is believed to be living in a small
settlement near the upper reaches of Weriagar river. They were
seen in the middle of last month by villagers seeking firewood in
the jungle," the report quoted Cosmos Serang, an elementary school
teacher, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen had a relatively tall physique and were
white-skinned. They usually look for food in the jungle in the
afternoon and fish in a small lake near their settlement, said the
school teacher.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen would immediately hide behind trees as soon as
they saw strangers coming, he said, adding that they also kept
parrots that would give them a signal whenever strangers were
approaching.

<HEADLINE> Crime in Nicaragua Soars Over Past Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Crime in Nicaragua increased 10.5
percent during the first five months of this year in comparison to
the same period of 1995, said Gerardo Arce, head of Nicaragua's
National Police Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The total number of criminal cases, most of them robbery, from
January to May was 22,059, an average of 147 a day or 4,000 a
month, Gerardo Arce added.
</P>
<P>
"There is an almost incredible increase in crime," said the
official, expecting an 8-percent increase by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
But he said that more police deployments across the country
during the October general elections will help reduce criminal
offenses, now standing at 118 cases per 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the law enforcement departments attributed the
the rising crime rate to the country's high unemployment rate,
lack of law education and limited number of policemen.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Calls on Citizens to Speak Politely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a scenic coastal city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has called on its citizens
not to talk rudely or speak local dialect.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called the "Beautiful Language Project," asks
citizens to speak standard Chinese or "putong hua" instead of
dialect, to speak in a warm-hearted manner rather than coldly, to
speak politely instead of rudely, and not to use profanities.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will last through the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Dalian receives millions of travelers every year, many of whom
have said that some foul-mouthed local residents are a sharp
contrast to the beautiful scenery.
</P>
<P>
A middle school student who was traveling in Dalian last month
wrote to the municipal government criticizing the citizens' coarse
language, while praising the beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
The girl's letter caught the authorities' attention, and triggered
the "Beautiful Language Project."

<P>
JAKARTA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Garuda Airline has
temporarily grounded DC-10 aircraft in its flights from the
country to Japan following the recent DC-10 accident at Fukuoka
Airport, a senior official announced.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Joop Ave made
the announcement in Cilacap, Central Java on Saturday, reports
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
"The discontinuation of the flights to Japan by using DC-10
aircraft is to meet a request from the Japanese government,
apparently as the accident is still fresh in their mind," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
A Garuda DC-10 jetliner, which carried 260 passengers and 15
crew, caught fire after an aborted take-off on June 13 at Fukuoka
Airport, killing three people and injuring 100 others.
</P>
<P>
Joop Ave said the accident has adversely affected the number of
foreign tourists to Indonesia. However, the unfavorable situation
has been improving as Garuda has replaced its DC-10 with B-747-400
jetliners, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Communist Party Congratulates CPC Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Vietnamese Communist Party
(CPV) official extended warm congratulations on the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Ha, chairman of the Commission for External Relations of
the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Communist Party, handed a
message of congratulation by the CPV's Central Committee to Wen
Jiabao, acting chief of the Chinese delegation attending the
Eighth National Congress of the CPV.
</P>
<P>
Wen is alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the CPC and member of the Secretariat of the Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPV leaders, Hong Ha expressed warm
congratulations to the CPC and all the Chinese party members on
the anniversary that falls on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has a glorious history and the CPV
is glad to see the healthy development of relations between the
two parties, Hong Ha said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin's visit to
Vietnam in 1994 and CPV General Secretary Do Muoi's visit to China
in 1995 as two major events in the development of the bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
It is of great importance that the Central Committee of the CPC
sent a high level delegation, headed by Premier Li Peng, to attend
the Eighth National Congress of the CPV, said Hong Ha, who is also
a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPV.
</P>
<P>
The move embodies the resolution of both parties to further
enhance the friendly cooperation between the two parties, two
countries and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Wen thanked the Central Committee of the CPV for its
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people, under the leadership of the CPC,
has achieved great successes both in the fights for liberation and
the building of socialism since the founding of the party in 1921.
</P>
<P>
Wen contributed the successes to the combination of the general
principles of Marxism with the reality of China as well as the
practice of building China in a way that is most suitable to the
nation's situation.
</P>
<P>
Sticking to the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the party's basic policies, the Chinese people
are making further efforts in their socialist modernization drive
under the leadership of the Communist Party, Wen noted.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of Du Muoi's political report at the
opening session of the CPV's Eighth National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people believe that, Vietnam, led by the CPV, will
achieve prosperity and progress through all-round reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Chinese delegation Saturday morning
paid their respects to the remains of the late Vietnamese leader
Ho Chi Minh.
</P>
<P>
Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of
the Central Committee of the CPC, and her Vietnamese counterpart,
Hong Ha, held talks Saturday night on further consolidating and
improving the friendly cooperation between the two parties.

<HEADLINE> Rural Economic Improvements in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Rural economic growth in south
China's Fujian province continues with total agricultural output
value for the first half of the year increasing by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, average per capita income for
farmers reached 1,275 yuan, a rise of 9.5 percent, and the added
value for agricultural products in the first quarter hit 5.69
billion yuan, up 11.7 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Fujian is very limited in average
per capita arable land and has to buy 4 billion kg of grain
annually from other provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts have been put into increasing grain production
this year and 130 million yuan has been spent in trying to meet
the target of increasing grain output by 120,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The effort has begun to pay off, with grain output for the
spring harvest this year amounting to more than 500,000 tons, or
30,000 tons more than for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province started 108 agricultural projects in
31 counties, investing 140 million yuan and increasing forests by
nearly 100,000 ha in the first five months this year.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises in the province are enjoying stable
growth, achieving a total output value of 116.5 billion yuan in
the first five months of this year, up 25.7 percent over the same
1995 figure.

<HEADLINE> Gary Payton Named to U.S. Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Seattle SuperSonics guard Gary
Payton was named as the replacement for Glenn Robinson on Dream
Team III Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Payton, who was missed by the American Basketball Committee the
first time around, helped lead Seattle to its first National
Basketball Association Finals appearance since 1979. The Sonics
lost to the Chicago Bulls in six games.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Payton averaged 19.3
points and 7.5 assists in 81 regular-season games and excelled in
the playoffs, averaging 20.7 points and 6.8 assists on 48.5
percent shooting from the field, including 41 percent from
three-point range.
</P>
<P>
Payton, who just concluded his fifth season with the Sonics,
was the second overall pick in 1990, and is expected to command a
large contract as a free agent this off-season.
</P>
<P>
Payton's selection represents a second snub to teammate Shawn
Kemp, who plays the same position as Robinson, forward. Kemp's
coarse, taunting behaviour at the world championships in Toronto
two years ago is thought to have hurt his chances both in the
original selection and now as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Playing alongside Payton in the U.S. backcourt are Utah's John
Stockton, Indiana's Reggie Miller, Orlando's Penny Hardaway and
Sacramento's Mitch Richmond.

The president said the country would get very close to the

To foster small farmers' interest in production, Cardoso

<HEADLINE> RMB Expected to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese yuan is expected to
remain stable after it becomes fully convertible under the current
account by the end of this year, according to a news analysis on
today's "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the supply of foreign exchange in the
market will surpass demand in the near future thanks to improving
foreign trade balance, continuous inflow of large amounts of
foreign capital and expanding foreign exchange reserves, which hit
85 billion U.S. Dollars by the end of May, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Since China abolished the dual-exchange-rate system in 1994,
the yuan's rate has been mainly decided by the supply and demand
of foreign exchange in the market.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade deficit by the end of May shrank to
490 million and it is expected that the country will see balanced
trade or even a small surplus by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Paid-out foreign capital during the first four months amounted
to 11 billion U.S. Dollars, 21 per cent more than during the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to predictions of the State Statistics Bureau, the
actual foreign investment this year will hit 40 billion
U.S. Dollars, 2.3 billion more than last year.
</P>
<P>
And the renminbi's convertibility under the current account
will further improve the environment for foreign investment, which
will give strong momentum to foreign fund inflow.
</P>
<P>
While the supply of foreign exchange remains abundant, the
demand will not increase sharply in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has vowed to stick to the relatively strict
monetary policy in the coming years, which means fixed-asset
investment will still remain firmly under control.
</P>
<P>
Declining inflation also results in another strong support to
the yuan's stability. The inflation rate in the first six months
dropped to 6.5 per cent, from 21.8 per cent in 1994 and 14.8 per
cent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many experts predicted that the inflation rate this year would
be around eight per cent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the paper quoted Dai Xianglong, governor of the
people's bank of China, as saying that several times that the
prediction of the yuan's devaluation is groundless.
</P>
<P>
Dai's firm attitude enhanced market investors' confidence on
the RMB and shut the door on speculative market activity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Exports Face Decline: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Some analysts warn that Chinese
exports face a stiff challenge after experiencing years of booming
growth, according to China Daily's Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
A continuous decline in exports is likely for the coming months
or even longer, said Qiu Xichun, an expert on foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the harsh situation is not one that can be
changed notably by one or two special government policies within
the current mechanism," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's customs service show that during the
first five months of this year, Chinese exports reached 51.7
billion US dollars, down 7.1 percent from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Such a slide has rarely been seen in the past decade, Qiu
said. According to government statistics, Chinese exports saw an
average annual growth rate of 19.1 percent during the 1991-95
period.
</P>
<P>
But Qiu says the falling exports are not surprising considering
that the high growth of Chinese exports in the past two years was
not achieved with rapid upgrading of quality and technology, but
by such an usual element as devaluation of the renminbi in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"An alarming signal is that key and traditional Chinese export
categories such as textiles, tools and bags are suffering a severe
decline today."
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period, exports of garments fell 10.3
percent from the same period of last year, exports of textile
products decreased 23.3 percent and tourism products and bags,
25.5 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports have experienced two stages of development,
from a dominance in materials and primary products before the late
1980s to labour-intensive production thereafter.
</P>
<P>
After enjoying years of development, China's key export
products such as textiles and other light industrial products have
encountered rising production costs at home, limited market access
worldwide, and fierce international competition.
</P>
<P>
Other difficulties plaguing Chinese exports include cuts in the
tax refund rate, delay of tax repayment and inefficient management,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chinese exporters, especially state-owned foreign
trade firms, are generally reporting poor profits. By the end of
last year, state-owned foreign trade firms had reported
accumulated losses of 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars,
surveys found.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Beijing Economic and Trade
Commission, a survey conducted in March found that five out of six
foreign trade firms in the city were in the red. Losses of
Beijing enterprises doing foreign trade during the first quarter
of this year already surpassed those of the entire year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puping, a professor at the Development Research Center
under the State Council, said the slide in exports could possibly
pull down overall external trade development to less than five
percent this year -- the lowest since 1986.

<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Men's singles top seed
Pete Sampras and the women's defending champion Steffi Graf have
defeated their opponents in the third round clashes and entered
the last 16 of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, also defending champion, moved a further step towards
gaining his consecutive fourth Wimbledon title with hard-earned
victory over his Slovak opponent Karol Kucera 6-4, 6-1, 6-7, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
The American tennis ace, also world number one player, looked
ready to run away with the match as he won nine games out of 10 to
take the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
However, the towering Slovakian found rhythm on his powerful
serve and stunned Sampras with some excellent returns to take the
third and go a break up in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
The top seed reponded and broke back in the crucial seventh
before finally clinching the match. Sampras is due to meet 16th
seed Cedric Pioline later on Monday. Pioline, from France, beat
Jan Kroslak of Slovakia 6-2, 7-6 and 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Sampras praised his opponet by
saying, "he played as well as he could and made me work hard on my
serve but it was a match I just wanted to win."
</P>
<P>
"The conditions were difficult and my form was not as good as
the last couple of matches but I still got through," he added.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Croatian ace Goran Ivanisevic served his way
past tricky opponent Alexander Volkov of Russia by firing down 28
aces, reaching speeds of up to 127mph, on his way to a 7-6, 7-5,
6-3 win.
</P>
<P>
The 11th seeded Michael Stich of Germany resisted the tide by
thrashing his Austrialian opponent Sandon Stolle 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 6-3
to reach the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
In the women's upper half third round matches played earlier
today, fifth seed Anke Huber of Germay crashed out of the third
round by losing to Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-7, 1-6.
</P>
<P>
Top seed and defending champion Graf of Germany dropped the
first nine points of her third round clash but she quickly
recovered to beat her American opponent Nicole Arendt in straight
sets 6-2, 6-1
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Wimbledon Champion Conchita Martinez of Spain, the
sixth seed Czech player Jana Novotona and 13th seeded French
player Mary Pierce and vercame have overcame their third hurdle in
straight sets to reach the fourth round.

<HEADLINE> New Harbor For North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Though still under
construction the Jing-tang Harbor, a joint project of Beijing and
Tangshan cities that started in 1989, is already showing force as
a major harbor with vast potentials, on north China's Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two port areas have a designed annual capacity of 7.8
million tons and 4 million tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
The harbor is more than 100 kilometers to the southeast of
Tangshan city, in Wangtan Town, Leting County, in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Seven berths in the No.1 port area are operational and handled
3 million tons of cargo in 1995. The last berth in No.1 port and
10 more in No. 2 port are under construction.
</P>
<P>
Zhang He, mayor of Tangshan city, said that the harbor has
great development potential, with its long coastline, and few
competitors in the area.
</P>
<P>
This area has a six-kilometer ice-free coastline, where about
100 berths, each with handling capacity of 10,000 tons can be
built, and where 100,000 to 200,000-ton berths can also be built.
</P>
<P>
Zhang explained that the harbor is connected with a state
railway running to northeastern China, and an express highway
linking Tangshan with the harbor is being built and is expected to
be open to traffic in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The harbor is located in an area which is rich in export
commodities. That includes Beijing, the provinces of Hebei,
Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Regions, China's major producers of coal, iron and
steel, cement, salt and porcelain products.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Candidate Vows to Modernize Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTO DOMINGO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Presidential candidate
Leonel Fernandez Reyna vowed today to do his best to modernize the
Dominican Republic if he wins Sunday's second-round elections.
</P>
<P>
Fernendez, the candidate of the Dominican Liberation Party
(PLD), is contending against Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, of the
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD).
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old politician is slightly ahead in recent public
opinion polls and his position was reinforced when the ruling
Social Christian Reformist Party, headed by incumbent President
Joaquin Balaguer, decided to throw its weight behind the PLD
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez and Pena Gomez obtained the most votes May 16 in the
first round of elections, with Pena Gomez surpassing Fernandez by
a thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez told Xinhua the coalition of the most important
political forces in the country will ensure him a victory over
Pena Gomez.
</P>
<P>
The winner of tomorrow's elections will succeed Joaquin
Balaguer, who has occupied the presidential chair for 22 years in
the last 30 years. Fernandez and Pena Gomez's electoral campaigns
closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said that among the problems he will tackle
immediately after being elected are a 30 percent unemployment
rate, children's malnutrition, water and electricity shortage, and
illiteracy, which affects 30 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The PLD candidate said one of the first measures he will take
is to reorganize the foreign service to promote the Dominican
Republic in the world stage.
</P>
<P>
He will also move to enhance the country's tourism development,
foreign investment, transfer of technology, and diversification of
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he will base his foreign policy on the promotion
of foreign trade and the economy.
</P>
<P>
Diversification of relations will be stressed and a bigger
participation in regional organizations, such as the Caribbean
Common Market (Caricom) and the Central American Common Market,
will be sought, the candidate said.
</P>
<P>
Ties with neighboring countries such as Haiti, the United
States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Costa Rica will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said he will pursue greater access to the European
market for Dominican products while attracting more investments
from Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan's Agriculture Benefits from Foreign Know-how </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Over the past five years, more
than 200 experts from Japan, France, the US, and international
agricultural organizations have come to one of China's major grain
producers to bring modern agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
The area, Sichuan Province in southwest China, attaches great
importance to the use of technology that can improve grain output.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese expert was invited seven times to help with early
breeding and light seeding rice technology, and helped train more
than 3,000 agro-technicians for the province.
</P>
<P>
The technology has been used on 9.84 million mu (626,000
hectares) of farmland, bringing an additional output of over 600
million kilograms of rice and adding 840 million yuan in income.
</P>
<P>
The province also imported large quantities of improved rice
and wheat strains, as well as advanced technology in fruit tree
planting.
</P>
<P>
Canxi County employed an expert from New Zealand to help plant
Yangtao trees, which were planted on 45,000 mu (2,700 hectares),
providing an output that accounts for one-third of the country's
total. More than 80 of the tree's products sell well and have
helped a large number of farmers find relief from poverty.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen foreign experts were also invited to Sichuan
to train personnel in rural cooperative management, or operation
of rural co-op funds and share-holding systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that he was glad to see Romania's achievements in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during talks with his Romanian counterpart,
Ion Iliesco. The Chinese president arrived here earlier this
afternoon on a four-day state visit to Romania at the invitation
of Iliescu.
</P>
<P>
"The moment I came down from the plane, I found myself again
among old friends," he told Iliescu during their "warm and
friendly" talks at the presidential palace soon after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Jiang lived and worked in Romania for more than a year as head
of the Chinese experts' team in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu extended welcome to Jiang's visit, saying that many
changes have taken place in Romania in recent years and that he
hoped Jiang would travel around the country, from which he had
been absent for many years.
</P>
<P>
"I wish your stay in Romania a pleasant experience," Iliescu
said.
</P>
<P>
"I have visited China for many times, and I was deeply
impressed by China's accomplishments in reform and opening up," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Iliescu presided over a welcoming ceremony
in honor of the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the third leg of Jiang's six European and central
Asian nation tour. He has made successful visits to Spain and
Norway.

<HEADLINE> UK Current Account Deficit in 1995 Revised to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The British economy was given a
double boost Friday when government statisticians reported that
Britain's current account deficit in 1995 was only half as large
as previously estimated and consumer incomes in the first quarter
of this year showed the fastest rise since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), Britain's balance of payments deficit was only
2.9 billion pounds (4.5 billion US dollars) last year, sharply
lower than earlier estimates of 6.7 billion pounds (10.3 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revelation suggested that there was little danger that
stronger consumer spending would cause a balance of payments
problem.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the main reasons for the revision were
inaccurate estimates of investment income and insurance flows and
late information by companies.
</P>
<P>
The statistic office admitted that the revision was probably
the largest ever and said that it now planned a joint study with
the Bank of England to look at means of improving the data.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ONS revealed that consumers' real personal
disposable income rose at 4 percent year-on-year in the first
quarter, the fastest rate since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke hailed the data as a
sign that the government was delivering "better living standards
for the average family."
