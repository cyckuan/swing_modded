Third flooding in a month kills 16 in central Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ At least 16 people have died in the third
bout of serious flooding to hit central Vietnam in a month, local
officials said Saturday. The death toll was expected to rise as
more reports filtered in.
	   Tropical Storm Dawn dumped up to 350 millimeters (14 inches) of
rain on the area Thursday and Friday. That submerged large swaths
of land and inundated thousands of houses. Roads and communications
to many vilages were cut off.
	   No damage estimates were available.
	   Provincial floods and storms control committees said Binh Dinh
and Quang Ngai provinces each reported four fatalities, Khanh Hoa
and Daklak three each and Phu Yen two.
	   Phu Yen provincial floods and storms control committee said a
Myanmar sailor on a Panama-flag ship was killed and three others
injured as they tried to disembark while anchored at a port to
avoid the storm.
	   The sailor was strangled by a buoy's cable, but 18 other sailors
on the ship were rescued by local authorities Thursday night.
	   Last month, flooding killed 52 people in central Vietnam and
caused damage estimated at dlrs 13.7 million. A second round of
flooding in the region killed 17 people on Nov. 13-14 and caused
dlrs 7.4 million in damage.
	   Central Vietnam, of the country's poorest region, had until
mid-August been suffering from its worst drought in at least half a
century.

Johnston beas Ceballos in main event

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Former World Boxing Council lightweight
champion Stevie Johnston, in hs first outing since being
dethroned, stopped Demetrio Ceballos by technical knockout in the
sixth round of their main event at The Orleans Hotel and Casino.
	   Promotor Bob Arum said after the Friday night fight he plans to
put Johnston, the WBC's lightweight contender, in a rematch with
current champion Cesar Bazan by April. Bazan took the title from
Johnston in June.
	   The 26-year-old Johnston, now 25-1 with 14 knockouts, halted the
taller but slower Ceballos at 2:08 of the sixth. Johnston, who at
5-feet-4{ inches is 4{ inches shorter than Ceballos, won the first
five rounds according to all three judges.
	   A right to the head was the beginning of the end for the
25-year-old Ceballos. The punch hurt Ceballos, of Panama, and after
a barrage of blows by Johnston, of Denver, referee Mitch Halpern
halted the bout.
	   ``I got him with the right hook,'' Johnston said. ``He was
leaning on me and I just caught him. I saw him buckle and I jumped
on him. I knew it was over. He couldn't stand up. His knees
buckled.''
	   Johnston, at 136 pounds, won the WBC lightweight title in March
1997 and successfully defended it three times before being
dethroned by Bazan.
	   Ceballos, also weighing 136 pounds, now has a record of 20-3
with 13 knockouts. It's his second straight loss; prior to this
bout he was stopped by International Boxing Federation lightweight
champion Shane Mosley in February.
	   In an eight-round super welterweight bout, world-ranked
welterweight Ova Carr of Detroit took a unanimous decision over
journeyman Verdell Smith of Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Carr, ranked
No. 2 by World Boxing Association and No. 9 by the WBC, had no
problems with Smith.
	   Carr, at 150 pounds, now has a record of 47-2-1 with 28
knockouts. Smith, who weighs 149 pounds, slips to 24-26 with 14
knockouts.

Two Hong Kong men executed for drug trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Two Hong Kong men have been executed by a
firing squad after being convicted of drug-trafficking charges in
Ho Chi Minh City, the city Police newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Chan Chung Hung Sam My, 38, and Sun Chi Kin, 36, were arrested
at the city's Tan Son Nhat airport on March 15, 1996, while
carrying 9.05 kilograms (20 pounds) of heroin each in double-deck
suitcases, the paper said.
	   Chan and Sun, who held fake Portugese passports, arrived from
Bangkok in transit to Belgium and Netherlands, the paper said.
	   In March 1997, Chan and Sun were condemned to death, and an
appeals court upheld their sentences in August 1997. The president
rejected their plea for clemency.
	   More than 30 people have been executed in Vietnam so far this
year on drug-trafficking charges.

Davenport, Hingis advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT quote to Daveport sted Hingis &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis blunted the power game of Mary
Pierce 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 Friday night to gain a spot in the semifinals
of the Chase Championships.
	   The second-seeded Hingis will next play Romania's Irina Spirlea,
with the winner advancing to the unique best-of-5-sets final in
this season-ending event, the only time during the year pro women
play more than three sets.
	   In the other semifinal, the world's top-ranked player, Lindsay
Davenport, has another date with the Corel WTA Tour's hottest
player, Steffi Graf. The Madison Square Garden meeting comes six
days after Graf beat Davenport in the final of a tournament in
Philadelphia.
	   ``She is obviously playing the best tennis right now, and you
always want to kind of go up against the best, and she has
definitely been doing that her last couple of tournaments,''
Davenport said of Graf. ``Sometimes it is great to kind of get back
out there against someone that you recently lost to and some of the
stuff is still fresh in your mind.''
	   Davenport advanced to the semifinals by easily defeating
eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-0, 6-3 in Friday night's
opener.
	   Graf advanced Thursday night with a dramatic 1-6, 6-4, 6-4
victory over No. 5 Monica Seles in the best match of the
tournament. It ran Graf's match winning streak to 12 as the
29-year-old German seeks her third title in three weeks.
	   ``Last night's match was unbelievable tennis, I thought,''
Davenport said.
	   The Hingis-Pierce match was a replay of last year's
quarterfinals, which Pierce won in three sets. This time, Hingis
didn't let it get that far.
	   She traded heavy groundstrokes with her French opponent, somehow
finding yet another angle, a winning one. She had more variety to
her game, and showed it, mixing in drop shots and regularly going
to the net to put away a winning volley.
	   Pierce called for a trainer in the first set and later iced the
back of her neck and her groin at every changeover. But it didn't
seem to bother her mobility, which is much improved over last year.
	   At one point, Pierce left the court for a few minutes. Hingis
kept limber by playing against a ball boy, who used one of her
rackets.
	   Hingis, who is assured of finishing the year ranked No. 2 behind
Davenport, is seeking her second trip to the final in her three
trips to the Garden. In her debut in 1996, she lost in five sets to
Graf.
	   Davenport raced through the opening set of her match in 19
minutes. While Tauziat provided much stiffer opposition in the
second set, there was no question as to who would win, only what
the final score would be.
	   ``The first set I played really great tennis,'' Davenport said.
``I don't think I had many errors. I was seeing the ball well.''
	   As Davenport won game after game, Tauziat captured the Madison
Square Garden crowd, which is always pulling for the underdog. Very
little worked for Tauziat, the oldest player in the select
16-person field. And when she did win a hard-earned point, the
crowd responded warmly.
	   The loudest cheer came 30 minutes into the match when the
Frenchwoman won her first game.
	   ``She played good tonight,'' Tauziat said of Davenport. ``But
compared to the other time, I don't play really good tonight, so
maybe that made the difference. But she didn't make a lot of
mistakes today, that is for sure.''
	   After hitting a good approach shot deep into a corner and
heading to the net, only to see yet another Davenport winner go
whizzing past, Tauziat at one point shook her head from side to
side in exasperation and slapped her thigh. On another point, one
where the ball tipped the top of the net during the rally, which
she lost, she pointed to the net and hit her forehand while
muttering to herself.
	   The final point of the night was a microcosm of the entire
match.
	   Tauziat pounded what she thought was a winner deep into the
corner. Somehow, Davenport got to the ball and lifted a defensive
backhand lob into the lights. The ball bounced just inside the
sideline halfway between the service and baselines.
	   Tauziat lined it up, prepared properly, then pounded the ball
into the middle of the net.
	   It was the 14th meeting between the two, a series Davenport has
dominated. However, in recent matches, Tauziat has created problems
for the world's top-ranked player, beating the right-hander from
Newport Beach, Calif., indoors at the Grand Slam Cup last month.
	   Prior to the match, Davenport had her right foot worked on after
the two had warmed up. The blister was the last thing that bothered
Davenport this night.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The top eight doubles teams are also competing on the Garden's
blue carpet. The doubles champions will split dlrs 200,000.

ASEAN anti-drug conference to be held in Hanoi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Representatives from ASEAN countries will
meet in Hanoi next week to discuss how to fight youth drug abuse,
an official at the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth League said
Saturday.
	   The conference, to be held Thursday and Friday and co-organized
by the Ministry of Public Security and the Youth League, also will
draw representatives from ASEAN national AIDS committees and youth
organizations, he said.
	   Participants will share experiences in fighting drug abuse among
youngsters in their countries, the official said.
	   It is estimated that Vietnam has 134,000 drug addicts, 80,000
with police records and 30 percent under age 30.
	   Official statistics show that 14,000 people have been arrested
on drug-related charges in 7,000 cases in the first 10 months this
year, up 34 percent compared with the same period last year.
	   About 30 people have been executed for drug trafficking in
Vietnam so far this year.

	   Kim said North Korea's recent test-firing of a missile and its
work on an underground site suspected of being used to construct
nuclear missiles are ``cause for deep concern.''
	   Both leaders agreed they are on the right course to prevent
nuclear proliferation by the communist nation in providing fuel oil
and a nuclear power program for North Korea.
	   Kim, who has advocated a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement
toward his communist neighbor, urged North Korea to take steps to
``clear the suspicion'' surrounding the underground site that the
United States wants to inspect for fear it is being used to build
nuclear missiles. North Korea has demanded dlrs 300 million simply
for the right to look _ a condition Clinton called unacceptable.
	   Insisting that any nuclear proliferation by the North would not
be tolerated, Kim added that ``the policy of engagement is the best
policy from a realistic standpoint and this ought to be pursued
with consistency.''

Rat population may boom in Mekong Delta due to absence of floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ With no customary floods in September and
October, the rat population in the Mekong Delta may boom this year,
a government official said Saturday.
	   Dam Quoc Tru, vice director of the Plants Protection Department,
said damage by rats to crops in the country's rice bowl next year
may be bigger than 1998, the worst year so far.
	   No statistics on Vietnam's rat population are available. It is
believed to be in the hundreds of millions.
	   More than 67 million have been killed so far this year by traps,
poisons or other methods, compared with 55 million for all of 1997.
	   But there also have been human casualties: dozens of people have
died from accidentally stepping on electric rat traps or ingesting
poison meant for rats.
	   Tru estimates rats are causing dlrs 5 million to dlrs 6 million
in damage a year to crops.
	   The rat population boom have been blamed on the increased
availability of food and the shrinking numbers of predators such as
cats or snakes, which traditionally have been served at restaurants
or sold to China for traditional medicines.
	   The government last year decided to close down restaurants that
served cat, banned exports of cats and snakes and encouraged people
to raise cats.

	   Clinton warned that, if North Korea continues to rebuff U.S.
inspection appeals, Congress would likely have ``a great
reluctance'' to continue provide funds for oil shipments.
	   ``It would be a sad thing indeed if, for no good end over the
long run, the North Koreans would make it impossible to go
forward,'' Clinton said.
	   The two presidents spoke after bilateral talks at South Korea's

	   Asked about another trouble spot, Clinton responded cautiously
to news out of Iraq that Saddam Hussein was balking at a U.N.

day,'' Clinton said one week after he was poised to launch

Jakarta's streets remain quiet as Habibie meets with university

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and
armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto held peace talks with university
leaders on Saturday, a week after bloody street clashes between
soldiers and student demonstrations in which up to 16 people died.
	   Wiranto and Education Minister Yuwono Sudarsono were among seven
senior ministers who attended meetings at the presidential palace
with 15 deans from private universities in Jakarta.
	   Thousands of students have swarmed the streets of Indonesia's
largest cities in past weeks demanding greater democratic reform,
Habibie's resignation and for ex-President Suharto to be tried for
corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Up to 16 people were killed in violent clashes on Nov. 13-14,
when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators trying to march on
Parliament. Police say 13 people died. Hundreds were injured.
	   The students returned to the streets unbowed this week.
	   Blaming him for the deaths, students are now calling for
Wiranto's resignation.
	   On Friday, about 1,500 protesters and family members laid
flowers at Atma Jaya University, the site of the worst of last
week's violence.
	   In Surabaya, the country's second-largest city, several hundred
protesters marched on a government building.
	   Jakarta's streets were quiet on Saturday, as student leaders
held strategy meetings and waited on the outcome of Habibie's
meeting with the university deans.
	   Earlier this week, attempts to march on Parliament and on
Suharto's home in the exclusive Jakarta suburb where he has become
a virtual recluse since he quit in May were blocked by police in
riot gear and barbed-wire barricades.
	   Former Australian prime minister Paul Keating is scheduled to
visit Suharto on Saturday, one of few visits by international
figures.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark bloody riots in May
which helped forced Suharto out and in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   Officials say security forces last week were ordered to fire
only blank ammunition or plastic bullets at protesters who tried to
march on Parliament in a campaign for greater democracy.
	   But doctors confirmed Friday that metal bullet fragments were
found in the bodies of some protesters killed.
	   Habibie has accused some opposition activists of orchestrating
the protests in an attempt to overthrow his young government.
	   Police have formally charged 10 with sedition and are
questioning another seven. Those charged have denied the
allegations.
	   The students want the armed forces banned from politics and have
been angered by a special government assembly that decreed the
reduction, but not the elimination, of the military's
representation in Parliament.
	   Suharto ruled for 32 authoritarian years, but was forced to quit
May riots and protests.
	   Suharto has denied allegations of corruption against him and an
investigation into Suharto's business dealings has so far found no
wrongdoing.

Progress in lockout talks, but no more meetings this weekend

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Progress finally occurred in NBA labor talks,
with players and owners making several compromises during the
longest negotiation session of the 143-day lockout.
	   ``I would say there has been some movement from both sides,''
commissioner David Stern said after about 9 1/2 hours of meetings
ended shortly before 0400 GMT Saturday morning. ``I think it's fair
to say that there's an evident spirit of an attempt to reach
(agreement) on both sides.''
	   The sides will not meet again during the weekend, and no firm
date was set for resuming discussions next week. But both sides
agreed a resumption should be expected before November 26.
	   ``You reach a point in negotiations when you have to take a
breather, and we both felt that we kind of reached that point,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We all want to have turkey
with our families if we can, but other than that we realize that
making the deal as soon as we can is more important than any other
obligations we have.''
	   Stern tempered his enthusiasm by pointing out that the sides
remain far apart on many issues, but his comments were both
surprisingly optimistic and clearly indicative there was real
progress in trying to settle the most damaging labor dispute in
league history.
	   ``We reached a position where neither side was prepared to make
any further movement, so we though it was a good time to stop,''
union director Billy Hunter said. ``When you've been in a hotel for
12 or 14 hours, the air gets stale and your head gets cloudy.''
	   Sources involved in the talks, speaking on the condition they
not be identified, told The Associated Press each side had moved
about a couple points off its desired salary percentages. The
owners had been demanding 50 percent, while the players wanted 60.
	   So far, the first month and a half of the season has been
canceled, and an agreement would need to be reached in the next
week or so in order to start before Christmas.
	   Such a scenario seemed highly unlikely when the sides arrived
spouting pessimism in the morning, but as the clock neared midnight
it no longer seemed as farfetched.
	   If the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries failed to drop
below an agreed-upon level _ and what that level would be is one of
the biggest points of contention _ most players would contribute up
to 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund, with the money
going back to the owners if the designated percentage was exceeded.

	   A hemisphere away from the impeachment proceedings underway in
the House Judiciary Committee, Clinton refused to weigh in on the
substance of this week's lengthy testimony by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr. ``I hope Congress will do the right thing in a
non-political way,'' he said in response to a reporter's question.
	   As student protesters back in the streets of the Indonesian
capital, Clinton also voiced hope that ``there will be no
backsliding'' on human rights by the new Indonesian government and
military, which has promised to implement reforms, including
investigation of human rights abuses and efforts to scale back the
military's prominent role in politics.
	   When he arrived in South Korea late Friday, Clinton said he was
struck by television pictures of South Koreans crowding a tourist
boat bound for the North.
	   ``Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground, that
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as
much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up
there full of people from here,'' Clinton said.

Argentina leads World Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Argentina's Angel Cabrera and
Richard Gonzalez claimed the third-round lead at the World Cup of
Golf Saturday as strong winds knocked over a series of challengers
at the Gulf Harbor course.
	   The gusting wind, a factor in the first two rounds, was even
worse Saturday, causing a huge swell in the usually calm Hauraki
Gulf and battering the 64 players. Only five of them broke the
par-72.
	   England's Nick Faldo and David Carter were a shot behind the
leaders with individual frontrunner Costantino Rocca (6-under)
taking Italy into a tie for third with Ireland at even.
	   ``It was a long, hard day out there,'' said Faldo, summing up
the general feeling. ``It's opened up for about six or more teams
who can win it, but a brutal day. You're just hitting a lot shots
you're not in control of.''
	   The back nine was worst affected _ holes 12-17 snake around the
Gulf _ and the winds send scores soaring in the teams event.
	   Argentina started the day at 1-under, five behind overnight
leader England, and picked up just one stroke.
	   England led by three at 7-under before the 10th but Carter lost
four shots and Faldo one in the next three holes. They slipped to
1-under before Carter brought them back level with Argentina with a
birdie at 17.
	   But the 20-year-old missed a short putt for par at the last to
hand Argentina the lead. Carter said he had a ``Krueger'' in
shooting 42 for the back nine. It's slang for nightmare, as in Elm
Street.
	   Cabrera, a late replacement for Dunhill Cup teammate Eduardo
Romero, said battling the course and conditions Sunday would be
more important than the final-round match-up with Faldo and Carter.
	   ``I think we can win but we need to beat the course first,''
said Cabrera, who was equal second with Faldo at 5-under on the
individual table.
	   ``I think we will be feeling the pressure tomorrow, but I think
all the teams will be.''
	   John Daly continued to struggle in the powerful winds as the
United States team slipped from 1-over to 8-over. Daly and Scott
Verplank led at 10-under after 10 holes of the second round before
losing 11 shots in eight to finish Friday's round.
	   The pair never got going Saturday and both had bogeys on the
opening hole, a par-4. Daly had three bogeys and two birdies in the
opening nine and came home with four bogeys in the next nine. Daly
was 5-over for the day and 8-over for the tournament while Verplank
had a 74 and was even overall.
	   Rocca moved from 5-under to 6-under following a 71 and got good
support for the first time from teammate Massimo Florioli (71).
	   Defending champion Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley made a
run at the lead to get to 7-under after seven holes but the Irish
pair had a dismal back nine. Harrington was 3-under for the day
into the 14th but then dropped four shots in two holes including a
triple-bogey at the par-4 16th. He came back with a birdie to
finish level, while McGinley added another for 1-over.
	   Pre-tournament favorite Scotland also perished in the wind down
the stretch and was at 5-over. Europe's leading money winner Colin
Montgomerie had a 75 to be even overall while Andrew Coltart shot a
77. Both players had double-bogey 6s at the par-4 16th.
	   Japan almost missed out on the third round altogether when
Mitsutaka Kusakabe was involved in a health scare before the round
started.
	   Kusakabe was checked by medics after suffering an irregular
heart beat and higher than usual blood pressure. He was taken to a
doctor 20 minutes from the clinic and arrived back at the course
with a few minutes to spare.
	   Kusakabe was 14-over as Japan continued its fall from leader at
10-under following the first round to 12-over after three.

Police arrests ethnic party lawmakers, raids party hostel in
</HEADLINE>
Karachi &QL; 
 &UR; By GHULLAM HASNAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Armed police on Saturday arrested
several members of an ethnic party, hours after the prime minister
suspended civil rights in Sindh province and ordered the army to
curb violence in Karachi, its troubled main city.
	   In an overnight raid, police surrounded a hostel run by the
ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement (MQM) in Karachi's Azizabad
neighborhood and arrested several of its members, including two
lawmakers of the Sindh provincial assembly.
	   The raid came just hours after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
ordered the army to help curb violence in the southern province.
Sharif also ordered the setting up of military courts in Karachi to
try ``terrorists and criminals'' _ a move the MQM says is targeting
only its own ethnic group.
	   The MQM, a former ally of Sharif, speaks for the political and
economic rights of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at
independence from Britain in 1947 and their descendants.
	   The party, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, has
controlled the city for more than a decade.
	   More than 1,000 people have died in political and religious
violence in Karachi, Pakistan's financial and commercial center.
	   ``They (police) barraged into the hostel late in the night and
started beating our people,'' Hasan Musana, a MQM spokesman, told
The Associated Press.
	   Last month Sharif dismissed the elected Sindh provincial
government of which the MQM was a major coalition partner and
instituted direct federal rule in an attempt to stop violence in
Karachi.
	   Sharif has accused the MQM of most of the bloodletting, and hold
it responsible for the murder of former governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM denies the charge and blames Sharif for
``state-sponsored violence'' against its members.
	   The MQM is fighting with its splinter faction, the MQM Haqiqi.
Hundreds of people have died in killings between these two groups
in recent months.
	   The human rights groups and opposition parties Friday criticized
the decision to suspend civil rights and call the army to help the
government.
	   ``It is a mini-martial law. The government has no justification
of taking such a harsh step,'' said Senator Iqbal Haider of the
opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party.
	   But Sharif said the move is in the interest of the city and the
country.
	   ``We want to get Karachi out of this hell,'' he said.
	   He said military courts are needed in Sindh because ``the
terrorists threatened witnesses, judges and their families'' and
have paralyzed the justice system.
	   Sharif said military courts reach decisions much more quickly
than civilian courts, in ``days, not weeks and months.''
	   In civilian courts, the government says criminals easily get
bail. The decision of a military court cannot be challenged in a
civilian court.

Hot line set up to register anti-U.S. sentiments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysians angry over U.S.
Vice-President Al Gore's comments praising anti-government
activists can now call in to register their protest.
	   Calls to two phone numbers published in the government-backed
New Straits Times daily Saturday are answered by operators who take
down callers' names to add to a list. They don't take down
comments.
	   An operator who answered a call said the service was not run by
the government. He said he was under orders not to divulge the name
of the person providing the service or to identify himself.
	   A list of callers will be published in a local newspapers later,
he said.
	   In a speech this week, Gore expressed support for Malaysia's
political reform movement started by jailed former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   There was an international outcry when Anwar appeared at his
arraignment in September with a black eye and bruises, the result
of an apparent beating while in police custody.
	   While Anwar is being tried for abuse of power and illegal sex
acts, charges he denies, the government has arrested several
hundred of his supporters for participating in rallies which called
for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to resign.
	   Anwar's trial resumes Monday after a weeklong recess to avoid
clashing with the summit of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. Gore was in Kuala Lumpur to stand in for
President Clinton during the APEC summit.
	   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador John Malott defended Gore, saying he
only called for democracy and was not inciting people to violence,
as some Malaysians have accused him of doing.
	   Malott said Malaysia could not be called a democracy just
because it held elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving
leader, has been in power for 17 years.
	   ``Democracy is not simply having elections,'' Malott said.
``Stalin held elections. Even Hitler held elections. Democracy is a
process of allowing all views to be heard, of allowing the
competition of ideas.''

 &UR; Britain's Michael Rutter powers to victory &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) _ Britain's Michael Rutter cruised through Macau's
twisting streets Saturday to win the 32nd Motorcycle Grand Prix.
	   On his fifth Macau Grand Prix, Rutter held firm his pole
position from start to finish, pulling away from fellow Briton Ian
Simpson on the last lap to win in 35 minutes and 56.800 seconds.
	   ``All I was worried about was the last lap, so I held my head
down and rode as well as I could,'' Rutter _ with a wreath around
his neck and a magnum of champagne in front of him _ told reporters
after the race.
	   With his head held low all through the race, Rutter powered his
Honda 750cc to record his fastest lap on the third lap in 2 minutes
and 30.869 seconds, averaging 143.01 kilometers per hour (88.67
mph).
	   It was a clear sweep for Great Britain, with 29-year old Ian
Simpson coming in second and 25-year old John McGuiness coming in
third.
	   Simpson finished the 14-lap race in 36 minutes and 03.087
seconds, with McGuiness coming in third in 36 minutes and 19.806
seconds.
	   Mark Miller, a 25-year old racer from Los Angeles, California,
powered his Yamaha 1000cc to place fourth in 36 minutes and 37.803
seconds.
	   A clear favorite to win, Rutter had set a new qualifying lap
record of 2 minutes and 32.547 seconds to grab pole position at the
start _ the position on the inside of the track.
	   ``I was all ready, and I had someone to gauge myself against,''
said the 25-year old from Wordsley, Scotland.
	   Fellow Briton Simpson, on his fourth visit to the Grand Prix,
rode his best lap in 2 minutes and 32.797 seconds tailing Rutter by
a whisker through the 6.2 kilometer (3.8 mile) Guia circuit, but
was unable to power his Honda 750cc to overtake him.
	   ``I was happy to have just finished the race,'' said Simpson,
who won the Isle of Man Formula One TT earlier this year.
	   Making his Macau debut, McGuiness had dropped to fourth place on
the fifth lap after negotiating the notorious Lisboa Bend _ a clear
90-degree turn beside the sea _ but powered his Honda 500cc to
catch up with Rutter and Simpson at the finish.
	   ``I just sat on the rhythm and kept it tight and happy,'' said
McGuiness, who rode at an average of 141.50 kilometers an hour
(87.73 mph).
	   Miller, who began the race in seventh place, rode his best lap
in 2 minutes and 34.383 seconds at an average 140.34 kilometers an
hour (87.01 mph) to place fourth.
	   ``The trail was really neat, and I had never done anything like
this before,'' said Miller, also making his Macau debut this year.
	   Security at the races was heightened following the discovery of
a home-made explosive and a deactivated Russian-made grenade at the
circuit during practice late Friday. Race officials denied reports
that the circuit had been damaged.

Iraqi terror threat prompts U.S. Embassy closure: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The suspected entry of terrorists sent
by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein into Thailand has prompted the
temporary closure of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, a newspaper said
Saturday.
	   The Bangkok Post, citing unnamed Thai security sources, reported
that information from the Central Intelligence Agency was passed to
the Thais warning that a number of unknown terrorists from the
Middle East had separately entered Thailand to attack U.S. targets.
	   The embassy closed for a three-day period Friday. A statement
said the closure was in response to a Nov. 12 ``worldwide caution''
against potential terrorist attacks directed against American
interests.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press on Friday that Thai police security had been
stepped up around U.S. Ambassador William Itoh, who was visiting
northeastern Thailand.
	   The Post reported that the CIA invited the Thai military's
supreme commander, Gen. Mongkol Ampornpisit, to the United States
last week for security meetings in which some confidential
information was passed on to him.
	   The CIA has told the Thais that the terror suspects had secretly
entered Thailand across the western border from Myanmar, also known
as Burma, possibly to stage attacks during the Asian Games in
Bangkok next month, the Post reported.
	   The Post's sources said that the CIA had provided pictures and
background information. Thai military intelligence sources were
cited by the Post as saying that some other foreign terrorists had
entered through southern Thailand for sabotage.
	   Thailand's border with Malaysia has traditionally been the
operating grounds of an armed Muslim separatist movement. Many of
its leaders were arrested and extradited to Thailand earlier this
year.
	   Meetings between Thai and U.S. security officials came to the
decision to close the embassy. The Netherlands embassy, located
near the ambassador's residence, has also been closed.
	   The State Department's warning mentioned possible retaliatory
actions related to tensions with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections, the August bombings of U.S embassies in East Africa
and the U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, and the arrests
of suspects in those bombings.
	   In July, six Pakistanis suspected of terrorist links were
arrested in Bangkok in a joint operation by Thai police and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. They were not charged with any
crimes and were deported.

Clinton, Kim appeal to North Korea to abandon nuclear

proliferation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, UPDATING throughout with additional quotes.

 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton exhorted
North Korea Saturday to abide by its agreements on nuclear
nonproliferation, warning against ``further provocations.''
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, appearing at a news
conference with Clinton, joined in declaring: ``We will not
tolerate any possible attempt by North Korea to proliferate nuclear
weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.''
	   But both leaders tempered their warnings with empassioned
appeals for the North to continue dialogue and contacts with the
South.
	   Clinton said he was struck by television pictures of South
Koreans crowding a tourist ship bound for the North. He drew a
contrast with concern over a massive underground facility north of
Pyongyang which U.S. officials suspect may be used to hide a
nuclear weaponry program.
	   ``Nothing could ever be put in that hole in the ground, that
would give the North Koreans as much advantage, as much power, as
much wealth, as much happiness, as more of those ships going up
there full of people from here,'' Clinton said.
	   Kim, who advocates a ``sunshine policy'' of engagement toward
his communist neighbor, urged North Korea to take steps to ``clear
the suspicion'' surrounding the underground site that the United
States wants to inspect. North Korea has demanded dlrs 300 million
simply for the right to look _ a condition Clinton called
unacceptable.
	   The two presidents spoke after bilateral talks at South Korea's
presidential Blue House.
	   The joint news conference covered a range of other issues,
including efforts to boost the Korean economy, U.N. inspections in
Iraq and turmoil in Indonesia.
	   Clinton said the United States would stand behind Korea's
efforts to recover from economic difficulties.
	   ``I know Korea has endured much pain and still has a difficult
road to travel,'' he said, adding that Kim ``needs the support of
all segments of society.''
	   Asked about Iraq, Clinton responded cautiously to news
indicating that President Saddam Hussein was balking at a U.N.
request for documents about its banned weapons program.
	   ``I think it's important we not overreact here on the first
day,'' Clinton said, a week after he was poised to launch
airstrikes against the Iraqis for non-compliance with United
Nations weapons inspectors.
	   ``I hope that Iraq will comply as they said they would just a
few days ago,'' he said.
	   As student protesters returned to the streets of the Indonesian
capital, Clinton voiced hope that ``there will be no backsliding''
on human rights by the new Indonesian government, which has
promised to implement reforms, including investigation of human
rights abuses, and efforts to scale back the military's prominent
role in politics.
	   On North Korea, Kim insisting that any nuclear proliferation
would not be tolerated, He added that ``the policy of engagement is
the best policy from a realistic standpoint and this ought to be
pursued with consistency.''
	   Clinton warned that, if North Korea continues to rebuff U.S.
inspection appeals, Congress would likely have ``a great
reluctance'' to continue provide funds for oil shipments.
	   ``It would be a sad thing indeed if, for no good end over the
long run, the North Koreans would make it impossible to go
forward,'' Clinton said.
	   Kim, the longtime dissident and democracy advocate who was
elected president last December, told reporters before the meeting
that he would urge the American president not to press North Korea
too hard about the suspected nuclear site U.S. officials want to
inspect.
	   ``We need patience when dealing with North Korea,'' Kim said
before meeting Clinton. ``Without any conclusive evidence, it is
not a good idea to blow up the problem.''
	   At the news conference, however, there was no sign of
disagreement between the two leaders on how to deal with North
Korea.

Howell takes big lead after three rounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ English golfer David Howell will take a
six-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the Australian PGA
Championship at the New South Wales course after shooting an
even-par 72 Saturday.
	   Chasing his first win as a pro, the 23-year-old Howell has a
three-round total of 9-under-par 207 after starting the day with a
two-stroke lead.
	   His nearest challengers are Australia's Terry Price, who dropped
away with a score of 76 Saturday to be three under and tied for
second with countryman Rob Willis, who stormed into contention with
a 69.
	   The only other player under par is Trinidad's Stephen Ames at
two under after a 73. (djp)

Hong Kong crime boss appeals death sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reputed Hong Kong crime boss Cheung Tze-keung,
sentenced to death by a Chinese court earlier this month, submitted
an appeal minutes before the deadline, a local newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   Before signing the 10-page appeal, Cheung, alias ``Big
Spender,'' asked his lawyers to make last minute changes, the Hong
Kong Standard reported.
	   Cheung and four of his underlings were sentenced to death by the
Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou for crimes including
kidnapping, gun smuggling, and armed robberies. Two others received
suspended death sentences.
	   The appeal document handed to the Guangdong Provincial People's
High Court, which reviews all death sentences, specifies in
Cheung's own words why he is dissatisfied with the verdict, the
paper said.
	   Legal experts have raised questions about jurisdiction of the
case, noting that crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not
execute people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a
trial closed to journalists.

Hongkong Telecom staff protest proposed pay cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hundreds of Honkong Telecommunications Ltd.
staff staged a sit-in late Friday outside company headquarters to
protest a proposal that could cut their annual bonuses, local
newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Workers organized the rally after hearing that a profit-linked
bonus plan had been accepted by a management-appointed body, the
Joint Staff Council.
	   ``The Joint Staff Council does not represent the workers. None
of us would accept the company's package,'' Fung Ping-kwong, a
union spokesman told the South China Morning Post.
	   The company, one of Hong Kong's largest private employers with a
staff of 13,800, proposed a new profit-related bonus scheme to
workers earning more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars a month (U.S.
dlrs 1,282). That means if the company makes less than a 3 percent
profit, workers would lose out.
	   Many companies in Hong Kong give year-end bonuses equivalent to
about one month's salary.
	   The move would not affect 1,500 workers who make less than
10,000 dollars, the Hong Kong Standard reported.
	   Hongkong Telecom withdrew an earlier decision to cut salaries by
10-percent after 1,500 Hongkong Telecom employees staged a sit-in
protest outside the company's headquarters in September. The
company also promised it would not cut wages for one year.
	   Hongkong Telcom executives were unavailable for comment.
	   A number of companies have announced pay cuts of up to 20
percent as a way to cut costs in Hong Kong's worst recession in
years. Unemployment has also soared to a record high of 5.3
percent.

The window of peace is slowly closing on Kosovo's monitors

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO's top commander in Europe
believes Kosovo has only a two- to four-month window of relative
calm before another explosion. That window is slowly sliding shut
even as diplomats negotiate and technicians struggle to organize a
huge team of peace ``verifiers.''
	   U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck a deal with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Oct. 12 to end the violence in
Kosovo, the poor southern province of Serbia. Part of the deal
included sending 2,000 unarmed monitors to keep watch on the
cease-fire between Serbs and rebel ethnic Albanians.
	   An enormous amount of work has been done in the six weeks since
then by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is in charge of the Kosovo Verification Mission. But
so far not a single OSCE verifier is patrolling in the province of
2 million people.
	   The only monitors on the road are from the Kosovo Diplomatic
Observer Mission, which began in July and now has more than 200
observers from the United States, European Union, Russia and
Britain. It eventually will be absorbed by the OSCE operation.
	   For now, the OSCE's mission doesn't exist beyond a growing
headquarters operation.
	   ``As soon as possible, as soon as we think we are robust enough,
I will say OK, it's now a totally OSCE show,'' said William Walker,
the American running the Kosovo Verification Mission.
	   The biggest monitoring job the OSCE has ever done until now was
in Croatia. That involved 250 people and took six months to get up
to 75 percent strength, Walker said.
	   The OSCE doesn't know what the final number will be for the
Kosovo mission. Sometimes Walker mentions 1,500 monitors, sometimes
2,000.
	   ``I would guess by the first of the year, mid-January, we will
have a serious percentage of those people in _ as fast as humanly
and bureaucratically possible. And that `bureaucratically' is the
tricky part,'' he said.
	   By mid-January, however, the window's opening will be a lot
smaller.
	   Christopher Hill, the American ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is Washington's point man on the diplomatic front,
trying to work out a settlement acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians. His latest draft has drawn serious reservations from the
Albanians and rejection by the Serbs.
	   Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe,
whose readied force of planes and troops persuaded Milosevic to
deal last month, says everyone must move quickly to avert a
resumption of fighting in the spring _ a favorite time for
offensives in the Balkans.
	   ``Despite all our best efforts ... we probably have only a two-
to four-month window of relative peace,'' Clark said. ``We must use
this respite to achieve a just and durable political settlement.
	   ``The Albanian Kosovars are strengthening their force, they're
organizing, they're achieving greater discipline, and they're
preparing for what could happen if the political solution doesn't
appear. No doubt the other side, the Serbs, are doing the same
thing.''
	   Sporadic shootings and killings continue in the countryside of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the
population. But for the moment, both sides are generally adhering
to the cease-fire.
	   The first task of the OSCE verifiers has been to take care of
themselves. A Norwegian military team provided dlrs 21 million and
70 experts to set up headquarters in Pristina, the provincial
capital, and in six regional centers.
	   The OSCE will open a training center Monday in the mountain
village of Brezovica in southern Kosovo. Three-day courses will be
used to make sure a wide variety of monitors from 30-35 countries,
ranging from professional soldiers to human rights workers, all
start on the same footing.
	   What they will face are Albanian rebels scattered around the
province _ rearming, reorganizing, demanding independence from
Serbia and ready to go to war again if they don't get their way _
and Serbian army and police forces prepared to put down any
uprising just as violently as they did last summer.
	   As the number of verifiers increases and they begin staying
overnight in rural villages, the OSCE hopes confidence will grow in
the cease-fire.
	   At worst, if the truce cracks, the verifiers will become human
shields that may deter the warring parties from careless shooting.
An 1,800-soldier NATO ``extraction force'' _ expected to move into
neighboring Macedonia as soon as approved by the host government _
will be prepared to rescue verifiers if necessary.
	   In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian
civilians remain terrified of the Serbs. Many are unable to return
to their damaged or destroyed homes; others refuse to go home
because they are convinced the Serbs will kill them.
	   As the first snow fell across the province this past week, most
refugees had shelter, even if it was only a single, crowded room.
Some rebuilding is going on. But there is no real optimism that
better times are coming anytime soon.

Top obstetrician causes stir with ethnic theories on childbirth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A prominent French obstetrician is making headlines
for saying fetuses of black women reach term one full week before
the expected delivery date for Caucasian women.
	   Emile Papiernik, widely regarded as France's leading
obstetrician, says in ``Le Passeur de Vie,'' (The Delivery Man),
that understanding racial distinctions can help doctors save the
lives of newborns delivered dangerously past their due date.
	   ``Recognizing that difference allows doctors to begin monitoring
pregnant African mothers one week earlier,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``This can cut in half prenatal deaths, fetal distress
during delivery and the neo-natal damage associated with post-term
births.''
	   But with that theory, the man who opened France's first
authorized abortion clinic and helped conceive the nation's first
test-tube baby is causing a stir again.
	   ``Is Papiernik Racist?'' Elle magazine headlined its review. The
article concluded that he wasn't.
	   ``The ethnic ethics of Prof. Papiernik,'' the center-right paper
Le Figaro subtitled its article.
	   Papiernik, head of obstetrics at the Port-Royal Hospital in
Paris, has published several articles on racial differences in
pregnancy duration.
	   In France, about two infant deaths per 1,000 are caused by
perinatal complications, meaning those that occur three months
before delivery to seven days after.
	   But, Papiernik says, those numbers don't include the hundreds of
babies who survive, often with lifelong handicaps and developmental
delays that require longterm care.
	   ``Is there anything more traumatic than losing a healthy baby in
the days preceding or during delivery?'' Papiernik says. ``It can
be avoided without expensive, advanced technology _ just changing
the attitude that all pregnancies are the same.''
	   ``It's so simple, it knocks you over!'' he said.
	   But getting out his message has not been so easy.
	   France's top left-leaning dailies, Le Monde and Liberation, have
published nothing on the book, which Papiernik terms a
``blackout.''
	   ``Racial difference is not politically correct among
Socialists,'' he said.
	   Liberation's science writer, Eric Favreau, said the paper had
``no room for stories that didn't add anything exceptional,'' and
Le Monde claimed it never received the book.
	   Papiernik says he knows firsthand about the danger of racial
criteria. As a child during World War II, he narrowly escaped a
roundup of Parisian Jews. His father perished at Auschwitz.
	   But he argues that acknowledging racial differences is the first
step in achieving equality in medical care.
	   ``As a doctor, I can tell you in numbers of lives lost about the
stupidity of political correctness,'' he said.
	   Papiernik points to Fort-de-France, Martinique, where he claims
perinatal deaths have dropped from seven or eight per 1,000 to
about four since the city's major hospitals adopted his methods.
	   ``Papiernik's methods have been standard procedure here for
years,'' said Dr. Danielle Sainte-Rose, head of the Redoute
Maternity Clinic at Fort-de-France's teaching hospital, Centre
Hospitalier Universitaire.
	   ``For example, if a patient is black, we let her go into labor
at 36 weeks if she's ready. If she's Caucasian, we give drugs until
the 37th week or longer to delay labor,'' she said.
	   But Dr. Sainte-Rose said Papiernik's method was among several
factors _ such as the closing of small maternity clincs and better
prenatal care _ that have reduced perinatal deaths.
	   Clinics in Singapore applying Papiernik's findings also say they
have reduced perinatal deaths among babies of Indian origin, who
mature earlier than babies of Chinese origin, according to medical
papers Papiernik showed The Associated Press.
	   ``Papiernik's research is very innovative and has far-reaching
implications with practical applications,'' said Dr. Greg
Alexander, Chairman of the Dept. of Maternal and Child Health at
the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
	   Alexander, who has written several articles with Papiernik, said
the findings were helping overturn commonly accepted theories of
gestation formed 150 years ago on the basis of Britain's
predominantly Caucasian population.
	   But Mouloud Aounit, a French anti-racism activist, warned that
the material could be exploited outside the scientific community.
	   ``A doctor doesn't have control over how his work is
interpreted,'' Aounit said.

Howell takes big lead after three rounds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes, new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ English golfer David Howell will take a
six-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the Australian PGA
Championship at the New South Wales course after shooting an
even-par 72 Saturday.
	   Chasing his first win as a pro, the 23-year-old Howell has a
three-round total of 9-under-par 207 after starting the day with a
two-stroke lead.
	   His nearest challengers are Australia's Terry Price, who dropped
away with a score of 76 Saturday to be three under and tied for
second with countryman Rob Willis, who stormed into contention with
a 69.
	   The only other player under par is Trinidad's Stephen Ames at
two under after a 73.
	   Howell said he wasn't concerned about blowing a big lead.
	   ``Sure, six, seven and eight shot leads have probably been blown
before but I'd rather be six ahead than six behind,'' Howell said.
	   Having finished his third season on the European tour in 32nd
place on the money list, Howell has solid form to back his
confidence.
	   Howell, from Swindon, was not thrilled with his round Saturday,
having got through the fierce winds of the first two days with just
one bogey, only to struggle a bit in far more benign conditions.
	   But he rallied well from the scare of a bogey at the sixth and
double at the par-4 seventh where he took four shots to reach the
green after driving into rough.
	   ``If I can shoot three or four under someone will have to do
something spectacular to beat me and if I shoot one or two under
I'll be in with a great chance,'' Howell said of a possible victory
Sunday. (djp)

After narrowly avoiding airstrikes, Iraq balking at document

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Baghdad has balked at turning over
sensitive documents to U.N. weapons inspectors less than a week
after Iraq's pledge to cooperate narrowly averted American
airstrikes.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, told chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler on Friday that many of the
documents Butler requested this week were destroyed, never existed
or already had been turned over. Al-Qaisi also placed conditions on
viewing a particularly contentious Iraqi air force document.
	   The United States maintains the Iraqi letters are insufficient
responses to Butler's requests and said Baghdad needs to provide
more information about its weapons program. However, U.S. President
Bill Clinton responded cautiously today when asked about Iraqi
reluctance.
	   ``I think it's important we not overreact here on the first
day,'' he said at a news conference during his visit to Seoul,
South Korea. ``I want to make sure that I know exactly what the
facts are.''
	   The dispute over the documents was the first glitch between Iraq
and the U.N. Special Commission that oversees disarmament efforts
since Nov. 14 _ when Baghdad announced it would reverse its Oct. 31
decision to halt cooperation with the weapons experts.
	   The announcement staved off what U.S. officials have said were
imminent U.S. airstrikes.
	   Based on Iraq's weekend pledge, Butler sent Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz three letters this week asking for documents
about its missiles and its chemical and biological weapons
programs.
	   Inspectors must certify that those weapons have been destroyed
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Persian Gulf
war.
	   In particular, Butler asked for an air force diary, which
inspectors discovered during a July search but were prevented from
taking, that detailed munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   In his letter Friday, al-Qaisi said the document was beyond the
scope of the inspectors' mandate. Nevertheless, he wrote, U.N.
experts could view ``relevant portions'' of it in the presence of
the U.N. envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah.
	   Butler's request to view other archives from the Defense
Ministry ``seems to be provocative rather than professional,''
al-Qaisi wrote.
	   Clinton said in Seoul that if Baghdad believes the materials
have nothing to do with matters covered by U.N. resolutions ``we
should immediately resolve it. ...But if they want the sanctions
lifted because they've complied with all the U.N. resolutions on
weapons, they have to give the information on the documents.''
	   In a letter to the council Friday night, Butler said the air
force document was directly related to the Special Commission's
mandate because it dealt with Iraq's use of bombs and rockets
filled with chemical agents.
	   He noted that the council already has demanded Iraq deliver the
contentious document to the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
	   Butler said he also was concerned with Iraq's responses to his
request for documents about its biological weapons program.
Inspectors consistently have said Baghdad's declarations about the
program are far from complete.
	   Iraq's deputy U.N. ambassador, Saeed Hasan, said Iraq remains
committed to cooperating with UNSCOM.
	   ``What they want is full submission, and they will never, never
get it,'' he said. ``Full cooperation is different than full
submission.''
	   In related events Friday:
	   _U.N. weapons teams carried out field inspections on the Muslim
Sabbath, previously a day off. But Caroline Cross, UNSCOM
spokeswoman, said teams will be working seven days a week.
	   _Baghdad asked to extend for only two months the U.N. program
that lets it sell oil to buy food and medicine. U.N. officials had
requested the oil-for-food program be prolonged for another six
months, as usual.
	   Though it relies on the program to keep food on its citizens'
tables, Iraq routinely has criticized the program as easing the
pressure on the international community to maintain the sanctions.

Division leaders try to extend leads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Three division leaders play their nearest
competitors Sunday with a chance to solidify their holds on first
place.
	   Green Bay (7-3), two games behind first-place Minnesota in the
NFC Central gets a chance to cut into the Vikings' lead in the
NFL's top game this weekend. Green Bay had lost five straight in
the Metrodome before breaking that streak last year.
	   Denver could become the first team since the 1991 Redskins to go
11-0 if it beats visiting Oakland (7-3). A Broncos victory would
just about put away the AFC West title and could clinch the
playoffs with one of following scenarios: a Pittsburgh loss; Miami
and Tennessee losses; or Buffalo, Miami and New York Jets losses.
	   Jacksonville (8-2) travels to Pittsburgh, a place they have
never won in, with a chance to move three games ahead of the
Steelers with five games left.
	   In other Sunday games it is the New York Jets at Tennessee,
Seattle at Dallas, New Orleans at San Francisco, Kansas City at San
Diego, Arizona at Washington, Chicago at Atlanta, Detroit at Tampa
Bay, Indianapolis at Buffalo, Philadelphia at New York Giants,
Carolina at St. Louis and Baltimore at Cincinnati.
	   Miami plays at New England Monday night.
	   The Packers have not forgotten their first meeting with the
Vikings, when Minnesota whipped them 37-24 in Green Bay. The
Vikings are surprisingly the team that wants to forget it.
	   ``I ain't talking about Green Bay,'' defensive lineman John
Randle huffed over and over again.
	   The Packers, who were humiliated by Randall Cunningham, Cris
Carter and Randy Moss that soggy Monday night, seemed to find
cathartic properties in rehashing the shocking loss.
	   ``It was embarrassing and shameful and all those other things,''
said defensive tackle Santana Dotson.
	   If Green Bay doesn't win the rematch, their three-year reign as
NFC Central champs could come to an early end.
	   ``Do or die? It's a really big game,'' said rookie defensive end
Vonnie Holliday. ``Two losses to this team is going to put us in a
bad predicament.''
	   Denver hasn't lost to anyone this season and is seeking its 22nd
consecutive regular-season win at home.
	   John Elway, expected to play after missing his last two starts
with a rib injury, needs to throw for just 30 yards to reach 50,000
yards for his career, joining Miami's Dan Marino as the only
quarterbacks in NFL history to reach that level.
	   ``I don't know if John is 100 percent, but he really practiced
well,'' coach Mike Shanahan said Friday. ``I don't know if he had
any more pain today. Hopefully, he keeps on progressing like he
has, and he'll be ready for game time. Right now, I anticipate him
playing unless there's a setback.''
	   Since losing to the Broncos when Bubby Brister relieved an
injured Elway and engineered a 34-17 comeback win on Sept. 20, the
Raiders have won six of seven, capped by last week's 20-17 victory
over Seattle.
	   ``What we're trying to establish here is a team that plays 60
minutes of hard football,'' Gruden said. ``We're not judging our
team on what happened around here in the great years or in the last
few years when they haven't realized their expectations.''
	   Pittsburgh always expects to win the AFC Central. So despite
trailing Jacksonville by two games, the Steelers are talking like
they are still in the lead.
	   ``I respect those guys, but I don't respect them THAT much,''
Steelers linebacker Levon Kirkland said. ``They're not a super
franchise.''
	   ``We still feel like we have the advantage here,'' free safety
Darren Perry said. ``We still control our own destiny.''
	   Only if they win. A Steelers victory moves them within a game of
Jacksonville with five to play and keeps alive the possibility
their Dec. 28 rematch in Jacksonville might decide the division
title.
	   But a Jaguars win would all but guarantee Jacksonville the
division title, unless Tennessee wins its remaining games, and
would effectively force Pittsburgh to seek a wild card.
	   ``This is an opportunity for us to separate ourselves a little
bit more,'' Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell said.

Maier's wipeout paves way for Eberharter to win giant slalom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs
 &UR; By GREG BEACHAM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Between the two runs of giant slalom,
Stefan Eberharter was seized by back pain so strong he found it
difficult to bend over.
	   But it didn't stop him. After a half-decade away from the skiing
limelight and his rebirth on the World Cup circuit last season,
Eberharter has come much too far to quit now.
	   And after finishing his second run in 2 minutes,14.75 seconds,
he watched leader Hermann Maier crash early in his run and hand
Eberharter his second GS win in the last three races.
	   ``After many years in a very big hole, it's great to be out in
the sunshine,'' he said. ``It was very tough the last few years,
but last year and this year, everything paid off.''
	   In the early 1990s, Eberharter was a rising star on the dominant
Austrian national team. He won two world championships and seemed
poised for stardom, but in 1993 he abruptly dropped off the skiing
map with a string of mediocre performances.
	   His confidence was soon shot, and he was dropped from the
Austrian team. In 1997, he was reduced to skiing in the Europa Cup,
the minor leagues of ski racing.
	   But after winning the Europa Cup, he made a triumphant return to
the World Cup circuit last year, collecting his first win, five
top-three finishes and a silver medal at the Nagano Olympics.
	   On Friday, it was Eberharter's strong, steady skiing that
overcame the mercurial brilliance of Maier, the GS world champion
who led the field by .35 seconds entering the second run.
	   ``I say it all the time: He's not unbeatable,'' Eberharter said.
``Today I had the better hand.''
	   When Maier reached the bottom of the course, he slammed down his
skis and poles, stepped over a security fence and charged through
the crowd, surprising dozens of fans who hadn't expected to see
their hero up close.
	   Another Austrian veteran, Christian Mayer, finished second in
2:15.27. Mayer's girlfriend recently gave birth to a son, and Mayer
credited young Dennis with providing much of his motivation.
	   ``I had much better concentration and focus in the second run
than the first run,'' Mayer said. ``I worked hard for this, so it's
nice to see such a good start to my season.''
	   In third was Liechtenstein's Marco Buechel, who skied two strong
runs to stand on his first podium.
	   ``Today is the best day I've ever had in skiing,'' Buechel said.
``I'm not the finest technical skier on the World Cup circuit, but
I hope to be fast.''
	   It was the second big result in as many days for the tiny,
landlocked European country. Birgit Heeb was third in the women's
GS on Thursday.
	   Bode Miller of Franconia, New Hampsire, led a surprising showing
by the American team, which landed three racers in the top 30
finishers for the first time in the 1990s. Miller finished eighth,
the best mark by an American since 1991.

Iranians resume pilgrimages to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran is allowing its nationals to resume
pilgrimages to holy Muslim sites in neighboring Iraq after a
week-long suspension due to the possibility of U.S. military
strikes there, the daily Zan newspaper reported Saturday.
	   It quoted Behrouz Karami, governor of the town of Kasr-e-Shirin
on the Iraqi border, as saying the government's decision to allow
the pilgrimages to resume was made on Thursday.
	   Iraq last July agreed to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to visit
its holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in the south of the country.
The cities are home to the most sacred shrines for Iran's
overwhelmingly Shiite Muslims after those in Saudi Arabia.
	   More than 30,000 Iranian pilgrims have traveled to Iraq since
August to visit the shrines, according to Karami.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq every year
until 1980, when war broke out between the two Muslim nations. The
war ended eight years later, but visa restrictions introduced
during the fighting remain in force.

	   In Anaheim, California, Andrei Kovalenko scored his second goal
of the game 39 seconds into overtime as the Edmonton Oilers beat
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
	   Paul Kariya earned his 300th NHL point with an assist on Antti
Aalto's first career goal and then scored with 6:11 left in the
third period to help the Ducks tie the score for the second time.
	   Winning goaltender Mikhail Shtalenkov made 19 saves in his first
game against his former teammates.
	   The Oilers ended Anaheim's three-game winning streak.
 &UR; Coyotes 2, Sharks 1 (OT)
	   In San Jose, California, Dallas Drake scored 37 seconds into
overtime, lifting the Phoenix Coyotes past the San Jose Sharks to
extend their unbeaten streak to an NHL-leading 10 games.
	   The Coyotes also set an NHL post-expansion record by holding an
opponent to two goals or less for the 13th straight game. Only
Ottawa, a 4-1 winner over Phoenix in the season opener, has scored
more than two goals against the Coyotes this year.
	   San Jose outshot Phoenix 7-2 in the third period and had a
chance to settle the game when Bernie Nicholls got off a clean shot
from up close with 28 seconds left, but goaltender Nikolai
Khabibulin made a nifty save to force overtime.

Doctors dismayed officials not mentioned in corruption report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Rural doctors whose complaints sparked
a scandal over government corruption in medical supplies purchases
have expressed dismay that an anti-corruption probe did not
implicate any Cabinet officials.
	   The heads of a leading farmer's lobby were cited in Thai media
reports Saturday as saying they would discuss circulating a
petition to obtain the 50,000 signatures needed to bring the
scandal before the Thai Senate.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was expected to review the report
from a Counter-Corruption Commission, the body which investigated
the worst scandal to hit his government since coming to office in
November 1997.
	   It has already forced the resignation of Health Minister Rakkiat
Sukthana, a member of a minor party in Chuan's coalition, but the
commission's report did not blame him or other any other ministers.
	   The report did find that at least one politician, a member of
the same party as Rakkiat, colluded with high-ranking health
officials to coerce government hospitals to buy supplies at
inflated prices from specified firms. Kickbacks were allegedly made
with the surplus money.
	   Commission officials have refused to name the politician or the
two highest-ranking ministry officials who were implicated. Their
fate will be left to Prime Minister Chuan's discretion.
	   The Rural Doctors Society has demanded that those responsible
for the scandal be prosecuted, despite several attempts by others
to sidetrack the investigation.

Waugh and Healy put Australia in control at the Gabba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia rallied around centuries by
Steve Waugh (112) and Ian Healy (134) and a sprightly unbeaten
half-century by Damien Fleming to take control of the first Ashes
cricket test Saturday against England.
	   After some strong lower-order batting had propped Australia to
485 all out at the Gabba, fast bowler Glenn McGrath removed opener
Mike Atherton for naught to have England on 53 for one at stumps on
the second day.
	   England's first task at hand will be to score 286 runs to avoid
the follow on.
	   Mark Butcher, who had managed nine runs in his previous five
first-class innings on tour, and the in-form Nasser Hussain were
unbeaten on 23 runs apiece.
	   McGrath lived up to his pre-match promise and removed Atherton
in his third over. Playing half forward to a full length delivery,
Atherton edged a catch to Mark Waugh at second slip.
	   It was the 10th time McGrath has dismissed Atherton in eight
tests.
	   Waugh and Healy made full use of wayward bowling, fielding
lapses and good fortune to resurrect a sagging Australian innings
that had dipped to 106 for four and 178 for five on the first day.
	   With the discipline and the line and length that highlighted
England's effort on the first day lacking, the overnight pair of
Waugh and Healy condemned the visitors in what could a
match-winning 187-run stand in almost six hours.
	   After Waugh's dismissal soon after lunch, the tail wagged
frustratingly as the last three wickets contributed 125 runs to
pile the misery on the England attack.
	   Australia, resuming the day on 246 for five, went from strength
to strength as the two senior batsmen, both playing their 107th
tests, hammered centuries.
	   Both batsmen, aided by dropped catches on the first evening,
deftly caned the four-pronged pace attack to take Australia to 348
for five at lunch.
	   Local hero Healy dominated the stand with his third test century
and the second against England. Healy took charge after Waugh was
smartly caught behind off a hard-working Allan Mullally.
	   Mullally, playing his first test in 22 months for England since
playing against New Zealand in Auckland in January 1997, returned a
career-best 5-105 in his 10th test.
	   The left-arm seamer gave England a long-awaited breakthrough
when he slanted a delivery across Waugh, who duly edged it to
wicketkeeper Alec Stewart in the sixth over after lunch.
	   Waugh's 16th test century lasted 30 minutes over five hours and
included 13 boundaries off 232 balls.
	   Healy rode his luck for his second century against England.
Dropped on 36, Healy played on to Darren Gough on 62, but the ball
failed to dislodge a bail, compounding England's agony on the
second morning.
	   Fleming, 71 not out, took liking to some half-hearted England
bowling.
	   He smashed 11 boundaries in showing scant respect to the
opposition, added 55 runs for the eighth wicket with Healy, and in
the company of Stuart MacGill (25) and McGrath (five), another 25
and 45 runs for the last two wickets.
	   Fleming lasted for 133 minutes and faced 108 balls.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Rural doctors whose complaints sparked
a scandal over government corruption in medical supplies purchases
have expressed dismay that an anti-corruption probe did not
implicate any Cabinet officials.
	   The heads of a leading doctor's lobby were cited in Thai media
reports Saturday as saying they would discuss circulating a
petition to obtain the 50,000 signatures needed to bring the
scandal before the Thai Senate.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was expected to review the report
from a Counter-Corruption Commission, the body which investigated
the worst scandal to hit his government since coming to office in
November 1997.
	   It has already forced the resignation of Health Minister Rakkiat
Sukthana, a member of a minor party in Chuan's coalition, but the
commission's report did not blame him or other any other ministers.
	   The report did find that at least one politician, a member of
the same party as Rakkiat, colluded with high-ranking health
officials to coerce government hospitals to buy supplies at
inflated prices from specified firms. Kickbacks were allegedly made
with the surplus money.
	   Commission officials have refused to name the politician or the
two highest-ranking ministry officials who were implicated. Their
fate will be left to Prime Minister Chuan's discretion.
	   The Rural Doctors Society has demanded that those responsible
for the scandal be prosecuted, despite several attempts by others
to sidetrack the investigation.

Interior minister heads investigation into slaying of lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin flew to St. Petersburg Saturday to personally head the
investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, a prominent
member of parliament.
	   Starovoitova was attacked in the entry way of her apartment
building Friday night, police said. An aide, Ruslan Linkov was
wounded in the attack.
	   They were going up the stairs of the apartment house when two
assailants opened fire, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Saturday,
quoting police reports. Starovoitova died immediately, the agency
said. Linkov was reported to be in critical condition from gunshot
wounds to the head.
	   A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at
the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Police would not speculate on a motive for the attack.
	   President Boris Yeltsin ordered the country's top law
enforcement officials, including Stepashin, Federal Security
Service chief Vladimir Putin and Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov
to take urgent measures to solve the crime.
	   Stepashin, told by Yeltsin to take personal charge of the
investigation, said he hoped for a quick solution to the killing.
	   ``I brought with me a team of experienced investigators,'' he
told reporters at St. Petersburg's airport. ``I think we will clear
it up soon.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, a member of the reformist Democratic Russia
party, tried to run for president in 1996 but her registration was
rejected for technical reasons. She planned to run again in 2000.
	   She served as Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the
only woman in his immediate circle _ and was on the human rights
committee of the former Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, Starovoitova was in St.
Petersburg to attend a session of the Northern Capital political
movement Saturday.
	   Starovoitova earned a reputation as one of the most outspoken
reform supporters in the Russian parliament, where she frequently
sparred with hard-liners, including ultranationalist Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.
	   In 1990 she won an unprecedented libel suit against Pravda when
the former official Soviet newspaper published a story accusing her
of calling for the forcible elimination of the government.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official's car was bombed last week
and a top banker was killed last week, and police attributed both
attacks to business deals. An aide to Russia's parliament speaker
was shot in the head last month in what police suspect was a
contract hit.
	   Contract killings are often used to settle business disputes in
Russia, and such hits have become increasingly widespread in recent
years.

U.N. weapons teams back into field, new dispute develops

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual
Saturday as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents
related to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons.
	   At least four cars with inspectors pulled out of U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad on the fourth consecutive day of field work
since the teams returned from Bahrain, where they were evacuated
after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections, would say only that ``We are
carrying on with our activities.''
	   UNSCOM is not making public how many teams are working each day
or where they are going.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the UNSCOM teams, has said they visited more than 23 sites in and
out of Baghdad during inspections from Wednesday through Friday.
	   The disagreement over documents, however, threatened to undo the
uneasy truce reached just a week ago, when Iraq pledged to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles. Its partner agency, the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency, oversees the destruction of
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq in August began curtailing the work of the inspectors, and
on Oct. 31 halted all UNSCOM work. After the United States and
Britain threatened military action, Baghdad on Nov. 14 backed down
and said it would resume cooperation.
	   But on Friday, U.N. officials in New York said Iraq was
objecting to three letters from UNSCOM chief Richard Butler asking
for access to documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, told Butler in
a letter that his request ``seems to be provocative rather than
professional,''
	   When asked about the latest dispute, President Clinton gave a
cautious response. Speaking Saturday at a news conference in Seoul,
South Korea, he said: ``I think It's important that we not over
react here on the first day. I want to make sure that I know
exactly what the facts are.''
	   He said he would be ``extensively briefed'' later by his
advisers on the issue, which he described as ``quite important.''
	   Among other documents, Butler reportedly is seeking an Iraqi air
force diary, which inspectors discovered during a July search but
were prevented from taking, that details munitions destroyed during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Al-Qaisi repeated Iraq's earlier position on the document,
saying that U.N. weapons experts could view ``relevant portions''
of it in the presence of Prakash Shah, the envoy to Iraq of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM in hopes of
speeding up a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the U.N.
Security Council of its compliance so far on U.N. disarmament
resolutions.
	   It wants that review to lead to an easing or lifting of the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the council after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The United States has said, however, that action on the
sanctions will not automatically follow the review.
	   Iraqi newspapers did not report the latest glitch.
	   Instead, the state-run Al-Jumhuriya slammed efforts by the
Clinton administration _ with British backing _ to support Iraqi
opposition groups intent on overthrowing President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Senior American and British officials have unveiled their
policy of conspiracy and revenge against Iraq ... and their
disregard for international law,'' the newspaper said.
	   It accused Washington and London of ``threatening terrorism
against Iraq'' and said that U.S. objections to easing or lifting
the embargo ``will lead to a systematic and slow process of killing
the Iraqi people.''
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
bar most financial dealings _ have seriously damaged Iraq's
once-rich economy.

Will a church bell found in Anzio's rubble journey home again?

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ In the 1944 novel ``A Bell for
Adano,'' John Hersey portrayed the anguish of Italian villagers
whose town bell was stolen by fascists just before liberating U.S.
troops show up.
	   That same year, during a protracted Allied offensive near Rome,
U.S. Army Sgt. Herbert Roth was roving through the Mediterranean
village of Anzio when he glimpsed a bronze bell protruding from the
rubble of a church.
	   Just 9 inches (23 centimeters) tall and 5 inches (13
centimeters) in diameter, it hardly rivaled the beloved treasure
depicted in Hersey's Pulitzer Prize-winning tale. Roth packed it in
his jeep and took it home as a memento of the war.
	   ``To me, the bell had a lot of meaning,'' said Roth, 84,
invoking the names of a string of comrades who were among nearly
50,000 soldiers killed at Anzio in one of the most ferocious
encounters of World War II.
	   Now, 54 years later, a museum in Anzio has somehow learned of
the whereabouts of the bell that had been used for maybe half a
century to call people into Mass at Saints Pio and Antonio Church.
	   It is ``our wish that the bell be returned,'' museum custodian
Amerigo Salvini said in a recent letter inviting Roth to attend
next year's 55th anniversary commemoration of the Anzio battle.
	   Roth, who is too ill for the trip, said Friday he would be
inclined to give the bell back. But there's one snag. He no longer
owns it.
	   After keeping it on a shelf at home for 53 years, he donated the
bell last fall to the newly-opened Italian American Community
Center in Gates, a Rochester suburb.
	   Weakened by two open-heart surgeries, Roth said he had long been
anxious to find a spot where his artifact would be properly
appreciated.
	   ``I'm in accord with what the community center feels _ no way
would I ever cross them after they treated me so well,'' said Roth,
who was honored with a lifelong membership.
	   The community center doesn't want to make any hasty decisions.
Its president, Bernie Iacovangelo, said the Anzio Beach Museum
seems happy with his idea of displaying the bell there for three
months, then accepting a life-size replica.
	   The real bell, however, might even end up permanently again in
Anzio, with the replica adorning the community center, he
suggested.
	   The museum in the seaside resort 38 miles (61.15 kilometers)
south of Rome says the bell carries historical as well as
sentimental value. On its side is the protruding figure of a lion's
head, a papal symbol marking the church's founding around 1850,
Iacovangelo said.
	   During the invasion of Italy, the Allies ran into tough German
defenses at Anzio in early 1944 and didn't break through until May.
	   They were bombarded by a mighty Nazi artillery gun nicknamed
``Anzio Annie'' that was rolled out of a cave each night atop a
rail car. Shells from the gun destroyed the church, which was
rebuilt after the war.
	   ``Every night we feared for our lives when 'Anzio Annie' came
out and started blasting,'' said Roth, who also fought in the North
African desert campaign and at the Battle of the Bulge and somehow
escaped unscathed.
	   ``Only God looked after me,'' he said pensively. ``I saw plenty
of war. I saw so much of it.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Marking his first six months in power,
Indonesian President B.J Habibie on Saturday promised to push ahead
with planned political reforms despite continued opposition from
student demonstrators.
	   Also Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said while visiting
South Korea that he hoped ``there will be no backsliding'' on human
rights by the new Indonesian government. His remarks came a week
after bloody street clashes in Indonesia's capital city left up to
16 people dead.
	   A sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people, Indonesia
has been enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades.
	   President Habibie met with a delegation from the ruling Golkar
party's youth wing on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets
near the home of ex-President Suharto.
	   ``The government will consistently carry out all the decrees of
the recent special session (of Parliament) as demanded by the
people,'' Habibie was quoted as saying by delegation secretary
Kaharudin Syah after the meeting.
	   The nation's highest legislative body, the People's Consultative
Assembly, approved the decrees on Nov. 13 in a session marred by
the violence on the streets outside the assembly building.
	   Human rights groups say up to 16 people died on Nov. 13-14, when
soldiers opened fire on demonstrators. Police say 13 people died.
Hundreds were injured.
	   Habibie has pledged to dismantle the authoritarian system set up
by his predecessor and former mentor, Suharto. Chief among the
promised reforms is a plan to hold an election next year, most
likely in May or June.
	   But students suspect the legislative chamber, which is filled
with holdovers from Suharto's authoritarian era, wants to stall
democratic reform.
	   The assembly ignored student demands that Suharto by put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses and decided to reduce
the military's influence in politics, rather than ban it
altogether.
	   Discontent over inflation and joblessness helped spark bloody
riots in May which forced out former authoritarian leader Suharto
after 32 years in power and in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   At a press conference in Seoul, Clinton said there had been both
troubling and hopeful signs coming from Indonesia in recent months.
	   ``The United States very much hopes there will be no backsliding
as we come up with an election season in Indonesia and that every
effort will be made to minimize any harm to people who are
exercising their voices to make their political views heard,'' he
said.
	   Meanwhile, about 200 students staged a protest near Suharto's
residence in a posh suburb of Jakarta where he has lived as a
virtual recluse since he quit.
	   The students, who called for armed forces chief Wiranto to
resign and for Suharto to be put on trial, were blocked by riot
police. Coincidentally, they were stopped in front of the U.S.
Ambassador's residence.
	   About 300 students placed flowers on the street outside Atma
Jaya University, where the worst of the violence occurred last
week.
	   Habibie, Wiranto and other ministers met university deans on
Saturday at the presidential palace.
	   Doctors confirmed Friday that metal bullet fragments were found
in the bodies of some protesters who were killed. Officials say
security forces were ordered to fire only blank ammunition or
plastic bullets.
	   Habibie has accused some opposition activists of orchestrating
the protests in an attempt to overthrow his government.
	   Police have formally charged 10 with sedition. Those charged
have denied the allegations against them.

with players and owners making several compromises during the
longest negotiation session of the 143-day lockout.
	   ``I would say there has been some movement from both sides,''
commissioner David Stern said after about 9 1/2 hours of meetings
ended shortly before 0400 GMT Saturday morning. ``I think it's fair
to say that there's an evident spirit of an attempt to reach
(agreement) on both sides.''
	   The sides will not meet again during the weekend, and no firm
date was set for resuming discussions next week. But both sides
agreed a resumption should be expected before November 26.
	   ``You reach a point in negotiations when you have to take a
breather, and we both felt that we kind of reached that point,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We all want to have turkey
with our families if we can, but other than that we realize that
making the deal as soon as we can is more important than any other
obligations we have.''
	   Stern tempered his enthusiasm by pointing out that the sides
remain far apart on many issues, but his comments were both
surprisingly optimistic and clearly indicative there was real
progress in trying to settle the most damaging labor dispute in
league history.
	   In a lockout, owner of teams prevent the players from playing
until a labor agreement is reached. While lockouts have happened
before in the National Basketball Association, it is the first time
one has prevented the start of the regular basketball season.
	   So far, the first month and a half of the season has been
canceled, and an agreement would need to be reached in the next
week or so in order to start before Christmas.
	   Such a scenario seemed highly unlikely when the sides arrived
spouting pessimism in the morning, but as the clock neared midnight
it no longer seemed as far-fetched.
	   ``We reached a position where neither side was prepared to make
any further movement, so we though it was a good time to stop,''
union director Billy Hunter said. ``When you've been in a hotel for
12 or 14 hours, the air gets stale and your head gets cloudy.''
	   Sources involved in the talks, speaking on the condition they
not be identified, told The Associated Press each side had moved
about a couple points off its desired salary percentages. The
owners had been demanding 50 percent, while the players wanted 60.
	   If the percentage of revenues devoted to salaries failed to drop
below an agreed-upon level _ and what that level would be is one of
the biggest points of contention _ most players would contribute up
to 10 percent of their salaries into an escrow fund, with the money
going back to the owners if the designated percentage was exceeded.

Mayfield wins pole position for season-ending NASCAR race

<TEXT>
	   MOTEGI, Japan (AP) _ Jeremy Mayfield outraced rising star Jeff
Gordon Saturday to set a track record and win the pole position for
the dlrs 1 million NASCAR Thunder Special Coca-Cola 500, a
season-ending exhibition race in Japan.
	   Mayfield, ranked seventh on the Winston Cup driver standings of
the year, posted the fastest qualifying lap of 35.116 seconds, or
158.799 mph, at the 1.5-mile Twin Ring Motegi in a Mobil 1 Ford. He
also was fastest at 35.692 seconds, the old record, in Friday's
practice session.
	   It will be the second pole start this year for the 29-year-old
Mayfield, of Owensboro, Kentucky, who last won the Pocono 500 at
Brooklyn, Michigan, in June.
	   Gordon, at age 27 the youngest driver ever to win three Winston
Cup championships, had the second-fastest lap with a time of 35.122
seconds, or 158.772 mph, in a DuPond Automotive Finishes Chevrolet.
	   The resident of Pittsboro, Indiana, has tied Richard Petty's
modern-era record of 13 victories in a season. The record had stood
for more than two decades.
	   In the race scheduled for Sunday, which offers a top prize of
dlrs 105,000, no championship points will be awarded.
	   Third-fastest at 35.162 seconds, or 158,592 mph, was Mike
Skinner, winner of the event last year at the 1.54-mile Suzuka
Circuitland. He drove a Lowe's Home Improvement Chevrolet.
	   The exhibition race this year is the third and final in a
three-year contract the NASCAR has with the Japanese to promote the
race worldwide.
	   Japanese auto racing officials said negotiations were underway
at Motegi for the Winston Cup West to stage a championship series
event in Japan starting from next season.
	   ``Yeah, we've had a great year,'' said Gordon, who almost won
his eighth pole of the year and is seeking a 14th win. ``There's
just no word to describe a year like we had.
	   ``Second today is great. I didn't think we had a shot at the top
three to be sitting here. A second is just great. I just wish that
Jeremy would've beaten me by a little bit more ... not to hurt my
feeling.''
	   ``We sure are happy to come around and see No. 12 (his car
number) on top of No. 24 for a change,'' said a jubilant Mayfield.
He added that he hopes to be ahead of Gordon in the race Sunday.
``I know it's not so easy. But that's what we are thinking any
way.''
	   ``So far, there only have been two winners in Japan,'' said
Skinner, of Susanville, California. ``I like to win here. It would
be pretty neat.''
	   Skinner was the Winston Cup's 40-year-old rookie of the year
when he drove to his first victory in high-level competition at
Suzuka last year. At that time, he started in the fourth spot and
made a late charge to the front in his Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
	   Winston Cup 1997 champion Jeff Gordon missed the Suzuka race
after he underwent surgery on his vocal chords.
	   In the first-ever NASCAR race in Japan _ also at Suzuka _ in
1996, Rusty Wallace was the winner. In the race last year, he
dropped out on the ninth lap after his Ford Thunderbird developed
engine trouble.
	   On Saturday, Wallace was eighth at 35.503 seconds, or 157.068
mph.

Indonesia's Habibie launches corruption inquiry of former leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with Habibie decision to set up
probe.

 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from former strongman Suharto, Indonesia's current head of state,
B.J. Habibie, launched a commission of inquiry on Saturday into
corruption allegations against his predecessor and one time mentor.
	   The probe into former President Suharto's wealth appears to be a
major concession to students who have fought bloody street battles
with the military, demanding that Suharto be tried for illegally
enriching himself and his family during 32 years as leader of the
Southeast Asian nation.
	   About 200 students staged a protest near Suharto's residence
Saturday, where the ex-president has lived as a virtual recluse
since quitting amid riots and protests on May 21.
	   Speaking on behalf of President Habibie, State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung told reporters the commission would ``examine and
investigate the wealth of former President Suharto.''
	   Members of the commission have not yet been appointed. However,
they would have ``credibility and high integrity within the nation
and state,'' Akbar said.
	   Akbar said Habibie made the decision after a four-hour meeting
with seven Cabinet ministers, including armed forces commander Gen.
Wiranto.
	   Critics and opponents of Suharto say he plundered the wealth of
Indonesia over three decades. They say his six children and a small
group of cronies built huge business empires under his patronage.
They also accuse him of stashing a fortune away in overseas bank
accounts.
	   Suharto, who was forced to quit on May 21 after a wave of riots
and protests, has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption
during his three-decade rule.
	   An inquiry by Indonesia's attorney general launched several
months ago has failed to identify any wrongdoing by Suharto.
	   Opponents have branded that inquiry as a whitewash and have
accused the Habibie government of trying to protect the former
autocrat.
	   Also Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said during a visit
to South Korea that he hoped ``there will be no backsliding'' on
human rights by the new Indonesian government, a week after bloody
street clashes between student demonstrators and the military left
up to 16 people dead.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Seoul, Clinton said there had
been both troubling and hopeful signs coming from Indonesia in
recent months.
	   ``The United States very much hopes there will be no backsliding
as we come up with an election season in Indonesia and that every
effort will be made to minimize any harm to people who are
exercising their voices to make their political views heard,'' he

have denied the allegations.

Clinton, Kim demand answers on suspected nuclear site

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South
Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a
suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders
not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news
conference, pledged to ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S.
endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full
access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility
and said the North must not develop missiles.
	   On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a
roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their
prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track.
Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia
trip that began in Japan.
	   Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not
yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in
North Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing
the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the
site.
	   On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a
roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their
prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track.
Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia
trip that began in Japan.
	   Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not
yet certain that the underground construction project in North
Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing the
door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the site.
	   ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton said at a joint news
conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential mansion
overlooking the capital. ``We need access to it.''
	   The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's
decades-long hostility toward the South is a 1994 ``agreed
framework'' in which the North halted its nuclear weapons program
in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern nuclear energy
sources there. That deal would be shattered if the suspect site
turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project.
	   Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of
engaging North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, was firm in
saying his government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue.
	   In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital,
U.S. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious
site, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret
effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program.
	   ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature
and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. ``If it is,
in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand
immediate close down.'' He also said the North must limit its
missile development, citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the
North Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31.
	   U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands of workers digging a
massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman on Friday
retracted an assessment he made Thursday that there was
``compelling evidence'' that North Korea is building an underground
nuclear facility.
	   In a statement distributed by the U.S. embassy here today,
Kartman said instead, ``There is strong information that makes us
suspicious, but we lack conclusive evidence that the intended
purpose of the underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what
type of nuclear facility it might be.''
	   Kim said his government would support U.S. efforts to resolve
the nuclear question. The North Koreans have denied the underground
construction site has any nuclear purpose, and have proposed a dlrs
300 million payment for allowing inspections. Clinton rejected the
idea of compensation.
	   Directing his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the
significance of a new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans
to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a
sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean War enemy.
	   ``Nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, given
our defense partnership here, that would give the North Koreans as
much advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness,
as more of those ships going up there full of people from here,''
Clinton said.
	   In his meeting with Korean community and business leaders at
Seoul's National Folklore Museum, Clinton praised South Korea's
progress in recovering from its financial crisis.
	   On a darker note, he mentioned recent tensions over Asian steel
exports to the United States, which have skyrocketed this year at
great cost to the domestic U.S. steelmakers. Japanese steel is the
biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports also are on the
rise.
	   Clinton said the U.S. economy could tolerate increased imports _
if they are not concentrated in just a few industries, and if the
result is that the Asian economies begin to recover.
	   ``We have to be sensitive if the price of doing that is to
basically erase'' an entire sector of the U.S. economy, Clinton
said.

Indonesia's Habibie launches corruption inquiry into Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from former strongman Suharto, Indonesia's current head of state,
B.J. Habibie, Saturday launched a commission of inquiry into
corruption allegations against his predecessor and one time mentor.
	   The probe into Suharto's wealth appears to be a major concession
to protesting students who have fought bloody street battles with
the military.
	   The students have demanded that Suharto, 77, be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during 32 years as
president of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   About 200 students staged a protest near Suharto's residence
Saturday, where the ex-president has lived as a virtual recluse
since quitting amid riots and protests on May 21.
	   Speaking on behalf of President Habibie, State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung told reporters the commission would ``examine and
investigate the wealth of former President Suharto.''
	   Members of the commission have not yet been appointed. However,
they would have ``credibility and high integrity within the nation
and state,'' Akbar said.
	   Akbar said Habibie made the decision after a four-hour meeting
with seven Cabinet ministers, including armed forces commander Gen.
Wiranto.
	   Critics and opponents of Suharto say he plundered the wealth of
Indonesia by allowing his six children and a small group of cronies
to build huge business empires under his patronage. They also
accuse him of stashing a fortune away in overseas bank accounts.
	   Suharto has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption during
his three-decade rule.
	   An investigation by Indonesia's attorney general launched
several months ago has failed to identify any wrongdoing by
Suharto. Opponents have branded that inquiry as a whitewash and
have accused the Habibie government of trying to protect the former
autocrat.
	   Last week, a special government assembly called on Habibie to
include Suharto in a new wide ranging corruption inquiry.
	   Visiting former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who met
with Suharto on Thursday, told reporters on Saturday that the
ex-leader said he would be willing to face any inquiry into his
wealth, estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   Also Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said during a visit
to South Korea that he hoped ``there will be no backsliding'' on
human rights by the new Indonesian government a week after clashes
between student demonstrators and the military left up to 16 people
dead.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Seoul, Clinton said there had
been both troubling and hopeful signs coming from Indonesia in
recent months.
	   ``The United States very much hopes there will be no backsliding
as we come up with an election season in Indonesia and that every
effort will be made to minimize any harm to people who are
exercising their voices to make their political views heard,'' he
said.
	   In Jakarta, Habibie met with a delegation from the ruling Golkar
party's youth wing on Saturday, as about 300 students placed
flowers on the street outside the Atma Jaya University, where the
worst of the violence occurred last week.
	   Habibie, Wiranto and other ministers met university deans on
Saturday at the presidential palace.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark bloody riots in May
which helped force out Suharto and in which 1,200 people were
killed.
	   Doctors confirmed Friday that metal bullet fragments were found
in the bodies of some protesters killed. Officials say security
forces were ordered to fire only blank ammunition or plastic
bullets.
	   Habibie has accused some opposition activists of orchestrating
the protests in an attempt to overthrow his government.
	   Police have formally charged 10 with sedition. Those charged
have denied the allegations against them.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Armed police on Saturday arrested five
members of an ethnic party, hours after the prime minister
suspended civil rights in Sindh province and ordered the army to
curb violence in Karachi, its troubled main city, police said.
	   In an overnight raid, police surrounded a hostel run by the
ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement (MQM) in Karachi's Azizabad
neighborhood and arrested five of its members, including two
lawmakers of the Sindh provincial assembly for keeping illegal
weapons.
	   Police seized five Kalashnikov rifles and three automatic
pistols during the raid, a police official said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Keeping weapons is a non-bailable offense. The accused,
including lawmakers Shoaib Bukhari and Wakil Ahmed Jamali, will be
tried soon by a military court, he said.
	   The raid came just hours after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
ordered the army to help curb violence in the southern province and
set up of military courts in Karachi to try ``terrorists and
criminals'' _ a move the MQM says is targeting only its own ethnic
group.
	   The MQM, a former ally of Sharif, speaks for the political and
economic rights of Urdu speakers who migrated from India at
independence from Britain in 1947 and their descendants.
	   The party, formerly known as the Mohajir Qami Movement, has
controlled the city for more than a decade. More than 1,000 people
have died in political and religious violence in Pakistan's
financial and commercial center.
	   The MQM said police were violent during the raid.
	   ``They (police) barraged into the hostel late in the night and
started beating our people,'' Hasan Musana, a MQM spokesman, told
The Associated Press.
	   Last month Sharif dismissed the elected Sindh provincial
government of which the MQM was a major coalition partner and
instituted direct federal rule in an attempt to stop violence in
Karachi.
	   Sharif has blamed the MQM of most of the bloodletting, and for
the murder of former governor Hakim Said.
	   The MQM denies the charge and blames Sharif for
``state-sponsored violence'' against its members.
	   The MQM is fighting with its splinter faction, the MQM Haqiqi.
Hundreds of people have died in killings between these two groups
in recent months.
	   Human rights groups and opposition parties on Friday criticized
the decision to suspend civil rights and call the army to help the
government.
	   ``It is a mini-martial law. The government has no justification
of taking such a harsh step,'' said Senator Iqbal Haider of the
opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party.
	   But Sharif said the move is in the interest of the city and the
country.
	   ``We want to get Karachi out of this hell,'' he said.
	   He said military courts are needed in Sindh because ``the
terrorists threatened witnesses, judges and their families'' and
have paralyzed the justice system.
	   Sharif said military courts reach decisions much more quickly
than civilian courts, in ``days, not weeks and months.''
	   In civilian courts, the government says criminals easily get
bail. The decision of a military court cannot be challenged in a
civilian court.

 &UR; Arafat, Palestinian Cabinet welcome withdrawal &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ One day after receiving control over
more West Bank land, the Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel to
cease Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank and move ahead
with the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   An Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank went smoothly
Friday, giving the Palestinians control over an additional 2
percent of the territory and upgrading their authority in 7 percent
of the land.
	   Israeli settlers, who opposes the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace
deal with the Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West
Bank hilltops to prevent them from being handed-over in the future.
	   A statement from the Palestinian Cabinet issued early Saturday
morning after an all-night session in the West Bank city of Hebron
said ``settlements would destroy the peace process, stability and
security.''
	   The Cabinet welcomed the first of three Israeli troop pullbacks
but was critical of Israel's handling of a Palestinian prisoner
release.
	   Israel set free 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including 150
criminals. Arafat had demanded freedom for Palestinians who fought
Israeli occupation.
	   ``We hope that the next batch of prisoners will include
political prisoners,'' said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
	   Friday, Palestinian policemen in the village of Qabatieh leaned
out of jeep windows and fired their rifles victoriously into the
air to celebrate their takeover of this West Bank farming town
after Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to Qabatieh greeting the convoy of powder blue jeeps.
	   Arafat told reporters late Friday that the withdrawal had ``gone
well and according to plan.'' The Palestinian leader sent
congratulations to those residents now under his authority. In a
call for unity, Arafat asked that they ``raise the Palestinian
flag.''
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   Friday's pullback from 36 small towns and villages earned praise
for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yet it made his
government more fragile than ever.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   However, support for the agreement signed last month in
Washington is slipping in Netanyahu's hard-line government, and
Israeli media said Friday the prime minister might call early
elections in the spring, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   In the month since the signing of the accord Israel and the
Palestinians have incessantly argued about each others'
obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind schedule
because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.
	   Erekat, usually a tough critic of the Israeli government, said
that the arguments of recent weeks may have brought the two sides
closer.
	   But more needed to be done, he said. ``We have to concentrate
... and have to exert maximum efforts to build the trust required
between us.''
	   The Palestinian Cabinet statement reiterated Palestinian
statehood goals with Jerusalem as its future capital but refrained
from saying it would unilaterally declare a state next May. Israel
opposes Palestinian statehood and held up implementation of the
accord because of such declarations.
	   The withdrawal isolated several Jewish settlements and Israeli
troops began reinforcing them with cement trenches and shooting
positions.
	   In Ganim, a community of 51 families, many were thinking about
leaving. Ilan Amar, 34, had just moved to Ganim with his wife Rikki
and three children three months ago.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Amar, who sells car paint in the Israeli
port city of Haifa.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual
Saturday as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents
related to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons.
	   At least four cars with inspectors pulled out of U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad on the fourth consecutive day of field work
since the teams returned from Bahrain, where they were evacuated
after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections, would say only that ``We are
carrying on with our activities.''
	   UNSCOM is not making public how many teams are working each day
or where they are going.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the UNSCOM teams, has said they visited more than 23 sites in and
out of Baghdad during inspections from Wednesday through Friday.
	   The disagreement over documents, however, threatened to undo the
uneasy truce reached just a week ago, when Iraq pledged to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles. Its partner agency, the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency, oversees the destruction of
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq in August began curtailing the work of the inspectors, and
on Oct. 31 halted all UNSCOM work. After the United States and
Britain threatened military action, Baghdad on Nov. 14 backed down
and said it would resume cooperation.
	   But on Friday, U.N. officials in New York said Iraq was
objecting to three letters from UNSCOM chief Richard Butler asking
for access to documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, told Butler in
a letter that his request ``seems to be provocative rather than
professional,''
	   When asked about the latest dispute, U.S. Bill President Clinton
gave a cautious response. Speaking Saturday at a news conference in
Seoul, South Korea, he said: ``I think It's important that we not
over react here on the first day. I want to make sure that I know
exactly what the facts are.''
	   He said he would be ``extensively briefed'' later by his
advisers on the issue, which he described as ``quite important.''
	   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, speaking to
reporters later in Seoul, gave a stronger response. Asked whether
Washington would take military action if Iraq did not hand over the
documents, he said: ``Clearly in our judgment Iraq has an
obligation to produce the documents that UNSCOM is seeking and we
will support UNSCOM in that effort.
	   ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions
is negative, we obviously are prepared to act.''
	   Among other documents, Butler reportedly is seeking an Iraqi air
force diary, which inspectors discovered during a July search but
were prevented from taking, that details munitions destroyed during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Al-Qaisi repeated Iraq's earlier position on the document,
saying that U.N. weapons experts could view ``relevant portions''
of it in the presence of Prakash Shah, the envoy to Iraq of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM in hopes of
speeding up a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the U.N.
Security Council of its compliance so far on U.N. disarmament
resolutions.
	   It wants that review to lead to an easing or lifting of the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the council after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The United States has said, however, that action on the
sanctions will not automatically follow the review.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
bar most financial dealings _ have seriously damaged Iraq's
once-rich economy.

Kotonishiki secures 13th win for tournament title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sumo-Results

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Kotonishiki, an underdog as the No.
12-ranked maegashira (senior wrestler), clinched the title Saturday
on the 14th day of the 15-day Kyushu tournament.
	   Kotonishiki kept his solitary lead ahead of the pack with just
one loss to 13 wins as he thrust ozeki (champion) Takanonami out of
the ring in his latest match.
	   ``I feel like I'm dreaming,'' Kotonishiki said in a nationally
televised interview after his bout.
	   Kotonishiki, 30, is the first in sumo history to win a
tournament twice as a maegashira. He last won in 1991.
	   Hawaiian-born ozeki Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani,
overpowered yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana (9-5), but ended
up with a 11-3 record, putting the title out of reach.
	   Kotonishiki's only defeat came at the hands of Wakanohana, but
he had a convincing victory against Wakanohana's brother and fellow
yokozuna Takanohana. On Saturday, Kotonishiki said he was careful
to make sure his opponent, Takanonami, couldn't catch hold of him.
	   His victory was assured when, in the bout immediately following
his match with Takanonami, the only other wrestler with a chance
for the title lost to Takanohana. No. 9 Tosanoumi (11-3) was
slapped down by the yokozuna, who also stands at eleven wins to
three losses.
	   ``It's strange to be happy when someone loses, but I felt this
joy surging up within in me,'' Kotonishiki said of his rival's
loss.
	   In other makuuchi action, No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga and
ozeki-hopeful Chiyotaikai faced off in a match which saw Tamakasuga
seize an opportune moment when the sekiwake (junior champion) was
off-guard. The No. 4 maegashira (8-6) forced Chiyotaikai (9-5) out
from behind.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
improved to eight wins to six losses after sweeping down No. 6
maegashira Kotoryu (7-7).
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, Hoshitango (7-7), or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
beat fellow No. 10 ranked Kitazakura (5-9).
	   No. 2 ranked Kyokutenho (6-8), or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
pushed out No. 9 Tokitsunada (8-6).
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 8-ranked Kaishinzan,
or American Henry Armstrong Miller, defeated No. 9 Tochinoyama for
his fourth win against three losses.
	   No. 11 ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, nudged
out Daikiyama at No. 4. Wakaazuma is now 3-4.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, Azumakaze, or
Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, ranked at No. 47, slapped down
No. 51 Takegaki to stand 4-3.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

 &UR; Arafat, Palestinian Cabinet welcome withdrawal &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ One day after receiving control over
more West Bank land, the Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel to
cease Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank and move ahead
with the latest Mideast peace accord.
	   An Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank went smoothly
on Friday, giving the Palestinians control over an additional 2
percent of the territory and upgrading their authority in 7 percent
of the land.
	   Israeli settlers, who opposes the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace
deal with the Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West
Bank hilltops to prevent them from being handed-over in the future.
	   A statement from the Palestinian Cabinet issued early Saturday
morning after an all-night session in the West Bank city of Hebron
said ``settlements would destroy the peace process, stability and
security.''
	   The Cabinet welcomed the first of three Israeli troop pullbacks
but was critical of Israel's handling of a Palestinian prisoner
release.
	   Israel set free 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, including 150
criminals. Arafat had demanded freedom for Palestinians who fought
Israeli occupation.
	   Friday, Palestinian policemen in the village of Qabatieh leaned
out of jeep windows and fired their rifles into the air to
celebrate their takeover of this West Bank farming town after
Israel's troop pullback.
	   ``At last the sun of freedom rises,'' declared a banner at the
entrance to Qabatieh greeting the convoy of powder-blue jeeps.
	   Arafat told reporters late Friday that the withdrawal had ``gone
well and according to plan.'' The Palestinian leader sent
congratulations to those residents now under his authority. In a
call for unity, Arafat asked that they ``raise the Palestinian
flag.''
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 40 percent of the West Bank, or 920 square
miles (2,382 square kilometers). Israel captured the West Bank from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Friday's pullback from 36 small towns and villages earned praise
for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yet it made his
government more fragile than ever.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright applauded the
withdrawal and said it showed that the two sides both want to carry
out their parts in the peace accord signed last month in
Washington.
	   However, support for the agreement signed last month in
Washington is slipping in Netanyahu's hard-line government, and
Israeli media said Friday the prime minister might call early
elections in the spring, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   In the month since the signing of the accord Israel and the
Palestinians have incessantly argued about each others'
obligations, and Friday's pullback was four days behind schedule
because of Israeli delays in ratifying the accord.

Austria takes security precautions after reported terrorist warning
</HEADLINE>
against U.S. facilities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian police have taken all
precautions for the protection of U.S. facilities in Austria after
a reported terrorist warning, a police official said Saturday.
	   The U.S. State Department said Friday that the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna had received credible information concerning the possibility
of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated
facilities in Austria.
	   It noted that a worldwide statement issued last week urged
Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance.
	   However, the police official who did not give his name said that
Austrian police had ``no concrete indications'' of anti-U.S. plans
in Austria.
	   Nevertheless, the street on which the U.S. Embassy is located,
has been permanently closed to traffic since Nov. 19, the official
confirmed. He did not elaborate on other security measures taken
except to refer to ``heightened surveillance'' of the embassy area.

Antlers beat Jubilo in first game of J-League championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NOTE that single name for Jorginho in 3rd graf is correct.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A goal by defender Ichiei Muroi on Saturday gave
the Kashima Antlers a 2-1 win over Jubilo Iwata in the first of two
games for the J-League season championship.
	   Defending champion Jubilo's forward Masashi Nakayama _
J-League's top scorer for the season _ made the first goal on a
penalty kick in the seventh minute of the game.
	   The Antlers, the league's second-stage winners, tied it in the
second half when Kashima's Jorginho sent up a pass to team forward
Atsushi Yanagisawa on the right side of the field.
	   Yanagisawa then kicked the ball in the direction of striker
Yoshiyuki Hasegawa, who headed in a goal to tie the game at 1-1.
	   ``I was responsible for the opening goal by Iwata and was
waiting for a chance to make up for it throughout the game,'' Muroi
told Kyodo News service.
	   Muroi had been called for a handball violation which gave Jubilo
the scoring penalty kick. But he netted the winning goal 20 minutes
into extra time, after a ball kicked by teammate Jorginho was
warded off by goalkeeper Tomoaki Ogami.
	   The Antlers' win at the National Stadium in Tokyo before a crowd
of 40,263 put the 1996 champions two points ahead as both teams
prepare for the next game at Kashima stadium set for next Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual
Saturday as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents
related to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons.
	   At least four cars with inspectors pulled out of U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad on the fourth consecutive day of field work
since the teams returned from Bahrain, to where they were evacuated
after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections, would say only that ``We are
carrying on with our activities.''
	   UNSCOM is not making public how many teams are working each day
or where they are going.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the UNSCOM teams, has said they visited more than 23 sites in and
out of Baghdad during inspections from Wednesday through Friday.
	   The disagreement over documents, however, threatened to undo the
uneasy truce reached just a week ago, when Iraq pledged to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   Its partner agency, the Vienna-headquartered International
Atomic Energy Agency, oversees the destruction of nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq in August began curtailing the work of the inspectors, and
on Oct. 31 halted all UNSCOM work. After the United States and
Britain threatened military action, Baghdad on Nov. 14 backed down
and said it would resume cooperation.
	   But on Friday, U.N. officials in New York said Iraq was
objecting to three letters from UNSCOM chief Richard Butler asking
for access to documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, told Butler in
a letter that his request ``seems to be provocative rather than
professional,''
	   When asked about the latest dispute, U.S. President Bill Clinton
gave a cautious response. Speaking Saturday at a news conference in
Seoul, South Korea, he said: ``I think It's important that we not
over react here on the first day. I want to make sure that I know
exactly what the facts are.''
	   He said he would be briefed later by his advisers on an issue he
said was ``quite important.''
	   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, speaking to
reporters later in Seoul, gave a stronger response. Asked whether
Washington would take military action if Iraq did not hand over the
documents, he said: ``Clearly in our judgment Iraq has an
obligation to produce the documents that UNSCOM is seeking and we
will support UNSCOM in that effort.
	   ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions
is negative, we obviously are prepared to act.''
	   Among other documents, Butler reportedly is seeking an Iraqi air
force diary, which inspectors discovered during a July search but
were prevented from taking, that details munitions destroyed during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Al-Qaisi repeated Iraq's earlier position on the document,
saying that U.N. weapons experts could view ``relevant portions''
of it in the presence of Prakash Shah, the envoy to Iraq of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM in hopes of
speeding up a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the U.N.
Security Council of its compliance so far on U.N. disarmament
resolutions.
	   It wants that review to lead to an easing or lifting of the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the council after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The United States has said, however, that action on the
sanctions will not automatically follow the review.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
bar most financial dealings _ have seriously damaged Iraq's
once-rich economy.

Frequent transfer of officials holds back education in Indian
</HEADLINE>
state.

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Frequent transfers of officials, often for
political reasons, has affected education in Uttar Pradesh, India's
most populous state and one with low literacy.
	   Education officers posted in the 83 districts of Uttar Pradesh
average less than 10 weeks on the job, according to a state
government study released on Saturday.
	   Uttar Pradesh has a literacy rate of about 41 percent compared
to the national average of 53 percent. State officials transferred
away from their assignments to improve literacy were mostly from
Uttar Pradesh districts with the lowest literacy.
	   One official in the study was transferred early this year after
barely two weeks at her post. She was not given a reason.
	   The study said frequent transfers and short tenures have
directly affected the success of literacy programs in the district.
	   It said officials had barely settled down before they were
transferred so lower level officials ``lack a sense of direction''
and suffered from low morale.
	   ``There seems to be a lot of wastage of resources because of the
transfers. There is no proper evaluation or supervision of the
money spent in the literacy programs,'' said the study, conducted
by the state's administrative reforms department.
	   State Education Minister Ravinder Shukla said the transfers were
for ``administrative exigencies.'' He refused to elaborate.
	   Officials say privately that the transfers are usually for
political reasons. Politicians wield enormous clout in Utter
Pradesh and often transfer officials to remote or inhospitable
areas if they refuse to comply with their numerous requests, most
of them illegal.

U.N. weapons teams back into field, new dispute develops

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual
Saturday as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents
related to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons.
	   At least four cars with inspectors pulled out of U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad on the fourth consecutive day of field work
since the teams returned from Bahrain, where they were evacuated
after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees the inspections, would say only that ``We are
carrying on with our activities.''
	   UNSCOM is not making public how many teams are working each day
or where they are going.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the UNSCOM teams, has said they visited more than 23 sites in and
out of Baghdad during inspections from Wednesday through Friday.
	   The disagreement over documents, however, threatened to undo the
uneasy truce reached just a week ago, when Iraq pledged to
cooperate fully with UNSCOM, which is charged with eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles. Its partner agency, the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency, oversees the destruction of
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq in August began curtailing the work of the inspectors, and
on Oct. 31 halted all UNSCOM work. After the United States and
Britain threatened military action, Baghdad on Nov. 14 backed down
and said it would resume cooperation.
	   But on Friday, U.N. officials in New York said Iraq was
objecting to three letters from UNSCOM chief Richard Butler asking
for access to documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, told Butler in
a letter that his request ``seems to be provocative rather than
professional,''
	   When asked about the latest dispute, U.S. President Bill Clinton
gave a cautious response. Speaking Saturday at a news conference in
Seoul, South Korea, he said: ``I think It's important that we not
over react here on the first day. I want to make sure that I know
exactly what the facts are.''
	   He said he would be ``extensively briefed'' later by his
advisers on the issue, which he described as ``quite important.''
	   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, speaking to
reporters later in Seoul, gave a stronger response. Asked whether
Washington would take military action if Iraq did not hand over the
documents, he said: ``Clearly in our judgment Iraq has an
obligation to produce the documents that UNSCOM is seeking and we
will support UNSCOM in that effort.
	   ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions
is negative, we obviously are prepared to act.''
	   Among other documents, Butler reportedly is seeking an Iraqi air
force diary, which inspectors discovered during a July search but
were prevented from taking, that details munitions destroyed during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Al-Qaisi repeated Iraq's earlier position on the document,
saying that U.N. weapons experts could view ``relevant portions''
of it in the presence of Prakash Shah, the envoy to Iraq of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq agreed to resume full cooperation with UNSCOM in hopes of
speeding up a promised ``comprehensive review'' by the U.N.
Security Council of its compliance so far on U.N. disarmament
resolutions.
	   It wants that review to lead to an easing or lifting of the
sweeping sanctions imposed by the council after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The United States has said, however, that action on the
sanctions will not automatically follow the review.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
bar most financial dealings _ have seriously damaged Iraq's
once-rich economy.

Ver, former chief aide of Marcos, dies in Bangkok

background in 12th-13th grafs.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine military chief of
staff Gen. Fabian Ver, once the chief aide to the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, has died at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand
following a long illness, a family spokesman said Saturday. He was
78.
	   Ver was one of the most powerful figures during the 20-year
Marcos administration, heading the presidential security force
before being appointed by Marcos as his chief of staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after the autocratic
leader was ousted in the ``people power'' revolt in February of
1986.
	   Mel Amado Jr., a spokesman for the Ver family, said the former
general succumbed to a ``lung malfunction complication'' early
Saturday at an undisclosed hospital in Bangkok.
	   Ver was rushed by his eldest daughter, Helma Ver Tuazon, to the
private hospital after he started experiencing shortness of breath,
Amado said.
	   Before he died, Ver was able to talk on the telephone to his
wife, Aida, and his youngest daughter Faida in California, sons
Wyrlo and Rexor in Hawaii, and another son, Irwin, in San
Francisco, Amado said.
	   Ver underwent lung surgery last year and a gall bladder
operation early this year, which may have led to a deterioration of
his health.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, quoting a Philippine embassy
officer in Bangkok, said the Ver family is making arrangements to
fly the former general's remains to Manila.
	   Former President Corazon Aquino, who succeeded Marcos, had
banned the return of Ver and his three sons, all former military
officers, on grounds that they posed a security threat.
	   Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino, continued the ban. Ramos was
Ver's deputy under the Marcos regime but later led rebel troops in
the 1986 revolt.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver rose from the rank of private to four-star general in his
four decades in the country's military.
	   He served as an intelligence officer during World War II and
gained fame in the anti-Huk campaign in the 1950s, when the
government suppressed a Communist-led peasant rebellion in the
Philippines.
	   Ver was accused of involvement in the 1983 assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., Mrs. Aquino's husband, at
Manila's airport but was acquitted while Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
The trial, however, failed to determine whether Marcos or his
associates ordered the assassination.
	   Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in absence
and the case against him had been shelved.
	   In a radio address on Saturday, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said police and military intelligence have determined the
Vers are no longer a threat to security.
	   He said he has ordered that passports be given to members of the
Ver family so they can return home.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos follower, had said that although Ver
would have to face charges in the Aquino murder, he could not be
forced to identify the mastermind of the assassination.
	   Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she was ``deeply saddened'' by Ver's
death.
	   ``The last time I spoke to him on the telephone, I was telling
him that I am praying so that you will be able to come home and
finally find ultimate vindication,'' Mrs. Marcos said.

president's wife

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Belgian police, helping Dutch
detectives hunt for the attackers of the wife of Royal Philips
Electronics President Cor Boonstra, have searched houses in and
around the northern city of Antwerp, Dutch media reported Saturday.
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, was kidnapped, brutally beaten,
handcuffed, strangled and left for dead in a deserted car park in
the western Dutch town of Hoek van Holland last Friday.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes, suffered a broken arm, broken fingers, a
serious head injury and was nearly blinded in the attack. She was
able to speak to Dutch investigators for the first time late
Friday, according to newspaper reports Saturday.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes, who remains in a Hague hospital in stable
condition, reportedly told police that she was bundled into a car
in the northern Dutch city of Antwerp, close to the Dutch border.
	   Police have described the attack as a ``deliberate payback,''
but refuse to elaborate.
	   The Dutch detectives pinpointed at least three houses to be
searched by Belgian colleagues based on evidence collected in the
week since the attack, including finger prints found on
Boonstra-Raatjes' BMW, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported.
	   No arrests were immediately reported.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes, who is separated from her husband, divides her
time between luxury homes in Belgium and the Bahamas.

Illegal immigrants set to protest in several French cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Illegal immigrants were to take to the streets
Saturday in several French cities, asking that the French
government give them residency status.
	   Afternoon protests were planned for Paris, as well as Orleans,
Le Havre, Bordeaux and Lille. About forty anti-racism groups,
several labor unions and members of the Greens party were to march
with the illegal immigrants.
	   The planned protests were seen as a test of a movement that
began in 1996 with a two-month-long occupation of a Paris church by
300 African illegal immigrants.
	   The Socialist-led French government has legalized the status of
some 76,000 illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested
for more than 64,000 others.
	   The Greens, represented by Environment Minister Dominique
Voynet, have called for the government to provide residency status
for all illegal immigrants, who in French are called ``sans
papiers'' or those without papers.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has been more generous in granting
residency permits to illegal immigrants than the previous
conservative government.
	   But the far right National Front, which blames high unemployment
on immigrants, has accused Jospin of being too soft on the issue.

Interior minister launches investigation into slaying of lawmaker

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said
Saturday he would take personal control over the investigation into
the killing of Galina Starovoitova, a prominent member of
parliament.
	   In a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's
lower house, the State Duma, Yeltsin said he was ``shocked and
indignant'' over the death of Starovoitova, who was shot to death
by unknown assailants Friday night.
	   Yeltsin said he will take control of the investigation and that
the ``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and
severely punished,'' the telegram said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and a team of
investigators arrived in St. Petersburg Saturday following
Yeltsin's orders to security chiefs to use all means to solve the
crime.
	   Starovoitova and an aide, Ruslan Linkov, were fired on by two
assailants as they climbed a stairway in the lawmaker's apartment
house Friday night, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, quoting police
reports.
	   Starovoitova died immediately, the news agency said. Linkov was
reported to be in critical condition from gunshot wounds to the
head.
	   A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at
the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Police would not speculate on a motive for the attack.
	   Yeltsin ordered the country's top law enforcement officials,
including Stepashin, Federal Security Service chief Vladimir Putin
and Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov to take urgent measures to
solve the crime.
	   Stepashin said he hoped for a quick solution to the killing.
	   ``I brought with me a team of experienced investigators,'' he
told reporters at St. Petersburg's airport. ``I think we will clear
it up soon.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, a member of the reformist Democratic Russia
party, tried to run for president in 1996 but her registration was
rejected for technical reasons. She planned to run again in 2000.
	   She served as Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the
only woman in his immediate circle _ and was on the human rights
committee of the former Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet.
	   Yeltsin praised Starovoitova as an ardent supporter of
democracy.
	   ``She has stood at the origin of new Russia,'' a statement
released by the presidential press service said. ``Galina
Vasilyevna (Starovoitova) has always and everywhere defended the
principles of democracy. One of the brightest figures in Russian
politics, she has been one of my closest companions and
assistants.''
	   According to Interfax, Starovoitova was in St. Petersburg to
attend a session of the Northern Capital political movement
Saturday.
	   She had earned a reputation as one of the most outspoken reform
supporters in the Russian parliament, where she frequently sparred
with hard-liners, including ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   In 1990 she won an unprecedented libel suit against Pravda when
the former official Soviet newspaper published a story accusing her
of calling for the forcible elimination of the government.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St.
Petersburg recently. A finance official's car was bombed last week
and a top banker was killed last week, and police attributed both
attacks to business deals. An aide to Russia's parliament speaker
was shot in the head last month in what police suspect was a
contract hit.
	   Contract killings are often used to settle business disputes in
Russia, and such hits have become increasingly widespread in recent
years.

Caustic letters proliferate in Singapore newspaper over Gore's
</HEADLINE>
comments

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A number of caustic responses were published in
Singapore's leading newspaper on Saturday to a letter to the editor
from an American reader who had praised U.S. Vice-President Al
Gore's recent support for more democracy in Asia and criticized
Singapore's human rights record.
	   On Thursday, The Straits Times published a letter from Elaine
Supkis of New York City which lauded Gore's words of encouragement
for the reform movement in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Gore made the comments while attending a meeting earlier this
week in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia of leaders from members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which includes the U.S.,
Singapore and 19 other economies.
	   The woman added that she was not surprised Singapore had
cautioned U.S. leaders not to issue such criticisms so publicly, a
reference to Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's remark that
the U.S. should speak more ``quietly.''
	   Some Singaporeans bristled at her rebuke and chided Gore in
letters published by the paper on Saturday.
	   ``Even though I may not agree with the actions of some Malaysian
leaders, I cannot help but feel a sense of outrage for the way the
Malaysians have been insulted in their own backyard,'' wrote Chua
Sheng Yang.
	   ``Time and time again, Americans have made scathing criticisms
of the way we Asians have chosen to structure our governments and
our politics simply because of the fact that we deviate from what
they deem to be the `superior' American system,'' added Chua.
	   Reader Chan Hon Chew asked how Americans would feel if Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad were to insult U.S. President Bill
Clinton during a visit to Washington.
	   ``Wouldn't any self-respecting American feel outraged?'' Chan
wrote.

England's Westwood takes two-stroke second round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Lee Westwood of England edged closer to
his seventh win of the year Saturday with a two-stroke lead after
the third round of the 250 million yen (dlrs 2 million) Dunlop
Phoenix tournament.
	   Westwood carded five birdies in a bogey-free five-under-par-66
on the 6,846-yard, par-71 Phoenix Country Club course, standing at
12-under-201 with one round left.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke also shot 66 and was second at
203.
	   Japan's Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki had the day's best score of 64,
on eight birdies and one bogey, to jump into a tie for third with
American Fred Funk, who had a 66.
	   ``It was nice to get around today without making any bogeys,''
Westwood said. ``My iron play was quite a bit better. I gave myself
a lot of chances.''
	   Westwood was thrilled with his shot from a bunker at the
par-four 14th.
	   ``It's probably the best bunker shot I've played ever,'' he
said.
	   Westwood was confident of making back-to-back victories
following his win of the Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo masters last week
in Japan.
	   ``I don't think it will be easy but I've certainly got as good
an opportunity as anybody, if not better,'' he said.
	   Clarke, a friend of Westwood's, said he looked forward to a good
fight in the final round.
	   ``We enjoy playing each other and trying to beat each other,''
he said. ``It's a very tough course. To shoot a very low number,
you've really got to be on top of your game.''
	   The winner receives 45 million yen (dlrs 375,000).

ASEAN foreign ministers to meet after Cambodia forms government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations will hold an emergency
meeting soon after Cambodia formally installs a government,
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said Saturday.
	   Siazon, however, said it was ``highly unlikely'' Cambodia would
be admitted into the regional bloc before the Dec. 15-16 ASEAN
summit meeting.
	   ASEAN includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ``There will be an emergency meeting if the Cambodian government
is formed,'' Siazon said.
	   He said the meeting would probably be held in Singapore since it
is the chairman of the ASEAN standing committee.
	   He said some ASEAN members are still apprehensive about
immediately admitting Cambodia to the group since it has not yet
actually formed a coalition government.
	   On Thursday, Cambodia's top two political parties began
hammering out details of their agreement to form a coalition
government.
	   Separate working groups formed by strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC
party met to draft proposals on establishing a joint political
platform and other matters.
	   Formerly bitter rivals, Hun Sen and Ranariddh ended more than
three months of political stalemate last week with an agreement
that will make Hun Sen prime minister of a coalition government.
	   Ranariddh, whose party finished a close second to Hun Sen's in a
July election, was expected to assume the duties of president of
the National Assembly, which will become the lower house of
parliament.
	   ``They are still bargaining. They only agreed in principle,''
Siazon said.
	   Key to the deal was an agreement to create a new Senate in a
bicameral Parliament. The new upper house will be led by Chea Sim,
the president of Hun Sen's party and outgoing head of the National
Assembly.
	   Both sides are eager to form a government before the ASEAN
summit meeting opens in Hanoi.
	   Cambodia's entry into ASEAN was postponed last year following
Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent
coup. A resolution of the crisis and the formation of a viable
government were set as preconditions before the group would
consider admitting Cambodia as its 10th member.

Yeltsin orders investigation of security service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the head of
Russia's Federal Security Service to look into reports of illegal
activities, including one that the agency ordered the death of a
prominent businessman.
	   Yeltsin met with Vladimir Putin, the head of the service, on
Friday and expressed concern about reports of alleged wrongdoing by
some of its officers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The
service, known as the FSB, is the main successor to the Soviet KGB.
	   The meeting followed renewed accusations by an intelligence
officer, Lt. Col. Alexander Litvinenko, that he had been ordered to
kill business mogul Boris Berezovsky. The financier is still alive.
	   When Litvinenko first made the accusations last spring, the
chief prosecutor's office started an investigation. It was
suspended for lack of evidence.
	   Yeltsin instructed the heads of the FSB and the Security
Council, the president's top advisory panel, to check the security
agency's activity and to report back within a month, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, denied reports he had received more than a
quarter of the shares in Russia's largest television station from
Berezovsky.
	   A hard-line Communist member of parliament had alleged on
Wednesday that Berezovsky had given Yeltsin's bodyguard, Alexander
Korzhakov, the power of attorney to give 26 percent of shares in
the ORT television station to Yeltsin in 1994. The lawmaker, Viktor
Ilyukhin, called the alleged transfer a bribe.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin denied the charge Friday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The station, which has been fighting bankruptcy proceedings
against it, is 51 percent government-owned, with the remainder held
by Berezovsky and other private investors.

Syria criticizes Israeli-British defense agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ A British-Israeli defense research
agreement reached this week would harm Arab interests and set back
the Middle East peace process, a Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
	   In an editorial, the state-owned Al-Thawra said Britain, by
signing the agreement, violated what it called the European
consensus in opposing Israel's anti-peace policies.
	   ``Maintaining cooperation with Israel will always remain, in all
criteria, a step backward in the (Middle East) peace process that
will never be in the interest of the region's stability and
security,' Al-Thawra added.
	   The Defense Research Memorandum of Understanding was signed
Friday by a British senior Ministry of Defense official and the
Israeli Ambassador in London.
	   It provides a framework for the exchange of information of
mutual interest and joint research projects on case-by-case basis.
It will run for 10 years and excludes cooperation on areas related
to weapons of mass destruction.
	   Britain lifted a ban on supplying Israel with weaponry and
military equipment in 1994.

Indonesia's Habibie launches corruption inquiry into Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from former strongman Suharto, Indonesia's current head of state,
B.J. Habibie, launched a commission of inquiry on Saturday into
corruption allegations against his predecessor and one time mentor.
	   The probe into Suharto's wealth appears to be a major concession
to protesting students who have fought bloody street battles with
the military.
	   The students have demanded that Suharto, 77, be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during his 32 years as
president of the Southeast Asian nation.
	   About 200 students staged a protest near Suharto's residence
Saturday, where the ex-president has lived as a virtual recluse
since quitting amid riots and protests on May 21.
	   Speaking on behalf of President Habibie, State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung told reporters the commission would ``examine and
investigate the wealth of former President Suharto.''
	   Members of the commission have not yet been appointed. However,
they would have ``credibility and high integrity within the nation
and state,'' Akbar said.
	   Akbar said Habibie made the decision after a four-hour meeting
with seven Cabinet ministers, including armed forces commander Gen.
Wiranto.
	   Critics and opponents of Suharto say he plundered the wealth of
Indonesia by allowing his six children and a small group of cronies
to build huge business empires under his patronage. They also
accuse him of stashing a fortune away in overseas bank accounts.
	   Suharto has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption.
	   An investigation by Indonesia's attorney general launched
several months ago failed to identify any wrongdoing by Suharto.
Opponents have branded that inquiry as a whitewash and have accused
the Habibie government of trying to protect the former autocrat.
	   When Habibie first assumed office he called on Indonesians not
to indulge in ``Wild West'' justice by trying to seize the
Suharto's assets.
	   Last week, a special government assembly called on Habibie to
include the former president in a new wide ranging corruption
inquiry.
	   Visiting former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who met
with Suharto on Thursday, told reporters Saturday the ex-leader
said he would be willing to face any inquiry into his wealth,
estimated by Forbes magazine at dlrs 4 billion.
	   ``He said to me that he was prepared to answer any charges
against him,'' Keating said.
	   Also Saturday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said during a visit
to South Korea that he hoped ``there will be no backsliding'' on
human rights by the new Indonesian government a week after clashes
between student demonstrators and the military left up to 16 people
dead.
	   Speaking at a news conference in Seoul, Clinton said there had
been both troubling and hopeful signs coming from Indonesia in
recent months.
	   ``The United States very much hopes there will be no backsliding
as we come up with an election season in Indonesia and that every
effort will be made to minimize any harm to people who are
exercising their voices to make their political views heard,'' he
said.
	   In Jakarta, Habibie met with a delegation from the ruling Golkar
party's youth wing on Saturday, as about 300 students placed
flowers on the street outside the Atma Jaya University, where the
worst of the violence occurred last week.
	   Habibie, Wiranto and other ministers met university deans on
Saturday at the presidential palace.
	   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago nation of 202 million people,
is enduring its worst economic turmoil in three decades. Discontent
over inflation and joblessness helped spark the May riots, in which
1,200 people were killed.
	   Doctors confirmed Friday that metal bullet fragments were found
in the bodies of some protesters killed. Officials say security
forces were ordered to fire only blank ammunition or plastic
bullets.
	   Habibie has accused some opposition activists of orchestrating
the protests in an attempt to overthrow his government.
	   Police have formally charged 10 with sedition. Those charged
have denied the allegations.

Woes mount for white farmers as squatters invade properties in

	   ENTERPRISE VALLEY, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Hundreds of impoverished
blacks armed with axes and knives have occupied farms in this
valley, angry with the pace of government efforts to resettle
blacks on white-owned land.
	   The escalating tension in Enterprise Valley, 30 miles (50
kilometers) east of the capital, Harare, came after the government
on Wednesday reiterated its intention to seize 841 white-owned
farms across Zimbabwe.
	   Since independence in 1980, about 70,000 black families have
been resettled on former white-owned farms, less than half of the
government target of 160,000 families. About 4,000 whites own
roughly one-third of the southern African nation's most productive
land.
	   For Stix Chimuti, a 45-year-old veteran of the guerrilla war
that led to independence, the land handover is proceeding too
slowly.
	   Now the leader of a group of about 100 squatters encamped on a
neatly plowed corn, tobacco and paprika farm, Chimuti vowed Friday
to fight to the death for a home for his wife and 12 children.
	   ``The white man stole our land, and we're going to have it back.
We're prepared to die for it,'' he said.
	   Chimuti and his followers, axes and knives stowed in their
makeshift shelters, trekked to Enterprise Valley a week ago from
densely populated arid land nearby.
	   ``That land is not suitable for people, just goats,'' he said.
	   At a wheat and corn farm nearby, squatters have daubed the farm
sign with the word ``tatora,'' ``we take'' in the local Shona
language, and have lit fires and pounded tribal drums at night, 100
yards (meters) from the farmer's bedroom.
	   The farmer, Rob Brown, said some of the more than 60 squatter
families on his land have threatened to assault or kill his 300
workers, calling them ``sellouts to whites.''
	   ``What worries us is the total breakdown of law and order,''
Brown said.
	   Brown's land is not on a list of white-owned farms President
Robert Mugabe's government wants to nationalize. But the squatters
are not going by any lists.
	   The plan to nationalize farms has brought harsh international
criticism. Aid donors and international financial institutions are
concerned that more land seizures could disrupt food production and
further harm the nation's crumbling economy.
	   The land program also has been plagued by delays, mismanagement
and corruption, with some seized properties going to politicians
and their cronies.
	   Wednesday's announcement to seize more land came despite the
government's September promise to Western donors to hold off on
hasty, poorly planned confiscations.
	   Britain said Friday it is seeking urgent clarification on the
Zimbabwe government's ordered compulsory acquisition of 841 farms.
	   Some critics accuse the government of timing the new
land-seizure announcement ahead of a ruling party congress next
month. Mugabe is expected to receive a stormy reception at the
annual party meeting over worsening economic hardships and the
deployment of 8,000 Zimbabwe troops to support embattled Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``It's politically motivated to divert attention from the
government's failure to deliver on its promises,'' Brown said.

Confusion abounds in Hurricane Mitch relief effort

	   CATACAMAS, Honduras (AP) _ The doctor stooped as he slogged
across the muddy soccer field, fighting the fierce gusts whipped up
by the twin rotors of a big U.S. Army C-47 Chinook.
	   It was the first helicopter to arrive in Catacamas in four days,
and the 1,700 people living in the town's shelters had run out of
food.
	   But excitement soon turned to anger for the local emergency
relief leader when volunteers began piling boxes onto the waiting
pickup trucks. Johnson's Disposable Diapers, the labels read. Extra
Large.
	   ``No! No! No!'' Dr. Orles Escobar screamed. ``We need food and
medicine, not diapers!''
	   The American soldiers said they were saving most of the food on
board for their next stop, Juticalpa, where the need was greater.
	   But in Juticalpa, officials didn't even want the sacks of rice
and beans. The bridges on the road to the capital had been patched
the day before, and they had plenty to eat now that trucks were
getting through. What they needed was medicine.
	   Miscommunication and confusion are reigning in the gargantuan
effort to prevent Hurricane Mitch's death toll from rising.
Already, 10,000 or so people are believed drowned or buried in
mudslides across Central America.
	   But the confusion is almost forgivable. Even if aid shipments
don't go to the worst-off places, there are people everywhere who
need help.
	   In the words of Honduras CARE director Marc de Lamotte: ``The
magnitude of the problem is so great, anything you do, the aid will
get to the population in need.''
	   ___
	   The relief operation for Hurricane Mitch may be the largest for
any natural disaster ever. Nobody knows for sure.
	   That's because in the struggle to get food and medicine to
communities isolated by floods, nobody has had time to add it all
up.
	   In Honduras, the closest thing to a list is in the hands of
Comptroller Vera Sofia Rubi, the government's top accountant, who
said she hasn't had a workday shorter than 16 hours since Mitch
struck a month ago.
	   With a boosted staff of about 900 people scattered throughout
the country, she is confident her office has noted down ``99
percent'' of all aid coming in, whether by truck, boat, plane or
bank wire, and recorded how each item is being used.
	   The list, a work in progress, consists of a 20-page computer
printout recording donations small and large.
	   One entry is from the Church of Christ in Nashville, Tennessee.
Four boxes containing 10 pairs of shoes, six blankets and some
clothes. Total value: dlrs 110.
	   Another is from the Taiwanese government: Two checks for a total
of dlrs 800,000. ``They've already cleared,'' Rubi said.
	   Some aid comes in the form of sacks of rice; some as medical
services; some as cash. Rubi said it would take too long to put a
dollar figure on everything.
	   More than two dozen governments have made sometimes huge pledges
_ the United States is giving dlrs 300 million, the European Union
dlrs 120 million _ and say they will donate much more as relief
turns into reconstruction. Several countries have forgiven Central
America's debts and are pushing major lenders like the World Bank
to do the same.
	   Private institutions and regular people have sent in millions
more, touched by the images they have seen or the stories they have
read.
	   Aid officials say they've never seen a response like it.
	   ``The biggest ever were the Mexico City earthquake and the
Colombia volcano eruption in 1985,'' Paul Bell, a top U.S. aid
official the past 36 years, said by phone from his base in Costa
Rica.
	   ``I'm sure before it's all over we will surpass those.''
	   ___
	   If confusion in the effort to get all that aid to the needy is
their worst problem, the governments of Honduras, Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala have reason to be proud.
	   Central America has a history of mismanaging relief.
Traditionally, corrupt officials have sold off donated supplies,
fattening their wallets at the expense of a disaster's victims.
	   In 1974, when Hurricane Fifi ravaged Honduras, top army officers
were accused of getting rich by selling donated clothes, medicine
and water purification plants. Seven months later, after 12 years
in power, Gen. Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was ousted in a coup.
	   When a 1972 earthquake devastated Nicaragua, the government of
dictator Anastasio Somoza was accused of graft. The scandal helped
build support for the leftist Sandinistas, who seized power seven
years later.
	   But at least so far, most observers agree there has been very
little graft since Hurricane Mitch. Apparently, Central America's
leaders have learned from history.
	   Honduras stationed hundreds of government auditors across the
country and recently put the Roman Catholic Church in charge of
shelters to avoid accusations of government mismanagement.
	   Nicaragua placed the church in charge of monitoring all aid
early on, leaving local priests weary from attending to the sick
and homeless almost frantic as they tried to account for warehouse
inventories.
	   ``They're very attentive and alert to what has happened in the
past,'' said James Creagan, U.S. ambassador to Honduras. ``From Day
One, they said: `We have to be careful that the aid is managed in
the proper way.'''

CATACAMAS, Honduras: proper way.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   When Hurricane Mitch began pounding Honduras' Caribbean coast on
Oct. 22, aid officials in the capital rushed to work out relief
plans for the devastated coast and its nearby resort islands.
	   The storm was stalled right on top of the islands, and although
most phones were out, it was clear there was a lot of damage.
	   Then suddenly and unexpectedly, the storm veered south and
headed straight at them. In three days, Tegucigalpa, the capital,
got 9.4 inches (24 centimeters) of rain.
	   The city was thrown into chaos. The Red Cross building was
covered in mud; floodwaters rose above the first three stories of a
major hospital. All but two of the capital's bridges collapsed and
phone lines went down across the country.
	   And the relief operation was in shambles before it even really
began.
	   ``The first days were a chaos,'' conceded army Maj. Orlando
Coca, aid coordinator for the government's emergency committee.
``Nothing like this had ever happened, and we weren't prepared for
it.''
	   Elena Brineman, director of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in Honduras, said information on damage and needs began
to stream in from across the country, but there was no mechanism in
the capital to put it together and link it to relief.
	   ``They've never had a disaster that affected the entire country,
and they couldn't handle it,'' she said. ``It's starting to work
out now. Given the situation, it's a remarkably orderly process.''
	   ___
	   Aid officials say there are still places they haven't reached,
where people are stranded on virtual islands with little food and
water.
	   But while helicopters search, relief workers also are scrambling
to plan for longer-term rebuilding, aware that any delay could put
thousands, perhaps millions, of lives at risk.
	   Non-governmental aid groups are dividing up the countries for
long-term aid. In Honduras, CARE is taking the northern and
southern coasts, World Relief the center and Global Village the
western banana-growing region.
	   Health workers are fanning out to vaccinate people against
diseases that have already started to spring up because of the
standing water and poor hygiene.
	   Work crews are struggling to rebuild roads _ not only to get in
aid, but also to get out newly harvested crops that escaped the
storm but will rot if they can't get to ports or markets.
	   Aid officials are appealing for architects and urban planners to
help them figure out how to rebuild neighborhoods so that the next
flood won't destroy them again.
	   Economists are calculating how to provide long-term food
handouts without destroying the agricultural sectors of the
affected countries.
	   Hillary Clinton warned last Monday that more people could still
die as a result of Hurricane Mitch. ``We're not by any means
through,'' she said.
	   ___
	   A steady stream of politicians and celebrities has visited the
disaster area, many pledging relief and trying to help.
	   While Tipper Gore, wife of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, shoveled
mud and spent a night in a tent, Spain's Prince Felipe provoked
goo-goo eyes in Honduran women and U.S. actor Edward James Olmos
weaved through a hotel crawling with journalists, asking who was
with television so he could tell them about his news conference.
	   The big names have helped focus international attention on the
devastation and probably sparked more donations.
	   But some victims say that when the celebrities are gone, they
have little to show for it.
	   Juan Antonio Lagus, 55, lives down the block from a school
visited by Mrs. Gore; Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red
Cross; and Honduran first lady Mary Flake de Flores.
	   The river rose midway to the second floor of his rented house
and swept away the piles of used clothes he sells to scrape by. His
wife and two children were hungry, he said, and he worried about
the nasty smell emerging from the mud that still blankets the
street three feet deep.
	   ``When they all came, we heard about the aid coming from all
those countries,'' he said. ``We're still waiting. We haven't
gotten anything.''

Ugandan army to distribute more than a million condoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, (AP) _ The Ugandan armed forces plan to distribute more
a million condoms in an attempt to control the spreads of AIDS
among the soldiers, it was reported Saturday.
	   The decision by Uganda Peoples Defense Forces to buy 1.2 million
condoms at a cost of dlrs 8,000 follows dwindling supplies in the
country's public health services, said The Monitor newspaper.
	   A government-owned vernacular newspaper, Bukedde, Saturday
quoted the officer in charge of AIDS control in the forces, Maj.
Rubaramira Rulanga, as saying soldiers should stop being bashful
and use condoms to protect themselves from contracting the disease,
which has no known cure.
	   Uganda is one of few country's in Africa with an aggressive
campaign on AIDS prevention and the government's open policy in
dealing the disease has attracted massive foreign assistance.
	   The East African nation, which had the highest AIDS rate in the
world in 1982, is the only African country south of the Sahara to
achieve a decline in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   More than 2 million Ugandans _ more than 10 percent of the
population _ are now infected. More than 1.8 million already have
died.

Primakov signs decree on agency for restructuring banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov Saturday signed a
decree setting up an agency to oversee the restructuring of banks
and other credit organizations, according to Russian news agencies.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the government's Federal
Property Fund will hold a 51 percent stake and the Central Bank of
Russia will have a 49 percent stake in the agency, which will
administer the restructuring of ailing Russian banks.
	   Recently, the central bank warned that about half of the
country's 1,500 banks faced collapse. However, those banks hold
only a fraction of Russia's banking assets, with most carrying out
only limited activities.
	   The decree allows the use of part of loans from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development to fund measures for
restructuring the banking system, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.

	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ Australian Maxine Nable won the women's
step-ladder finals with a 235-231 victory over Tseng Su-fen from
Taiwan Saturday in the Coca-Cola AMF Bowling World Cup.
	   Yang Cheng-ming of Taiwan won the men's competition by beating
finalist Mario Quintero of Mexico 233-152.
	   Nable led for the entire title match against Tseng but boosted
her chances with consecutive strikes from the fifth through the
ninth frames.
	   ``I was fortunate that everything came together for me this
week,'' she said. ``I had a good feeling after a few frames, and
then it got even better when the strikes started coming near the
end.''
	   Earlier, fourth-seeded Janette Piesczynski of the United States
had a 213-168 victory over No. 5 Ross Greiner of the Netherlands,
but she was defeated by third-placed Malaysian Shalin Zulkifli.
	   Tseng, placing second and the defending champion, eliminated
Zulkifli 222-199. Zulkifli finished third last year and second two
years ago.
	   In men's action, No. 2 seed Quintero beat No. 3 Japan's Koichi
Takahashi 177-163 to get into the finals.
	   But against Yang, he couldn't make a strike or a spare in frames
two, three and four.

Cardinal's rebuke of bishop reveals rift in Austrian church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn has
publicly rebuked a conservative bishop in an unprecedented move
revealing a deep rift in the Austrian Catholic hierarchy.
	   Bishop Kurt Krenn of St. Poelten west of Vienna had claimed in
public comments he had not known the text of a five-year report the
Austrian bishops delivered at the Vatican during their current
one-week Rome visit.
	   Among other things the document admitted clumsy handling of a
scandal involving retired Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was
accused of sexually abusing young boys and men but never directly
admitted his guilt. Groer, who had to relinquish all his church
functions, recently returned from months of Vatican-imposed exile
and is reported to be terminally ill.
	   Krenn said he did not know the contents of the bishops' report
and disagreed with it.
	   Talking to Austrian state television from Rome late Friday,
Cardinal Schoenborn, visibly angry, said, `` Objectively, what he
(Krenn) said was simply not correct.''
	   He said it was ``completely wrong to say that the text (of the
bishops' report) was unknown,'' referring to existing minutes of
the procedure in drafting and communicating the document.
	   However, the Austrian church leader stopped short of repeating
even harsher language attributed to him in an interview in the
Vienna daily Kurier. Referring to Krenn's public claims, he was
quoted as saying, ``This is a serious disciplinary offense within
the bishops' conference, a breach of trust. That is also relevant
for Rome (the Vatican). There will be disciplinary consequences.''
	   In the TV interview, Schoenborn did announce he would take up
the matter with the Vatican bishops' congregation, but only hinted
disciplinary measures may be considered.
	   Bishop Krenn remained defiant, challenging the cardinal.
	   ``A reprimand can only succeed if one allows it to happen and if
someone is in a position (to pronounce it). However, we bishops are
all equal,'' Krenn said in an interview with the weekly Profil to
be published Monday and carried in part by the Austria Press Agency
Saturday.
	   Krenn was also quoted as saying that under church disciplinary
proceedings could only be initiated by the Vatican, ``because we
are all subject to the pope.''
	   The Groer affair last year has brought to the open a
long-simmering conflict between Austrian church leaders favoring
reforms and others, particularly Krenn, taking a conservative
stance in line with current Vatican policy.
	   In a speech Friday, Pope John Paul II rejected the idea of a
``democratization'' of the church, saying the truth cannot be
arrived at ``through opinion polls and in a democratic manner.''
	   Nor can the revealed truth be decided by ``some one from
below,'' the pope told his bishops, referring to demands for
thorough reform contained in a referendum signed by a half million
Austrian Catholic lay people.

 &UR; U.S. special envoy backtracks on statement about North Korea

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador Charles Kartman
backtracked Saturday on his earlier contention that ``compelling
evidence'' exists linking an underground construction site in North
Korea to the communist country's nuclear development program.
	   In a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, Kartman said
Washington lacks ``conclusive evidence'' that the site northeast of
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang is a nuclear facility.
	   The statement was described as a ``clarification'' by U.S.
President Bill Clinton's special envoy on North Korean affairs, who
had made the earlier remark during a news conference in Seoul on
Thursday.
	   ``There is strong information that makes us suspicious, but we
lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the
underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type of
nuclear facility it might be,'' the statement said.
	   The clarification was distributed as Clinton and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung said in a joint news conference on Saturday
that they harbor suspicions about the North Korean site, but have
no solid evidence connecting it to nuclear-related activities.
	   North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear development program in
a 1994 accord with the U.S.

East Timor Bishop says Indonesian troops kill 11 rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 11 separatist rebels were killed
by Indonesian troops in recent days following a series of clashes
in the disputed territory of East Timor, Roman Catholic Bishop
Carlos Belo said Saturday.
	   However, Indonesia's military chief denied reports in Portugal
that his forces had carried out a massacre against the rebels.
	   Belo, a joint 1996 Nobel peace laureate, said those killed in
the village of Same, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of the
capital Dili, included a village chief, identified as Vicente Dean
Enbrade.
	   He said the soldiers also burned 30 houses and a priest's car in
neighboring Luring village.
	   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Friday he was
seriously disturbed by reports of civilian casualties which came as
the government of former colonial power Portugal suspended
U.N.-sponsored talks in New York with Indonesian officials over the
disputed territory.
	   The suspension followed reports of a massacre of civilians,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said in Lisbon Friday.
	   Indonesia's military's chief in East Timor Col. Suhartono
Suratman said there had been several clashes with rebels in recent
days.
	   ``There was no massacre,'' he said.
	   ``In fact, our soldiers and civilians have been killed by the
(rebels) and East Timorese youths.''
	   The New York talks were to discuss an Indonesian proposal to
grant broad autonomy to the half-island territory, which is located
1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of the Indonesian capital,
Jakarta.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after invading it
when Portuguese colonial rule ended. The United Nations still
regards Portugal as the legal authority in East Timor.
	   The situation in East Timor has been tense in recent weeks after
at least two clashes between Indonesian soldiers and their civilian
supporters and rebel fighters.
	   In the village of Alas, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast
of Dili, East Timor's provincial capital, a local chief was killed
by the military last week, military sources said.
	   The military had earlier accused the chief of leading a Nov. 9
attack against one of its posts, in which three soldiers and one
rebel were killed. Rebels took 13 soldiers captive during that raid
and continue to hold two soldiers captive.
	   In Baucau village, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the Dili, a
chief of another village was killed by rebel fighters.
	   Suhatono said seven suspects were being interrogated in relation
to the deaths of eight soldiers and civilians.

West Indies top 300 in provincial match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies topped 300 in
the first innings on Saturday, day two of their four-day match
against Free State at Springbok Park.
	   Carl Hooper gave the decisive boost with 64 runs, before they
were dismissed for 316 at lunch.
	   The match is the final warm up before the start of the five-test
series against South Africa in Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   The early morning belonged to the young Victor Mpitsang, who
took two quick wickets to get rid of overnight batsman Stuart
Jacobs and, in the very next ball, Ridley Jacobs.
	   Nixon McLean stuck around with Hooper, delivering some clubbing
blows as is his custom, and he scored a pesky 46. Added to the 18
scored by Mervyn Dillon, it was enough to allow Hooper to score his
third successive big total of the tour, which bodes well for the
West Indies before the first test in Johannesburg.
	   Apart from Mpitsang's early spell, none of the Free State
bowlers were particularly impressive, with Johan van der Wath
ending with the best figures of three for 57 off his 20 overs.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Belgian police, helping Dutch
detectives hunt for the attackers of the wife of Royal Philips
Electronics President Cor Boonstra, have searched houses in and
around the northern city of Antwerp, Dutch media reported Saturday.
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, was kidnapped, brutally beaten,
handcuffed, strangled and left for dead in a deserted car park in
the western Dutch town of Hoek van Holland last Friday.

serious head injury and was nearly blinded in the attack. She was
able to speak to Dutch investigators for the first time late
Friday, according to newspaper reports Saturday.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes, who remains in a Hague hospital in stable
condition, reportedly told police that she was bundled into a car
in the Belgian city of Antwerp, close to the Dutch border.
	   Police have, 5th graf previous.

NATO exercise in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ NATO began a two-day military
exercise in this Alpine nation Saturday _ the first time alliance
maneuvers are held in this former Yugoslav republic.
	   The operation, code-named Exercise Cooperative Adventure
Exchange 1998, is primarily intended to conduct peace support
operations and rehearse ``medical interoperability,'' especially
with the budding member nations.
	   Eight fully fledged NATO members were taking part in the war
games along with ten nations of the organization's Partnership for
Peace program. The exercise will be commanded by four-star Gen.
Guiseppe Artito of Italy.
	   In a mock-scenario, on the country's south-eastern border with
Croatia, the troops will move into a deteriorating conflict between
two fictional countries, Fatlandia and Farmlandia, to quell an
outbreak of violence and maintain peace, NATO officials said.
	   More than 5,500 troops and officers will participate in the
closed operation, using about 2,000 vehicles. Over a fifth of the
force will be Slovene soldiers.
	   Slovenia, which declared independence from the former Yugoslav
federation in 1991, became a member of the Partnership for Peace
program in 1995 . The country of two million is also listed as a
serious contender in NATO's envisaged enlargement.
	   NATO officials have denied recent speculation that the
activities were related to efforts to contain the conflict in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia's restive southern province where the United
States and its allies are seeking to mediate talks for a peaceful
solution.

Train workers continue strike ahead of European walkout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two days ahead of a Europe-wide rail strike, train
traffic remained disrupted in parts of southern France Saturday as
workers extended their walkout for a twelfth day.
	   Meanwhile, French train conductors' unions have called a
nation-wide strike for next Friday, saying they lack sufficient
staff.
	   Rail traffic across France is often disrupted by walkouts. In
late 1995, train workers brought France to a near standstill over a
government plan to reduce benefits.
	   In the region surrounding Marseille, in southern France, only
one of five local lines was running Saturday. Two out of three
trains were operating on long-distance and high-speed routes.
	   Rail workers there want the national rail company to hire 30
more train conductors by the end of the year.
	   Adding to travelers' woes, train traffic across France was set
to slow Sunday evening before coming to a standstill Monday, as
railway workers in six European countries protest liberalization
plans.
	   Traffic is expected to come to a halt in France, Spain, Belgium,
Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions will hand out leaflets to
commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands in a bid
to stop plans to further privatize the sector.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from strongman Suharto, Indonesian head of state B.J. Habibie
launched a commission of inquiry on Saturday into corruption
allegations against his predecessor and one-time mentor. The probe
into Suharto's wealth appears to be a major concession to
protesting students who have fought bloody street battles with the
military. The students have demanded that Suharto, 77, be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during his 32 years as
president of the Southeast Asian nation. About 200 students staged
a protest near Suharto's residence Saturday, where the ex-president
has lived as a virtual recluse since quitting amid riots and
protests on May 21. (INDONESIA)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South
Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a
suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders
not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula.
President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news
conference, pledged to ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S.
endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He called for full
access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility
and said the North must not develop missiles. On the first of two
days in South Korea, Clinton also met with business leaders to hear
their prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track.
Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia
trip that began in Japan. (CLINTON-ASIA)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspection teams went to work as usual
Saturday as a new dispute appeared to be developing over documents
related to Iraq's biological and chemical weapons. At least four
cars with inspectors pulled out of U.N. headquarters in Baghdad on
the fourth consecutive day of field work since the teams returned
from Bahrain, where they were evacuated after the United States
threatened missile strikes. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the inspections, would say
only that ``We are carrying on with our activities.'' UNSCOM is not
making public how many teams are working each day or where they are
going. Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts
for the UNSCOM teams, has said they visited more than 23 sites in
and out of Baghdad during inspections from Wednesday through
Friday. (IRAQ)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ One day after receiving control over
more West Bank land, the Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel to
cease Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank and move ahead
with the latest Mideast peace accord. An Israeli withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank went smoothly on Friday, giving the
Palestinians control over an additional 2 percent of the territory
and upgrading their authority in 7 percent of the land. Israeli
settlers, who opposes the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace deal with
the Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West Bank
hilltops to prevent them from being handed over in the future. A
statement from the Palestinian Cabinet issued early Saturday after
an all-night session in the West Bank city of Hebron said
``settlements would destroy the peace process, stability and
security.'' (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said
Saturday he would take personal control over the investigation into
the killing of Galina Starovoitova, a prominent member of
parliament. In a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, Yeltsin said he was
``shocked and indignant'' over the death of Starovoitova, who was
shot to death by unknown assailants Friday night. Yeltsin said the
``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and
severely punished,'' the telegram said, according to the Interfax
news agency. Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin and a team
of investigators arrived in St. Petersburg on Saturday following
Yeltsin's orders to security chiefs to use all means to solve the
crime. (RUSSIA-ATTACK)

Tense Central African Republic braces for assembly polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Violence-prone Central
African Republic is preparing to put democracy to the test on
Sunday when more than 840 candidates participate in the first round
of legislative polls.
	   The vote is going ahead despite growing concerns the elections
could trigger ethnic violence or reignite insurrection by the
military.
	   Despite President Ange-Felix Patasse's efforts to postpone the
vote, the first round voting will go ahead as planned, the election
commission said Friday.
	   Elections officials, however, have conceded that facilities for
polling stations in some outlying areas have not received proper
election equipment or ballots. Other areas have failed to complete
voter registration.
	   At stake in the vote are 109 parliamentary seats, the vast
majority of which are now controlled by Patasse's ruling Movement
for the Liberation of the People of Centrafrique, or MLPC.
	   At least 23 opposition parties are putting up candidates, many
chosen on ethnic lines _ a move that threatens to exacerbate
already tense relations between the country's various groups.
	   Since May 1996, mutinous soldiers have staged three major
rebellions against Patasse, whose election win in 1993 ended more
than a decade of army rule.
	   At least five people have been killed in recent weeks of
pre-election violence that authorities say was linked to ethnic
rivalries.
	   Armed political supporters attacked opposition groups in the
eastern towns of Rafai and Bangassou in recent days.
	   Troops from the capital Bangui were sent to the area to try and
quell the clashes and have stayed on for increased security during
the voting, state-run radio reported.
	   Violent crime is rampant in the Central African Republic, where
armed bandits rob motorists and rival groups fight for influence.
	   For years, French troops helped maintain a semblance of
stability in the Central African Republic until they pulled out
earlier this year. A United Nations peacekeeping force replaced the
French.
	   Independent from French colonial rule since 1960, the Central
African Republic has lurched from one crisis to the next for much
of that time.
	   Through the 1960s and '70s, the Central African Republic fell
under the tyrannical rule of former army Col. Jean-Bedel Bokassa,
who in 1977 declared himself emperor of the Central African Empire
and spent about a quarter of the country's annual foreign earnings
on his coronation.
	   Deposed in 1979 during a bloodless coup, Bokassa was accused of
corruption, murder, torture and cannibalism.
	   In his wake, the Central African Republic remains a troubled and
isolated country that at times appears to be teetering on anarchy.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine military chief of
staff Gen. Fabian Ver, once the chief aide to the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, has died at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand
following a long illness, a family spokesman said Saturday. He was
78.
	   Ver was one of the most powerful figures during the 20-year
Marcos administration, heading the presidential security force
before being appointed by Marcos as his chief of staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after the autocratic
leader was ousted in the ``people power'' revolt in February of
1986.
	   Mel Amado Jr., a spokesman for the Ver family, said the former
general succumbed to a ``lung malfunction complication'' early
Saturday at an undisclosed hospital in Bangkok.
	   Ver was rushed by his eldest daughter, Helma Ver Tuazon, to the
private hospital after he started experiencing shortness of breath,
Amado said.
	   Before he died, Ver was able to talk on the telephone to his
wife, Aida, and his youngest daughter Faida in California, sons
Wyrlo and Rexor in Hawaii, and another son, Irwin, in San
Francisco, Amado said.
	   Ver underwent lung surgery last year and a gall bladder
operation early this year, which may have led to a deterioration of
his health.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, quoting a Philippine embassy
officer in Bangkok, said the Ver family is making arrangements to
fly the former general's remains to Manila.
	   Former President Corazon Aquino, who succeeded Marcos, had
banned the return of Ver and his three sons, all former military
officers, on grounds that they posed a security threat.
	   Fidel Ramos, who succeeded Aquino, continued the ban. Ramos was
Ver's deputy under the Marcos regime but later led rebel troops in
the 1986 revolt.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver rose from the rank of private to four-star general in his
four decades in the country's military.
	   He served as an intelligence officer during World War II and
gained fame in the anti-Huk campaign in the 1950s, when the
government suppressed a Communist-led peasant rebellion in the
Philippines.
	   Ver was accused of involvement in the 1983 assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., Mrs. Aquino's husband, at
Manila's airport but was acquitted while Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
The trial, however, failed to determine whether Marcos or his
associates ordered the assassination.
	   Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in absence
and the case against him had been shelved.
	   In a radio address on Saturday, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said police and military intelligence have determined the
Vers are no longer a threat to security.
	   He said he has ordered that passports be given to members of the
Ver family so they can return home.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos follower, had said that although Ver
would have to face charges in the Aquino murder, he could not be
forced to identify the mastermind of the assassination.
	   Marcos' widow, Imelda, said she was ``deeply saddened'' by Ver's
death.
	   ``The last time I spoke to him on the telephone, I was telling
him that I am praying so that you will be able to come home and
finally find ultimate vindication,'' Mrs. Marcos said.

Serbia publishes its own peace proposal for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After rejecting a U.S.-sponsored
plan, Serbia published Saturday its own peace proposal for Kosovo,
envisaging a form of self-rule but keeping the province firmly
within Serbia. Ethnic Albanian leaders are likely to ignore it.
	   Saturday's publication of the Serbian plan came amid escalating
tensions in Kosovo, following accusations that ethnic Albanian
rebels ambushed a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, a Serbian Media Center said, when guerrillas fired an
anti-tank round into their vehicle and then followed up with small
arms.
	   Although the attack could not be independently confirmed, it
indicated persistent violence despite an official cease-fire.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic scheduled new talks with
ethnic Albanian leaders for next Wednesday in the provincial
capital Pristina _ a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians did not
show up for the talks earlier in the week and before that.
	   Milutinovic dismissed Wednesday a U.S. proposal as giving too
much power to the independence-minded ethnic Albanians, who
comprise 90 per cent of Kosovo's population of 2 million.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia which is the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Published Saturday in the state-run daily Politika as a proposal
for an interim three-year agreement on Kosovo, Serbia's plan gives
its province ``broad self-rule,'' stressing any permanent
settlement has to respect Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and
fall within the legal framework of both the Serbian and Yugoslav
constitutions.
	   According to the document, Kosovo would have its own two-chamber
parliament _ the lower one would reflect the ethnic distribution in
the Albania-majority province while the upper chamber would have
equal representation from all ethnic communities.
	   In case any future assembly decision conflicted with the
interest of a particular ethnic community, the Serbian assembly
would have the overriding say. The province, in turn, would have
representation in both the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments.
	   Kosovo's assembly would adopt a statute for the province, select
a presidency, elect an executive council as governing body and name
an Ombudsman for the protection of human rights.
	   According to the Serbian plan, Kosovo would have its own local
police force, appointed by each municipality and reflecting its
ethnic composition. Local policemen would have only sidearms. Each
ethnic community would set up its own local courts and name a
National Council to look after its rights.
	   The Serbian plan also calls for elections in Kosovo within nine
months, adding signatories of the interim agreement would review it
after a three-year period.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes since
Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on
Kosovo separatists in February.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MATSUYAMA, Japan (AP) _ Chikayo Yamazaki held on to her
one-stroke lead at 139 after Saturday's second round in the 65
million yen (dlrs 541,000) 54-hole Daio Seishi Elleair Ladies Open
golf tournament.
	   The 34-year-old Japanese, seeking her first Japan LPGA victory

three bogeys for an even score on the 6,352-yard, par-72 Elleair
Golf Club Matsuyama course in southwestern Japan.
	   ``I'm lucky to still be ahead,'' she said. ``Everyone has a
chance to win now. So I have to keep focused.''
	   One stroke off at 140 was Aki Takamura, also of Japan, who shot
a 71.
	   ``My shots feel good. What I have to work on now is the
putting,'' Takamura said.
	   Li Wen-lin of Taiwan and South Korean Won Jai-sook are a stroke
behind tied for third place.
	   The winner will receive prize money of 11.7 million yen (dlrs
97,500).

Indian fishermen released by Pakistan sail home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Approximately 191 Indian fishermen,
including 26 children, sailed home Saturday after Pakistan released
them from prisons as a goodwill gesture to its often hostile
neighbor India, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said.
	   The authorities arrested these fishermen along with their 31
boats during 1996 and 1997 on charges of illegal fishing in
Pakistani waters.
	   They were released on Nov. 11, but could not sail home
immediately because their boats needed repair.
	   The boats sailed from a small island near the port city of
Karachi and were heading towards the Indian state of Gujarat, the
APP said.
	   Gujarat is some 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Karachi.
	   The boats will take at least 45 hours to reach their destination
as many are still not fully operational and are being towed, the
APP quoted an unidentified Indian Fisheries Department official as
saying. Normally the journey takes around 35 hours, he said.
	   Pakistan and India routinely arrest each others' fishermen for
trespassing in their waters.
	   Islamabad promised to release the fishermen during talks last
month between India and Pakistan.
	   A Pakistani delegation is expected to leave within next two
weeks to secure the release of 149 Pakistani fishermen in Indian
jails, the APP said.

China's Jiang puts spotlight on ties with Russia, Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite the economic miseries besetting its two
most powerful neighbors, China plans to highlight closer, smoother
ties with both Russia and Japan during visits by President Jiang
Zemin next week.
	   Jiang leaves Sunday on a two-nation tour that first takes him to
Moscow, where the two countries will celebrate their recent
cooperation in the diplomatic arena and reaffirm efforts to boost
trade.
	   The informal meeting with ailing President Boris Yeltsin, the
sixth summit between the two leaders, is not expected to dredge up
any controversy, but the Nov. 25-30 Japan leg of the tour could
prove more challenging.
	   The overall success of Jiang's tour will hinge on whether he
manages to collect in Tokyo an apology for Japan's wartime
aggression deemed sincere enough to enable the two countries to
finally put the matter to rest.
	   ``If Japanese leaders want to develop relations with Asian
countries, particularly China, they must clearly acknowledge and
atone for these historical issues left over from the war,'' says
Zhang Yunling, director of the Institute of Japanese Studies at the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
	   Japan's invasion and occupation of much of China earlier this
century, and wartime atrocities committed by its Imperial Army,
have often haunted its relations with Beijing.
	   China is hoping that Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese
president since World War II, will enable the two countries to put
the past behind them and focus on building stronger, stabler ties.
	   Chinese officials have stressed they expect Japan to accord
Jiang the same treatment given to South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung, who during his state visit to Tokyo earlier this month
received from Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi Tokyo's fullest apology
yet for its colonial rule.
	   Japanese officials in Tokyo said they were still working out
details of the apology with the Chinese side and could not give a
``preview.''
	   ``Concerning the Japanese attitude to the wartime, we have
already made many statements and our position is clear to
everybody. We have no intention to change it,'' Foreign Ministry
deputy press secretary Masaki Okawa told reporters in a recent
press conference.
	   Both Tokyo and Beijing would like put their ties on a less
contentious footing commensurate with their close economic
relationship _ China is Japan's second largest trading partner and
Japan is China's largest, with annual trade volume of more than
dlrs 60 billion.
	   China's relations with Russia were no less troubled over three
decades of enmity between the Chinese and the former Soviet
Communist parties, which split bitterly in the late 1950s.
	   Capping a rapprochement that began with a visit by
then-President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989, last year the two
countries declared a ``strategic partnership.'' Their shared
interest in cooperating to counter U.S. influence ensures that
Jiang's visit to Moscow requires no diplomatic breakthroughs of the
sort needed in Tokyo.
	   ``I'd like to note with special joy that the two nations have
achieved successful cooperation on many international issues,''
Jiang told the Russian news agency Itar-Tass in an exclusive
interview Thursday.
	   Jiang pointed to recent joint efforts to defuse the Iraqi crisis
as evidence of growing closeness, saying that China and Russia had
a special responsibility to help promote world peace and stability.
	   China and Russia also recently sided together in their staunch
opposition to a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have
allowed NATO to enforce a peace accord for the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
	   To help its struggling neighbor, Jiang was planning to offer
Russia economic aid as well as possible shipments of meat and other
food products, Itar-Tass reported Friday.
	   Beijing and Moscow are putting the finishing touches on final
accords settling disputes over their 4,300 kilometer (2,700-mile)
border and they continue to set new deals for purchases of advanced
military technology _ submarines, fighters and other armaments _
China covets for its modernizing army.
	   The main issue of concern for Jiang and Yeltsin will be lagging
commerce between the two countries. Trade fell 10 percent last year
to dlrs 6.1 billion and the two want to raise the total to dlrs 20
billion by 2000.
	   Russia has blamed China for the trade woes, complaining of
Chinese limits on its exports of aircraft, fertilizer and ferrous
metals.

Ugandan army to distribute more than a million condoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, (AP) _ The Ugandan armed forces plans to distribute
more 1 million condoms in an attempt to control the spreads of AIDS
among soldiers, it was reported Saturday.
	   The decision by Uganda Peoples Defense Forces to buy 1.2 million
condoms at a cost of dlrs 8,000 follows dwindling supplies in the
country's public health services, said The Monitor newspaper.
	   The number of Ugandan soldiers is estimated at 45,000.
	   A government-owned vernacular newspaper, Bukedde, on Saturday
quoted the officer in charge of AIDS control in the forces, Maj.
Rubaramira Rulanga, as saying that soldiers should stop being
bashful and use condoms to protect themselves from the disease,
which has no known cure.
	   Uganda is one of the few countries in Africa with an aggressive
campaign on AIDS prevention. The government's open policy in
dealing the disease has attracted massive foreign assistance.
	   The East African nation, which had the highest AIDS rate in the
world in 1982, is the only African country south of the Sahara to
achieve a decline in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   More than 2 million Ugandans _ more than 10 percent of the
population _ are infected. More than 1.8 million have died.

Singapore minister defends human rights record in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore Cabinet minister has praised
China's human rights record, saying that those who judge a
country's civil liberties should take into account economic and
cultural factors.
	   China ``should be given a Nobel Prize for human rights'' because
it has pulled millions of its inhabitants out of poverty,
Information Minister George Yeo said in a speech Friday, according
to a text released Saturday.
	   ``It is absurd to talk about human rights independent of the
overall economic development of a society,'' he said at a
conference on human rights in Hamburg, Germany. ``Cultural
differences and the issue of development cannot be simply swept
aside.''
	   Yeo faulted Westerners ``who criticize China for the lack of
human rights, while at the same time, choosing to ignore what the
present Chinese government has done for a large number of its
people.''
	   But he conceded that there is still room for improvement in many
parts of China, where ``local authorities still behave in a
corrupt, cruel and arbitrary manner.''
	   Regardless, human rights should not be taken out of a
historical, cultural and economic context, he said.
	   Largely dismissing the concept of universal human rights, he
proposed instead a more balanced compromise between Eastern and
Western views on the often contentious issue.
	   ``It would be wrong to equate universal human rights and
responsibilities with Western democratic values. If the starting
point is that Western democratic systems are morally superior
embodiments of human rights, our dialogue would not go very far.''

Serbia publishes its own peace proposal for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia published its own peace
proposal for Kosovo on Saturday, envisaging a form of self-rule but
keeping the province firmly within Serbia. Ethnic Albanian leaders
are likely to ignore it.
	   Publication of the Serbian plan came amid escalating tensions in
Kosovo, following accusations that ethnic Albanian rebels ambushed
a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen and severely
wounding three others.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the Serbian Media Center said, when guerrillas fired an
anti-tank round into their vehicle and then followed up with small
arms.
	   Although the attack could not be independently confirmed, it
indicated persistent violence despite an official cease-fire.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic scheduled new talks with
ethnic Albanian leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital,
Pristina _ a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians did not show up
for talks earlier in the week or others before that.
	   Milutinovic dismissed a U.S. peace proposal Wednesday, saying it
would give too much power to the independence-minded ethnic
Albanians who comprise 90 per cent of Kosovo's population of 2
million.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, which is the dominant republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in
February.
	   Published Saturday in the state-run daily Politika as a proposal
for an interim three-year agreement on Kosovo, Serbia's plan gives
its province ``broad self-rule,'' stressing that any permanent
settlement has to respect Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and
fall within the legal framework of both the Serbian and Yugoslav
constitutions.
	   According to the document, Kosovo would have its own two-chamber
parliament _ the lower one would reflect the ethnic distribution in
the province while the upper chamber would have equal
representation from all ethnic communities.
	   In case any future assembly decision conflicted with the
interest of a particular ethnic community, the Serbian assembly
would have the overriding say. The province, in turn, would have
representation in both the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments.
	   Kosovo's assembly would adopt a statute for the province, select
a presidency, elect an executive council as governing body and name
an ombudsman for the protection of human rights.
	   According to the Serbian plan, Kosovo would have its own local
police force, appointed by each municipality and reflecting its
ethnic composition. Local policemen would carry only sidearms. Each
ethnic community would set up its own local courts and name a
National Council to look after its rights.
	   The Serbian plan also calls for elections in Kosovo within nine
months, adding signatories of the interim agreement would review it
after a three-year period.

Ugandan army to distribute more than a million condoms

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, (AP) _ The Ugandan armed forces plans to distribute
more 1 million condoms in an attempt to control the spreads of AIDS
among soldiers, it was reported Saturday.
	   The decision by Uganda Peoples Defense Forces to buy 1.2 million
condoms at a cost of dlrs 8,000 follows dwindling supplies in the
country's public health services, said The Monitor newspaper.
	   The number of Ugandan soldiers is estimated at 45,000.
	   A government-owned vernacular newspaper, Bukedde, on Saturday
quoted the officer in charge of AIDS control in the forces, Maj.
Rubaramira Rulanga, as saying that soldiers should stop being
bashful and use condoms to protect themselves from the disease,
which has no known cure.
	   Uganda is one of the few countries in Africa with an aggressive
campaign on AIDS prevention. The government's open policy in
dealing the disease has attracted massive foreign assistance.
	   The East African nation, which had the highest AIDS rate in the
world in 1982, is the only African country south of the Sahara to
achieve a decline in new infections.
	   The overall rate dropped from a peak of 14 percent in 1990 to
9.5 percent last year, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   More than 2 million Ugandans _ more than 10 percent of the
population _ are infected. More than 1.8 million have died.

Belgian lawyer files complaint against Kabila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Days ahead of a planned visit to
Brussels by Congolese President Laurent Kabila, a Belgian lawyer
said Saturday he had filed a complaint against the Congolese leader
and two of his aides for violation of international law.
	   Lawyer Pierre Himpler said he filed the legal action Friday on
behalf of two clients, a Belgian and a Congolese from the Tutsi
ethnic group.
	   Himpler accused Kabila and his aides of ``making declarations
inciting hatred and racial war'' which led to ethnic killings of
Tutsis in the Congolese capital last summer.
	   Kabila, whose troops are still fighting against a rebel force
that includes many Tutsis, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene and other top Belgian and European Union officials
during a three-day visit starting Tuesday.
	   In a telephone interview, Himpler said he based his case on a
1993 law that allows Belgian courts to try people accused of
serious violations of the Geneva Conventions.
	   The lawyer acknowledged that Kabila, as a serving head of state
could likely claim diplomatic immunity from prosecution. However he
said his clients hoped lodging the complaint would to draw
attention to rights abuses in Congo.
	   The other Congolese officials named in Himpler's complaint are
Information Minister Didier Mumengi and Kabila's communications
advisor Dominique Sakombi Inogo.

Rebel grenade attack kills one, injures 40 in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim militants lobbed a
grenade at a police station in a crowded shopping area in troubled
Kashmir Saturday, but it exploded short of the target. At least one
person was killed and 40 others were wounded, police said.
	   The grenade mostly hit shoppers in Anantnag, a town 50
kilometers (30 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state, a police statement said.
	   Four policemen were among those injured. Five civilians were
hospitalized in critical condition, the statement said.
	   Police cordoned off the area, looking for the suspects.
Shopkeepers pulled down the shutters, accusing police of beating
innocent people.
	   Muslim militants have been waging a secessionist war since 1989
in the only Muslim majority Jammu-Kashmir state in a predominantly
Hindu India. More than 15,000 people have been killed in the
fighting.
	   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of training and arming the
rebels, a charge Pakistan denies.

Russian government fails to approve budget draft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government Saturday failed to approve
any of three proposed versions of a draft budget for 1999 and
called for more revisions, including changes on external debt
servicing and tax reform.
	   ``The government's presidium didn't accept any of the proposed
plans on the 1999 budget,'' Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
said after a four-hour meeting of key government ministers. ``More
work is needed,'' he said.
	   The government has been trying to persuade foreign creditors to
restructure at least a portion of some dlrs 17 billion payments due
in 1999.
	   ``Only when we know how much we will have to pay on our external
debts (next year), we will be able to set our fiscal policy,''
Shapovalyants said.
	   The government hopes to complete drafting its 1999 budget by
Dec. 1, but it will require more details on the planned tax reform
for next year, Shapovalyants said.
	   ``We have to finalize volumes of (expected) tax collections and
set new tax brackets,'' he said.
	   The three versions put the disparity between revenues and
spending at either 150 billion rubles (dlrs 9 billion), 280 billion
rubles (dlrs 16 billion), or 360 billion rubles (dlrs 21 billion),
according to one senior government official, who spoke Friday on
the condition of anonymity.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met Saturday with an
International Monetary Fund delegation after the meeting to discuss
the country's economic situation, the Interfax news agency said.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said on Friday that
Russia will ask the IMF for new terms on repaying the dlrs 4.6
billion due to the lending organization next year.
	   New IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August. The IMF
has insisted it will not release any more money until the
government comes up with a comprehensive plan to combat the
economic crisis and starts implementing it.

Red tape may bar many from registering to vote in South Africa

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Standing in lines that snake
through government offices, South Africans are fighting red tape
for the right to vote next year.
	   At the main office here, several have lost the battle with
bureaucracy and have been sent home because they lacked the proper
documents or the correct number of photos.
	   The government's plan is to create the first national voters
roll by registering 25 million people in three days, beginning
Friday.
	   To register, people must use bar-coded identification books
introduced in 1986 to gradually replace the older versions. But
millions of voters lack the documents.
	   Given the long lines and confusion about the process, it is
unlikely that many of them will have the proper identification, or
a special receipt saying they applied for one in time.
	   The problems with bar-coded identification books could have
political consequences. Fewer whites, the bulwark support of
opposition parties, have the proper documents than blacks, which
could mean a boon for the governing African National Congress.
	   During 1994's all-race elections, which ended apartheid, voters
only needed to show up on election day with any identification and
at any polling place. Registration was scrapped to reduce tension
before the historic vote.
	   Requiring the bar-coded identification to register was the
brainchild of the Independent Electoral Commission, which since has
tried to reverse the plan after learning about the backlogs.
	   But the ANC government believes the backlogs are not that bad
and has stuck by the idea, inviting criticism that it wants to
exclude white voters.
	   More than 80 percent of blacks have the bar-coded documents,
compared with 65 percent of whites.
	   It was more in the interest of blacks to obtain them. As
apartheid was ending, many rushed to obtain the bar-coded
identification to replace their apartheid-era documents.
	   Now, record numbers of people are lining up for new
identification documents, up 60 percent over last year, said Home
Affairs spokesman Manafe Makewla.
	   That doesn't mean they get them.
	   A dejected Edwin Rasekwere, 40, who is black, was told at the
Home Affairs window he needed a birth certificate from a
magistrate's court.
	   ``Maybe I'm going to spend the whole day there,'' he said.
	   Gary Gilmore, 46, a white South African, was turned away because
he didn't have enough photographs.
	   ``So now I have to decide if I want to come back into this''
line, he said. ``And that will depend on my workload next week.''

Kalmyk leader says autonomy demand misunderstood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin, the
leader of a southern Russian region said Saturday that his call for
greater autonomy from Moscow was misunderstood.
	   Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of Kalmykia, said Tuesday on
Russian television that the federal government had failed to
deliver subsidies to his republic and that he would push for
secession.
	   ``The whole meaning of my statement came down to the point that
Kalmykia for 400 years has been a reliable and stable part of
Russia and that we do not see ourselves outside the Russian
Federation,'' Ilyumzhinov said in his letter, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Russian Security Council met Saturday to discuss
Ilyumzhinov's televised statement, but did not reveal what action
they might recommend.
	   Yeltsin denounced Ilyumzhinov's statements Friday, saying that
``any attempts to revise the federal structure of Russia, or
rewrite our constitution are very dangerous in our situation,''
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   Yakushkin said he could not rule out Yeltsin's ordering direct
presidential rule over Kalmykia in response to Ilyumzhinov's call
for greater autonomy.
	   After the Security Council meeting, Ilyumzhinov told reporters
that he firmly believed the region should remain a part of Russia.
	   ``All of my acts were always aimed at preservation and
consolidation of the Russian Federation,'' he said. But, he added,
regions should be granted more economic rights to cope with the
country's financial crisis.

Actor Robert De Niro accuses France of mistreating visitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Robert De Niro has told a French newspaper he is
still angry about his questioning by a French judge investigating a
prostitution ring, adding ``France's guests deserve to be treated
better.''
	   In an interview published Saturday in the daily Le Figaro, De
Niro denied he ever said he would give up his Legion of Honor award
or that he would never return to France following his questioning.
	   ``I simply said I was tempted to do that,'' De Niro was quoted
as saying. ``Even today, I am still angry.''
	   He added: ``I am not the only visitor to France who has been
mistreated.''
	   De Niro was hauled in for a day of questioning in February by a
French judge as a witness in an international prostitution network.
The actor denied paying any woman for sex, and angrily accused the
judge of leading a ``witch hunt.''
	   De Niro was in Paris at the time for the filming of the movie
``Ronin,'' directed by John Frankenheimer, which is to be released
in France next week.
	   The trial of the prostitution ring's alleged leaders began last
week and is expected to last until next Wednesday.

Bashir says thaw with Ethiopia, Eritrea imminent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir Saturday warned
opposition groups based in neighboring Eritrea and Ethiopia that
Sudan was about to mend fences with the two Horn of Africa nations.
	   Relations between Sudan and its two neighbors have been fraught
with tension for several years. Khartoum accuses them of aiding
Sudanese rebels, while Ethiopia and Eritrea level similar charges.
	   If it materializes, a rapprochement between Khartoum and the two
countries would greatly undermine the Sudanese opposition, possibly
ending its freedom to use their territories to launch attacks
against government forces in the east and southeast of Sudan.
	   Bashir, who seized power in Sudan in a 1989 military coup, said
an agreement ending hostilities with Ethiopia and Eritrea would be
signed soon and that opposition politicians based there would
either have to return home or become refugees.
	   ``We want peace and we want to develop our country,'' said
Bashir, speaking in the state of Gedarif near the Ethiopian border.
	   ``They (opposition) will have only two options: either return
home and find out that we have opened the door to political
association and they can organize themselves to lead opposition
groups, or they can go to refugee camps.''
	   Bashir also claimed that Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
had turned down a request for arms from Sudanese opposition groups,
who also demanded a halt to overtures by Addis Ababa toward
Khartoum.
	   ``But Zenawi told them no such thing was going to happen
anymore. There will be no border war with Sudan, and no incursions
anymore,'' Bashir said.

Austria takes security precautions after reported terrorist warning
</HEADLINE>
against U.S. facilities &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. Embassy press release, ambassador's
comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian police have taken all
precautions for the protection of U.S. facilities in Austria after
a reported terrorist warning, a police official said Saturday.
	   The U.S. State Department said Friday that the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna had received credible information concerning the possibility
of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated
facilities in Austria.
	   In a similar press release, the U.S. Embassy in Vienna on
Saturday said Austrian authorities had been informed ``and are
taking measures to maximize the security of those facilities and
provide for public safety.''
	   It added, ``As noted in the Nov. 12 Worldwide Caution Public
Announcement, American citizens are reminded to maintain a high
level of vigilance. This guidance is especially appropriate at this
time in Austria.
	   ``Organizers of any gathering in which large numbers of American
citizens are participants shold ensure that appropriate security
measures are taken or, where feasible, consider postponement.''
	   U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall told Austrian radio that the U.S.
mission was continuing its work despite a ``credible threat.'' She
was appreciative of the Austrian authorities' prompt and efficient
response given to the U.S. security needs.
	   Earlier, the Vienna police official, who did not give his name,
said that Austrian police had ``no concrete indications'' of
anti-U.S. plans in Austria.
	   Nevertheless, the street on which the U.S. Embassy is located,
has been permanently closed to traffic since Nov. 19, the official
confirmed. He did not elaborate on other security measures taken
except to refer to ``heightened surveillance'' of the embassy area.

Spanish union rallies to demand 35-hour week, more jobless
</HEADLINE>
benefits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's unions Saturday announced they will
stage some 50 rallies in towns and cities across Spain on Dec. 3 to
demand a 35-hour working week and greater financial assistance for
the unemployed.
	   In a press conference, Workers Commission leader Antonio
Gutierrez said workers' meetings would also be staged at large- and
medium-sized business and factories so that employers are made
aware of the union demands.
	   Candido Mendez, leader of Spain's other principal labor group,
the General Workers Union, said he hoped that after Dec. 3 the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar would
show itself to be flexible and thus avert more serious action by
the unions.
	   Gutierrez said that Spain's 1999 state budget would lead to
cutbacks in payments to the jobless. He warned that Aznar's
government also planned cutbacks in health and education.
	   Backing a reduction from a 40-hour to a 35-hour working week,
Gutierrez said that Spain's buoyant economy should ``lead to the
creation of more jobs and this calls for reorganization and a cut
in the working day.''
	   Despite continuous strong economic growth and low inflation in
recent years, Spain, at nearly 19 percent, still has one of the
highest unemployment rates in the 15-nation European Union.

Turkey cautions Italy against asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday harshly warned Italy against granting political asylum to
a Kurdish rebel leader freed by an Italian court.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said.
	   On Friday, an Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition to
countries where suspects faces the death penalty. Turkey said it
would appeal.
	   Ocalan was being held in a hospital outside Rome and it was not
clear when he'd be set free. The court ordered him to stay in Rome,
but that restriction could be lifted next month. The Turkish
newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge
if leaves Italy.
	   ``I have a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,''
Yilmaz said at a convention of his center-right Motherland Party.
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest
terrorist in the world.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in
Turkey on capital charges.
	   Laying black wreaths and honking horns in front of the Italian
embassy, Turks showed their outrage Saturday at the Italian court's
decision.
	   ``No to terrorism, today and forever'' read a banner hung across
a main boulevard where the embassy is located while loud speakers
blared patriotic songs. The embassy walls were sprayed with
graffiti denouncing the PKK.
	   Turkish businesses were boycotting Italian products and a
newspaper said the government canceled the purchase of five Italian
Agusta helicopters. The Turkish subsidiary of the Italian clothing
company Benetton said it would drape black cloth over the windows
of its 171 outlets in Turkey in protest against.
	   In Rome, the Foreign Ministry advised Italians to put off trips
to Turkey as a precaution.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema warned Turkey risked distancing
itself from the rest of Europe with its harshness toward Italy.
``Our aim is to be a bridge between Turkey and Europe,'' he said in
an interview with the Turkish newspaper Sabah published Saturday.
	   Other European countries have tried to stay out of the dispute,
but the United States has been pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan.
	   The Washington-based Human Rights Watch on Saturday said it
supports Italy's decision not to extradite Ocalan to Turkey, but
added that he should be ``held accountable for atrocities committed
under his leadership.''

Negotiating official blasts Congo rebels for childish conduct
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ A Southern African Development
Community official on Saturday blasted Congolese rebels for
childish conduct at peace negotiations, saying they had demanded
their country be divided with two separate governments.
	   The outburst from Kaire Mbuende, executive secretary of SADC,
came on the second day of the latest in a series of attempts to
settle a nearly four-month-old civil war in Congo.
	   Mbuende spoke as foreign ministers from South Africa, Tanzania,
Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana waited for the rebel delegation's
hour-late arrival, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The gathering reached agreement on a draft cease-fire agreement
on Friday, although any agreement is unlikely to carry much weight
until Congo President Laurent Kabila's government meets face to
face with the rebels.
	   Kabila has refused to do so.
	   Last minute changes proposed by the rebels on Saturday were not
made public, but Mbuende's comments indicated talks ended abruptly
on Friday after the rebels demanded their country be partitioned.
	   ``We think that this behavior is tantamount to that of bandits
and not statesmen,'' Mbuende said Saturday. ``They behave like
spoilt children and they think we owe them something and we have to
run after them.''
	   Despite the seeming disparity between the rebels and the
negotiators, Rebel leader Bizima Karaha told journalists on
Saturday that his movement would now ``seriously embark on the
peace process''.
	   Karaha on Friday said insurgents have enough weapons to keep
fighting until the government is toppled.
	   Countries that are backing Kabila with weapons and troops _
Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ did not attend the negotiations.
	   Kabila came to power last year after leading a rebellion that
overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a
rebel force composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians.
	   Kabila blames Rwanda and Uganda, who are backing the rebels, for
the war.

charges, the Interior Minister of Cyprus said Saturday that he had
submitted his resignation to President Glafcos Clerides.
	   Dinos Michaelides said his action followed a recommendation by
the attorney-general that a criminal investigation be launched into
allegations of corruption leveled against him.
	   He made the announcement as he left an extraordinary Cabinet
meeting. The cabinet began to debate whether to accept the attorney
general's recommendation after Michaelides left.
	   The minister has repeatedly denied the allegations, first made
by the head of Parliament's Watchdog Committee in a detailed report
listing more than 30 cases of corruption and improper action
resulting in the minister's enrichment.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysians angry over U.S.
Vice-President Al Gore's comments praising anti-government
activists can now call in to register their protest.
	   Calls to two phone numbers published in the government-backed
New Straits Times daily Saturday are answered by operators who are
compiling a list of all those offended by the remarks.
	   An operator who answered a call said the service was not run by
the government. He said he was under orders not to divulge the name
of the person providing the service or to identify himself.
	   The list of the callers' names will be published in a local
newspaper, the operator said.
	   In a speech this week, Gore expressed support for Malaysia's
political reform movement started by jailed former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   There was an international outcry when Anwar appeared at his
arraignment in September with a black eye and bruises, the result
of an apparent beating while in police custody.
	   While Anwar is being tried for abuse of power and illegal sex
acts _ charges that he denies _ the government has arrested several
hundred of his supporters for participating in rallies calling for
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation.
	   Anwar's trial resumes Monday after a weeklong recess to avoid
clashing with the summit of leaders from members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Gore was in Kuala Lumpur
to stand in for President Clinton during the APEC meeting.
	   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador John Malott defended Gore, saying he
had only called for democracy and was not inciting people to
violence, as some Malaysians have accused him of doing.
	   Malott said Malaysia could not be called a democracy just
because it held elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving
leader, has been in power for 17 years.
	   ``Democracy is not simply having elections,'' Malott said.
``Stalin held elections. Even Hitler held elections. Democracy is a
process of allowing all views to be heard, of allowing the
competition of ideas.''
	   Meanwhile, the head of the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,
Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, said in a statement issued Saturday that
Malaysians do not need any interference from abroad, especially by
the U.S.

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir Saturday warned
opposition groups based in neighboring Eritrea and Ethiopia that
Sudan was about to mend fences with the two Horn of Africa nations.
	   Relations between Sudan and its two neighbors have been fraught
with tension for several years. Ethiopia and Eritrea accuse Sudan
of supporting groups opposed to their governments. Khartoum levels
a similar charge against the two.
	   If it materializes, a rapprochement between Khartoum and the two
countries would greatly undermine the Sudanese opposition, possibly
ending its freedom to use their territories to launch attacks
against government forces in the east and southeast of Sudan.
	   Bashir, who seized power in Sudan in a 1989 military coup, said
an agreement ending hostilities with Ethiopia and Eritrea would be
signed soon and that opposition politicians based there would
either have to return home or become refugees.
	   ``We want peace and we want to develop our country,'' said
Bashir, speaking in the state of Gedarif near the Ethiopian border.
	   ``They (opposition) will have only two options: either return
home and find out that we have opened the door to political
association and they can organize themselves to lead opposition
groups, or they can go to refugee camps.''
	   Bashir also claimed that Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
had turned down a request for arms from Sudanese opposition groups,
who also demanded a halt to overtures by Addis Ababa toward
Khartoum.
	   ``But Zenawi told them no such thing was going to happen
anymore. There will be no border war with Sudan, and no incursions
anymore,'' Bashir said.

Federal Prosecutors issue new arrest warrant on Kurdish leader on
</HEADLINE>
new charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ The federal prosecutors office in
Karlsruhe on Saturday confirmed a new arrest warrant has been
issued on Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader who was
arrested earlier this month in Rome,
	   The confirmation came after Der Spiegel magazine reported
Saturday that new charges against Ocalan, who was previously sought
in Germany on a single charge of murder, included ``liquidation of
a string of dissidents,'' in the 1980s, and ``a series of arson
attacks in 1993.''
	   While federal prosecutor spokeswoman Eva Schuebel would not
confirm the individual charges mentioned by the Hamburg-based
Spiegel, she said she could confirm that a new arrest warrant with
updated information ``was being forwarded to Bonn'' as a formality.
	   Schuebel said that it did not automatically mean the Bonn
Justice Ministry would decide on asking for Ocalan's extradition.
	   On Friday, government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told reporters
that Germany has for now put off action on a 1990 arrest warrant to
allow Italian authorities to handle the case and because broader
Turkish terrorism charges against Ocalan should have priority.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 at Rome's airport off a flight from
Moscow and has asked for political asylum in Italy. A Rome court
freed him from detention Friday but ordered him to remain in the
capital.
	   With 500,000 Kurds living here, Germany has a clear stake in
Ocalan's fate. Already, thousands of Kurds have staged protests in
Germany since his arrest.
	   Germany banned Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in 1993
as an extremist organization after a series of terrorist attacks on
Turkish and German targets, an extension of the rebels' 14-year war
for autonomy from Turkey.
	   In 1996, Ocalan changed his strategy, renouncing violence in
Germany in hopes of getting the ban on legal PKK activity lifted.
	   Some 11,000 PKK activists are based in Germany despite the ban,
according to the country's domestic security agency.
	   Heye denied that fears of unrest in Germany influenced the
government's decision.
	   The case ``is in good hands'' in Italy, he said.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Standing in lines that snake
through government offices, South Africans are fighting red tape
for the right to vote next year.
	   At the main office here, several have lost the battle with
bureaucracy and have been sent home because they lacked the proper
documents or the correct number of photos.
	   The government's plan is to create the first national voters
roll by registering 25 million people in three days, beginning
Friday.
	   To register, people must use bar-coded identification books
introduced in 1986 to gradually replace the older versions. But
millions of voters lack the documents.
	   Given the long lines and confusion about the process, it is
unlikely that many of them will have the proper identification, or
a special receipt saying they applied for one in time.
	   The problems with bar-coded identification books could have
political consequences. Fewer whites, the bulwark support of
opposition parties, have the proper documents than blacks, which
could mean a boon for the governing African National Congress.
	   During 1994's all-race elections, which ended apartheid, voters
only needed to show up on election day with any identification and
at any polling place. Registration was scrapped to reduce tension
before the historic vote.
	   Requiring the bar-coded identification to register was the
brainchild of the Independent Electoral Commission, which since has
tried to reverse the plan after learning about the backlogs.
	   But the ANC government believes the backlogs are not that bad
and has stuck by the idea, inviting criticism that it wants to
exclude white voters.
	   More than 80 percent of blacks have the bar-coded documents,
compared with 65 percent of whites.
	   It was more in the interest of blacks to obtain them. As
apartheid was ending, many rushed to obtain the bar-coded
identification to replace their apartheid-era documents.
	   Now, record numbers of people are lining up for new
identification documents, up 60 percent over last year, said Home
Affairs spokesman Manafe Makewla.
	   That doesn't mean they get them.
	   A dejected Edwin Rasekwere, 40, who is black, was told at the
Home Affairs window he needed a birth certificate from a
magistrate's court.
	   ``Maybe I'm going to spend the whole day there,'' he said.
	   Gary Gilmore, 46, a white South African, was turned away because
he didn't have enough photographs.
	   ``So now I have to decide if I want to come back into this''
line, he said. ``And that will depend on my workload next week.''

Austria takes security precautions after reported terrorist warning

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with interior minister's comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian police have stepped up security
precautions for the protection of U.S. facilities in Austria after
a reported terrorist warning, Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said
Saturday.
	   The street on which the U.S. Embassy is located, has been
permanently closed to traffic since Nov. 19.
	   The U.S. State Department said Friday that the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna had received credible information concerning the possibility
of a terrorist act in the near future against American-affiliated
facilities in Austria.
	   In a similar press release, the U.S. Embassy in Vienna on
Saturday said Austrian authorities had been informed ``and are
taking measures to maximize the security of those facilities and
provide for public safety.''
	   It added, ``As noted in the Nov. 12 Worldwide Caution Public
Announcement, American citizens are reminded to maintain a high
level of vigilance. This guidance is especially appropriate at this
time in Austria.
	   ``Organizers of any gathering in which large numbers of American
citizens are participants shold ensure that appropriate security
measures are taken or, where feasible, consider postponement.''
	   Schloegl, who was asked for a comment outside a party meeting,
on Saturday confirmed that indications had been received in recent
days of possible terrorist attacks against U.S. facilities in
Austria. As a result ``security precautions have been strongly
increased,'' he added.
	   The minister, as quoted by the Austria Press Agency, said he did
not want to contribute to unease but caution was warranted.
	   U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Hall told Austrian radio that the U.S.
mission was continuing its work despite a ``credible threat.'' She
said she was appreciative of the Austrian authorities' prompt and
efficient response given to the U.S. security needs.

Dutch beat Americans in men's worlds

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending Olympic champion the Netherlands
maintained a perfect record with an easier-than-expected victory
Saturday against the United States 15-12, 15-6, 15-11 in the second
round of the Men's World Volleyball Championships.
	   The United States, with losses already to Russia and Italy, is
among four teams in Group H with no wins. The top two teams in each
of the two groups advance to the finals.
	   ``This was a very important game for us,'' said Dutch head coach
Toon Gerbrands. ``I have a lot of respect for the Americans. They
are the best fighters.''
	   American captain Lloyd Ball acknowledged his team had a tough
fight.
	   ``How much harder can it get? I still believe we're a good
team,'' he said.
	   Head coach Douglas Beal said the team was improving.
	   ``Making decisions is hard for us. We notice a change, but it
takes a while for everyone to adapt,'' Beal said.
	   Yugoslavia and Italy, as well as Russia, also have three wins
and no losses in the group.
	   In Group G, Brazil, Spain and Cuba also emerged with three wins
and no losses after Saturday's matches.
	   Spain, which has no world or Olympic title, has been a surprise
at the championships.
	   On Saturday, the Spanish team _ which selects a player ahead of
each match to shave his head for good luck _ beat Bulgaria 17-15,
15-4, 15-11.
	   In other Group G play in Hiroshima, western Japan, Cuba, whose
women's team defended its world title last Thursday, beat South
Korea 15-13, 15-9, 15-7.
	   Brazil edged Japan 15-11, 15-9, 15-13. Canada managed its first
win, defeating Argentina 15-11, 10-15, 15-4, 15-6.
	   In Group H, Italy defeated China 15-5, 15-4, 15-5, and
Yugoslavia defeated the Ukraine 15-9, 15-10, 15-1, at
Chiba-Makuhari Messe Hall near Tokyo.
	   Greece managed to win one set, but was downed by Russia 12-15,
15-6, 15-11, 15-6.
	   The men's championship started Nov. 13 with 24 teams, and 16
advanced to the current round, which lasts until Nov. 26. The
semifinals and finals will be played in Tokyo Nov. 28-29.

Tensions rise on Ethio-Eritrean border with no end in sight to
</HEADLINE>
dispute &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD LEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADIGRAT, Ethiopia (AP) _ Tension is increasing dramatically in
this town near the front line as international efforts to find a
peaceful solution to the six-month border dispute between Ethiopia
and Eritrea appear to have hit the wall.
	   Troops dug in on either side of the border north of Adigrat
exchange artillery fire nearly every day, and some of the shells
have fallen just north of town.
	   There was a 30-minute artillery duel Wednesday night. It
followed a number of other exchanges over the past two weeks in
which one civilian was killed.
	   There is no information about military casualties, and military
officials make it clear they don't welcome visitors.
	   Adigrat is just 25 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line at
Zalambesa, occupied by Eritrea since early June when air raids and
fighting caused several hundred deaths on both sides. At least 100
were killed in Adigrat.
	   Eritrea, which gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993,
refuses to withdraw from areas it occupied after May, a
precondition of all the peace proposals put forth so far.
	   The population of Adigrat has nearly doubled from 35,000 in May,
swollen by people moving away from border areas.
	   Although residents flee to outlying villages when the shelling
starts, only a few have left the town altogether.
	   A military source said no decision has been made yet to evacuate
Adigrat, 900 kilometers (620 miles) north of the capital, Addis
Ababa. But he said people have been told to prepare for further
bombardments and to leave if they can.
	   The source said artillery exchanges have escalated along
1,000-kilometer (620-mile) disputed frontier since the failure two
weeks ago of peace talks sponsored by the Organization of African
Unity and the subsequent visit to both countries by U.S. envoy
Anthony Lake.
	   The increased shelling has forced schools to close. Makeshift
classrooms have been set up in caves and fields.
	   But a boy was still injured when a shell exploded outside his
cave-school.
	   Adigrat has been transformed into a military staging post.
Hundreds of soldiers fill the bars and restaurants, and military
convoys rumble through on their way to Zalambessa.
	   Nevertheless, residents try to carry on as normal. Shops and
businesses are open, the construction of new roads and irrigation
channels continues.
	   But everyone is constantly alert, ready to react at the first
sound of shelling.
	   Authorities do not allow any travel beyond Adigrat towards the
front line because of the danger.
	   They say in extreme western Ethiopia near the junction of the
Sudanese-Eritrean border, an estimated 30,000 people have been
moved 50 kilometers (30 miles) back from the front after shelling
Nov. 5.
	   Another 10,000 people fled Shiraro in disputed northern Badime
district after heavy shelling killed 13.
	   So far there have been no reports of actual troop engagements,
but fears are growing that fighting could break out if something is
not done to halt the artillery exchanges.
	   The OAU's central conflict resolution body, which is trying to
mediate the dispute, is not scheduled to meet until late next
month, and the meeting could be postponed.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday harshly warned Italy against granting political asylum to
a Kurdish rebel leader wanted on terrorism charges in Turkey.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said.
	   On Friday, an Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition to
countries where suspects faces the death penalty. The court also
said he could be freed from custody. Turkey said it would appeal.
	   ``I have a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,''
Yilmaz said at a convention of his center-right Motherland Party.
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest
terrorist in the world.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in
Turkey on capital charges.
	   Ocalan was in custody in a hospital outside Rome and it was not
clear when he'd be set free. The court ordered him to stay in the
Italian capital, but that restriction could be lifted next month.
The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might offer
him refuge if he leaves Italy.
	   In Germany, a prosecutor in Karlsruhe said Saturday that a new
arrest warrant had been issued for Ocalan. It reportedly accuses
him of murdering PKK dissidents and a series of arson attacks.
	   It is now up to the Justice Ministry to decide whether to seek
his extradition. Just a day earlier, it announced that Germany
would not pursue Ocalan's extradition on an earlier warrant.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment was again running high in Turkey on
Saturday after the decision to free Ocalan. Outraged Turks laid
black wreaths in front of the Italian Embassy and honked their
horns. Graffiti denouncing the PKK defaced the walls.
	   ``No to terrorism, today and forever'' read a banner hung across
the boulevard in front of the embassy.

Egypt praises Israeli withdrawal from parts of West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Egypt's foreign minister Saturday described
as ``a positive step'' Israel's withdrawal from parts of the West
Bank and said he hoped the Jewish state would implement the rest of
the Wye River Accord.
	   Amr Moussa was speaking to reporters on his arrival in Muscat,
capital of the Gulf sultanate of Oman, to deliver a letter from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Sultan Qaboos, the Omani ruler.
	   The official Omani News Agency, which reported Moussa's arrival
and remarks, did not say what the letter was about.
	   During his one-day visit, Moussa will discuss regional
developments and bilateral ties with Sultan Qaboos and Foreign
Minister Youssef bin Alawi, he said.
	   The Wye River accord, signed in Washington on Oct. 23,
stipulates an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
in exchange for Palestinian security guarantees.
	   Israel withdrew from parts of the West Bank Friday, giving the
Palestinians control over an additional 2 percent of the territory
and upgrading their authority in 7 percent of the land.
	   Under the agreement, Israel is to carry out two more pullbacks
by late January, awarding Palestinians joint or sole jurisdiction
over 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
east war.

London submits bid for 2003 track and field World Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ London Saturday launched its bid for
the 2003 track and field World Championships, just two days after
Edmonton, Canada, landed the 2001 worlds.
	   The event _ considered the third most prestigious
internationally behind the Olympics and soccer's World Cup _ is
being planned for Wembley Stadium.
	   The 75-year-old stadium is to be revamped next year as the
centerpiece of England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup.
	   With the worlds going to North America for the first time, it
makes it more likely a European city will be chosen for 2003.
	   ``Staging the championships at Wembley would be a fantastic
boost for British athletics,'' said David Hemery, newly elected
president of Athletics UK who presented the bid Saturday of IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo.
	   ``I am delighted to have this launch as one of my first roles as
president of Athletics UK,'' he added. ``I believe that it will be
an integral part of our future to play host to major events.''
	   David Moorcroft, CEO of Athletics UK, suggested the Canadian
victory would bode well for London.
	   ``It may be good news for us,'' he said. ``We would hope that
the world championships would come to Europe in 2003.''
	   Paris and Stanford, Calif., who lost out to Edmonton, are also
viewed a possible bidders.

Polish cab drivers demonstrate to demand death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Angered by recent brutal murders of taxi
drivers, hundreds of cabs drove through Poland's cities Saturday to
demand restoration of the death penalty.
	   ``The death penalty deters criminals,'' said Kazimierz
Dobrowolski, 60, a driver from the Plus taxi company, which
organized a protest in Warsaw.
	   In line with laws in western Europe, Poland's new penal code,
introduced in September, abolished capital punishment, making life
imprisonment the country's toughest sentence. A defendant can apply
for a conditional release after 25 years.
	   ``I don't know if a criminal will really spend his lifetime in
jail. And if he is released after 25 years, he will be even more
depraved,'' said Dobrowolski. He does not drive his cab in the
evenings because he fears an attack.
	   Some 1,000 cabs took part in the protest in the central city of
Lodz where two cab drivers and a parking attendant were shot last
month, PAP news agency reported.
	   During the protest, the drivers gathered signatures to petition
for reintroduction of the death penalty that is to be given to
parliament on December 2.
	   Under Poland's constitution, a group of 100,000 citizens can
submit a motion to parliament.
	   The drivers are also demanding more police patrols and setting
up a hotline with police.

Thousands move to shelters amid cyclone threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Authorities evacuated thousands of
fishermen from a remote island Saturday as a cyclone with winds up
to 115 kph (70 mph) was expected to hit the coast early Sunday.
	   The cyclone could whip up high tidal waves and inundate
low-lying areas along stretches of the country's 400-kilometer
(250-mile) coastline, the meteorological department said.
	   The cyclone, spawning from a depression in the Bay of Bengal on
Thursday, intensified into a ``sever cyclone'' on Saturday. Moving
southwest with a speed of 20 kph (12 mph), it was located 500
kilometers (310 miles) south and southwest of Khulna district.
	   More than 5,000 fishermen on Dublarchar island in the Bay of
Bengal have moved to safe areas, Wahud Ahmed, a Bangladesh Red
Crescent official, said in Dhaka. Dublarchar is 135 kilometers (85
miles) southwest of Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital.
	   The Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, has
posted nearly 33,000 volunteers along the coast where at least 10
million people live. The region has more than 1,200 shelters for
the residents.
	   ``Using loud speakers, our volunteers are alerting people to
move to shelters at short notice,'' Ahmed said.
	   Even though the core of the cyclone headed southwest, officials
at Chittagong, the southeastern port city, were taking no chances.
	   Authorities at the country's largest Chittagong Port have
advised 19 anchored ships to take precautions. State-run radio and
television were broadcasting cyclone warnings.
	   Bangladesh, a low-lying delta nation, is buffeted by tropical
cyclones that kill hundreds of people every year. A menacing
cyclone killed 138,000 people along the coast in 1991.

London submits bid for 2003 track and field World Championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ London Saturday launched its bid for
the 2003 track and field World Championships, just two days after
Edmonton, Canada, landed the 2001 worlds.
	   The event _ considered the third most prestigious
internationally behind the Olympics and soccer's World Cup _ is
being planned for Wembley Stadium.
	   The 75-year-old stadium, host to the 1948 Olympics and 1966
World Cup, is to be revamped next year as the centerpiece of
England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup.
	   With the worlds going to North America for the first time, it
makes it more likely a European city will be named.
	   ``Staging the championships at Wembley would be a fantastic
boost for British athletics,'' said David Hemery, newly elected
president of Athletics UK who presented the bid Saturday of IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo.
	   ``I am delighted to have this launch as one of my first roles as
president of Athletics UK,'' he added. ``I believe that it will be
an integral part of our future to play host to major events.''
	   David Moorcroft, CEO of Athletics UK, suggested the Canadian
victory would bode well for London.
	   ``It may be good news for us,'' he said. ``We would hope that
the world championships would come to Europe in 2003.''
	   Paris and Stanford, Calif., which both lost out to Edmonton, are
also viewed as possible bidders. The winner is expected to be named
next May by the IAAF at a meeting in Seville, Spain.
	   Seville hosts next year's worlds Aug. 20-29.

Clinton, Kim demand answers on suspected nuclear site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with toast, Clinton visiting brother. EDITS
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South
Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a
suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders
not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the
peninsula.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news
conference, pledged that his government would ``spare no effort in
supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. He
called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean
underground facility and said the North must constrain its
development and exports of missiles.
	   On the first of two days in South Korea, Clinton also held a
roundtable discussion with business leaders to hear their
prescriptions for putting the nation's economy back on track.
Economics and security are Clinton's twin themes on a five-day Asia
trip that began in Japan.
	   Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not
yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in
North Korea is nuclear related. But he said the North risks closing
the door on cooperation if it refuses a U.S. inspection of the
site.
	   ``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton said at a joint news
conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential mansion
overlooking the capital. ``We need access to it.''
	   The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's
decades-long hostility toward the South is a 1994 ``agreed
framework'' in which the North halted its nuclear weapons program
in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern nuclear energy
sources there. That deal would be shattered if the suspect site
turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. And that, in turn,
would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks that could
produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice that ended the
Korean War in 1953.
	   Kim, who has moved South Korea to a ``sunshine'' policy of
engaging North Korea on cultural and economic fronts, firmly said
his government supports Clinton on the nuclear issue.
	   ``We must require full access and ways to ascertain the nature
and the purposes of the construction site,'' Kim said. ``If it is,
in fact, proven that it is nuclear related, we should demand
immediate close down.'' He also said the North must limit its
missile development, citing the ``great shock'' in Japan when the
North Koreans test-fired a missile its way Aug. 31.
	   In a dinner toast, Kim said that despite tensions, ``North Korea
is cautiously but noticeably taking measures to increase
interaction and cooperation between the South and the North.''
	   And Clinton saluted Seoul's battle against Asia's economic woes.
``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis more
prosperous, more stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small
measure to Korea's example.''
	   After the state dinner, Clinton made a surprise late-night stop
at a concert at the Sejong Culture Center where his younger
brother, Roger, and his band were performing. The president
listened to songs off stage before his brother introduced the
president as ``a very special person.'' The audience of 2,000
people stood and applauded.
	   In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital,
U.S. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious
underground site, which American intelligence officials fear could
be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program.
	   U.S. spy satellite photos show thousands of workers digging a
massive complex. U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman said Thursday
after the Pyongyang talks that there was ``compelling evidence'' of
an underground nuclear facility.
	   But in a statement distributed by the U.S. Embassy here
Saturday, Kartman backtracked, saying instead that the United
States lacks ``conclusive evidence'' the site is a nuclear
facility.
	   ``There is strong information that makes us suspicious, but we
lack conclusive evidence that the intended purpose of the
underground site is nuclear related and, if so, what type of
nuclear facility it might be,'' Kartman said, offering a
``clarification'' of his earlier remarks.
	   Kim said his government would ``spare no effort in supporting
the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question. The North
Koreans have denied the underground construction site has any
nuclear purpose, and it has demanded a dlrs 300 million payment for
proving that. In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, Clinton rejected the
idea of compensation.
	   Directing his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted the
significance of a new tourism deal that is bringing South Koreans
to the North on cruise ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a
sign the North may be opening up to its 1950s Korean War enemy. To
risk that kind of cooperation _ and progress with America on other
issues _ by stonewalling on the suspected nuclear site is contrary
to the North's long-term interests, he said.
	   ``Nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, given
our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put in that
hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much
advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness, as
more of those ships going up there full of people from here,''
Clinton said.
	   To underscore the U.S. military commitment to South Korea,
Clinton was scheduled to venture out of the capital on Sunday to
visit U.S. Army troops at a training range north of Seoul. He also
planned to address American troops at Osan Air Base from a U-2 spy
plane hangar.

West Indies rips through Free State batting for 316-67
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Nixon McLean ripped through
the Free State batting on Saturday to leave them devastated at 67
all out in the first innings at tea time.
	   West Indies held a first innings total of 316 on day two of the
four-day match, West Indies' final first-class fixture before the
five-test series against South Africa begins Thursday in
Johannesburg.
	   McLean's career-best figures of seven for 28 were aided by
superb short leg catching by Philo Wallace, who took three in that
position. The innings ended in under two hours.
	   It was Free State's poorest-ever performance against a touring
side, although young wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk showed backbone,
finishing undefeated on 32. He produced the shot of the day with a
cover drive off McLean for a boundary.
	   South African national team captain Hansie Cronje succumbed to
the combination of pace and catching from McLean and Wallace.
National team contenders Gerhardus Liebenberg and Nicky Boje were
at sea against McLean.
	   In the West Indies first innings, Carl Hooper gave the decisive
boost with 64 runs, before they were dismissed for 316 at lunch.
	   The early morning belonged to Free State's Victor Mpitsang, who
took two quick wickets to get rid of overnight batsman Stuart
Jacobs and, in the very next ball, Ridley Jacobs.

Serbia publishes its own peace proposal for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ethnic Albanian negotiator's comment, identifies
Serbian media center in 3rd graf as pro-government; RECASTS. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After rejecting a U.S.-sponsored
plan, Serbia published Saturday its own peace proposal for Kosovo,
envisaging a form of self-rule but keeping the province firmly
within Serbia. An ethnic Albanian negotiator turned it down.
	   Saturday's publication of the Serbian plan came amid escalating
tensions in Kosovo, following accusations that ethnic Albanian
rebels ambushed a Serb police vehicle Friday, killing two policemen
and severely wounding three others.
	   The policemen were returning to barracks after completing their
shift, the pro-government Serbian Media Center said, when
guerrillas fired an anti-tank round into their vehicle and then
followed up with small arms.
	   Although the attack could not be independently confirmed, it
indicated persistent violence despite an official cease-fire.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic scheduled new talks with
ethnic Albanian leaders for next Wednesday in the provincial
capital Pristina _ a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians did not
show up for the talks earlier in the week and before that.
	   Ilias Kurteshi, a member of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating
team, told The Associated Press in Belgrade that the Serbian
proposal was ``one-sided'' and ``could not enhance the climate for
talks on Kosovo.''
	   ``The Serbian side is, of course, within its rights to come up
with a proposal, but the sides involved in the conflict already
have a set path of indirect negotiations carried out through
shuttle diplomacy of U.S. mediator (Christopher) Hill,'' Kurteshi
said.
	   He added Hill's efforts and the indirect talks have come a long
way by now and ``a return to unilateral, ready-made,
take-it-or-leave-it proposals was not contributing to the
process.''
 &UR; Milutinovic dismissed, 6th graf pvs.

Spanish Socialist party votes Borrell as leader in unity deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Looking to ward off a crisis and present a
unified front, Spain's opposition Socialist party Friday voted
Josep Borrell as its sole leader.
	   The vote came after months of confusion as to who headed the
party _ Borrell, the organization's candidate for prime minister in
the next elections, or Joaquin Almunia, the Socialist group's
secretary general.
	   The division threatened to split a party which had enjoyed more
than a decade of unity under Felipe Gonzalez, who doubled as prime
minister and party boss until after the 1996 general election
defeat.
	   Observers also saw the dual leadership between Borrell and
Almunia as seriously hampering any chances the Socialists had of
regaining office from conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar's Popular Party in the next elections, scheduled for 2000.
	   Opinion polls placed Borrell way ahead of Aznar prior to his
selection as Socialist candidate for premier last year but in
recent months he has fallen behind the Popular Party leader.
	   Borrell's unanimous victory among the 237 members of the
Socialist party's federal committee Saturday came after an
agreement was reached late Friday following the intervention of
Gonzalez and other party members.
	   After losing the 1996 elections, Almunia was voted in to replace
Gonzalez as secretary general when Gonzalez stepped down at a party
congress later that year.
	   But in 1997 the succession scheme was upset when Almunia
unexpectedly lost to Borrell when the party's rank and file voted
on who should be the candidate to challenge Aznar.
	   Over the following months conflicts began to emerge in the
two-pronged leadership, with supporters of Borrell, who is seen as
the more dynamic and progressive of the two, complaining that his
mandate was being restricted by Almunia. Almunia, in turn, claimed
his leadership was being undermined by Borrell.
	   Under the agreement, Almunia will continue as administrative
party leader while Borrell will be the group's chief representative
in all institutional and parliamentary dealings.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian riot police armed with
shields and truncheons chased away a crowd of anti-government
protesters in the capital city Saturday as water cannons mounted
atop a truck drenched the demonstrators.
	   Several of the protesters were arrested, eyewitnesses said.
	   Hundreds of policemen wearing helmets moved into a central Kuala
Lumpur neighborhood after a group of demonstrators shouting
``Mahathir Resign'' refused to heed warnings to disperse.
	   The crowds gathered after the day's final prayers at a city
mosque and began to chant ``Reformasi, Reformasi,'' meaning reform,
to the tune of the popular folk song ``Clementine.''
	   They then began to loudly demand Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's resignation and waved portraits of his ousted deputy,
Anwar Ibrahim, who is in jail facing trial on charges of abuse of
office and illegal sex acts.
	   Police quickly blocked roads leading to the area and moved in on
the protesters, spraying them with water laced with a chemical that
causes skin irritation and a burning sensation in the eyes.
	   Last Saturday, while officials from the 21-member Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum met in Kuala Lumpur to discuss Asia's
financial crisis, police fired shots into the air to disperse
thousands of people demonstrating in the same area of the city.
	   It was the first time security forces had fired shots since
anti-government protests began after the dismissal of Anwar as
deputy prime minister on Sept. 2 and his subsequent arrest.
	   Anwar denies the charges against him and says he's the victim of
a political vendetta orchestrated by Mahathir.
	   Anwar's trial is scheduled to resume on Monday after a weeklong
recess to avoid a clash with the APEC summit.

Opposition wins Senate elections, exit polls show
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The main opposition party and
another opposition grouping apparently won the Czech Senate
elections, exit polls showed Saturday. The results are a blow to
the governing Social Democrats
	   Candidates for the conservative Civic Democratic Party won in 11
out of 27 districts in the two days of run-off voting. A four-party
center-right coalition, led by the Christian Democrats and the
Freedom Union, also won 11 seats.
	   The ruling Social Democrats came third with 4 mandates,
according to exit polls tabulated on Czech public TV.
	   The exit polls, carried out by the STEM agency, were based on
interviews with 15,000 voters.
	   Polling stations closed at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT), and final results
were expected late Saturday.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were seats of 27 members whose
terms had run out. Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to
win the election outright or face a run-off between the two top
finishers.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent in the
first-round vote, meaning that run-off elections were necessary in
all 27 districts.
	   Turnout was estimated to be even lower than the 42 percent in
last week's first round.
	   The Senate vote was considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats, led by Zeman.
	   His Cabinet survived in Parliament thanks to a stability pact
struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   The deal was criticized as an attempt to introduce a bipartisan
model of politics.
	   The two parties have a three-fifth majority in the lower house
of Parliament and have also retained their three-fifth majority in
the Senate.
	   This means they could theoretically change the constitution to
reinforce the role of strong parties, a move feared by smaller
political groupings, including the Christian Democrats and the
Freedom Union.
	   The Senate is by far the less important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   It was primarily created as a safety mechanism to ensure the
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the
200-seat lower house of the parliament be dissolved.

Serbia publishes its own peace proposal for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with ethnic Albanian negotiator's
rejection of plan, trim. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia published its own peace
proposal for Kosovo on Saturday, envisioning a form of self-rule
but keeping the province firmly within Serbia. An ethnic Albanian
negotiator turned it down.
	   The proposed interim three-year agreement, published in the
state-run daily Politika, gives the Serbian province ``broad
self-rule,'' stressing that any permanent settlement has to respect
Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and fall within the legal
framework of both the Serbian and Yugoslav constitutions.
	   A member of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, Ilias
Kurteshi, told The Associated Press in Belgrade that the Serbian
proposal was ``one-sided'' and ``could not enhance the climate for
talks on Kosovo.''
	   Indirect talks through U.S. envoy Christopher Hill are
progressing, and ``a return to unilateral, ready-made,
take-it-or-leave-it proposals was not contributing to the
process,'' Kurteshi said.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic scheduled new talks with
ethnic Albanian leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital,
Pristina _ a hollow gesture since Kosovo Albanians did not show up
for talks earlier in the week or others before that.
	   Milutinovic dismissed a U.S. peace proposal Wednesday, saying it
would give too much power to the independence-minded ethnic
Albanians who comprise 90 per cent of Kosovo's population of 2
million. Kosovo is a province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Several hundred people have been killed and almost a quarter of
a million ethnic Albanians displaced since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Kosovo separatists in
February.
	   Under Saturday's proposal, Kosovo would have its own two-chamber
parliament _ the lower one would reflect the ethnic distribution in
the province while the upper chamber would have equal
representation from all ethnic communities.
	   If any assembly decision conflicted with the interests of a
particular ethnic community, the Serbian assembly would have the
overriding say. The province, in turn, would have representation in
both the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments.
	   Kosovo's assembly would adopt a statute for the province, select
a presidency, elect an executive council as governing body and name
an ombudsman for the protection of human rights.
	   Kosovo would have its own local police force, appointed by each
municipality and reflecting its ethnic composition. Local policemen
would carry only sidearms. Each ethnic community would set up its
own local courts and name a National Council to look after its
rights.
	   The Serbian plan also calls for elections in Kosovo within nine
months, and says that the agreement would be reviewed after three
years.

West Indies rips through Free State batting for 316-67
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS Eds note; UPDATES with Free State innings at tea time &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Nixon McLean ripped through
the Free State batting on Saturday to leave them devastated at 67
all out in the first innings at tea time.
	   West Indies held a first innings total of 316 on day two of the
four-day match, West Indies' final first-class fixture before the
five-test series against South Africa begins Thursday in
Johannesburg.
	   McLean's career-best figures of seven for 28 were aided by
superb short leg catching by Philo Wallace, who took three in that
position. The innings ended in under two hours.
	   It was Free State's poorest-ever performance against a touring
side, although young wicketkeeper Morne van Wyk showed backbone,
finishing undefeated on 32. He produced the shot of the day with a
cover drive off McLean for a boundary.
	   South African national team captain Hansie Cronje succumbed to
the combination of pace and catching from McLean and Wallace.
National team contenders Gerhardus Liebenberg and Nicky Boje were
at sea against McLean.
	   In the West Indies first innings, Carl Hooper gave the decisive
boost with 64 runs, before they were dismissed for 316 at lunch.
	   The early morning belonged to Free State's Victor Mpitsang, who
took two quick wickets to get rid of overnight batsman Stuart
Jacobs and, in the very next ball, Ridley Jacobs.

Germany's historic return to Berlin finally takes shape
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Dull. Rainy. A bureaucrats' village.
	   This sleepy university town on the Rhine River has endured 50
years of put-downs, and still the government has gotten cozy since
moving here after the Nazi defeat in World War II. So cozy that
it's taken nearly a decade to get serious about returning to
bustling Berlin, Germany's historic capital.
	   Now moving trucks finally have loaded up and the first
government agency is taking the plunge, closing down for good in
Bonn and shifting to a new home 600 kilometers (375 miles) to the
east.
	   For the 150 staffers of President Roman Herzog, Germany's
largely ceremonial head of state, it means swapping a set of boxy
postwar office buildings on the Rhine for a brand-new Berlin
workplace, a bold, polished black stone structure that officially
opens for business Monday.
	   It's a prelude to the full-fledged arrival of the federal
government next fall. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, government
ministers and lawmakers will set up shop, often in temporary
quarters, to officially launch what's being called the ``Berlin
Republic.''
	   Getting there has been a slow process since the opening of the
Berlin Wall in 1989 ended the city's Cold War division, setting in
motion the merger of east and west Germany the following year.
	   After parliament narrowly voted in 1991 to restore Berlin as
capital of the united Germany, many politicians resisted the idea
of returning to what was the Nazis' seat of power. Building delays,
cost problems, compensation demands by Bonn and the odd worker
strike have added to the chaos.
	   Even lavish government inducements _ housing allowances, free
travel for officials who keep a Bonn residence, money for private
lessons to help kids switch schools _ haven't quieted all grumbles.
	   ``We're curious about Berlin and we are going with a positive
attitude,'' said Ulf Bauer, a presidential spokesman. ``Of course,
it's not all smiles. We're leaving behind a piece of home.''
	   But Schroeder, Germany's first chancellor with no personal
memory of World War II, has given the move new urgency since taking
office last month. He will already hold part of his Cabinet
meetings in Berlin starting next week.
	   To Schroeder, 54, Germany is mature enough to handle the return
to Berlin without being crushed by the ghosts of the past, even if
some of his ministers are moving into buildings from which Adolf
Hitler's henchmen once plotted war.
	   On a practical level, he can't escape the complexity of moving
11,000 people into a metropolis that is Europe's biggest building
site.
	   For one thing, the move's 20 billion mark (dlrs 12 billion)
budget, set by ``unity chancellor'' Helmut Kohl, will likely be
overshot.
	   And just this week, officials said construction of Schroeder's
own chancellery, near the refurbished Reichstag parliament building
that once abutted the Berlin Wall, would be delayed by six months
until October 2000. Architects had underestimated the difficulty of
building on Berlin's shifting, sandy soil.
	   In the meantime, Schroeder will use a central Berlin building
from which East German communists once ruled.
	   The striking, oval building for the presidential staff on the
Spree River had its own problems: Water seepage forced a four-month
delay to seal the foundation. Herzog, an earnest former supreme
court judge given to thoughtful speeches about Germany's past, has
already been using his Berlin residence, a small chateau in the
same park as the new building.
	   But he isn't letting go completely yet. His mansion in Bonn on
the banks of the Rhine officially remains his secondary home until
the rest of the government moves.

Spanish union rallies to demand 35-hour week, more jobless
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 5th graf that 35-hour week would not involve pay
cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's unions Saturday announced they will
stage some 50 rallies in towns and cities across Spain on Dec. 3 to
demand a 35-hour working week and greater financial assistance for
the unemployed.
	   In a press conference, Workers Commission leader Antonio
Gutierrez said workers' meetings would also be staged at large- and
medium-sized business and factories so that employers are made
aware of the union demands.
	   Candido Mendez, leader of Spain's other principal labor group,
the General Workers Union, said he hoped that after Dec. 3 the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar would
show itself to be flexible and thus avert more serious action by
the unions.
	   Gutierrez said that Spain's 1999 state budget would lead to
cutbacks in payments to the jobless. He warned that Aznar's
government also planned cutbacks in health and education.
	   Backing a reduction from a 40-hour to a 35-hour working week
with no cut in pay, Gutierrez said that Spain's buoyant economy
should ``lead to the creation of more jobs and this calls for
reorganization and a cut in the working day.''
	   Despite continuous strong economic growth and low inflation in
recent years, Spain, at nearly 19 percent, still has one of the
highest unemployment rates in the 15-nation European Union.

Albania opposition cancels rally, calming tension before referendum
</HEADLINE>

planned illegal rally, ADDS quotes, details; EDITS. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Opposition leaders called off a planned
illegal rally in Tirana Saturday, slightly easing nationwide
tension a day before a referendum that may give Albania its first
post-communist Constitution.
	   But opposition leader Sali Berisha again rejected requests from
Western nations that he cancel a planned boycott of the Sunday
referendum.
	   ``I call on all Albanians to boycott the referendum in the name
of the nation, liberty and democracy,'' said Berisha, waving a
draft copy and raising his gravelly voice in an emotionally charged
news conference Saturday afternoon. He didn't say why he canceled
the rally.
	   The government and Western European advisers, who helped draft
the Constitution, say the boycott could cast doubts on the results
and label all voters who line up to cast their secret ballot as
government supporters.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and
several other European institutions, have called in recent days for
mass participation in the referendum.
	   The canceled rally in downtown Tirana, where Berisha had
promised to gather 50,000 supporters, would have violated a
referendum law prohibiting political rallies 24 hours before the
vote.
	   Tirana remained calm, although many had feared violence during
the planned rally and police remained on full alert throughout the
country.
	   Large rallies have often turned violent in recent years in
Albania, where political life is bitterly divided between the
Berisha's Democratic Party and the Socialists who ousted the
Democrats in 1997 national elections.
	   The draft Constitution outlines private property rights and
gives Albanians the right to legally change their religion and
identify themselves as a member of an ethnic minority.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party said these clauses are
``anti-Albanian'' and will encourage citizens to turn away from
Islam, the national religion, hoping to emigrate to richer,
non-Muslim European countries.
	   A senior OSCE official, who requested anonymity, also said
Saturday that Berisha may send some of his supporters to polling
booths as observers of the referendum.
	   The opposition is allowed two observers at each of the nation's
4,700 polling booths, but Berisha earlier said his party would not
participate in the monitoring process.
	   The boycott of the referendum has troubled the governing
Socialists and Western officials who say that many will stay away
from the polls for fear of violence and being branded by neighbors
as government supporters, particularly in opposition-run areas.
	   Since the boycott was called earlier this month, Albanians have
been divided between voters who will approve the draft and those
who will abstain. Few are expected to vote ``no'' on the ballot.
	   The draft's 180 clauses outline basic civil, human and
democratic rights in this country which shed one of Europe's most
isolated communist regimes in 1991.
	   But, observers say, the opposition will claim all abstentions as
their supporters even though at least 300,000 of the 1.9 million
eligible voters live abroad, with no access to polling stations,
and many may be marked abstentions.
	   Recent snowfalls in northern Albania have also blocked four
national roads and may prevent many remote communities from voting.
	   OSCE has set aside 180 observers to monitor the referendum.
	   There are fears that opposition supporters, particularly in
remoter areas, will stage violent protests or fire in the air to
intimidate voters into staying away from the polls.

Sondral, Niemann-Stirnemann win at World Cup speedskating
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) _ With just 5/100ths of a second
splitting the first three, Norwegian Adne Sondral won the 1,500
meters in 1 minute 49.94 seconds Saturday at this World Cup
speedskating event.
	   The time to beat of 1:49.98 was set by Dutchman Rintje Ritsma,
skating in the fourth-to-last pair after his disappointing seventh
place in last week's World Cup opener in Hamar, Norway.
	   Ritsma was the first here to duck under the 1:50 mark but the
final race between Sondral and Dutchman Ids Postma, paired together
for the first time since the Nagano Olympics last season, turned
into a razor-edge battle on the last lap.
	   Sondral was just behind for most of the race but edged Ritsma
into second by 4/100ths of a second while Postma, a winner in
Hamar, had to settle for third just 1/100th behind his compatriot
in 1:49.99.
	   Later in the afternoon, Germany's Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann added
the women's 5,000 meters to her 3,000 meters victory in Hamar,
winning in 7:05.42.
	   In a race in which 11 women improved their personal best times,
Dutchwoman Carla Zijlstra was second in 7:05.94, with German
Claudia Pechstein third in 7:07.63.

Haunting photos by Picasso muse Dora Maar sold at auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A bizarre and haunting image of a scaly armadillo
fetus, photographed by Picasso muse and lover Dora Maar, has sold
at auction for 300,000 francs (dlrs 53,600).
	   Maar was Pablo Picasso's companion for eight years, and the
well-known subject of countless of his most famous paintings and
drawings. But she also was a noted photographer with close ties to
the Surrealists.
	   Abandoned by Picasso for the younger Francoise Gilot, Maar went
into a tailspin. She died in July 1997 at the age of 89, lonely and
in poverty.
	   A treasure trove of works Picasso had given her _ paintings,
drawings and whimsical objects like sketches on matchbox covers _
sold at auction last month for 192 million francs (dlrs 34.6
million.)
	   But most of Maar's photos were held back from that auction to
coincide with this week's Paris Photo fair, when some of the
world's top dealers are in the French capital.
	   No one knows where Maar found the armadillo fetus, with long,
raised claws, featured in the 1936 black-and-white ``Portrait of
Ubu.'' But it is a prime example of her Surrealist work.
	   After spirited bidding for the photo, in an auction that went
into the early morning hours Saturday, the French government
exercised its right to pre-empt the sale _ meaning it has two weeks
to decide whether to buy the photo at that price.
	   Another famous Maar photo, the 1936 ``29 Rue d'Astorg,'' was
sold to a Parisian rare books dealer, the Librairie Viane, for the
same price.
	   That photo depicts a strange statue that Maar moved to a stone
archway. Also in black and white, it has Maar's handwritten
indications of color on the reverse side.
	   Both photos went for nearly twice their original estimates by
the Piasa auction house. In all, the photo auction brought in about
5 million francs (about dlrs 900,000).
	   The 230 auction lots included not only Maar's work but also
photos of her, both in her youth and later, relaxing with Picasso
and their dog on a beach, or with friends. Some are by such famous
photographers as Irving Penn and Man Ray.
	   In one Man Ray photo from the summer of 1937, a group of friends
is seated around a couch, including Picasso and Maar. But Picasso's
head has been cut out of the photo _ perhaps to be used in a
medallion, or perhaps for a much more emotional reason.

Indonesian villagers riot in South Sulawesi: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of customers of a troubled
local financial firm went on a rampage in South Sulawesi after they
were unable to withdraw their savings, a report said Saturday.
	   The official Antara news agency said at least six villagers and
scores of security personnel were taken to a hospital after the
riot which occurred Friday in Pinrang, a coastal town about 1,370
kilometers (856 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   The report said clients of a cooperative that acted as an
illegal bank ran amok after finding out that a reimbursement offer
from the firm was fraudulent.
	   The rioters damaged government offices and set fire to a prison
where executives of the already banned cooperative were detained,
Antara said, quoting a local police official.
	   One villager was believed to have been shot by security
personnel and was in serious condition at a hospital, it said.
	   It was the second such protest since early last month.
	   Indonesia is currently battling its worst economic crisis in 30
year and many financial institutions, including banks, have become
insolvent.

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police arrested five members of an
ethnic party Saturday, hours after the Pakistani government
suspended civil rights in Sindh province and ordered the army to
curb violence in Karachi, its troubled main city, authorities said.
	   In an overnight raid, police surrounded a hostel run by the
ethnic Muttahida Qami Movement, or MQM, in Karachi's Azizabad
neighborhood and arrested five of its members, including two
lawmakers of the Sindh provincial assembly, for keeping illegal
weapons.
	   Police seized five Kalashnikov rifles and three automatic
pistols.
	   The suspects, including lawmakers Shoaib Bukhari and Wakil Ahmed
Jamali, will be tried in military court, police chief Farooq Ameen
Querashi said.
	   The MQM accused police of using violence and arresting lawmakers
without warrants. ``They barged into the hostel late in the night
and started beating our people,'' spokesman Hasan Musana said.
	   The raid came hours after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced
that the army had been called in to help curb violence in the
southern province. Sharif also said military courts were being set
up in Karachi to try ``terrorists and criminals'' _ a move the MQM
says actually targets its own ethnic group.
	   The MQM, formerly a Sharif ally, represents Urdu speakers who
migrated from India at independence from Britain in 1947 and their
descendants.
	   The party has controlled Karachi for more than a decade. More
than 1,000 people have died in political and religious violence so
far this year, paralyzing economic activity, as the MQM battles a
splinter faction.
	   Sharif dismissed the elected Sindh provincial government, in
which the MQM was a major coalition partner, and instituted direct
federal rule last month in an attempt to stop the violence in
Karachi, Pakistan's main financial and commercial center.
	   Sharif has blamed the MQM of most of the bloodletting, and for
the slaying of former governor Hakim Said. The MQM denies it and
blames Sharif for ``state-sponsored violence'' against its members.
	   MQM leader Altaf Hussain said his party has faced military
operations in the past and was not going to bow down now.
	   ``We will resist it by all legal, constitutional and democratic
means,'' Hussain told The Associated Press by telephone Saturday
from London, where he has been living since 1992. ``Suspension of
civil rights is an aggression against Sindh by the federal
government. Sharif's action are leading the country towards
disintegration.''
	   Human rights groups and opposition parties also criticized
Sharif's decision to suspend civil rights and call in the army.
	   ``It is a mini-martial law. The government has no justification
of taking such a harsh step,'' said Sen. Iqbal Haider of the
opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party.
	   But Sharif said the move is in the interests of the city and the
country. ``We want to get Karachi out of this hell,'' he said.
	   Sharif said military courts are needed in Sindh because ``the
terrorists threatened witnesses, judges and their families'' and
have paralyzed the justice system.
	   Military courts will provide speedy justice, he said. In
civilian courts, the government says, criminals easily get bail.
The decision of a military court cannot be challenged in a civilian
court.

	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ In the 1944 novel ``A Bell for
Adano,'' John Hersey portrayed the anguish of Italian villagers
whose town bell was stolen by fascists just before liberating U.S.
troops show up.
	   That same year, during a protracted Allied offensive near Rome,
U.S. Army Sgt. Herbert Roth was roving through the Mediterranean
village of Anzio when he glimpsed a bronze bell protruding from the
rubble of a church.
	   Just 9 inches (23 centimeters) tall and 5 inches (13
centimeters) in diameter, it hardly rivaled the beloved treasure
depicted in Hersey's Pulitzer Prize-winning tale. Roth packed it in
his jeep and took it home as a memento of the war.
	   ``To me, the bell had a lot of meaning,'' said Roth, 84,
invoking the names of a string of comrades who were among nearly
50,000 soldiers killed at Anzio in one of the most ferocious
encounters of World War II.
	   Now, 54 years later, a museum in Anzio has somehow learned of
the whereabouts of the bell that had been used for maybe half a
century to call people into Mass at Saints Pio and Antonio Church.
	   It is ``our wish that the bell be returned,'' museum custodian
Amerigo Salvini said in a recent letter inviting Roth to attend
next year's 55th anniversary commemoration of the Anzio battle.
	   Roth, who is too ill for the trip, said Friday he would be
inclined to give the bell back. But there's one snag. He no longer
owns it.
	   After keeping it on a shelf at home for 53 years, he donated the
bell last fall to the newly-opened Italian American Community
Center in Gates, a Rochester suburb.
	   Weakened by two open-heart surgeries, Roth said he had long been
anxious to find a spot where his artifact would be properly
appreciated.
	   ``I'm in accord with what the community center feels _ no way
would I ever cross them after they treated me so well,'' said Roth,
who was honored with a lifelong membership.
	   The community center doesn't want to make any hasty decisions.
Its president, Bernie Iacovangelo, said the Anzio Beach Museum
seems happy with his idea of displaying the bell there for three
months, then accepting a life-size replica.
	   The real bell, however, might even end up permanently again in
Anzio, with the replica adorning the community center, he
suggested.
	   The museum in the seaside resort 38 miles (61.15 kilometers)
south of Rome says the bell carries historical as well as
sentimental value. On its side is the protruding figure of a lion's
head, a papal symbol marking the church's founding around 1850,
Iacovangelo said.
	   The museum heard about the bell from members of the community
center who went to Anzio hoping to find old photographs of the
church _ and possibly the bell, too.

<TEXT>
	   Kuwait (AP) _ Algeria's Oil Minister Yousef Yousfi said Saturday
he was working to boost sagging oil prices with fellow members in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   ``We're studying all ways and solutions that would boost the oil
prices,'' he said before leaving Kuwait for Qatar, his second stop
in a tour of Gulf states.
	   Yousfi said he was consulting with the Gulf producers ahead of
Wednesday's OPEC meeting in Vienna. He told reporters he hoped the
talks would result ``in collective measures which would benefit all
(oil) countries.''
	   Yousfi has been calling on OPEC members to undertake further
production cuts to boost prices. He declined to be specific about
the agenda of the OPEC meeting, but said his country wants to
``overcome this price crisis as soon as possible.''
	   The minister handed a letter from Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual to Kuwait's Emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah dealing with
the current weak oil prices. The contents were not disclosed.
	   Yousfi did not meet Kuwait's oil minister as he is visiting the
United States.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Trade between China and Iran exceeded dlrs
924 million in the first nine months of 1998, a 45.7 percent
increase over the same period last year, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
	   Iran sold dlrs 460 million worth of goods to China, a 48.5
percent increase over last year, said the agency, quoting a Chinese
foreign ministry spokesman.
	   Iranian exports of crude oil to China doubled in 1998 to 92,000
barrels of crude oil a day, the agency said. It also exported
minerals, including copper and chromium.
	   China exported dlrs 444 million worth of goods to Iran, an
increase of 42.9 percent compared with last year, the agency said.
Chinese exports consisted mainly of electronic equipment, fabrics,
paint materials and iron ore.
	   Trade between the two nations has increased almost twofold over
the past three years, the agency said.
	   The trade was worth dlrs 780 million in 1996 and dlrs 1.38
billion in 1997, the agency said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan took the first concrete steps
Saturday to privatize its bus service in the capital, Amman.
	   ``Contracts with three local firms were signed to operate,
manage and invest in transport facilities in four areas of
operation for bus routes in Amman,'' Transport Minister Nasser
Lawzi said.
	   The four areas will be served by 165 buses and the companies
will pay an annual lease of 557,000 dinars (dlrs 784,000) to manage
and run the routes, he said.
	   The government last month asked a local accounting firm to begin
liquidating the state-owned Public Transport Corporation and sell
its assets.
	   The Corporation, a monopoly which had enjoyed concession rights
on all Amman routes since its inception in 1970, has been recording
monthly losses of 100,000 dinars (dlrs 140,000).

Seven die in weather-related accidents in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Seven people died and some 20 others
were injured in winter weather-related accidents in the last 24
hours in Romania, national radio reported Saturday.
	   Fifteen hours of non-stop snowfalls blocked most of the national
roads in Romania, caused long train delays and closed four Black
Sea ports.
	   ``The snow storms continue in southwest Romania, and
temperatures will stay below 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) in the
coming days,'' said Dinu Marasoiu from the Romanian weather bureau
on national radio.
	   A driver blocked on a highway between two cities, some 125
north-west Bucharest, spent the night in his car with his family.
He reported on his mobile phone that 100 cars were also snowbound.
	   ``We were lucky we had heating in our car, but drivers of older
cars asked shelter in some other cars to get warmer,'' said Victor
Butnaru on private television Pro Tv.
	   The snow reached up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) high the the mountain
regions.

Central-East European countries want to intensify ties with EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Officials from 16 European nations are
for the most part excluded from the European Union ended a meeting
Saturday, determined to diminish the gap between the continent's
rich and poor countries.
	   Wrapping up a two-day gathering, the Central European
Innitiative member countries called on the EU not to neglect its
members in developing lasting regional security and political
cooperation.
	   In a final statement, the group stressed the need for the EU and
NATO to keep their doors ajar and seek integration of new members
``with the purpose of extending the benefits of stability, economic
prosperity and security to all countries of the region.''
	   ``Avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines, remains the
priority of the Central European Innitiative,'' the document
released by the group said.
	   The group also expressed faith in efforts to reach peace in
Kosovo, Yugoslavia's restive southern province.
	   The participants also emphasized the need to press on with
post-war reconstruction in Bosnia, underlining the importance of
promoting good neighborly relations to strengthen stability in the
wider Balkan region.
	   Most of the CEI nations are struggling to overcome legacies of
communism and promote democratic and free-market reforms. A common
goal in bilateral contacts was to expand mutual trade and attract
foreign investment.
	   While the member nations boast a combined population the size of
the United States, with some 240 million people, a staggering three
fourths of the total gross domestic product is accounted for by
Italy and Austria, the only two nations already members of the EU.
	   Total foreign investment in CEI countries totaled dlrs 12
billion in 1997.
	   The CEI countries are Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czech
Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus, as well as
four former Yugoslav countries, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Macedonia. Today's Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro,
is not a member.
	   The CEI was established in 1989.

Albania opposition cancels rally, calming tension before referendum

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Opposition leaders called off an illegal
rally in Tirana on Saturday, easing tension a day before a
referendum that could give Albania its first post-communist
constitution.
	   But opposition leader Sali Berisha again rejected requests from
Western nations to cancel a boycott of Sunday's referendum.
	   ``I call on all Albanians to boycott the referendum in the name
of the nation, liberty and democracy,'' said Berisha, waving a
draft of the constitution and raising his gravelly voice in an
emotional news conference Saturday. He didn't say why he called off
the rally.
	   The government and Western European advisers, who helped draft
the constitution, say the boycott could cast doubt on the results
and label all voters who line up to cast their secret ballots as
government supporters.
	   The constitution's 180 clauses outline basic civil, human and
democratic rights in a country which shed one of Europe's most
isolated communist regimes in 1991.
	   Tirana was calm Saturday, and police remained on full alert
throughout the country. There are fears that opposition supporters,
particularly in remoter areas, will stage violent protests or fire
in the air to intimidate voters into staying away from the polls.
There are expected to be 180 Western observers at the polls.
	   The rally in downtown Tirana, where Berisha had promised to
gather 50,000 supporters, would have violated a law prohibiting
political rallies 24 hours before the vote.
	   Large rallies have often turned violent in recent years in
Albania, where political life is bitterly divided between the
Berisha's Democratic Party and the Socialists who ousted him in
1997 national elections.
	   The constitution outlines private property rights and gives
Albanians the right to legally change their religion and identify
themselves as a member of an ethnic minority.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party said these clauses are
``anti-Albanian'' and will encourage citizens to turn away from
Islam, the national religion, hoping to emigrate to richer,
non-Muslim European countries.
	   Since the boycott was called earlier this month, Albanians have
been divided between those who will approve the draft and those who
will abstain. Few are expected to vote ``no.''

Not much progress at nuclear talks with the United States, says
</HEADLINE>
Indian defense minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The seven rounds of nuclear talks
between India and the United States have not much to show in terms
of results, United News of India quoted the Indian defense minister
as saying on Saturday.
	   ``The talks have shown that the United States has an agenda for
India which is not acceptable,'' said Fernandes in his speech on
``Defense strategy, then and now,'' in New Delhi. He did not give
details.
	   ``The United States should understand India's security concerns
and reconcile itself to the obvious. India is too big and
potentially a very powerful country to be subjected to a carrot and
stick treatment,'' UNI quoted the defense minister as saying.
	   India has fought three wars against Pakistan and one against
China during the past 50 years over territorial disputes, and its
two neighbours are nuclear weapon states.
	   Fernandes spoke about the lack of progress in the Indo-U.S.
dialogue a day after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and Indian negotiator Jaswant Singh ended their latest round of
talks in Rome aimed at nudging New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
	   The talks began after India tested five nuclear devices in May,
provoking rival tests by Pakistan.
	   A joint statement Friday acknowledged that differences remained
and Talbott and Singh agreed to meet again in New Delhi in January.
	   India wants to be recognized as a nuclear weapons power, a
demand rejected by the United States and other nuclear states. But
New Delhi has accepted the essence of the treaty by offering a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
	   The U.S. wants both India and Pakistan to sign the treaty and
take steps toward ending 50 years of hostility. The test ban treaty
must be signed and ratified by 44 countries before it can go into
effect.

 &UR; Iranians resume pilgrimages to Iraq
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iranians arrival; CHANGES dateline; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ More than a thousand Iranian pilgrims
arrived in Iraq on Saturday, the first group to cross the border
since Iran suspended the pilgrimages for fear of U.S. air strikes
against Iraq, the official news agency reported.
	   A total of 1,026 Iranians passed through the Iraqi border point
of al-Muntheriya on their way to the Muslim holy sites, the Iraqi
News Agency said.
	   In Tehran, the Iranian newspaper Zan reported Saturday that the
government had decided to allow the pilgrimages to resume on
Thursday _ a week after it suspended them on Nov. 12.
	   The paper quoted the governor of the border town of
Kasr-e-Shirin, Behrouz Karami.
	   Last July, Iraq agreed to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to visit
its holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. For Iran's overwhelmingly
Shiite Muslim population, the sacred shrines in these cities are
second only to those in Saudi Arabia.
	   More than 30,000 Iranian pilgrims have traveled to Iraq since
August to visit the shrines, according to Karami.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians used to visit Iraq every year
until 1980, when war broke out between the two Muslim nations. The
war ended eight years later, but visa restrictions introduced
during the fighting remain in force.

Totti's late penalty kick puts Roma into tie for first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AS Roma wasted a chance to take sole possession of
first place in the Italian League for the first time in four years
Saturday, settling for a 1-1 draw against Bari that moved the
capital's club into a tie for the top spot.
	   A week after dominating two-time defending champion Juventus of
Turin in a 2-0 victory, Roma had to rally just to avoid a loss
against unheralded Bari.
	   Francesco Totti, the striker fresh off his debut start for
Italy's national team, hit a penalty kick with nine minutes
remaining to salvage the standings point for Roma. It was the
22-year-old's fifth goal of the season.
	   Bari's players argued with the referee at length about the call
for Moroccan defender Rachim Neqrouz's foul on Totti just inside
the penalty area.
	   Bari had taken the lead five minutes earlier, when South African
striker Phil Masinga knocked in the rebound after Roma 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti failed to hold a shot by Swedish forward Yksel
Osmanovski.
	   The result ended Roma's five-game winning streak at its Olympic
Stadium, where it had outscored the opposition 13-2 before Sunday.
Roma has never lost at home to Bari, winning 22 meetings and
drawing the other six.
	   Roma has a 5-3-2 record for 18 points, pulling even with
Fiorentina, which has a game in hand. A victory over Bari would
have given Roma 20 points and put it alone atop the standings for
the first time since October 1994.
	   Fiorentina can regain the Serie A lead with a draw or victory
against Internazionale of Milan on Sunday.
	   Bari is 2-7-1 for 13 points, tied for ninth place.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon's goal
with 13 minutes left gave Cagliari a 1-0 upset over AC Parma, and
Bologna and Perugia drew 1-1.
	   At Cagliari, Kallon drove a blast into the net after a run up
the right flank for his fifth goal of the season. Cagliari improved
to 4-2-4, while Parma _ which would have moved ahead of Roma in the
standings with a win _ fell to 4-4-2.
	   At Bologna, Croat striker Milan Rapajic put Perugia (3-3-4)
ahead in the 37th minute, dribbling to the end-line before cutting
back toward the center of the field and sending a shot under the
crossbar from a near-impossible angle.
	   Bologna (3-5-2) pulled even just five minutes later, though, on
midfielder Jonathan Binotto's goal.
	   Saturday's games were moved a day ahead of the rest of the
schedule to give Roma, Parma and Bologna extra time to prepare for
UEFA Cup outings Tuesday.
	   On Sunday, in addition to Fiorentina vs. Inter, it's Juventus
vs. Empoli, Salernitana vs. Venezia, Sampdoria of Genoa vs.
Vicenza, Udinese vs. Piacenza, and AC Milan vs. Lazio of Rome at
night.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ More than 1,000 Iranian pilgrims arrived in
Iraq on Saturday, the first group to cross the border since Iran
suspended the pilgrimages for fear of U.S. airstrikes on Iraq, the
official news agency reported.
	   A total of 1,026 Iranians passed through the Iraqi border point
of al-Muntheriya on their way to the Muslim holy sites, the Iraqi
News Agency said.
	   In Tehran, the Iranian newspaper Zan reported Saturday that the
government had decided to allow the pilgrimages to resume on
Thursday _ a week after it suspended them on Nov. 12, quoting the
governor of the border town of Kasr-e-Shirin, Behrouz Karami.
	   In July, Iraq agreed to allow 12,000 Iranians a month to visit
its holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. For Iran's overwhelmingly
Shiite Muslim population, the sacred shrines in these cities are
second only to those in Saudi Arabia.
	   More than 30,000 Iranian pilgrims have traveled to Iraq since
August to visit the shrines, Karami said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians visited Iraq every year until
1980, when war broke out between the two Muslim nations. The war
ended eight years later, but visa restrictions remain in force.

Turkey cautions Italy against asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with Ocalan freed &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday harshly warned Italy against granting political asylum to
a Kurdish rebel leader wanted on terrorism charges in Turkey.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said.
	   On Friday, an Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan under a law barring extradition to
countries where suspects faces the death penalty. The court also
said he could be freed from custody. Turkey said it would appeal.
	   ``I have a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,''
Yilmaz said at a convention of his center-right Motherland Party.
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest
terrorist in the world.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in
Turkey on capital charges.
	   On Saturday, Ocalan left the hospital outside Rome where he'd
been in custody since his arrest Nov. 12 for a private residence in
the Italian capital
	   The court has ordered him to stay in Rome, but that restriction
could be lifted next month. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said
Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge if he leaves Italy.

EU backs Italy's position on Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Italy's European Union partners
Saturday backed Rome in its dispute with Turkey over the case of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
	   The 15-nation EU issued a statement expressing ``full solidarity
with Italy in her determination to fully implement her laws and
treaty obligations.''
	   On Friday, an Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the
arrest of Ocalan under a law barring extradition to countries where
suspects face the death penalty. Italy's stance has enraged opinion
in Turkey, where Ocalan is wanted on terrorism charges.
	   The EU statement also condemned violence by Ocalan's Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought a 14-year-old war for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey that has claimed 37,000
lives.
	   ``The European Union reiterates in condemnation of terrorism in
all forms, including acts of terrorism by the PKK, wherever such
acts occur and for whatever purpose,'' said the statement.
	   Belgian police were out in force around EU headquarters in
Brussels and around the Italian embassy Saturday afternoon after
reports that several thousand Turkish immigrants would demonstrate
to demand Ocalan be handed over. The protest was canceled after
Belgian authorities refused authorization.
	   However, police reported minor clashes with small groups of
Turkish youths after about 150 gathered to protest in largely
immigrant neighborhoods to the north and east of downtown Brussels.
No injuries were reported.

France, Spain pledge to pursue fight against terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL-HENRI du LIMBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA ROCHELLE, France (AP) _ French and Spanish leaders pledged
Saturday to continue their legal battle against Basque terrorism,
saying future policy in this area depended on the separatist group
ETA.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, speaking at the end of a
Franco-Spanish summit, said it ``is essential'' for France and
Spain to maintain their current anti-terrorism stance.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar praised France's role in
the fight against ETA violence and said cooperation between the two
countries had been ``decisive'' in contributing to ETA's
announcement of a unilateral truce in September.
	   Aznar, who earlier this month authorized talks with ETA, told a
news conference he was still waiting for an answer from the
separatist group.
	   ``We are waiting and we will continue to wait,'' Aznar said.
	   Aznar, in a newspaper interview published Friday, described as
``very encouraging'' developments in the Basque situation, but said
that while peace is the goal, Spain must not pay a political price
for it.
	   He added, according to daily Le Figaro, that the ``objective is
to confirm the definitive abandonment of arms. It is up to ETA to
provide the proof of its intentions.''
	   Le Figaro quoted Aznar as rejecting any sort of amnesty for the
535 imprisoned ETA members but saying that the government is
prepared to ``adapt its penitentiary policies'' to regroup ETA
prisoners if violence were renounced.
	   Some ETA prisoners are also currently being held in French
prisons.
	   For the past decade, France has cracked down on militant
separatists taking refuge in the country's Basque region.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom _
has killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968.

Negotiating official blasts Congo rebels for childish conduct

<TEXT>
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ The latest in a series of negotiations
to settle a four-month old civil war in Congo ended inconclusively
on Saturday, with Congolese rebels agreeing in principle to a
cease- fire but refusing to accept a final document.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila did not attend the
negotiations or send a representative, and has refused to discuss a
cease-fire directly with the rebels, making the gathering in
Gaborone unlikely to succeed from the beginning.
	   The talks were aimed at getting the rebels to adopt a cease-fire
plan that was proposed last month at a meeting of 12 African
nations in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   On Friday, it was reported that the rebels supported the draft
cease-fire agreement. But after Saturday's session, it appeared
that was not the case.
	   The rebels demanded changes to the document, repeating past
insistence that they would be recognized as full participants in
peace talks.
	   The rebels asked the Southern African Development Community,
which organized the Gaborone meeting, to help set up face-to-face
talks between the rebel movement and President Laurent Kabila's
government.
	   Rebel delegations have been present at a number of peace
negotiations since August, but Kabila has refused to allow them to
join the talks.
	   SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said the demands would be
passed on to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who is overseeing
the search for peace.
	   ``Ideally, the contents of this agreement should be discussed
directly between the (rebels) and the government or in the presence
of other interested parties,'' the three-page document from the
rebels said on Saturday.
	   Rebel leader Bizima Karaha told journalists his movement would
now ``seriously embark on the peace process'' in Congo although
they did not agree with the cease-fire proposal.
	   South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said the talks had
``narrowed the gap'' towards a cease-fire and improved the chances
of a face-to-face meeting with Kabila, although he did not specify
what had changed from previous negotiations.
	   On Saturday, Mbuende said that the rebels on Friday had demanded
their country be divided with two separate governments, a bid that
he said showed the rebels were behaving like ``spoilt'' children.
	   Rebel leaders could not be reached for comment.
	   Karaha on Friday said insurgents have enough weapons to keep
fighting until the government is toppled.
	   SADC countries that are backing Kabila with weapons and troops _
Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ did not attend the negotiations.
	   Kabila came to power last year after leading a rebellion that
overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He now is confronted by a
rebel force composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of
Kabila's army and opposition politicians.
	   Kabila blames Rwanda and Uganda, who are backing the rebels, for
the war.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ An investigation was launched
Saturday into the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent
women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing was widely
considered to be politically motivated.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control
over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who
was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her
apartment. An aide was also shot and critically wounded.
	   The shooting occurred in a building along St. Petersburg's
atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious Russian
crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor
Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.''
	   Like that fictional crime, which shone a light on social ferment
in the St. Petersburg of its day, the death of Starovoitova was
immediately seized upon as a seminal event in the Russia of the
late 1990s.
	   ``It is one of the black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir
Putin, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the
Interfax news agency. ``It doesn't do much to improve our
reputation, the reputation of the country as a whole.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy in the lower house of
parliament who inspired strong feelings from both her friends and
enemies. She was planning to run for president in 2000.
	   Those close to her speculated about who might have wanted her
dead, with some naming various prominent politicians as potential
culprits.
	   However, Putin, whose agency is in charge of the investigation,
cautioned that there was still no evidence that her death was a
political assassination.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the
motive for the crime, but told reporters that it was being
investigated under a criminal code section that covers terrorism.
	   Arriving at the St. Petersburg airport from Moscow, he said: ``I
brought with me a team of experienced investigators. I think we
will clear it up soon.''
	   Yeltsin sent a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the
``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and
severely punished,''
	   More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square
to remember Starovoitova. People hugged quietly as they listened to
speeches by her fellow politicians and friends.
	   The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations
and photographs of the deputy with various people, including the
late Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov.
	   ``We are united today by pain, which is bigger than politics,''
said Viktor Krivulin, a poet and candidate for the regional
legislature. ``Politics, as I felt during the past night, has
become the art of spitting on the soul.''
	   Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova
was killed by those who disliked her outspoken views.
	   ``She had too many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to
the lawmaker. She said Starovoitova had received many threats in
the past.
	   ``It was doubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov,
the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats.
	   Police said two men followed Starovoitova and her aide, Ruslan
Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her building Friday
evening. Linkov was shot twice. He regained consciousness after a
five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained
in critical condition in intensive care.
	   A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at
the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of
Gorelovo, near St. Petersburg.

EU Council presidency expressed solidarity with Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union on Saturday expressed
its full solidarity with Italy regarding the case of Kurdish leader
Abdullah Oecalan, who was arrested and then released by Italian
authorities.
	   Oecalan, the leader of the underground Kurdish Workers Party,
has been at the center of a war of words between Italy and Turkey,
which has fiercely demanded his extradition. Italy has refused the
demand, pointing out that capital punishment is legal in Turkey.
	   In a statement of the EU Council presidency issued by the
Austrian Foreign Ministry in Vienna, the EU voiced its solidarity
with Italy's determination to fully honor its laws and treaty
obligations.
	   ``The European Union underscores its condemnation of terrorism
in all its forms, including the terrorist acts by the PKK (Kurdish
Workers Party) wherever and for whatever prupose these acts are
committed,'' the statement, as cited by the Austria Press Agency,
said.
	   During a visit in Zagreb, Croatia, Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel, the EU Council president, earlier expressed to
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema his solidarity and confidence in
coping with the crisis surrounding the Kurdish leader.
	   Schuessel said any inappropriate pressure on the part of Turkey
must be rejected.
	   He spoke only days after Turkish President Suleyman Demirel was
on an official three-day visit in Austria.

Turkey cautions Italy against asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with EU issuing statement of support, new warrant
doesn't mean Germany would seek extradition. Edits to conform
throughout
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday harshly warned Italy against granting political asylum to
a Kurdish rebel leader wanted on terrorism charges in Turkey.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said.
	   An Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of
Abdullah Ocalan on Friday under a law barring extradition to
countries where suspects faces the death penalty. On Saturday,
Ocalan was freed from custody.
	   Turkey said it would appeal the court's decision.
	   ``I have a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,''
Yilmaz said at a convention of his center-right Motherland Party.
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest
terrorist in the world.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in
Turkey on capital charges.
	   On Saturday, Ocalan left the hospital outside Rome where he'd
been in custody since his arrest Nov. 12 for a private residence in
the Italian capital
	   The court has ordered him to stay in Rome, but that restriction
could be lifted next month. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said
Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge if he leaves Italy.
	   In Germany, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe said Saturday
that a new arrest warrant had been issued for Ocalan, but it did
not necessarily mean German would seek extradition.
	   Just a day earlier, the Justice Ministry announced that Germany
would not pursue Ocalan's extradition on an earlier warrant. The
new warrant accuses Ocalan of murdering PKK dissidents and a series
of arson attacks.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment was again running high in Turkey on
Saturday after the decision to free Ocalan. Outraged Turks laid
black wreaths in front of the Italian Embassy and honked their
horns. Graffiti denouncing the PKK defaced the walls.
	   ``No to terrorism, today and forever'' read a banner hung across
the boulevard in front of the embassy
	   Turkish businesses were boycotting Italian products and a
newspaper said the government canceled the purchase of five Italian
Agusta helicopters. The Turkish subsidiary of the Italian clothing
company Benetton said it would drape black cloth over the windows
of its 171 outlets in Turkey in protest against.
	   In Rome, the Foreign Ministry advised Italians to put off trips
to Turkey as a precaution.
	   Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema warned Turkey risked distancing
itself from the rest of Europe with its harshness toward Italy.
``Our aim is to be a bridge between Turkey and Europe,'' he said in
an interview with the Turkish newspaper Sabah published Saturday.
	   Other European countries have tried to stay out of the dispute,
but the United States has been pushing Italy to extradite Ocalan.
	   On Saturday, the European Union backed up Italy, issuing a
statement expressing ``full solidarity with Italy in her
determination to fully implement her laws and treaty obligations.''
At the same time, the EU condemned violence by the PKK.
	   The Washington-based Human Rights Watch also said Saturday that
it supports Italy's decision not to extradite, but added that he
should be ``held accountable for atrocities committed under his
leadership.''
	   Italy had been Turkey's staunch ally in its bid for EU
membership. That bid has been unsuccessful, in part because
Turkey's human rights record is marred by its treatment of its 12
to 15 million Kurds.

Jamaica to try again to resume hangings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica will try again this week to
resume hangings after a 10-year lull with two convicts scheduled to
go to the gallows Thursday.
	   A third convict is scheduled to hang on Dec. 1, National
Security and Justice Minister K.D. Knight confirmed Saturday.
	   Jamaica and other Caribbean nations want to resume executions to
try to stem crime, but have encountered international criticism.
	   Several Caribbean countries have withdrawn from some accords
allowing condemned prisoners to appeal their sentences to
international tribunals. Jamaica officials said prisoners abused
the appeals process to delay executions indefinitely.
	   Jamaica is also urging neighboring nations to form a regional
final appeals court to replace the London-based Privy Council,
which serves as the final court of appeal for several former
British colonies.
	   ``The time has come for a final court of our own,'' Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson said at a recent regional summit.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis recently executed prisoners for the first
time in more than a decade and Trinidad and Tobago also wants to
resume hangings.
	   In Jamaica, Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine are scheduled to hang
Thursday and Milton Montague is scheduled for the gallows on Dec.
1.
	   In a separate case, two men on death row were freed last week
after new evidence was submitted to the court.
	   Samuel ``Sammy Dread'' Lindsay and Henry ``Roscoe George'' McKoy
were set free Friday after a new witness testified they were not
the killers of Richard Forbes and Suzette Brown, who was pregnant
when the couple was killed in 1993.
	   The new evidence was heard by the court after an order by the
Privy Council _ the part of the appeals process Jamaica now wants
to replace with a regional court.

Turkish premier reelected to head center-right party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP)_ The center-right Motherland Party reelected
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz as its leader on Saturday in show of
support in the face of his almost certain defeat in a no-confidence
vote next week.
	   Opposition parties have moved to topple Yilmaz' 17-month-old
minority government, accusing the premier of having links to
organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a bank. He
is expected to lose the confidence vote on Wednesday.
	   Yilmaz, who stood for reelection unopposed, has denied the
allegations raised after a businessman with links to a mafia boss,
claimed the premier had helped him purchase the bank.
	   The premier defended himself Saturday saying his government had
efficiently battled organized crime, arresting several mobsters
over the past months.
	   ``The only ones to gain from the fall of this government will be
the gangs and the criminals,'' Yilmaz told thousands of delegates.
	   The collapse of the government will open the way for lengthy
negotiations among parties for a new coalition since no party has
enough votes to rule alone.
	   Turkey has been rocked by allegations of ties between the
government and organized crime since 1996, when a car crash injured
a legislator and killed a police official and a fugitive _ all
riding together in the same car. State Minister Eyup Asik, from

Bundesbank chairman outlines elements for stable world finance and
</HEADLINE>
economic systems &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With introduction of the euro - western Europe's
single currency just 40 days away, Germany's central bank chief
Hans Tietmeyer on Saturday outlined what he said were three central
elements for stable world finance and economic systems.
	   Speaking at a European Forum conference in Berlin attended by to
top international economic representatives, Tietmeyer said the most
important element for stability of a country was correct domestic
political policies,
	   The conference was seen as especially important since the
European Union began membership talks earlier this month with the
Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Cyprus.
	   Tietmeyer told the delegates that domestic policies encompassed
solid public budgeting, stable money policies, a functional finance
system, along with a sufficient amount of competition and
flexibility in domestic goods and employment markets.
	   To insure they are up to standard, countries should be regularly
surveyed through ``critical and transparent'' consultations with
the International Monetary Fund, the central bank chairman said.
	   Tietmeyer also cautioned against protectionism of markets, which
``mostly in the long run is damaging to (a country's) own
competitiveness.''
	   ``The consumer markets should be as open as possible,'' he said.
	   Capital markets should also be open, but the sequence to doing
that required a country to have a domestic finance sector that is
capable of dealing with large amounts of capital, Tietmeyer said.
	   ``Especially important is that the exchange rate policies must
find the right level,'' Tietmeyer said in a prepared statement.
	   Transparency in a country's financial data, information on
foreign debt structures and maturity schedules along with close
cooperation on International Monetary Fund surveys were among other
items Tietmeyer said were requirements for those countries
expecting to compete on a stable international market.

Illegal immigrants protest in several French cities

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of illegal immigrants took to the streets
Saturday in several French cities, asking that the French
government give them residency status.
	   Immigrants protested in Paris, as well as Orleans, Le Havre,
Bordeaux and Lille. Anti-racism groups, labor union leaders and
members of the Greens party joined the marches.
	   In Paris, several thousand illegal immigrants began their march
on the capital's left bank in the mid afternoon. The protesters
carried banners denouncing Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and beat drums as they wound their way toward Jospin's Matignon
palace.
	   Official estimates on the number of marchers were not
immediately available.
	   The protests were seen as a test of a movement that began in
1996 with a two-month-long occupation of a Paris church by 300
African illegal immigrants.
	   The Socialist-led French government has legalized the status of
some 76,000 illegal immigrants but has rejected residency requested
for more than 64,000 others.
	   The Greens, represented by Environment Minister Dominique
Voynet, have called for the government to provide residency status
for all illegal immigrants, who in French are called ``sans
papiers'' or those without papers.
	   Jospin has been more generous in granting residency permits to
illegal immigrants than the previous conservative government.
	   But the far right National Front, which blames high unemployment
on immigrants, has accused Jospin of being too soft on the issue.
	   Philippe Seguin, head of French President Jacques Chirac's Rally
for the Republic (RPR) party, proposed Saturday that the government
give illegal immigrants an 18-month grace period to leave the
country.

Jamaica to try again to resume hangings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CAROLL ORR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica will try again this week to
resume hangings after a 10-year lull, with two convicts scheduled
to go to the gallows Thursday.
	   A third convict is scheduled to hang on Dec. 1, National
Security and Justice Minister K.D. Knight confirmed Saturday.
	   Jamaica and other Caribbean nations want to resume executions to
try to stem crime, but have encountered international criticism.
	   Several Caribbean countries have withdrawn from some accords
allowing condemned prisoners to appeal their sentences to
international tribunals. Jamaica officials said prisoners abused
the process to delay execution indefinitely.
	   Jamaica is also urging neighboring nations to form a regional
final appeals court to replace the London-based Privy Council,
which serves as the final court of appeal for several former
British colonies.
	   ``The time has come for a final court of our own,'' Prime
Minister P.J. Patterson said at a recent regional summit.
	   St. Kitts and Nevis recently executed prisoners for the first
time in more than a decade and Trinidad and Tobago also wants to
resume hangings.
	   In Jamaica, Dalton Daley and Peter Blaine are scheduled to hang
Thursday and Milton Montague is scheduled for the gallows on Dec.
1.
	   In a separate case, two men on death row were freed last week
after new evidence was submitted.
	   Samuel ``Sammy Dread'' Lindsay and Henry ``Roscoe George'' McKoy
were freed Friday after a new witness testified that they were not
the killers of Richard Forbes and Suzette Brown, who was pregnant
when the couple was killed in 1993.
	   The new evidence was heard by the court after an order by the
Privy Council _ the part of the appeals process Jamaica wants to
replace with a regional court.

Eales kicks Wallabies to victory over France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Australian captain John Eales kicked
four second-half penalties to guide the Wallabies to a 32-21 win
over France on Saturday, making a comeback after the home side had
taken a surprise 21-20 half-time lead.
	   Eales, who scored 15 points on his 64th international
appearance, made the most of repeated infringements from the French
as Australia tightened its defense in the second period to win the
first of its two-match European tour - and break the home side's
eight-match winning streak.
	   France and Australia displayed classy attacking play that
augured well for both nations at next year's World Cup.
	   In bitterly cold conditions at the Stade de France, Australia
scored three tries to France's two in a brilliant first half.
	   Three penalties from Christophe Lamaison, including a stunning
50-yard (meter) kick in the 10th minute, gave the French a 21-20
lead at the break.
	   Daniel Wilson scored the first try of the match in the sixth
minute, after brilliant work by Daniel Herbert.
	   The Queensland center shimmied past three tackles before finding
Joe Roff, whose pass set up Wilson for a comfortable try.
	   Thomas Bowman scored the Wallabies' second try in the 13th
minute, after collecting a long looping pass from Stephen Larkham.
	   But France bounced back from the Australians' early domination
to score two tries.
	   In the 24th minute, winger Thomas Lombard put France ahead,
shaking off a tackle from Stephen Larkham and sprinting 40 yards
(meters) to score.
	   A classy lineout move gave France a 21-13 lead in the 36th
minute.
	   Two meters from the line, Olivier Magne was first to the ball
and then the French forwards drove over the line with Philippe
Carbonneau scoring the try.
	   But Toutai Kefu scored Australia's third first-half try in the
40th minute with another superb effort, charging 40 yards (meters)
to score.
	   Australia was weakened by the unavailability of seven of its top
players for the 13-day European tour.
	   Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim Horan, Damian Smith and Dan Crowley
were among the absentees.
	   Australia had won both the countries' recent meetings, 29-15 in
Sydney and 26-19 in Brisbane last year.
	   Lineups:
	   France: Artur Gomes, Philippe Bernat-Salles, Christophe
Lamaison, Stephane Glas, Thomas Lombard, David Aucagne, Philippe
Carbonneau, Thomas Lievremont, Olivier Magne, Marc Lievremont,
Fabien Pelous, Olivier Brouzet, Franck Tournaire, Raphael Ibanez,
Sylvain Marconnet.
	   Australia: Chris Latham, Jason Little, Daniel Herbert, Nathan
Grey, Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David
Wilson, Matthew Cockbain, John Eales, Thomas Bowman, Andrew Blades,
Phil Kearns, Patricio Noriega.

Turkey cautions Italy against asylum for Kurdish rebel leader

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on
Saturday harshly warned Italy against granting political asylum to
a Kurdish rebel leader wanted on terrorism charges in Turkey.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Yilmaz said.
	   An Italian court rejected a Turkish warrant for the arrest of
Abdullah Ocalan on Friday under a law barring extradition to
countries where suspects faces the death penalty. On Saturday,
Ocalan was freed from custody.
	   Turkey said it would appeal the court's decision.
	   ``I have a few words to say to our friend and ally Italy,''
Yilmaz said at a convention of his center-right Motherland Party.
``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the bloodiest
terrorist in the world.''
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives. He is on trial in absentia in
Turkey on capital charges.
	   On Saturday, Ocalan left the hospital outside Rome where he'd
been in custody since his arrest Nov. 12 for a private residence in
the Italian capital
	   The court has ordered him to stay in Rome, but that restriction
could be lifted next month. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said
Saturday that Libya might offer him refuge if he leaves Italy.
	   In Germany, the federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe said Saturday
that a new arrest warrant had been issued for Ocalan, but it did
not necessarily mean Germany would seek extradition.

U.S. doubles luge teams win World Cup opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IGLS, Austria (AP) _ the United States doubles luge team of
Christian Niccum and Matt McClain emerged from the considerable
shadow of their Olympic medal-winning teammates Saturday by winning
the season's opening World Cup race.
	   Niccum, of Woodinville, Washington, and McClain of Lake Placid,
New York, four-time world junior champions, were in a dead tie to
the thousandth of a second with Nagano bronze medalists and
defending World Cup overall winners Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin
after the first of two runs. But a brilliant second heat gave the
20-year-olds a .072 victory margin.
	   ``All I cared about was seeing the U.S. flag fly at the awards
ceremony and hearing the anthem,'' said McClain. ``We're not really
used to that. it was like a silly dream.''
	   The winners posted times of 50.197 and 40.224 seconds for a
cumulative 1 minute, 20.421 seconds. Grimmettee, of Muskegon,
Michigan, and Martin of Palo Alto, California, began their defense
of the World Cup crown with a second-place clocking of 1:20.493.
Italians Gerhard Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder were third
in 1:20.675.
	   Olympic silver medal winners Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer
finished fourth for the third consecutive luge race dating back to
1995 on this former Olympic course. Thorpe, of Marquette, Michigan,
and Sheer, of Croton, New York, recorded a time of 1:20.818.
	   Germany dominated the women's event when Sylke Otto, who failed
to qualify for the 1998 Olympic team, also overcame two Nagano
medalists en route to victory, Otto's times of 40.100 and 40.288
totaled 1:20.388.
	   Teammate and Olumpic silver medalist Barbara Niederhuber placed
second in 1:20.884. Austrian Angelike Neuner, bronze winner in
Nagano, finished third in 1:20.954.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with rejection of minister's resignation;
CHANGES overline; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot president rejected Saturday
the resignation of his interior minister, who has been accused of
corruption by a parliamentary committee.
	   President Glafcos Clerides announced his decision in a statement
issued after a five-hour Cabinet meeting called to discuss the
attorney-general's report into the accusations against the
minister, Dinos Michaelides.
	   The statement said the attorney general had found 11 corruption
charges against Michaelides to be baseless. The accusations stemmed
from the chairman of the parliamentary Watchdog Committee.
	   But the Cabinet accepted the attorney-general's recommendation
that the police investigate two other allegations against the
minister, whose department issues building permits and residence
visas.
	   The two allegations say Michaelides benefited personally from
alterations in town planning zones and from the irregular granting
of residence permits to aliens.
	   Clerides said he would not accept Michaelides' resignation
because an investigation itself ``does not constitute guilt, and no
person is considered guilty because there are charges against
him.''
	   Earlier Michaelides had walked out of the Cabinet meeting,
telling reporters he had submitted his resignation because of the
attorney-general's recommendation that two charges be pursued.
	   Later Michaelides was summoned to the Presidential Palace to be
told that his resignation had been rejected. On leaving,
Michaelides told journalists he was fully satisfied with the
development and had withdrawn his resignation.
	   Opposition parties have criticized Clerides for not insisting
that Michaelides step down while the investigation is conducted.
	   During the presidential elections in February, Michaelides broke
ranks with his party to endorse Clerides.

a newspaper said Saturday.
	   A group calling itself Net Struggle demanded that Education
Minister Gerasimos Arsenis negotiate with student groups before
imposing the reforms, the afternoon daily Ethnos said.
	   Earlier this week, a student splashed Arsenis with a glass of
water while he was at a restaurant.
	   The education reforms, introduced in September, have changed
course structures at high schools and universities. Students have
staged occupations and street rallies against the measures, while
teachers have threatened strikes.

Tourist visit to North shows change on Korean border

	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ When a South Korean cruise ship
sailed into the North Korean port of Changjon this week, passengers
could hear the shouts of drilling soldiers carry clearly on the
cold winter air.
	   As the tourists crowded the ship's deck, they were treated to
the sight of hundreds of fatigue-clad soldiers marching down a
waterfront road, singing military songs and shouting slogans.
	   Anchored nearby were seven warships weighing up to 1,000 tons.
	   One, its guns clearly visible, sailed past the curious tourists,
who stood on the cruise ship's open deck to take a first look at a
land that had been off limits to them for the past half century.
	   The scene symbolized a subtle but significant change taking
place along the tense Korean border, the world's last front line in
a Cold War that began to evaporate a decade ago.
	   It was a difference that U.S. President Bill Clinton pointed to
in a news conference Saturday with South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung, as he endorsed Kim's policy of engagement with North
Korea.
	   ``The significance is far reaching,'' Hong Yong-chan, an
economic professor at Seoul's Hankook University of Foreign
Studies, said of the North Korean decision to open Changjon to
South Korean tourists.
	   Hong was one of the some 800 tourists who arrived in Changjon on
Thursday aboard the first cruise ship operated by a South Korean
conglomerate in a joint venture with North Korea.
	   Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea fought in the
early 1950s in a war that ended without a peace treaty, leaving
them still technically at war. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   But apparently for economic reasons, the impoverished North
opened the military port at Changjon to South Korean tourists under
a dlrs 905 million deal with Seoul's Hyundai Group.
	   Changjon is the gateway to Diamond Mountain, a remote region of
high crags, deep valleys and thundering waterfalls only 16
kilometers (10 miles) from the border with the South.
	   Officials of South Korea's Unification Ministry, who accompanied
the tourists, said North Korea's military strongly opposed opening
Changjon, but were overruled by leader Kim Jong Il.
	   The Unification Ministry is charged with guiding policy toward
the North, and about half a dozen of its officials were aboard the
tour ship. The North initially objected, but eventually relented
and allowed them to debark.
	   The ministry officials said the deal with Hyundai is enough to
cover North Korea's annual shortfall of 1.5 million tons of grain
until 2004.
	   Changjon's harbor, nestled below Diamond Mountain in an
excellent natural shelter, was until recently the home base of a
major North Korean naval fleet.
	   Most of the fleet was relocated farther north before the tour
started, according to the South Korean officials. The port's
facilities look very old. Some were built during Japan's colonial
rule in the early part of the century.
	   Berthing facilities were rusting and shore embankments were
unrepaired. Along the long ridge of the mountain stretching into
the sea were several huge tunnels used as shelters for warships.
	   Their entrances were temporarily blocked and camouflaged after
the ships were relocated. Matchbox-shaped gray concrete buildings
used by soldiers and their families dotted one side of the shore.
	   Most of those buildings were empty, their occupants transferred
to other bases.
	   Lee Chang-sung, 69, who served as a North Korean sailor at
Changjon before the Korean War, said the port looked just as he
remembered it.
	   ``No improvement was made from my days in 1949 and 1950,'' said
Lee, who was captured during the Korean War, freed, and chose to
live in South Korea.
	   Hyundai plans to spend millions at Diamond Mountain building a
hotel, golf course, restaurants and other facilities in an effort
to create a major tourist attraction.
	   But major obstacles remain after decades of conflict and
mistrust.
	   Every movement of the first South Korean visitors was closely
watched by North Korean officials. They blocked transmission of
reports by 200 journalists who accompanied the tour, a major news
event in South Korea.
	   Most of the tourists were elderly natives of North Korea who
were separated from their families during the war, a fate shared by
about 10 million Koreans on both sides of the border.
	   But the visitors were confined to strictly designated areas and
no reunions were allowed. No contact with any North Koreans
civilians was allowed.
	   For Lee Young-shik, 67, a South Korean businessman, the tour
stopped only about 1,000 meters (yards) from where he was born and
raised.
	   ``My native home is just over there, but I can not go,'' Lee
said fighting back tears. ``I am returning with a broken heart, but
i will come back.''

First Lady visits U.S.-supported health facilities in Haiti
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ On the last leg of her six-nation
tour of hurricane-ravaged Central America and the Caribbean, U.S.
first lady Hillary Clinton is expected in Haiti Saturday for a
two-day inspection of U.S.-funded health facilities.
	   Aside from the effects of Hurricane Georges, which killed at
least 221 people in Haiti, Mrs. Clinton will see a country that is
not only the Western Hemisphere's poorest, but also its least
healthy.
	   ``The future of democracy depends on the capacity of people to
live, work, and reproduce in good health,'' said Michelle
Pierre-Louis, executive director of the Haitian Knowledge and
Freedom Foundation, which is funded by financier-philanthropist
George Soros. ``But in Haiti two out of three farmers are always
sick.''
	   Forty percent of the estimated 8 million population _ of which
two thirds is rural _ have no access to health care and 75 percent
have no access to family planning services, a recent U.S. Agency
for International Development report stated.
	   One child of eight does not live to the age of 5, the highest
mortality rate in the Western Hemisphere, and one of three is
chronically malnourished, the USAID report stated.
	   Sunday, Mrs. Clinton will visit two U.S.-funded health
facilities.
	   Bienfaisance Hospital in Pignon, about 60 miles (100 kilometers)
northeast of the capital, provides curative and preventive health
care to over 125,000 people as well as training in maternal care,
literacy, and family planning.
	   The Foundation for Family and Reproductive Health, a capital
family planning clinic, is a model for reducing adolescent
pregnancy.
	   The father of computer software tycoon Bill Gates, William H.
Gates Sr., will accompany Mrs. Clinton on her tour.
	   The William Gates Foundation has made a three-year, dlrs 1.25
million grant to the Family and Reproductive Health clinic and a
three-year, dlrs 1.5 million grant to Management and Resources for
Community Health, a suburban Petionville organization which assists
women of child-bearing age.
	   More than one third of girls and young women give birth before
the age of 20.
	   Mrs. Clinton will also visit the Soros-funded Basil Moreau
nursery and primary school in suburban Bizoton. The 450 children
are given hot lunches and health care and their parents benefit
from family planning instruction.
	   The United States is Haiti's largest international health donor,
providing dlrs 16.7 million in fiscal 1997.
	   Hurricane Georges, which hit Haiti on Sept. 22, worsened the
country's chronic health problems and poverty.
	   Mrs. Clinton has also visited Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Guatemala, hit by Hurricane Mitch, and the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti and also suffered
from Georges.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered
Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most
prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing
was widely considered to be politically motivated.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control
over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who
was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her
apartment. An aide was also shot and critically wounded.
	   The shooting occurred in a building along St. Petersburg's
atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious Russian
crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor
Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.''
	   Like that fictional crime, which shone a light on social ferment
in the St. Petersburg of its day, the death of Starovoitova was
immediately seized upon as a seminal event in the Russia of the
late 1990s.
	   ``It is one of the black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir
Putin, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the
Interfax news agency. ``It doesn't do much to improve our
reputation, the reputation of the country as a whole.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy in the lower house of
parliament who inspired strong feelings from both her friends and
enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party,
she was planning to run for president in 2000.
	   Those close to her speculated about who might have wanted her
dead, with some naming various prominent politicians as potential
culprits.
	   ``Whose path did she cross? The answer is simple: communists and
gangsters,'' said former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais.
``These are the two kinds of people in whose way she was
standing.''
	   Putin, whose agency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned
that there was still no evidence that her death was a political
assassination.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the
motive for the crime, but told reporters that it was being
investigated under a criminal code section that covers terrorism.
	   Arriving at the St. Petersburg airport from Moscow, he said: ``I
brought with me a team of experienced investigators. I think we
will clear it up soon.''
	   Yeltsin sent a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the
``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and
severely punished,''
	   The president also sent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in
which he called her ``one of the most vivid figures in Russian
politics,'' who ``consistently upheld the lofty ideals of freedom
and democracy.''
	   More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square
to remember Starovoitova. People hugged quietly as they listened to
speeches by her fellow politicians and friends.
	   The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations
and photographs of the deputy with various people, including the
late Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov.
	   ``We are united today by pain, which is bigger than politics,''
said Viktor Krivulin, a poet and candidate for the regional
legislature. ``Politics, as I felt during the past night, has
become the art of spitting on the soul.''
	   Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova
was killed by those who disliked her outspoken views.
	   ``She had too many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to
the lawmaker. She said Starovoitova had received many threats in
the past.
	   ``It was doubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov,
the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats.
	   Police said two men followed Starovoitova and her aide, Ruslan
Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her building Friday
evening. Linkov was shot twice. He regained consciousness after a
five-hour operation at the Military Medical Academy, but remained
in critical condition in intensive care.
	   A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at
the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of
Gorelovo, near St. Petersburg.

Zimbabwe unions press government on plight of farm workers and cost
</HEADLINE>
of top-heavy government &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL HARTNACK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The country's trade unions on Saturday
seized the international spotlight on government plans to take over
white-owned farms, raising questions about the fate of 60,000 black
farm workers who could lose their jobs.
	   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trades Unions said it would investigate
what would happen to the workers if the government resettles
thousands of landless blacks onto more than 800 farms, as it
threatened once again last week to do.
	   International donors are closely watching the proposed seizure
that would violate promises made by President Robert Mugabe that he
would hold off on the takeovers.
	   ``The ZCTU has never opposed the land reform policy in broad
terms,'' said secretary general Morgan Tsvangirai. ``But we must
get the facts as far as this is concerned.''
	   Mugabe's intended land seizure is seen as an attempt to
cultivate support in the country at a time that unrest over soaring
prices and government corruption present the most serious threat
ever to his 18-year-old governance.
	   Mugabe and his family left unexpectedly on Friday for a 16-day
overseas trip to Egypt, Libya, France, Italy and Britain, without
the customary formal announcement in the government gazette. No
reason was given for the trip.
	   Following two one-day strikes over the past two weeks that shut
down the economy, the ZCTU said it would submit its strongest
demands to date to the government on Monday, part of a platform
adopted by its national executive panel on Saturday.
	   It plans to push for an increase in power for Parliament, a
reduction in the number of costly cabinet members from 54 to 15,
and a refund of billions of Zimbabwe dollars (millions of U.S.
dollars) that politicians have bilked from housing and pension
funds.
	   Until now, the unions have restricted their demands to wage
matters, pushing for increased salaries and reduced prices to
counteract soaring inflation.
	   Tsvangirai said the unions would also demand a full statement of
the cost of Zimbabwe's current war effort in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, where over 8,000 troops are backing President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The labor leader called for a social contract to address poverty
alleviation to be discussed at the ongoing talks between labor,
business and government that is next to meet on Nov. 30.
	   The United Nations says 60 percent of Zimbabwe's 12.7 million
people live below the poverty line.

South Africa wins 35-10 for 16th win in a row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ South Africa ran in four second half
tries for a 35-10 victory over Scotland Saturday to make it 16 wins
in a row in international matches, one short of New Zealand's
record of 17.
	   On top of opportunist tries by scrum half Joost van der
Westhuizen and winger Pieter Rossouw, the Springboks, who trailed
7-3 early in the game, produced top-quality scores by center Andre
Snyman and livewire back row forward Bobby Skinstad.
	   Scottish fly half Duncan Hodge scored all his team's points with
a try, conversion and penalty while South African winger Stefan
Terblanche also crossed the home line. Fullback Percy Montgomery
kicked two penalties and two conversions.
	   Narrowly beating Wales 27-20 after trailing with three minutes
to go, the Springboks were expected to totally overwhelmed a
much-changed Scottish team.
	   Although they produced long periods of pressure, with the back
row Skinstad, Johan Erasmus, Gary Teichmann and later Andre Venter
in control, they didn't produced the high-scoring result they
expected and the Scots, who impressed with their attacking ideas
and handling, didn't look like a team which lost for the 10th time
in 11 internationals.
	   The South Africans went ahead when Montgomery kicked a penalty
from 20 meters and Hodge had a great chance to tie the score from a
similar distance in the 22nd minute but sliced his kick wide.
	   Hodge made amends with a try.
	   From 30 meters out, the Scots kicked for position rather than
going for points and, after winning the lineout, ran the ball
across the line.
	   Back row Eric Peters fed Hodge, who ran through a a huge gap in
the South African defense to cross beneath the posts. Hodge kicked
the convertion and the Scots led 7-3 with 27 minutes gone.
	   Montgomery cut the lead to 7-6 with a penalty for a Scottish
offside in front of the posts before Terblanche scored his ninth
try in South African colors.
	   Fly half Henry Honiball fed Johan Erasmus who found Terblanche
in plenty of room. With the Scottish defense expecting a pass
outside, the winger cut inside and charged through the gap for the
score.
	   Just before half time, Hodge had a chance to cut South AFrica's
lead to one point with an angled penalty after a stunning break by
New Zealand-born center John Leslie had been halted 20 meters short
of the line.
	   With minutes into the second half, Van der Westhuizen scored his
24th try for South Africa in a breakaway after Scottish winger Alan
Tait had been tackled by winger Roussow.
	   The scrum half picked up the loose ball and raced half the field
for the score. Montgomery missed the conversion attempt but another
South African try soon followed.
	   After strong forward pressure, Snyman took a long pass from
Honiball high in the air and ran past Townsend to the line.
Montgomery kicked the conversion and the Springboks led 23-10.
	   Hodge cut the lead to 23-10 with a straightforward penalty with
21 minutes to go before Roussow came up with another breakaway try.
	   Hodge tried to chip the ball over the head of Honiball but the
lanky fly half stretched up his arms to block the ball. It
rebounded conveniently into the arms of winger Roussow who had no
one between him and the line. Montgomery missed the conversion
kick.
	   Skinstad almost made it to the line for another try but passed
to Andre Venter who was tackled just short. But he wasn't to be
denied and produced the fifth South African try of the match in the
final minute for his fourth in eight tests.
	   With the Scottish defense sucked in, Honiball fed a short pass
to substitute Venter who switched it on to Skinstad who used his
amazing pace to outrun the only two defenders left. Montgomery
converted.
	   Lineups:
	   Scotland _ Derrick Lee; Alan Tait, Jamie Mayer, John Leslie,
Cameron Murray; Duncan Hodge, Bryan Redpath; Tom Smith, Gordon
Bulloch, Paul Burnell, Scott Murray, Doddie Weir, Peter Walton,
Eric Peters, Budge Pountney.
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Christian Stewart, Pieter Rossouw; Henry Honiball, Joost
van de Westhuizen; Robbie Kempson, James Dalton, Adrian Garvey,
Krynauw Otto, Mark Andrews, Johan Erasmus, Gary Teichmann, Bobby
Skinstad.

Butyrskaya win womens to beat Bobek; French take pairs

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Russian Maria Butyrskaya rallied from third to beat
American Nicole Bobek to take the women's event at the Lalique
Trophy figure skating competition Saturday.
	   Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis of France won the pairs
program for their major international victory.
	   Although Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian
did the more difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand
Prix victory of the season. She won also at Skate America.
	   Leading after the short program, Bobek was looking for her first
major victory since the 1995 U.S. title.
	   It was not to be. Although Bobek's music to ``Evita'' was
inspiring, her skating was not.
	   Bobek started well with a triple lutz-double toe loop
combination. Then she proceeded to scale down three triple jumps to
doubles in her next four attempts. She ended with just three
triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from her eyes while
waiting for her marks.
	   She scored technical marks between 5.0 to 5,4 and only a little
better in the presentation marks.
	   Butyrskaya skated well enough to win. Opening with a good triple
lutz and adding three more triples, she scored more than two-tenths
better than Bobek on nearly every mark to win easily.
	   Although Butyrskaya went down on one triple jump and had to put
a hand down on another, the overall quality and quantity of the
jumps gave her the win.
	   Third went to Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena
Liashenko of Ukraine who had mistakes on nearly every jump
including falling twice.
	   Abitbol and Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer
mistakes of the top couples. In the short program there was little
to distinguish them because all skated clean.
	   In the free program to the music of `Acropolis' they were off in
individual jumps but had some unusual lifts to maintain first.
	   Americans Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman moved from fourth to
second with a program to the music from ``Phantom of the Opera.''
They scaled down a few triple moves and only had single axels at
the end of their program.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

 &UR; U.S. doubles luge teams win World Cup opener &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   IGLS, Austria (AP) _ the United States doubles luge team of
Christian Niccum and Matt McClain emerged from the considerable
shadow of their Olympic medal-winning teammates Saturday by winning
the season's opening World Cup race.
	   Niccum, of Woodinville, Washington, and McClain of Lake Placid,
New York, four-time world junior champions, were in a dead tie to
the thousandth of a second with Nagano bronze medalists and
defending World Cup overall winners Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin
after the first of two runs. But a brilliant second heat gave the
20-year-olds a .072 victory margin.
	   ``All I cared about was seeing the U.S. flag fly at the awards
ceremony and hearing the anthem,'' said McClain. ``We're not really
used to that. it was like a silly dream.''
	   The winners posted times of 50.197 and 40.224 seconds for a
cumulative 1 minute, 20.421 seconds. Grimmettee, of Muskegon,
Michigan, and Martin of Palo Alto, California, began their defense
of the World Cup crown with a second-place clocking of 1:20.493.
Italians Gerhard Plankensteiner and Oswald Haselrieder were third
in 1:20.675.
	   Olympic silver medal winners Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer
finished fourth for the third consecutive luge race dating back to
1995 on this former Olympic course. Thorpe, of Marquette, Michigan,
and Sheer, of Croton, New York, recorded a time of 1:20.818.
	   Germany dominated the women's event when Sylke Otto, who failed
to qualify for the 1998 Olympic team, also overcame two Nagano
medalists en route to victory, Otto's times of 40.100 and 40.288
totaled 1:20.388.
	   Teammate and Olumpic silver medalist Barbara Niederhuber placed
second in 1:20.884. Austrian Angelike Neuner, bronze winner in
Nagano, finished third in 1:20.954.

Mandela campaigns in last stronghold of apartheid's architect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ President Nelson Mandela on Saturday
took his party's election campaign into the last stronghold of
apartheid's architect, seeking to undermine the National Party's
only provincial power base.
	   Speaking to African National Congress party contributors,
religious leaders and other groups at three stops during the day,
Mandela sought to reassure non-blacks that they had a role to play
in the new South Africa.
	   His ANC won more than 60 percent of the vote in the first
democratic elections in 1994 that ended decades of white minority
rule.
	   But the National Party that ruled during apartheid won the local
provincial elections in 1994, hanging on to its traditional power
base in the Western Cape with the support of many mixed-race _ or
colored _ voters.
	   The ANC rules in seven other provinces, with the Zulu
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party ruling KwaZulu-Natal.
	   The 1999 election date has not yet been set, but Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki is expected to succeed Mandela as president.
Mandela is stepping down.
	   Mandela wore a T-shirt with Mbeki's picture at his separate
campaign stops in black and mixed race neighborhoods. On Sunday he
is to meet with white voters at the waterfront.
	   ``We in the ANC have no minorities. We have human beings,''
Mandela said.
	   He said the government did not intend to marginalize coloreds,
Asians and whites, who should stop thinking of themselves as
minority groups.
	   At one of his stops, Mandela lashed out at vigilante groups that
use religion to justify their attacks on alleged drug dealers _ a
thinly veiled reference to People Against Gangsterism and Drugs
(PAGAD).
	   With large support in the Muslim community, PAGAD has targeted
alleged drug dealers with bombings and violence, police have said.
	   ``They violently assume the role of the law and harass and
inflict violence against innocent members of their communities,''
he said.
	   Mandela vowed that the government would intensify its fight
against crime. Soaring violence has plagued South Africa since the
early '90s, as apartheid started being dismantled.

Eales kicks Wallabies to victory over France

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS typo in slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Australian captain John Eales kicked
four second-half penalties and rallied the Wallabies from a
one-point halftime deficit to a 32-21 victory over France on
Saturday.
	   Eales, who scored 15 points on his 64th international
appearance, made the most of repeated infringements from the French
as Australia tightened its defense in the second half to win the
first game of its two-match European tour _ and end the home side's
eight-match winning streak.
	   France and Australia displayed classy attacking play that
augured well for both nations at next year's World Cup.
	   In bitterly cold conditions at the Stade de France, Australia
scored three tries to France's two in a brilliant first half.
	   Three penalties from Christophe Lamaison, including a stunning
50-yard (meter) kick in the 10th minute, gave the French a 21-20
lead at the break.
	   Daniel Wilson scored the first try of the match in the sixth
minute, after brilliant work by Daniel Herbert.
	   The Queensland center shimmied past three tackles before finding
Joe Roff, whose pass set up Wilson for a comfortable try.
	   Thomas Bowman scored the Wallabies' second try in the 13th
minute, after collecting a long looping pass from Stephen Larkham.
	   But France bounced back from the Australians' early domination
to score two tries.
	   In the 24th minute, winger Thomas Lombard put France ahead,
shaking off a tackle from Stephen Larkham and sprinting 40 yards
(meters) to score.
	   A classy lineout move gave France a 21-13 lead in the 36th
minute.
	   Two meters from the line, Olivier Magne was first to the ball
and then the French forwards drove over the line with Philippe
Carbonneau scoring the try.
	   But Toutai Kefu scored Australia's third first-half try in the
40th minute with another superb effort, charging 40 yards (meters)
to score.
	   Australia was weakened by the unavailability of seven of its top
players for the 13-day European tour.
	   Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim Horan, Damian Smith and Dan Crowley
were among the absentees.
	   Australia had won both the countries' recent meetings, 29-15 in
Sydney and 26-19 in Brisbane last year.
	   ___ &QC;

 &UR; Palestinians says Israeli release of thieves violates accord
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES byline, ADDS Palestinians say prisoners released not
part of accord, Palestinian police move into more villages, Arafat
quote, arrest of Hamas leader
 &UR; AP Photos JRL101-103
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, the Palestinians said Saturday that they did not consider
150 criminals released by Israel as part of those detainees to be
freed under the agreement.
	   The Palestinians said they protested to the United States over
``a violation of the accord'' since Israel released on Friday
mostly car thieves and drug dealers and only 100 prisoners accused
in the struggle against Israeli occupation.
	   Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 9.1
percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum signed last month, Israel
is slated to withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January in tandem with Palestinian steps against
anti-Israeli activity.
	   The pullbacks in three phases will grant the Palestinians
partial or total control over 40 percent of the area.
	   ``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S.
President Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi,
a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not
fair and shows bad intentions.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in
response that the peace accord did not stipulate that Israel free
prisoners with Jewish ``blood on their hands.''
	   In completing the transfer of the territory, Palestinian police
entered on Saturday seven of the 36 villages located between the
cities of Jenin and Nablus.
	   Only a smattering of residents in the farming communities showed
up to welcome the police who had already operated unofficially in
much of the area.
	   But in the village of Tubas, the police jeeps were escorted by
scout troops playing drums and onlookers waving red, green, white
and black Palestinian flags.
	   The withdrawal isolated several Jewish settlements and Israeli
troops began reinforcing them. In Ganim, a community of 51
families, many were thinking about leaving.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Ilan Amar, who sells car paint in the
Israeli port city of Haifa.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel in a meeting overnight
to abide by the Wye Memorandum and cease Jewish settlement activity
in the West Bank.
	   Israeli settlers, who oppose the land-for-peace deal with the
Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West Bank hilltops
to prevent them from being handed-over in the future.
	   A statement from the Palestinian Cabinet said ``settlements
would destroy the peace process, stability and security.''
	   Israeli soldiers were slated Saturday night and Sunday to
complete the demarcation of the borders of those areas transferred
to the Palestinian Authority, Israeli media reported.
	   Arafat told reporters in Gaza Saturday that the withdrawal was
``a good beginning in the implementation of what was agreed upon.''
The Palestinian leader sent congratulations on Friday to those
residents now under his authority and asked that they ``raise the
Palestinian flag.''
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 920 square miles (2,382 square kilometers).
Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Apparently as part of a Palestinian crack down on anti-Israeli
extremists, Palestinian police arrested on Saturday Ismail Haniya,
a leader in the Islamic radical group, Hamas, relatives said.
	   Since the signing of the accord, Palestinian police have
arrested hundreds of members of Hamas, which opposes the peace
process and has taken responsibility for several deadly attacks on
Israelis.

Not much progress at nuclear talks with the United States, says

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The seven rounds of nuclear talks
between India and the United States have not much to show in terms
of results, United News of India quoted the Indian defense minister
as saying on Saturday.
	   ``The talks have shown that the United States has an agenda for
India which is not acceptable,'' said George Fernandes in his
speech on ``Defense strategy, then and now,'' in New Delhi. He did
not give details.
	   ``The United States should understand India's security concerns
and reconcile itself to the obvious. India is too big and
potentially a very powerful country to be subjected to a carrot and
stick treatment,'' UNI quoted the defense minister as saying.
	   India has fought three wars against Pakistan and one against
China during the past 50 years over territorial disputes, and its
two neighbours are nuclear weapon states.
	   Fernandes spoke about the lack of progress in the Indo-U.S.
dialogue a day after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and Indian negotiator Jaswant Singh ended their latest round of
talks in Rome aimed at nudging New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
	   The talks began after India tested five nuclear devices in May,
provoking rival tests by Pakistan.
	   A joint statement Friday acknowledged that differences remained
and Talbott and Singh agreed to meet again in New Delhi in January.
	   India wants to be recognized as a nuclear weapons power, a
demand rejected by the United States and other nuclear states. But
New Delhi has accepted the essence of the treaty by offering a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
	   The U.S. wants both India and Pakistan to sign the treaty and
take steps toward ending 50 years of hostility. The test ban treaty
must be signed and ratified by 44 countries before it can go into
effect.

Acquitted war-crimes suspect returns home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered
at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who was
cleared of war crimes charges earlier this week after spending 980
days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
	   Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes
committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian
Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic.
	   Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will
serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp
guards.
	   Delalic held up his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted
by his family and then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers
(31 miles) south of Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him
was planned.
	   ``This is the book of 500 pages in which it says 12 times
Delalic is not guilty,'' he told reporters. ``More important is
that acts commited by some weren't ordered by officers of our
Bosnian Army. These acts were qualified as acts of individuals that
happened on a daily basis,'' he said.
	   Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek
compensation for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who
spent almost three years in confinement.

Kurdish rebel leader freed amid new protests from Turkey

	   ROME (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel leader was freed in Rome Saturday
amid a new barrage of protests from Turkey, which wants him handed
over as a terrorist.
	   Abdullah Ocalan left the hospital where he'd been in custody
since his Nov. 12 arrival in Italy for a private residence on
Saturday morning. He told the thousands of Kurds from throughout
Europe who are in Rome a show of support to return home.
	   ``Go back to your towns and your jobs and continue supporting
the Kurdish cause,'' he said in a statement.
	   Ocalan was freed by a court decision a day earlier that rejected
a Turkish warrant for his arrest because Italian law forbids
extradition to countries where someone faces the death penalty. The
court said Ocalan had to stay in Rome, but that order could be
lifted next month.
	   Turkey, which is trying him in absentia on capital crimes, was
outraged and warned Italy once again against granting Ocalan
political asylum.
	   Italy ``cannot carry this shame. If it does, Turkey will not
leave this unanswered,'' Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz threatened in
Ankara.
	   ``Italy's biggest error would be to open its arms to the
bloodiest terrorist in the world,'' he said.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey that has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet said Saturday that Libya might
offer him refuge if he has to leave Italy.
	   Turkey is applying economic as well as diplomatic pressure on
Italy, its second-largest trading partner. Turkish businesses are
boycotting Italian products and there were reports the government
would cancel the purchase of five Italian Agusta helicopters. The
United States is also pressuring Rome to extradite Ocalan.
	   Italy got some welcome backing Saturday in its standoff with
Turkey.
	   The European Union expressed ``full solidarity with Italy in her
determination to fully implement her laws and treaty obligations''
and in Washington, Human Rights Watch also gave Italy its support.
	   At the same time, both condemned PKK violence and Human Rights
Watch said Ocalan should be ``held accountable for atrocities
committed under his leadership.''
	   Germany, home to 500,000 Kurdish exiles, issued a warrant for
Ocalan in 1990, but said Friday it wouldn't seek his extradition.
On Saturday, the federal prosecutor issued a new warrant, but said
it didn't necessarily change Germany's stance.
	   The new warrant accuses Ocalan of murdering PKK dissidents and a
series of arson attacks in Germany.
	   Anti-Italian sentiment was again running high in Turkey and the
Italian Foreign Ministry on Saturday advised Italians to put off
trips to Turkey as a precaution.
	   Outraged Turks in Ankara laid black wreaths in front of the
Italian Embassy Saturday and honked their horns; graffiti
denouncing the PKK defaced the walls. ``No to terrorism, today and
forever'' read a banner hung across the boulevard in front of the
embassy.
	   In an interview with a Turkish newspaper, Italian Premier
Massimo D'Alema warned Ankara that it risks distancing itself from
the rest of Europe with its harshness toward Italy.
	   Italy had been Turkey's staunch ally in its bid for EU
membership, a bid that has been unsuccessful, partly because
Turkey's human rights record is marred by its treatment of its 12
to 15 million Kurds.

Russian government fails to approve budget draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and EDITS thruout, UPDATES with Shapovalyants
saying government to rely on optimistic scenario. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top government officials tried and failed Saturday
to come to terms on a 1999 budget that is intended to set the
country on the road out of economic crisis.
	   ``More work is needed,'' Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
said after a four-hour meeting of key government ministers.
	   The ministers considered three alternative plans, but ultimately
rejected them all and called for more revisions, including changes
on external debt servicing and tax reform.
	   After the meeting, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met with a
delegation of International Monetary Fund officials to discuss the
country's economic situation, the Interfax news agency said.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov had said earlier that
Russia would ask the IMF for new terms on repaying the dlrs 4.6
billion due to the lending organization next year.
	   New IMF loans to Russia have been on hold since August. The IMF
has insisted it will not release any more money until the
government comes up with a comprehensive plan to combat the
economic crisis and starts implementing it.
	   But government officials said they might not be able to adopt a
budget until they determine whether foreign creditors can be
persuaded to restructure at least a portion of dlrs 17 billion in
debt payments due in 1999.
	   ``Only when we know how much we will have to pay on our external
debts will we be able to set our fiscal policy,'' Shapovalyants
said.
	   The government hopes to complete drafting its 1999 budget by
Dec. 1, but it will require more details on the planned tax reform
for next year, Shapovalyants said.
	   ``We have to finalize volumes of (expected) tax collections and
set new tax brackets,'' he said.
	   The three versions put the disparity between revenues and
spending at either 150 billion rubles (dlrs 9 billion), 280 billion
rubles (dlrs 16 billion), or 360 billion rubles (dlrs 21 billion),
according to one senior government official, who spoke Friday on
the condition of anonymity.
	   Shapovalyants was quoted Saturday as saying the government
intended to use the most optimistic scenario, which also projects a
3 percent drop in productivity and an inflation rate of 30 percent.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. experts inspected arms sites Saturday
as an exchange of letters between Iraq and the United Nations
suggested a new row was brewing over weapons documentation.
	   At least four U.N. cars left the inspectors' Baghdad
headquarters in the morning, but the spokeswoman for the U.N.
Special Commission, Caroline Cross, said only: ``We are carrying on
with our activities.''
	   It was the fourth consecutive day that the inspectors had gone
into the field since they returned Tuesday from Bahrain, where they
were evacuated after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   Iraq's National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for
the UNSCOM teams, says the inspectors visited more than 23 sites in
and around Baghdad from Wednesday through Friday.
	   Meanwhile, it emerged that Iraq appeared to be reluctant to
fulfill UNSCOM's latest request for documents, less than a week
after the United States canceled its planned attack.
	   The United States and Britain had intended to strike to force
Baghdad to reverse its Oct. 31 decision that halted all UNSCOM
work. On Nov. 14, Iraq agreed to allow inspections to resume in a
statement that pledged full cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler promptly wrote to Baghdad asking it
to hand over documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   U.N. officials say that in reply, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister
Riyadh al-Qaisi has said Butler's request ``seems to be provocative
rather than professional.''
	   In Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, said the United States believed Iraq was obliged to hand
over the documents and would back Butler in his request.
	   ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions
is negative, we obviously are prepared to act,'' Berger said.
	   Among other documents, Butler is said to be seeking an Iraqi air
force diary that details munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   The inspectors are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must complete
before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sweeping sanctions
imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
most trade _ have crippled Iraq's once-rich economy.

Poster depicting Mandela as Rastafarian displeases officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Joh 101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A music production company
called Trippy Grape has superimposed President Nelson Mandela's
face on the body of a dope-using Rastafarian in an advertising
poster, raising protest from Mandela's lawyer, a local newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Mandela's lawyer, Fink Haysom, says the poster could violate a
South African law that prohibits the image of the head of state to
be used in an advertisement without official permission, reported
the Saturday Star in Johannesburg.
	   Mandela's face is on the body of a long-haired figure that is
rolling a marijuana cigarette in one hand and reaching into his
pocket with the other.
	   Earlier this month, a Mandela aide said the use of Mandela's
picture in an advertising campaign for Hilton hotels would also be
investigated.
	   Since his release in 1990 after 27 years in prison under the
apartheid regime, Mandela has gained world stature and popularity
for his role in the anti-apartheid struggle.

West Indies on way to huge lead

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with stumps &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies ground their
way to a lead of 361 runs in their second innings against Free
State at Springbok Park at the end of the second day of their
four-day match against the local side.
	   This is the final warm up match for the tourists before the
first of five test matches against South Africa starts in
Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   After Nixon McLean set it up for them with an astonishing
seven-wicket haul in Free State's first innings, two batsmen who
need the practice stayed at the wicket until the close of play to
set up the victory charge that could come some time after lunch
tomorrow.
	   Philo Wallace, the big-hitting opening bat, needed a decent
score for his confidence, but he was denied by what looked to be a
cruel leg before wicket decision to Johan van der Wath. The young
Free Stater struck with his very next delivery an over later to
remove Brian Lara with a peach of a delivery, but that was to be
the last of Free State's luck for the day.
	   Clayton Lambert (41) and Stuart Williams (32) _ the same two who
were at the crease at the end of the first day _ were there again
at stumps today.

Villa, Manchester United, Arsenal all lose; Fowler hat trick
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's top three clubs _ Aston Villa,
Manchester United and Arsenal _ all lost Saturday.
	   In Scotland, there was another surprise stumble as home-standing
Celtic battered Rangers 5-1, Celtic's biggest win over its biggest
rival in 33 years.
	   Aston Villa fell 4-2 at home against Liverpool as Robbie Fowler
scored a hat trick for the struggling Reds. It was the first
victory for manager Gerard Houllier, who took over sole control of
the team earlier this month from Roy Evans.
	   The loss was Villa's first in 13 games this season and
overshadowed two more goals by Dion Dublin.
	   Dublin, a 5.75-million pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from
Coventry, has seven goals in just three games for the league
leaders and should have had an eighth when he was stopped by
Liverpool goalkeeper David James on a late penalty.
	   With all three top clubs losing, Villa remained in the lead with
28 points followed by Manchester United (25) and Arsenal (24).
	   Chelsea, with a 4-2 win at Leicester _ the Blues are now
unbeaten in 18 this season _ moved into fourth with 23 points
followed by Leeds (23), Middlesbrough (22) and West Ham (20).
	   Sheffield Wednesday beat Manchester United 3-1 with two goals by
Niclas Alexandersson.
	   Wimbledon got a 1-0 victory over Arsenal, its first home win
against the Gunners in six years.
	   It was a horrible game for Arsenal as Dennis Bergkamp (calf) and
Patrick Vieira (hamstring) both went off injured in the first half.
Coach Arsene Wenger said Vieira would be out for Wednesday's
crucial Champions League match against French side Lens. He termed
Bergkamp ``50-50.''
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Blackburn 0, Southampton
2; Leeds 4, Charlton 1; Middlesbrough 2, Coventry 0; Tottenham 2,
Nottingham Forest 0.
	   Southampon's win moved the Saints off the bottom and dropped
Blackburn _ Premier League champions in 1995 _ into that dubious
spot of 20th in the 20-team league.
	   In Scotland, Celtic battered bitter rivals Rangers 5-1 as
Lubomir Moravcik and Henrik Larsson each scored twice. Mark
Burchill had the other for Celtic and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst got
Rangers' only goal.
	   Despite the loss, Rangers remained on top in Scotland with 30
points to 25 for Kilmarnock followed by Celtic (23) and St.
Johnston (23). In other Scotland Premier League games: Aberdeen 0,
St. Johnstone 1; Hearts 2, Dunfermline 1; Kilmarnock 0, Motherwell
0.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland lost its first match of
the season in 25, falling 3-2 at Barnsley. Sunderland stayed on top
with 40 points followed by Watford (35) and Ipswich (35).

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian riot police armed with
shields and truncheons chased away a crowd of anti-government
protesters in the capital city Saturday as water cannons mounted
atop a truck drenched the demonstrators.
	   Several of the protesters were arrested, eyewitnesses said.
Among them was Tian Chua, the leader of a new anti-government
coalition of opposition parties and pro-reform groups formed in the
wake of the arrest of Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime
minister who is challenging Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Hundreds of policemen wearing helmets moved into a central Kuala
Lumpur neighborhood after a group of demonstrators shouting
``Mahathir Resign'' refused to heed warnings to disperse.
	   The crowds gathered after the day's final prayers at a city
mosque and began to chant ``Reformasi, Reformasi,'' meaning reform,
to the tune of the popular folk song ``Clementine.''
	   They began to loudly demand Mahathir's resignation and waved
portraits of Anwar, who is in jail facing trial on charges of abuse
of office and illegal sex acts. He denies the charges and calls
them politically motivated.
	    &UR; Police quickly ... PICKUP 6th graf pvs.

<SLUG> Doctor: Ronaldo can face Real, doesn't use pharmaceuticals </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo will be able to play in
Internazionale of Milan's crucial Champions League match against
defending titlist Real Madrid, the Italian club's doctor said
Saturday.
	   The Brazilian striker has fought tendon problems in both knees
this season and played sparingly. Inter doctor Piero Volpi
definitively ruled Ronaldo out of Sunday's clash at Serie A leader
Fiorentina, but said the two-time FIFA Player of the Year will be
ready to go by Wednesday.
	   ``Ronaldo can play against Real, though I don't think he can
play 90 minutes,'' Volpi said. ``The left knee, bruised during the
(Nov. 8) Milan derby, is almost all healed.''
	   In light of the months-long investigations into and allegations
about the role of medicines and performance-enhancing substances in
Italian soccer, Volpi noted that Ronaldo has been relying only on
physical therapy as he battles back into playing condition.
	   ``Ronaldo is working and recuperating from his injuries without
the help of any pharmaceuticals,'' Volpi said.
	   Meanwhile, Inter coach Luigi Simoni said he will count on
veteran Roberto Baggio to carry the offensive load against
Fiorentina.
	   ``Baggio is finally fine,'' Simoni said Saturday, ``even if he
might still not have 90 minutes in his legs. I hope his play will
be a determining factor for Inter at Florence.''
	   Like Ronaldo, Baggio has had knee tendinitis and the 31-year-old
has yet to score for Inter in league play.

Opposition wins Senate elections

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with preliminary reults; ADDS quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN SLIVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A four-party center-right
coalition surprisingly won the Czech Senate elections Saturday, and
another opposition party finished second. The results are a blow to
the governing Social Democrats.
	   Candidates for the ad hoc coalition, led by the Christian
Democrats and the Freedom Union, won in 13 out of 27 districts in
two days of run-off voting.
	   They were followed by the conservative Civic Democratic Party of
ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus with 9 seats.
	   The ruling Social Democrats came third with three mandates,
followed by the Communists who won two seats, according to
preliminary results announced by the Central Election Committee.
	   ``Our goal was to prove there is an alternative to the Social
Democrats and the Civic Democratic Party,'' said Jan Kasal,
vice-chairman of the Christian Democrats.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were seats of 27 members whose
terms had expired. Candidates had to get a 50 percent majority to
win the election outright or face a run-off between the two top
finishers.
	   None of the candidates gained more than 50 percent in the
first-round vote, meaning that run-off elections were necessary in
all 27 districts.
	   Turnout was estimated at slightly over 20 percent, the lowest
number of voters ever taking part in any Czech election. Election
fatigue after a relatively recent national election could have
contributed to the lack of voter enthusiasm.
	   After the vote, the four-party coalition controlls a total of 28
seats in the Senate, followed by the Civic Democratic Party with 26
mandates and the Social Democrats with 23 seats.
	   ``We didn't succeed,'' said Zdenek Skromach, vice-chairman of
the Social Democrats.
	   The Senate vote was considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats, led by Zeman.
	   His Cabinet survived in Parliament thanks to a stability pact
struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   The two parties have a three-fifth majority in the lower house
of Parliament and have also retained their three-fifth majority in
the Senate.
	   This means they could theoretically change the constitution to
reinforce the role of strong parties, a move feared by smaller
political groupings, including the Christian Democrats and the
Freedom Union.
	   The Senate is by far the lesser important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.
	   It was primarily created as a safety mechanism to ensure the
country could function in case of a constitutional crisis. It can
pass laws, except laws on budget and constitution, should the
200-seat lower house be dissolved.

	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ With Wembley Stadium as the venue,
London on Saturday launched its bid for the 2003 athletics World
Championships, just two days after Edmonton, Canada, landed the
2001 worlds.
	   Seventy-five-year-old Wembley, host to the 1948 Olympics and
1966 World Cup, is to be revamped next year as the centerpiece of
England's bid to land the 2006 World Cup.
	   With the worlds going to North America for the first time, it
makes it more likely a European city will be named.
	   ``Staging the championships at Wembley would be a fantastic
boost for British athletics,'' said David Hemery, newly elected
president of Athletics UK who presented the bid Saturday of IAAF
president Primo Nebiolo.
	   ``I am delighted to have this launch as one of my first roles as
president of Athletics UK,'' he added. ``I believe that it will be
an integral part of our future to play host to major events.''
	   David Moorcroft, CEO of Athletics UK, suggested the Canadian
victory would bode well for London.
	   ``It may be good news for us,'' he said. ``We would hope that
the world championships would come to Europe in 2003.''
	   Paris and Stanford, California, hich both lost out to Edmonton,
are also viewed as possible bidders. The winner is expected to be
named next May by the IAAF at a meeting in Seville, Spain.
	   Seville hosts next year's worlds Aug. 20-29.

Thousands turn out in memory of former Nice mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Several thousand mourners filled the streets
of Nice Saturday to pay tribute to Jacques Medecin, who governed
this Mediterranean city for 24 years.
	   ``He deserved this homage from the people of Nice,'' said
Charles Hermann, a centrist member of parliament from Nice, as he
left the funeral service at the Cathedral Sainte-Reparate.
	   Shopkeepers lowered their shades in central Nice and several
main roads were closed to traffic during the procession.
	   Medecin died last Tuesday of a heart attack in Uruguay, where he
had lived since 1996. He was 70.
	   One of the French Riviera's most outspoken politicians, Medecin
held the mayor's post from 1966 until 1990, when he slipped off to
Uruguay ahead of pursuing French authorities.
	   He was extradited to France in 1994 and sentenced to 3 1/2 years
in prison for accepting four million francs (dlrs 714,000) in
bribes from a traffic signal company in exchange for municipal
contracts. He also was convicted of embezzling nearly 15 million
francs (dlrs 2.7 million) from the Nice Opera during the 1980s.
	   An appeals court later upheld his corruption conviction but
reduced his sentence, allowing him to go free after serving two
years in jail.
	   Medecin maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal, saying
he was a scapegoat for the government of late President Francois
Mitterrand. The former mayor claimed Mitterrand, a socialist,
resented his lengthy run as head of a right-wing administration.

Doctor: Ronaldo can face Real, hasn't used pharmaceuticals

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT garbling. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo will be able to play in
Internazionale of Milan's crucial Champions League match against
defending titlist Real Madrid, the Italian club's doctor said
Saturday.
	   The Brazilian striker has fought tendon problems in both knees
this season and played sparingly. Inter doctor Piero Volpi
definitively ruled Ronaldo out of Sunday's clash at Serie A leader
Fiorentina, but said the two-time FIFA Player of the Year will be
ready to go by Wednesday.
	   ``Ronaldo can play against Real, though I don't think he can
play 90 minutes,'' Volpi said. ``The left knee, bruised during the
(Nov. 8) Milan derby, is almost all healed.''
	   In light of the months-long investigations into and allegations
about the role of medicines and performance-enhancing substances in
Italian soccer, Volpi noted that Ronaldo has been relying only on
physical therapy as he battles back into playing condition.
	   ``Ronaldo is working and recuperating from his injuries without
the help of any pharmaceuticals,'' Volpi said.
	   Meanwhile, Inter coach Luigi Simoni said he will count on
veteran Roberto Baggio to carry the offensive load against
Fiorentina.
	   ``Baggio is finally fine,'' Simoni said Saturday, ``even if he
might still not have 90 minutes in his legs. I hope his play will
be a determining factor for Inter at Florence.''
	   Like Ronaldo, Baggio has had knee tendinitis and the 31-year-old
has yet to score for Inter in league play.

Russian nuclear energy minister arrives in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Russia's atomic energy minister arrived in
Iran on Saturday to check on the building of the country's first
large scale, nuclear power plant.
	   ``Russia will continue cooperation with Iran in peaceful nuclear
facilities,'' Yevgeny Adamov told reporters at Tehran airport.
	   Russia is to install a VVER-1000 light water reactor in the
southern city of Bushehr. The contract is worth dlrs 800, the
Russian news agency Interfax said.
	   The United States and Israel have objected to the 1,000-megawatt
Bushehr plant, saying it could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
But Russia says the reactor can be used only for civilian purposes.
	   Iranian radio criticized the United States and Israel on
Saturday, saying their accusations amounted to ``illegal
intervention.''
	   ``The opposition of America and Israel to peaceful cooperation
between Iran and Russia . . . shows their concern about Islamic
Iran's progress in the scientific, technical and economic fields.
Opposition to such cooperation is a form of illegal intervention,''
the radio said.
	   Iran says the Bushehr plant will be used only to generate power.
It notes that its facilities have been approved by the
International Atomic Energy Agency.

 &UR; Bayern Munich loses as Bundesliga race heats up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Lanky striker Michael Preetz scored in the 68th
minute Saturday as 10 players for Berlin stunned Bayern Munich 1-0
and heated up the Bundesliga title race.
	   Preetz connected for his seventh goal 11 minutes after defender
Dick van Burik was sent off for repeated fouls, turning around a
match controlled until that point by visiting Munich.
	   Braving sub-freezing temperatures, 76,000 spectators at
Olympiastadium saw Berlin deal the first place side just its second
season loss.
	   ``We wasted our chances early and beat ourselves,'' said Munich
coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. ``As paradoxical as it sounds, the red card
was a handicap for us. Berlin came alive after that.''
	   Munich stayed only two points clear in the table of charging
Bayer Leverkusen, which blasted Bochum 5-1. Two weeks ago the
margin was eight, although Munich now has a match in hand.
	   FC Kaiserslautern, another main rival of the Bayern, closed to
four points back by winning its fourth straight match _ all by a
1-0 margin _ against Borussia Dortmund.
	   Kaiserslautern is points even with 1860 Munich, which struggled
to a 0-0 home draw against FC Nuremberg.
	   Leverkusen, which has been blowing out opponents of late, has
shaken off its early season habit of playing the league's most
beautiful soccer, but failing to produce goals.
	   Toying with Bochum, which fell to 10th, Leverkusen passed the
Bayern as the league's most productive offense on scores by Stefan
Beinlich, Boris Zivkovic, Paulo Rink, Jan Heintze and Nico Kovac.
	   Kaiserslautern again played ugly, but baffled another opponent
by emerging with three points at home.
	   Dortmund dominated but then fell victim to Marco Reich's 78th
minute score. His cross flew past several players untouched and
curved into the net.
	   ``It's unbelievable that we let in a goal like that,'' said a
frustrated Dortmund midfielder Stefan Reuter.
	   Since Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza has dropped back to play
libero a banged-up defense hasn't yielded a goal. But
Kaiserslautern's offense has sputtered, although the defending
champions always seem to manufacture the winning goal.
	   ``To start with why we can't do this and that is dumb _ we have
success,'' said Sforza.
	   In other matches, Wolfsburg and Nuremberg drew 1-1, while
Stuttgart and Rostock also played to 1-1. On Friday, Shalke claimed
its first win in two months by beating Duisburg 2-0 and Bremen also
beat Duisburg 2-0.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A center-right coalition won a
surprise victory in Czech Senate elections Saturday, and another
opposition party finished second. The results are a blow to the
governing Social Democrats.
	   Candidates for the four-party coalition, led by the Christian
Democrats and the Freedom Union, won in 13 out of 27 districts in
the two days of run-off voting.
	   They were followed by the conservative Civic Democratic Party of
ex-Premier Vaclav Klaus with nine seats.
	   The ruling Social Democrats came third with three, followed by
the Communists with two, according to official results announced by
the Central Election Committee.
	   ``Our goal was to prove there is an alternative to the Social
Democrats and the Civic Democratic Party,'' said Jan Kasal, vice
chairman of the Christian Democrats.
	   At stake in the 81-member Senate were 27 seats. Candidates had
to get a 50 percent majority to win the election outright or face a
run-off between the two top finishers. None of the candidates
gained more than 50 percent in the first-round vote last weekend,
meaning that run-off elections were necessary in all 27 districts.
	   Turnout was estimated at slightly over 20 percent, the lowest
ever. Election fatigue after a relatively recent national election
could have contributed to the lack of voter enthusiasm.
	   After the vote, the four-party coalition controls 28 seats in
the Senate, followed by the Civic Democratic Party with 26 and the
Social Democrats with 23.
	   ``We didn't succeed,'' said Zdenek Skromach, vice chairman of
the Social Democrats.
	   The Senate vote was considered a test of support for Prime
Minister Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the early general
election in June produced a one-party minority government of Social
Democrats, led by Zeman.
	   His Cabinet survived in Parliament thanks to a stability pact
struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   The two parties have a three-fifth majority in the lower house
of Parliament and a three-fifths majority in the Senate.
	   This means they could theoretically change the constitution to
reinforce the role of strong parties, a move feared by smaller
political groupings, including the Christian Democrats and the
Freedom Union.
	   The Senate is by far the lesser important of the two legislative
bodies in the Czech Republic, confirming or rejecting laws adopted
by the lower chamber.

	   ROME (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel leader was freed in Rome Saturday
amid a new barrage of protests from Turkey, which wants him handed
over as a terrorist.
	   Abdullah Ocalan left the hospital where he'd been in custody
since his Nov. 12 arrival in Italy for a private residence on
Saturday morning. He told the thousands Kurds from throughout
Europe who came to Rome in his support to return home.
	   ``Go back to your towns and your jobs and continue supporting
the Kurdish cause,'' he said in a statement.
	   Obediently, the most visible group, several hundred supporters
who'd camped out for the past week in a Rome piazza, peacefully
packed up and left.

Butyrskaya win womens to beat Bobek; French take pairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Update with women's quotes; more details.
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Russian Maria Butyrskaya rallied from third to beat
American Nicole Bobek to take the women's event at the Lalique
Trophy figure skating competition Saturday.
	   Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis of France won the pairs
program for their major international victory.
	   Bobek wanted to rebound with her first international victory
since 1995 when she won the U.S. title. Since then she has had a
lot of downs, which culminated with a 17th at the Olympic Games.
	   She has since gone back to train with Richard Callaghan, with
whom she won the national crown. Callaghan coached Tara Lipinski to
the Olympic gold medal.
	   ``Definitely I think it is a new start. I think we accomplished
a lot in this competiton and the other competition,'' Bobek said.
	   She showed potential in taking the short program on Friday but
couldn't hold on to the lead in Saturday's free program.
	   Although Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian
did the more difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand
Prix victory of the season. She won also at Skate America.
	   Bobek's music to ``Evita'' was inspiring, her skating was not.
	   Bobek started well with a triple lutz-double toe loop
combination. Then she proceeded to scale down three triple jumps to
doubles in her next four attempts. She ended with just three
triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from her eyes while
waiting for her marks.
	   ``Of course the emotions came out, '' Bobek said.
	   She scored technical marks between 5.0 to 5,4 and only a little
better in the presentation marks.
	   Butyrskaya skated well enough to win. Finishing with only four
triples, she still scored more than two-tenths better than Bobek on
nearly every mark to win easily.
	   Although Butyrskaya, the European champion and third at the
world championships, went down on one triple jump and had to put a
hand down on another, the overall quality and quantity of the jumps
gave her the win.
	   ``I.m happy with the result, the win but I am not happy with the
way I skated. I didn't do the things I can do in practice or last
year at Europeans,'' Butyskaya said. ``But this is my sixth
competition of the year and I am very tired.''
	   Third went to Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena
Liashenko of Ukraine who had mistakes on nearly every jump
including falling twice.
	   Abitbol and Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer
mistakes of the top couples. In the short program there was little
to distinguish them because all skated clean.
	   In the free program to the music of `Acropolis' they were off in
individual jumps but had some unusual lifts to maintain first.
	   Americans Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman moved from fourth to
second with a program to the music from ``Phantom of the Opera.''
They scaled down a few triple moves and only had single axels at
the end of their program.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Zyuganov elected to head leftist, nationalist coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov was
unanimously re-elected chairman of a left-wing and nationalist
coalition Saturday at a meeting featuring an anti-Semitic outburst,
Russian news agencies said.
	   Zyuganov, who ran a strong presidential race against Boris
Yeltsin in 1996 and is expected to run for president again in 2000,
was picked to continue leading the People's Patriotic Union.
	   The coalition adopted several resolutions that appeared aimed at
combating critics who have charged Russian leftists and
nationalists with anti-Semitism in recent weeks for failing to
condemn an anti-Semitic colleague.
	   One resolution urged people of ``all estates, languages and
faiths to come together under the banner of patriotism,'' while
another called for prosecution of officials who encourage genocide,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At the same time, however, Interfax said members of the
coalition applauded a coal miner who quoted the 19th century
novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky as saying that Jews ``will bring about
the death of Russia.''
	   ``This is what they are doing now,'' the miner, Konstantin
Pimenov, added in a speech at the coalition's congress. No other
speakers renounced Pimenov, Interfax said.

South Africans down Scots for 16th win in a row, Australia triumphs
</HEADLINE>
over French &QL;

	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa made it 16 wins in a row with a 35-10
victory over Scotland Saturday and below-strength Australia came
from behind to beat Europe's strongest team, France, 32-21 to
maintain the southern hemisphere's rugby union dominance.
	   The Springboks, who trailed 7-3 early in the game, ran in four
second half tries at Murrayfield through scrum half Joost van der
Westhuizen, winger Pieter Rossouw, center Andre Snyman and back row
forward Bobby Skinstad.
	   South African winger Stefan Terblanche also crossed the home
line and fullback Percy Montgomery kicked two penalties and two
conversions while all the Scottish points came from fly half Duncan
Hodge with a try, conversion and penalty.
	   After going close to defeat last week against Wales, the South
Africans produced a much improved performance against the Scots,
who gave debuts to three players including Kiwi-born center John
Leslie who was joined by his brother, Martin, as a substitute.
Their father, Andy Leslie, was a standout captain for New Zealand.
	   The Scots impressed with their ball-handling and imaginative
play and hardly resembled a team which had lost 10 of its last 11
matches.
	   In bitterly cold conditions at the Stade de France, Australian
captain John Eales kicked four second half penalties after his team
trailed Five Nations champion France 21-20 at half time.
	   The game had five tries in the first half and none in the second
with Eales scoring all the points after the break as both teams
tightened their defenses.
	   The Wallabies scored tries through Daniel Wilson, Thomas Bowman
and Toutai Kefu in the first half but the Australians had to rely
on the boot of second row Eales after the break.
	   Winger Thomas Lombard and half-back Philippe Carbonneau crossed
for first half tries for the French with three penalties from
Christophe Lamaison, including a stunning 50-meter (yard) kick,
giving his team the edge at the interval.
	   On a 13-day European tour which also takes in a game against
England next weekend, the Australians are without several of their
top players, including Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim Horan, Damian
Smith and Dan Crowley.
	   England is in action on Sunday when it meets Italy in a World
Cup qualifying game, even though both teams have already qualified
by beating the weakest team in the group, the Netherlands.
	   Ireland scored a 53-35 victory over Romania Saturday in a World
Cup qualifying game with both teams already through having already
beaten Georgia.
	   Center Jonathan Bell scored two tries, fullback Conor O'Shea,
scrum half Ciaran Scally and back row Anthony Ward also crossed the
Romanian line and New Zealand referee Paul Honiss also awarded the
Irish two penalty tries at Lansdowne Road. Eric Elwood and David
Humphreys both kicked three conversions and a penalty.
	   Romanian fullback Mihai Vioreanu scored two tries while others
came from center Gabriel Brezoianu and wingers Gheorghe Salomie and
Radu Fugigi. Scrum half Petre Mitu kicked two conversions and two
penalties.
	   In another international game later Saturday, Wales hosted
Argentina at Llanelli

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Warning North Korea to forsake nuclear
weapons, U.S. President Bill Clinton showed off American military
power in a visit with troops on watch near the world's most heavily
guarded border.
	   Clinton spoke Saturday of a ``strong suspicion'' that an
underground construction project in the communist North that is
barred from U.S. inspection is nuclear related.
	   Saying the United States has an ``unshakable alliance'' with
Seoul, Clinton urged North Korea to seize ``an historic
opportunity'' for peace extended by South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung in his policy of engagement with his neighbor.
	   Kim said North Korea ``is cautiously but noticeably taking
measures to increase interaction and cooperation.'' But Kim, in
office less than a year, said he and Clinton agreed that ``we will
not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.''
	   The two leaders spoke at a news conference at the Blue House,
Seoul's presidential residence named for its roof of blue ceramic
tiles. Later, they toasted each other at a dinner in a state guest
house.
	   To underscore the U.S. military commitment, Clinton was flying
north of Seoul to a training center bristling with military
hardware, from Apache attack helicopters to M-1 Abrams tanks and
Bradley Fighting Vehicles. He also planned to address American
troops at Osan Air Base from a U-2 spy plane hangar.
	   In his weekly radio address, the president called the Korean
Peninsula ``the last fault line of the Cold War'' where almost
40,000 Americans are helping South Korea defend its freedom.
	   An armistice, not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War,
and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Close to 2
million troops are deployed on both sides of the border.
	   Security worries and Asia's economic collapse were Clinton's top
themes in South Korea, as they were earlier in Japan. He urged
Korea to continue to open its markets, resist protectionism and
prevent unfair trade practices in sensitive sectors like steel and
semiconductors.
	   He also saluted Seoul's struggle to overcome Asia's economic
upheaval. ``I believe Asia will emerge from this present crisis
more prosperous, more stable, more democratic _ thanks in no small
measure to Korea's example.''
	   Clinton managed a bit of relaxation during his visit with a
surprise late-night stop Saturday at a concert featuring his
brother, Roger, and his band. The president listened to songs
off-stage at the Sejong Culture Center until Roger Clinton
introduced his brother as ``a very special person.'' The audience
of 2,000 stood and applauded.
	   On security, new unease was raised by photos from a U.S. spy
satellite that show thousands of North Korean workers digging a
huge hole in a mountainside at Keumjongri, 25 miles (40 kilometers)
northeast of North Korea's main nuclear complex, Yongbyon. North
Korea rebuffed U.S. appeals to inspect it, demanding dlrs 300
million for the privilege. Clinton has rejected that idea.
	   Directing his remarks at North Korea, Clinton noted a new
tourism deal that is taking South Koreans to the North on cruise
ships _ an arrangement touted by Kim as a sign the North may be
opening up to its midcentury enemy. He contrasted the ship
arrangement with the suspected nuclear project.
	   ``Nothing could ever be put into that hole in the ground, given
our defense partnership here, nothing could ever be put in that
hole in the ground that would give the North Koreans as much
advantage, as much power, as much wealth, as much happiness, as
more of those ships going up there full of people from here,''
Clinton said with fervor.
	   Kim urged North Korea to take steps to ``clear the suspicion''
surrounding the underground site. ``We must be firm on these
issues.'' He said that if the project is proven to be nuclear
related, ``We should demand immediate closedown.''
	   Clinton warned that if North Korea continues to rebuff U.S.
inspection, Congress likely would have ``a great reluctance'' to
continue paying for fuel oil and nuclear reactor programs in the
North.
	   ``It would be a sad thing indeed if, for no good end over the
long run, the North Koreans would make it impossible to go
forward,'' he said.
	   Under a 1994 accord, North Korea halted its nuclear weapons
program in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern
nuclear energy sources there. That deal would be shattered if the
suspect site turned out to be a clandestine nuclear project. And
that, in turn, would jeopardize preliminary North-South peace talks
that could produce a treaty to replace the shaky armistice.

	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Bundesliga club Schalke broke
ground on a new stadium Saturday with an enclosable roof that team
manager Rudi Assauer touted as ``Europe's most modern.''
	   Team libero Olaf Thom hammered in the symbolic first post at the
ceremonies for the dlrs 221 million stadium, which will seat 62,000
and is scheduled to be finished in the year 2001.
	   The stadium, almost completely financed by private means, was
also described by German officials at the groundbreaking as an
important step in Germany's fight to host the 2006 World Cup.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, the Palestinians said Saturday that 150 criminals released
by Israel were not the political prisoners who were supposed to be
freed.
	   The Palestinians said they protested to the United States over
``a violation of the accord,'' since Israel released mostly car
thieves and drug dealers Friday, and only 100 of the 250 freed were
prisoners accused in the struggle against Israeli occupation.
	   Palestinian police continued to move into the 9.1 percent of the
West Bank they received a day earlier, but the latest disagreement
threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more Palestinian
prisoners.
	   Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum signed last month, Israel
is to withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West Bank by the
end of January in tandem with Palestinian steps against
anti-Israeli activity.
	   The three-phased pullback will give the Palestinians partial or
total control over 40 percent of the West Bank.
	   By late January, Israel is to have carried out two more
pullbacks under the Wye River agreement, awarding Arafat joint or
sole jurisdiction over 920 square miles (2,382 square kilometers).
Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   ``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S.
President Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi,
a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not
fair and shows bad intentions.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in
response that the peace accord did not stipulate that Israel free
prisoners with Jewish ``blood on their hands.''
	   Apparently as part of a Palestinian crackdown, on Saturday
Palestinian police arrested Ismail Haniya, a leader in the Islamic
radical group Hamas, relatives said. Since the signing the accord,
Palestinian police have arrested hundreds of members of Hamas,
which opposes the peace process and has taken responsibility for
several deadly attacks on Israelis.
	   In completing the land transfer Saturday, Palestinian police
entered seven of the 36 villages that lie between the cities of
Jenin and Nablus.
	   Only a smattering of residents in the farming communities showed
up to welcome the police, who had already been operating
unofficially in much of the area.
	   But in the village of Tubas, the police jeeps were escorted by
scout troops playing drums and onlookers waving red, green, white
and black Palestinian flags.
	   The withdrawal isolated several Jewish settlements and Israeli
troops began reinforcing them. In Ganim, a community of 51
families, many were thinking about leaving.
	   ``If this place turns into an armed camp, it's not the way we
wanted to live,'' said Ilan Amar, who sells car paint in the
Israeli port city of Haifa.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet called on Israel to abide by the Wye
Memorandum and cease Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank.
	   ``Settlements would destroy the peace process, stability and
security,'' the Cabinet said in a statement.
	   Israeli settlers, who oppose the land-for-peace deal with the
Palestinians, have been trying to take as many West Bank hilltops
as possible to keep them from being handed over in the future.
	   Israeli soldiers were slated to complete the demarcation of the
borders of transferred areas Saturday night and Sunday, Israeli
media reported.
	   Arafat said in Gaza on Saturday that the withdrawal was ``a good
beginning in the implementation of what was agreed upon.'' The
Palestinian leader sent congratulations on Friday to those
residents now under his authority and asked that they ``raise the
Palestinian flag.''

	   Details of Premier League games:
 &UR; Aston Villa 2, Liverpool 4 (0-2) &QC; 
	   Paul Ince scored in the 2nd minute and Robbie Fowler got the
second five minutes later, the kind of start Liverpool needed to
break a three-game league losing string. It was also only the Reds'
second win in 10 games. Dion Dublin made it 2-1 in the 47th on a
10-meter (yard) shot. Fowler got his second in the 58th and his
third in the 66th. Dublin picked up No. 2 in the 63rd and should
have a third when he was stopped by David James on a late penalty.
Aston Villa played with 10 men in the final 22 minutes after Stan
Collymore was sent off on his second yellow card for a tackle on
Michael Owen. Villa was trying to be the first team to go
undefeated in 13 season-opening matches since the Premier League
began in 1992.
 &UR; Blackburn 0, Southampton 2 (0-1) &QC; 
	   This loss cost Roy Hodgson his job. The Blackburn manager _
formerly Swiss national and Inter Milan manager _ stepped down
after the loss, which left Blackburn in last place. The club won
the Premier League title in 1995. Matt Oakley scored for
Southampton in the 4th and Steve Bashmam in the 89th to move
Southampton off the bottom.
 &UR; Leeds 4, Charlton 1 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Leeds keeps rolling under new manager David O'Leary _ moved up
when George Graham left a few weeks ago. Leeds got goals from four
different players: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (34), Lee Bowyer (51),
Alan Smith (67) and Harry Kewell (87). Charlton's only strike came
from Paul Mortimer in the 65th.
 &UR; Leicester 2, Chelsea 4 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Chelsea continues to play England's best soccer. The Blues are
now unbeaten in 18 matches _ the last loss was opening day. They've
moved into fourth place with 23 points and, having played only 12
games, have a game in hand on leaders Aston Villa _ and two games
in hand on Arsenal. Italian Gianfranco Zola scored twice (28th and
90th) with help from Uruguay's Gustavo Poyet (39) and Norway's Tore
Andre Flo (56). Muzzy Izzet (40) and Steve Guppy (60) scored for
Leicester.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 2, Coventry 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Middlesbrough extended its streak of league matches unbeaten at
home to 26. Dean Gordon made it 1-0 on a 35-yard (meter) shot in
the 66th and Hamilton Ricard of Colombia got his 9th league goal in
the 83rd.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 3, Manchester United 1 (1-1) &QC; 
	   Sweden's Niclas Alexandersson scored twice (14th and 73rd) as
Manchester United suffered a pre-European upset. The club plays in
Barcelona Wednesday in a key Champions League match. United has won
only once in its last nine matches at Hillsborough. After the
Swede's opening goal, Andy Cole equalized in the 29th, but Wim Jonk
made it 2-1 after 55 minutes, setting the stage for Alexandersson's
second.
 &UR; Tottenham 2, Nottingham Forest 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Tottenham continues to improve slowly under George Graham. But
it was more misery for Forest, which is winless in 11 matches.
Steve Stone was sent off on his second yellow card in the 46th,
allowing Tottenham to take over with goals in the 59th by Chris
Armstrong and Allan Nielsen in the 69th.
 &UR; Wimbledon 1, Arsenal 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   This is a day Arsenal would like to forget. Nigerian
international Efan Ekoku came in as a substitute and scored
Wimbledon's decider in the 77th. The loss was only Arsenal's second
in the league this season. It was a costly game. Patrick Vieira
picked up a hamstring injury and will be lost for Wednesday's
Champions League game. Dennis Bergkamp suffered a calf injury and
is 50-50.
	   On Sunday, West Ham played at Derby and Everton was set for a
Monday match at Newcastle.

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Urska Hrovat of Slovenia was more than a
second than the rest of the field and lef after Saturday's first
run of a women's World Cup slalom.
	   While most others had trouble on the steep, icy top of the
Clementine course, Hrovat was as at ease as if on a recreational
ski. She was .80 seconds ahead after the first 30 gates and
extended it to finish in 49.67 seconds.
	   Olympic bronze medalist Zali Steggall of Australia, whose only
World Cup victory came on this hill last November, was a distant
1.10 seconds back and, at 50.77, was the only other racer to break
51 seconds.
	   Hrovat's teammate, Alenka Dovzan, skied out of the second seed
to claim a share of third with Norway's Trine Bakke at 51.03.
	   Sabine Egger of Austria rounded out the top five in 51.15.
Kristina Koznick the United States shared sixth place with Italy's
Deborah Compagnni at 51.26.
	   Germany's Martina Ertl was eighth in 51.28, followed by the
young and old of the Swedish team. Pernilla Wiberg, the 28-year-old
who won the World Cup overall title in 1997, was ninth in 51.30, a
mere .08 better than 17-year-old circuit rookie Anja Paerson.
	   Defending World Cup slalom champion Ylva Nowen of Sweden was
15th, 2 seconds behind Hrovat.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of illegal immigrants took to the streets
Saturday in cities across France, asking that the French government
give them residency status.
	   About 3,000 protested in Paris, according to police estimates,
and hundreds more gathered in Orleans, Marseille, Bordeaux, Lille
and Avignon. Anti-racism groups, labor union leaders and
politicians from the Greens and the Communist parties joined the
marches.
	   In Paris, illegal immigrants marched on the capital's left bank
throughout the afternoon. The protesters carried banners denouncing
the immigration policies of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and beat drums as they wound their way toward Jospin's Matignon
palace.
	   The protests were seen as a test of a movement that began in
1996 with a two-month-long occupation of a Paris church by 300
African illegal immigrants.
	   About 300 people gathered in both Bordeaux and Marseille
Saturday, while 200 protested in Avignon.
	   Several hundred marched in Orleans, where 22 illegal immigrants
have staged a hunger strike in the town's cathedral for the past 28
days.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors paid an unannounced visit
to a suspected weapons site on Saturday, the first such visit since
Iraq blocked their work completely on Oct. 31.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that a missile team ``made a
surprise visit to an establishment to check the monthly declaration
of its output.''
	   The agency did not identify the site, but the report suggested
the facility was a previously identified, potential weapons site.
	   ``The Iraqi side has provided all necessary assistance,'' the
agency said, quoting Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, head of the
National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for the U.N.
inspectors.
	   The U.N. Special Commission or UNSCOM has refused to talk to
reporters about its inspections since it resumed work Wednesday.
The inspectors returned the previous day from Bahrain, where they
were evacuated after the United States threatened missile strikes.
	   But surprise inspections have always been the most contentious
issue between UNSCOM and Iraq. On Aug. 5, Iraq refused to provide
escorts for such missions, but allowed U.N. inspectors to go to
previously declared sites to continue monitoring work. On Oct. 31,
Iraq halted all UNSCOM visits.
	   The National Monitoring Authority said teams from the U.N.
Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency
visited a number of sites on Saturday to check equipment. These
visits were presumed to concern cameras and sensors installed to
monitor activity.
	   Amin also said an American U-2 plane ``violated Iraqi skies many
times on Saturday,'' the agency reported.
	   The U-2 jets are used for aerial surveillance by the U.N.
inspectors.
	   Meanwhile, it emerged that Iraq appeared to be reluctant to
fulfill UNSCOM's latest request for documents, less than a week
after the United States canceled its planned attack.
	   The United States and Britain had intended to strike to force
Baghdad to reverse its Oct. 31 decision. On Nov. 14, Iraq agreed to
allow inspections to resume in a statement that pledged full
cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler promptly wrote to Baghdad asking it
to hand over documents related to Iraq's chemical and biological
programs.
	   U.N. officials say that in reply, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister
Riyadh al-Qaisi has said Butler's request ``seems to be provocative
rather than professional.''
	   In Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, said the United States believed Iraq was obliged to hand
over the documents and would back Butler in his request.
	   ``If we reach the conclusion that the answer to those questions
is negative, we obviously are prepared to act,'' Berger said.
	   Among other documents, Butler is said to be seeking an Iraqi air
force diary that details munitions destroyed during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
	   The inspectors are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must complete
before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sweeping sanctions
imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
most trade _ have crippled Iraq's once-rich economy.

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Roy Hodgson stepped down Saturday as
manager at Blackburn Rovers just minutes after a 2-0 home loss to
Southampton dropped the club into last place in the Premier League.
	   The departure of Hodgson, who agreed to take over the team
midway through 1997 _ when he was still at Inter Milan _ is the
fifth management shakeup in the league this season after managerial
changes at Tottenham, Leeds, Newcastle and Liverpool.
	   Club chief executive John Williams read a brief statement to
announce the move.
	   ``Following the run of recent poor results, Jack Walker and Roy
Hodgson have agreed that Roy will be leaving the club. The club are
disappointed at this outcome but feel the decision is inevitable
and in the best interests of Blackburn Rovers.''
	   Rovers, Premier League champions in 1995 under Kenny Dalglish,
have won only two league games this season _ the last on Oct. 3.
	   Hodgson, the former manager of the Swiss national team, had
recently been mentioned as a possible successor to England manager
Glenn Hoddle.
	   Speculation immediately turned to Dalglish to replace Hodgson.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered
Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most
prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing
was widely considered to be politically motivated.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control
over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who
was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her
apartment. An aide was also shot and critically wounded.
	   The shooting occurred in a building along St. Petersburg's
atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another notorious Russian
crime _ the murder that was the central event in Fyodor
Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and Punishment.''
	   Like that fictional crime, which shone a light on social ferment
in the St. Petersburg of its day, the death of Starovoitova was
immediately seized upon as a seminal event in the Russia of the
late 1990s.
	   ``It is one of the black pages in our modern history,'' Vladimir
Putin, director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) told the
Interfax news agency. ``It doesn't do much to improve our
reputation, the reputation of the country as a whole.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy in the lower house of
parliament who inspired strong feelings from both her friends and
enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party,
she was planning to run for president in 2000.
	   Those close to her speculated about who might have wanted her
dead, with some naming various prominent politicians as potential
culprits.
	   ``Whose path did she cross? The answer is simple: communists and
gangsters,'' said former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais.
``These are the two kinds of people in whose way she was
standing.''
	   Putin, whose agency is in charge of the investigation, cautioned
that there was still no evidence that her death was a political
assassination.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin did not speculate about the
motive for the crime, but told reporters that it was being
investigated under a criminal code section that covers terrorism.
	   Arriving at the St. Petersburg airport from Moscow, he said: ``I
brought with me a team of experienced investigators. I think we
will clear it up soon.''
	   Yeltsin sent a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the
``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and
severely punished,''
	   The president also sent a telegram to Starovoitova's family, in
which he called her ``one of the most vivid figures in Russian
politics,'' who ``consistently upheld the lofty ideals of freedom
and democracy.''
	   More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square
to remember Starovoitova. People hugged quietly as they listened to
speeches by her fellow politicians and friends.
	   The small stage was adorned with red roses, yellow carnations
and photographs of the deputy with various people, including the
late Russian physicist and dissident, Andrei Sakharov.
	   ``We are united today by pain, which is bigger than politics,''
said Viktor Krivulin, a poet and candidate for the regional
legislature. ``Politics, as I felt during the past night, has
become the art of spitting on the soul.''
	   Others at the gathering said they were sure that Starovoitova
was killed by those who disliked her outspoken views.
	   ``She had too many enemies,'' said Galina Markelova, an aide to
the lawmaker. She said Starovoitova had received many threats in
the past.
	   ``It was doubtless a political murder,'' added Vitaly Milonov,
the chairman of the Young Christian Democrats.
	   Police said two men followed Starovoitova and her aide, Ruslan
Linkov, 27, and shot them on the stairs of her building Friday
evening. Linkov was shot twice. He remained in critical condition
in intensive care afer a five-hour operation at the Military
Medical Academy, and had not regained consciousness since the
shooting.
	   A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at
the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in the settlement of
Gorelovo, near St. Petersburg.

German atomic power plant said to be contaminating region with
</HEADLINE>
plutonium leak &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BREMEN, Germany (AP) _ Measurements at an atomic power plant
near Kruemmel just southeast of Hamburg in northern Germany have
shown leaks of decaying plutonium, according to a report released
Saturday by the Elmarsch Citizens Initiative against Leukemia.
	   The group said measurements were carried out by the medical
physics department of Bremen University which showed that americium
241 - one of the transuranic elements produced by the decay of an
isotope of plutonium - had contaminated the entire Elmarsch - a
wetland region on the Elbe river.
	   Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, who was attending a Greens
party meeting in Lower Saxony state said the plant's operating
permit did not permit the leakage of any contamination and that he
would push to get ``consequent measures'' taken.
	   ``Suspicion that an atomic plant leaks plutonium and is
therefore responsible for 10 cases of leukemia and two deaths is
not a trifle,'' Trittin said.
	   As Germany's new Environment Minister, Trittin announced as soon
as he took office with the new center-left coalition last month
that he wanted to shut down ``as many as possible'' atomic power
plants ``as soon as possible.''
	   The Kruemmel atomic power plant in question has had troubles in
the past including alleged acts of sabotage and leaky waste
transporters. It is currently shut down for maintenance work.
	   According to the head of the Bremen University group that took
the measurements, Inge Schmitz-Feuerhake, the above normal level of
americium 241 found could not have been emitted by normal operation
of the plant. She said that the contamination was found in seven of
12 measurements on dust samples at homes in the region.
	   She rejected the possibility that the contamination could have
come from the meltdown of a reactor at the Chernobyl atomic power
plant in the Ukraine in 1986 or from earlier nuclear weapons tests
carried out by the United States, the former Soviet Union and
others over the years.
	   The Elmarsch Citizens Initiative again Leukemia said they
arranged to have the tests carried out because it became known at
the end of 1997 that the Kruemmel plant for years had problems with
contaminated water that was caught by security tanks at the plant.
	   Technical inspectors said that those leaks led to higher
emission of so-called alpha- and beta rays, an indication that
cases of leukemia in the region were caused by the plant.
	   Johannes Altmeppen, spokesman for the Hamburg Electricity Works,
which operates the plant, said the company would closely examine
the results of the tests. He said previous studies done by
Schmitz-Feuerhake's team on Kruemmel were proven inaccurate.

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ Nixon McLean's haul of seven
wickets for 28 runs strangled Free State's first innings and the
West Indies ran up a 361-run lead before stumps were drawn
Saturday, the second day of their four-day tour match.
	   McLean led the West Indies to restrict the provincial side,
which includes South African captain Hansie Cronje, to 67 after the
tourists resumed their first innings at 193 for four and piled up a
total of 316 all out.
	   After bowling out the South Africans, the West Indies added 112
for two in their second innings.
	   This is the final warm up match for the tourists before the
first of five test matches against South Africa starts in
Johannesburg on Thursday.
	   McLean's bowling prowess in his 10 overs included two wickets
for ducks and Cronje's for only three.
	   It took only 112 minutes between lunch and tea for McLean,
Curtly Ambrose (1 for 12) and Dinanath Ramnarine (2 for 19) to wipe
out Free State.
	   West Indies captain Brian Lara did not enforce the follow-on,
giving his team more batting practice.
	   It didn't work out for Lara personally, who was bowled by Johan
van der Wath for a duck.
	   One ball earlier, Van der Wath also claimed opener Philo Wallace
for 28 on a somewhat controversial leg before wicket decision.
	   That left Clayton Lambert (41) and Stuart Williams (32) to carry
the West Indies into their second innings.
	   Earlier, Carl Hooper achieved his third successive half-century
and McLean hit 46 to begin the resumption of the West Indies first
innings.
	   Resuming on 35, Hooper, who had an unbeaten 60 against the
Gauteng Invitation X1 and 109 against Griqualand West, reached his
50 off just 65 deliveries before Van der Wath forced him into a
shot that Louis Wilkinson cauth at slip.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors paid an unannounced visit
to a suspected Iraqi weapons site on Saturday, the first such visit
since Baghdad blocked their work completely three weeks ago.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said that a missile team ``made a
surprise visit to an establishment to check the monthly declaration
of its output.''
	   The agency did not identify the site, but the report suggested
that it was a previously identified potential weapons site.
	   ``The Iraqi side has provided all necessary assistance,'' the
agency said, quoting Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, head of the
National Monitoring Authority, which provides escorts for the U.N.
inspectors.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, has refused to talk to
reporters about its inspections since it resumed work Wednesday.
	   Iraq halted all UNSCOM visits on Oct. 31, then on Nov. 14
promised full cooperation in the face of threats of a military
strike by the United States and Britain. Surprise inspections have
always been the most contentious issue for Iraq, which has long
complained that the inspections violate its sovereignty.
	   The inspectors are charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must complete
before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sweeping sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an invasion that
triggered the Gulf War.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel, limit the sale of oil and
most trade _ have crippled Iraq's oil-rich economy.
	   The National Monitoring Authority said teams from the U.N.

	   The inspectors use the U-2 jets for aerial surveillance.
	   Meanwhile, in Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said the United States believed Iraq was obliged to
hand over documents requested by UNSCOM chief Richard Butler.
	   After Iraq promised to cooperate, Butler asked for a number of
documents related to its chemical and biological programs.
	   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said Friday
that many of the documents were destroyed, never existed or had
already been turned over. He placed conditions on viewing a
particularly contentious Iraqi air force document.

	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Roy Hodgson stepped down Saturday as

Southampton dropped the club into last place in the Premier League.
	   The departure of Hodgson, who agreed to take over the team
midway through 1997 _ when he was still at Inter Milan _ is the

changes at Tottenham, Leeds, Newcastle and Liverpool.
	   Hodgson, 51, spent freely in the off-season including 7.5
million pounds (dlrs 12.4 million) for Kevin Davies, who has been
disappointing so far.
	   Southampton's win _ its first in a league match at Ewood Park in
47 years _ was the final straw as Blackburn chief executive John
Williams announced the move in a brief statement.
	   ``Following the run of recent poor results, Jack Walker and Roy
Hodgson have agreed that Roy will be leaving the club. The club are

	   Rovers, Premier League champions in 1995 under Kenny Dalglish,

 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on proposal to end Marseille strike, EDITS
throughout

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two days ahead of a Europe-wide rail strike, train
traffic remained disrupted in parts of southern France Saturday as
workers extended their walkout for a twelfth day.
	   The workers were set to vote late Saturday on a proposal that
would allow them to return to work. However, an end to that walkout
would offer only temporary relief to travelers.
	   French train conductors' unions have called a nation-wide strike
for next Friday, saying they lack sufficient staff.
	   Rail traffic across France is often disrupted by walkouts. In
late 1995, train workers brought France to a near standstill over a
government plan to reduce benefits.
	   Adding to travelers' woes, train traffic across France was set
to slow Sunday evening before coming to a standstill Monday, as
railway workers in six European countries protest liberalization
plans.
	   Traffic is expected to come to a halt in France, Spain, Belgium,
Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions will hand out leaflets to
commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands in a bid
to stop plans to further privatize the sector.
	   In the region surrounding Marseille, in southern France, only
one of five local lines was running Saturday. Two out of three
trains were operating on long-distance and high-speed routes.
	   Rail workers there want the national rail company to hire 30
more train conductors by the end of the year. The proposal under
consideration would provide 23 new employees.

Belgrade court fines another independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Acting on charges brought by
Serbia's ultranationalist deputy premier, a Belgrade district court
fined Saturday an independent daily the equivalent of dlrs 38,000
dlrs, Beta news agency reported.
	   Serbian deputy premier and leader of extremist Radical Party,
Vojislav Seselj, initiated the lawsuit Friday, accusing the
newspaper Glas Javnosti of violating his personal rights by
publishing an ``untrue'' statement about him, coming from a local
judge.
	   The court ruled the publisher, chief editor and company manager
of the newspaper _ one of the few remaining independents _ were
guilty of violating Serbia's new media law.
	   In a crackdown against press freedoms, Serbian authorities
passed a new restrictive media law last month, demanding strictly
``patriotic'' coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The law imposed hefty fines on publishers of articles that
authorities deem anti-state. It was followed by a string of
lawsuits, property confiscations and shutdowns of independent
papers.
	   In an interview published this week in Glas Javnosti, a judge
from Serbia's troubled Kosovo province and the brother of a
recently sacked Seselj associate, had accused the deputy premier of
working ``against interests of Serb people'' and called him a
``dictator.''
	   The paper's chief editor Manojlo Vukotic said Saturday he would
appeal the verdict and refused to pay, believing his paper had made
no professional mistake.
	   ``All we did was print a quote and I don't think carrying
someone's quote violates our profession,'' Vukotic concluded.
	   Three Belgrade independent dailies were briefly banned in
connection with the crackdown and two leading papers and a weekly
were slapped with draconian fines for criticizing the regime of
Yugoslavia's autocratic president Slobodan Milosevic.

Head of Saudi consultative council in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The head of a top Saudi council arrived in
Iran on Saturday in a further sign of improved relations between
the two nations.
	   Sheik Mohammed bin Jubeir heads the 90-member consultative
council, or Majlis al-Shura, which is the closest thing Saudi
Arabia has to a parliament.
	   He was met at Tehran airport by his host, the speaker of Iran's
parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
	   During his five-day trip, bin Jubeir will hold talks with
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and former president Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who now heads a powerful advisory council, the official
Iranian news agency reported.
	   King Fahd set up the Majlis al-Shura in 1993. It does not have
legislative powers. Its appointed members make recommendations to
the king.
	   Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran, owing to
Tehran's stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The
kingdom, a Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from
Iran, a Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   But relations began to improve after President Khatami, a
political moderate, took office last year. The ties received a
boost in February when Rafsanjani visited the kingdom.
	   In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement on
trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological
cooperation.

Ireland faces `golden age,' Ahern tells party faithful
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland is enjoying a golden age of peace
and prosperity, but still expects generosity from European Union
coffers, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern told his Fianna Fail party
faithful on Saturday.
	   ``We face into an Ireland of great promise, an Ireland at peace
with itself for the first time in more than a thousand years, an
Ireland which is in the process of creating a new golden age of
prosperity,'' said Ahern, addressing a Fianna Fail conference for
the first time since his party swept to power in mid-1997.
	   More than 5,000 party supporters packed the Royal Dublin Society
hall for Ahern's concluding address to the 63rd annual conference
of Fianna Fail, which means Soldiers of Destiny in Gaelic.
	   Ahern emphasized that the fate of April's historic accord on
Northern Ireland rested with the British-ruled province's divided
Protestant and Catholic politicians, not with his own government,
which now accepts the right of Northern Ireland to exist as a
separate state.
	   ``The people of Northern Ireland want to enjoy the same bright
future as ourselves. We must help them achieve that goal, not out
of any selfish political interest, but in a spirit of friendship
and respect for difference. We cannot determine their future for
them,'' he said.
	   Ahern said his government expected to retain priority funding
from the European Union into the 21st century. Priority funding is
reserved for the poorest members of the 15-nation union. For the
past decade Ireland has received more EU money per capita than any
other country, but could lose that edge next year.
	   Ahern said the Irish Republic had ``spectacularly prospered in
the European Union,'' and that the state's standard of living was
now more than 85 percent of the European Union average _ 10 points
above the cutoff point to qualify for priority aid, and far ahead
of Greece, Portugal and Spain.
	   ``But we are still some distance behind all the other 11 member
states of the EU,'' he said, adding: ``As the fourth-least
developed country of the union, we are absolutely entitled to be
net recipients of the EU budget for some time to come.''
	   Ahern said crime statistics had fallen by 10 percent in the past
year and his government would keep clamping down by hiring more
police officers and building more prison cells.
	   ``Many organized criminal gangs are either in jail or have fled
the state,'' he said. ``The days when it might have appeared that
Ireland was a drug-pusher's paradise are well and truly over.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LLANELLI, Wales (AP) _ Back row forward Colin Charvis scored two
tries and Neil Jenkins kicked five penalties and four conversions
as Wales scored a 43-30 victory over Argentina Saturday.
	   The teams scored four tries each in an entertaining match at
Stradey Park with the South Americans trailing by only one point at
half time after Wales had opened up a 17-point lead early on.
	   Center Mark Taylor and winger Daffyd James also scored tries for
the Welsh while scrum half Agustin Pichot, fly half Felip Contepomi
and back row forward Pedro Sporleder crossed the line for Argentina
which also was awarded a penalty try after some phenemonal play by
its forwards. Contepomi contributed 15 points with a try, two
penalties and two conversions.
	   Although Argentina took the lead second minute penalty by
Contepomi, Jenkins's kick leveled the scores two minutes later and
then the Welsh raced into a 20-3 lead inside the first 17.
	   Taylor powered through a huge defensive gap for his first try
for Wales in the ninth minute and Charvis crossed the line two
minutes later. Jenkins converted both and then extended the lead to
20-3 with another penalty.
	   After Contepomi had replied with a penalty, two more kicks by
the accurate Jenkins made it 26-6 before Argentina, powered by its
massive, well-organized forwards, hit back with three tries.
	   Scrum half Pichot was the first to cross the Welsh line in the
33rd minute, and Contepomi converted and then scored a try of his
own four minutes later to reduce the lead to 26-18.
	   Just before the break the forwards forced the Welsh to pull down
a scrum and Irish referee Alan Lewis awarded Argentina a penalty
try, which Contempomi converted to make it 26-25 at the interval.
	   With only one point separating the two teams, there was no
scoring for the first 16 minutes of the second half when center
Scott Gibbs pass to Charvis, who went over for his second try,
converted by Jenkins, and Wales led 33-25.
	   Six minutes later the Welsh were 15 points clear again with
winger Daffyd James racing 35 meters to go over for their fourth
try and Jenkins kicked his fourth conversion.
	   Back row forward Pedro Sporleder then cut the lead to 10 points
at 40-30 with a try following a lineout in the 66th minute but
Jenkins kicked his fifth penalty of the game four minutes from the
end to ensure no more Argentina comebacks.

Brazil's transport minister calls for sea route for Rio commuters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Stressed Rio de Janeiro commuters
may soon get a new way to avoid the city's busy roads and
inefficient rail service: going to work by sea.
	   Brazilian Transport Minister Eliseu Padilha is backing the
introduction of a hovercraft service along Rio's coast.
	   ``This is a very simple project, easy to set up at a reasonable
cost,'' he was quoted as saying in the O Jornal do Brasil newspaper
Saturday. ``In my opinion, there would be private companies from
all the world interested in getting involved with it.''
	   Padilha urged Rio city authorities to work on the idea, which is
seen as a big draw for tourists.
	   A plan to link seven neighborhoods along about 20 miles (30
kilometers) of Rio's coast to the city center with a hovercraft
service was drawn up in 1995 but did not progress.

President rejects resignation of minister accused of graft

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from parliamentary committee; ADDS

 &UR; By ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cypriot president rejected Saturday
the resignation of his interior minister, who has been accused of
corruption by a parliamentary committee.
	   ``This is one of the saddest days for democracy in Cyprus,''
said Christos Pourgourides, chairman of the parliament's Watchdog
Committee, which charged the minister with graft. ``It is unheard
of for a minister to remain in office when the attorney general
undertakes a criminal investigation involving him.''
	   President Glafcos Clerides announced his decision in a statement
issued after a five-hour Cabinet meeting called to discuss the
attorney-general's report into the accusations against the
minister, Dinos Michaelides.
	   The statement said the attorney general had found 11 corruption
charges against Michaelides to be baseless. The accusations stemmed
from the Watchdog Committee.
	   But the Cabinet accepted the attorney-general's recommendation
that the police investigate two other allegations against the
minister, whose department issues building permits and residence
visas.
	   The two allegations say Michaelides benefited personally from
alterations in town planning zones and from the irregular granting
of residence permits to aliens.
	   Clerides said he would not accept Michaelides' resignation
because an investigation itself ``does not constitute guilt, and no
person is considered guilty because there are charges against
him.''
	   Earlier Michaelides had walked out of the Cabinet meeting,
telling reporters he had submitted his resignation because of the
attorney-general's recommendation that two charges be pursued.
	   Later Michaelides was summoned to the Presidential Palace to be
told that his resignation had been rejected. On leaving,
Michaelides told journalists he was fully satisfied with the
development and had withdrawn his resignation.
	   Opposition parties have criticized Clerides for not insisting
that Michaelides step down while the investigation is conducted.
	   Watchdog chairman Pourgourides said the Cabinet's decision might
have been influenced by fear that Michaelides could reveal cases of
high-level corruption.
	   During the presidential elections in February, Michaelides broke
ranks with his party to endorse Clerides.

 &UR; Eds: Recasts, ADDS Jenkins becomes rugby's second highest scorer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LLANELLI, Wales (AP) _ Neil Jenkins became the second highest
points scorer of all time in international rugby union Saturday as
Wales scored a 43-30 victory over Argentina.
	   The Pontypridd fly half kicked five penalties and four
conversions for a personal match haul of 23 points to take his
total to 673 for Wales and the British Lions and past Scotland's
now-retired Gavin Hastings. Only Australia's Michael Lynagh, now
retired with a total of 911 international points, has scored more.

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Justin Rose, the English teen-ager who
finished a surprise fourth in July's British Open, took his first
step Saturday to winning his PGA European Tour card.
	   Rose, 18, shot 1-under 71 Saturday to make the four-round cut
and advance to the final field of 75. The top 35 players after play
Sunday and Monday will receive their tour cards.
	   Rose tied for 58th place, at 4-over 292, 13 shot behind leader
Ross Drummond of Scotland. Rose opened with a disastrous 6-under 78
on Wednesday but then shot 73, 70 going into Saturday's round.
	   Drummond shot 1-over 73 Saturday to add to rounds of 70, 67 and
69 for 279. Emanuele Canonica of Italy, Francis Valera of Spain and
Henrik Nystrom of Sweden were two shots back at 281. Valera and
Canonica each shot 75 Saturday and Nystrom had a 70.
	   American Mac O'Grady, twice a winner on the U.S. Tour but now
47, shot a 5-under 67 at Sotogrande to make the cut at 291 with
previous rounds of 75, 74, 75.

South Africans down Scots for 16th win in a row, Australia triumphs
</HEADLINE>
over French &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Wales-Argentina, South African quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa made it 16 wins in a row with a 35-10
victory over Scotland Saturday and below-strength Australia came
from behind to beat Europe's strongest team, France, 32-21 to
maintain the southern hemisphere's rugby union dominance.
	   Wales hit back for the northern hemisphere by scoring a 43-30
victory over Argentina with fly half Neil Jenkins kicking five
penalties and four conversions to become the second highest points
scorer in international rugby with 673 for Wales and the British
Lions. Australia's Michael Lynagh, now retired, scored 911.
	   The Springboks, who trailed 7-3 early in the game, ran in four
second half tries at Murrayfield through scrum half Joost van der
Westhuizen, winger Pieter Rossouw, center Andre Snyman and back row
forward Bobby Skinstad.
	   South African winger Stefan Terblanche also crossed the home
line and fullback Percy Montgomery kicked two penalties and two
conversions while all the Scottish points came from fly half Duncan
Hodge with a try, conversion and penalty.
	   After going close to defeat last week against Wales, the South
Africans produced a much improved performance against the Scots,
who gave debuts to three players including Kiwi-born center John
Leslie who was joined by his brother, Martin, as a substitute.
Their father, Andy Leslie, was a standout captain for New Zealand.
	   The Scots impressed with their ball-handling and imaginative
play and hardly resembled a team which had lost 10 of its last 11
matches.
	   ``We threw away three or four other try-scoring chances,'' said
South African coach Nick Mallett.
	   ``There was a big improvement in our focus and commitment from
the Wales match against a team that kept possession very well.
	   ``Defensively, we were far better than against the Welsh but we
are still looking like a side that got together just two weeks
ago,'' Mallett said.
	   ``Scotland probably had 60 percent of the possession today but
only scored 10 points, while from our 40 percent possession, we
managed 35 points so that has got to be very encouraging.''
	   In bitterly cold conditions at the Stade de France, Australian
captain John Eales kicked four second half penalties after his team
trailed Five Nations champion France 21-20 at half time.
	   The game had five tries in the first half and none in the second
with Eales scoring all the points after the break as both teams
tightened their defenses.
	   The Wallabies scored tries through Daniel Wilson, Thomas Bowman
and Toutai Kefu in the first half but the Australians had to rely
on the boot of second row Eales after the break.
	   Winger Thomas Lombard and half-back Philippe Carbonneau crossed
for first half tries for the French with three penalties from
Christophe Lamaison, including a stunning 50-meter (yard) kick,
giving his team the edge at the interval.
	   On a 13-day European tour which also takes in a game against
England next weekend, the Australians are without several of their
top players, including Matt Burke, Ben Tune, Tim Horan, Damian
Smith and Dan Crowley.
	   Back row forward Colin Charvis scored two of the four Welsh
tries at Llanelli but it was the accurate boot of Jenkins, who
contributed 23 points, that ensured victory over Argentina.
	   Center Mark Taylor and winger Daffyd James also scored tries for
the Welsh while scrum half Agustin Pichot, fly half Felip Contepomi
and back row forward Pedro Sporleder crossed the line for
Argentina. The South Americans, beaten 34-14 by France last week,
also were awarded a penalty try after some phenemonal play by their
powerful and well-organized forwards.
	   England is in action on Sunday when it meets Italy in a World
Cup qualifying game, even though both teams have already qualified
by beating the weakest team in the group, the Netherlands.
	   Ireland scored a 53-35 victory over Romania Saturday in a World
Cup qualifying game with both teams already through having already
beaten Georgia.
	   Center Jonathan Bell scored two tries, fullback Conor O'Shea,
scrum half Ciaran Scally and back row Anthony Ward also crossed the
Romanian line and New Zealand referee Paul Honiss also awarded the
Irish two penalty tries at Lansdowne Road. Eric Elwood and David
Humphreys both kicked three conversions and a penalty.
	   Romanian fullback Mihai Vioreanu scored two tries while others
came from center Gabriel Brezoianu and wingers Gheorghe Salomie and
Radu Fugigi. Scrum half Petre Mitu kicked two conversions and two
penalties.

Public-school teachers end strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Some 4,000 teachers at public high
schools suspended a strike Saturday, pending further negotiations.
	   The teachers' trade union said in a statement they would resume
talks with the government, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a
local television channel, reported.
	   The strike, which began Nov. 9, had closed 193 public schools,
leaving more than 65,000 high school students without classes.
	   The teachers struck Nov. 9, saying that their end-of-service
compensation should be calculated on the basis of their full
salaries. Last month the government offered to calculate the
compensation on the basis of 85 percent of the final salaries.
	   In Lebanon, retirement pay is generally given in one lump sum,
called end-of-service compensation, in which the worker receives a
payment equal to one month's pay _ or a percentage of the pay _ for
each year worked.
	   Teachers' salaries run from dlrs 250 a month to dlrs 1,000 in
public schools and from dlrs 550 a month to dlrs 1,000 in private
ones.

St. Croix officials warn about Africanized bees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE BULLOCK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Though no one has yet
been stung by an Africanized bee on St. Croix, Department of
Agriculture officials are warning residents to stay away from
colonies of the excitable insects.
	   The aggressive bees, sometimes called ``killer bees,'' have been
present on the island since 1994, but have spread further afield in
search of food since Hurricane Georges blew away fruit blossoms and
flowering plants.
	   ``We have had a number of reports from concerned citizens and
the department has assisted some individuals to remove colonies
from their premises,'' said Errol Chichester, a department of
agriculture extension officer.
	   ``Bee activity increases at this time of year,'' said
Agriculture Commissioner Dr. Arthur Petersen.
	   He said his main concern is that children out of school for
holiday vacation might mix with the bees.
	   ``What we want to do is alert the public about the steps to take
if confronted with an attack,'' said Petersen. ``To put it simply,
run for cover as far and as fast as you can.''
	   Dr. Jeff Keularts, an entomologist at the University of the
Virgin Islands, endorsed that advice.
	   ``Anything or anybody that's in the vicinity will be attacked,''
he said. ``If it's an Africanized colony they will attack in larger
numbers. Ten percent of the colony can be recruited.''
	   Keularts said a small colony can have as few as 15,000 bees, but
a large, well established colony can have as many as 75,000.
	   In nearby Puerto Rico, a 2-year-old boy died hours after he was
attacked by a swarm of the bees earlier this summer.

 &UR; There is life, an awful life, under the snow rubble &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TURICEVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) - The charred remains of what was
once a village pokes through the blanket of snow into the slate
gray sky, a white desert seemingly empty of life in the silent
Kosovo countryside. Then a movement.
	   A man in a blue jacket moves slowly up the hill toward an almost
indiscernable wisp of smoke curling from a makeshift chimney. A
second movement catches the eye. A boy this time.
	   On closer observation, there are people in this devastated
countryside, now covered with the first snowfall of the winter.
They do live here. In a way. An awful way. A cold, hungry way.
	   Jakup Syla greets a visitor. He is able to smile even as he
indicates his wrecked, roofless, windowless home, burned to the
brick frame. He and his family have made a home in the basement
since coming back a month ago.
	   The room is cold and damp. Stalactites of seepage drip from the
ceiling as Syla's wife flattens the dough for bread.
	   Outside, a few chickens scratch and a mangy yellow dog looks for
warmth.
	   The Serbs devastated this ethnic Albanian village 50 kilometers
(30) miles west of Pristina during their final offensive in
September.
	   ``You want to see a house with 30 people living on one room?''
asks a neighbor who has come to see what all the excitement is
about in Syla's house.
	   A short walk next door. A tractor with three wheels leans
against the wall of an unfinished home.
	   In fact, 32 people from seven families live in one room of Avdi
Syla's house. Twenty-six of them have come here from other villages
to seek shelter with family and friends.
	   ``We are going to spend the winter together here,'' says Avdi
Syla, a 66-year-old grandfather in a worn jacket and dirty white
conical Albanian hat.
	   The longer the visitor stays, the more people turn up. Villagers
estimate about 30 percent of the original 200 families have
returned in the past month, though most of the houses are
uninhabitable.
	   ``We don't have anything,'' says Avdi Syla. ``If somebody helps
us, good. Otherwise we will try to survive somehow.''
	   These families have not received any humanitarian aid at all,
they say, and are living mostly on potatoes.
	   Diplomatic observers came here once, villagers said. They said
they would come back with aid. But they never did.
	   ``You have to take notes,'' Syla told a reporter. ``Tell the
world what is happening to us.''

Former hostage Terry Anderson attends press forum in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The longest-held foreign hostage in
Beirut, U.S. journalist Terry Anderson, took part in a conference
on press freedom in the city Saturday.
	   ``I'm very happy to be back and I look forward to seeing the
progress the country has made,'' Anderson told The Associated
Press.
	   It is his second visit to Lebanon since his release in 1991
after 2,455 days in the custody of Muslim extremists.
	   He arrived Friday and is expected to stay several days.
	   He said he was representing the Committee to Protect
Journalists, a New York-based organization of which he is the vice
president, at a forum organized by the international World Press
Freedoms Committee.
	   Anderson, 50, was chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press when his kidnappers seized him on March 16, 1985
at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
	   His ordeal made him the longest-held of 92 foreigners who were
abducted during the war. Most were freed. Eleven are believed to
have been killed by their captors or died in captivity.
	   Anderson made his first return to Lebanon in 1996 to film a
documentary for Cable News Network about the country's recovery
from the civil war.

Davenport beats Graf to make Chase final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with first semifinal. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport got her revenge, beating
Steffi Graf 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 on Saturday to advance to the title match
of the dlrs 2 million Chase Championships.
	   The victory comes six days after Graf upset Davenport, the
top-ranked player, in the final of a tournament in Philadelphia.
	   Davenport ended Graf's match winning streak at 12, handing the
German her first loss since having wrist surgery in September. Graf
was seeking her third consecutive tournament title since rejoining
the WTA Tour.
	   In Sunday's championship match, Davenport will face the winner
of Saturday's second semifinal between No. 2 Martina Hingis of
Switzerland and Irina Spirlea of Romania.
	   Hingis is seeking her second trip to the final in her three
trips to New York City's Madison Square Garden. In her debut in
1996, she lost in five sets to Graf.
	   Sunday's title match will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time
women play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs
500,000, with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   Davenport is top-seeded in this season-ending, 16-player
tournament. Graf, a five-time winner of the Championships, was
unseeded in the Madison Square Garden event for the first time in
13 appearances, having never been ranked lower than No. 3.
	   Their semifinal was a battle of wills as much as forehands, and
Davenport proved just as tough in both. She played mostly to Graf's
backhand, daring her opponent to come up with a winning solution.
	   Graf was the crowd favorite until nearly the last game of the
match. It made no difference to the U.S. Open champion, who finally
won them over with her gutsy play and big strokes.
	   Whenever Graf seemed to gain the upper hand, Davenport came back
with yet another winner. She finally got the crowd cheering for her
on the second point of the final game when, after making several
off-balance shots to stay in the point, she won with a sharply
angled crosscourt forehand.
	   That made it 15-all, and Graf won only one more point in the
match.
	   Davenport advanced to the semifinals Friday night by easily
defeating eighth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-0, 6-3. Hingis
clinched a berth with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory over No. 6 Mary
Pierce of France.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   There were varying amounts of cloudiness and sunshine across the
U.S. Virgin islands and Puerto Rico during the afternoon hours.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms were noted but were
most numerous across the interior and west sections of Puerto Rico.
High temperatures ranged from the lower to mid 70s over the
mountains to the 80s to around 90 degrees elsewhere. It was breezy
with gusty east winds of 15 to 20 mph, except for local sea breeze
variations along the coast.
	   Skies will average out partly cloudy across the region tonight.
Scattered showers and an isolated thunderstorm or two will occur,
mainly over the U.S. Virgin Islands, along the north and east
coasts of Puerto Rico and across the coastal waters. Low
temperatures will range from 60 to 65 degrees over the normal cool
spots of south and interior Puerto Rico to generally between 65 and
75 degrees elsewhere. The winds will be east to northeast at 15 mph
or less.
	   Surface high pressure centered well northeast of Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands will move east through Sunday and will be
replaced by a second high moving off the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast.
This will result in a generally fair and dry weather regime across
the region through Sunday. However, normal diurnal effects, a mid
to upper-level disturbance and available moisture will combine to
produce scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms across the
local area.

Former hostage Terry Anderson attends press forum in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The longest-held foreign hostage in
Beirut, U.S. journalist Terry Anderson, took part in a conference
on press freedom in the city Saturday.
	   ``I'm very happy to be back and I look forward to seeing the
progress the country has made,'' Anderson told The Associated
Press.
	   It was Anderson's second visit to Lebanon since his release in
1991 after 2,455 days in the custody of Muslim extremists. He
arrived Friday and was expected to stay several days.
	   Anderson said he was representing the Committee to Protect
Journalists, a New York-based organization of which he is the vice
president, at a forum organized by the World Press Freedoms
Committee.
	   Anderson, 50, was chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press when his kidnappers seized him on March 16, 1985
at the height of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
	   His ordeal made him the longest-held of 92 foreigners who were
abducted during the war. Most were freed. Eleven are believed to
have been killed by their captors or died in captivity.
	   Anderson made his first return to Lebanon in 1996 to film a
documentary for Cable News Network about the country's recovery
from the civil war.

Hrovat holds off Austrian to win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with second run. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Urska Hrovat of Slovenia lost most of a
huge first-run margin but still held off Sabine Egger of Austria by
.38 seconds to win a women's World Cup slalom Saturday.
	   Croatian teen-ager Janca Kostelic, predicted to reach greatness
in the future, showed some on Saturday by taking third, giving her
a podium finish in only her fifth World Cup start.
	   Hrovat dominated the morning run, leading by 1.1 seconds, and
that margin paid off in victory in the afternoon. Egger, fifth
after the first run but 1.48 seconds back, skied brilliantly in
carving more than a second off the leader's time.
	   Hrovat's winning aggregate was 1 minute, 36.91 seconds. Egger
finished in 1:37.29 for second with Kostelic in 1:37.60.
	   Hrovat got her fifth career victory with a solid if
unspectacular run. She made use of her huge lead, keeping her skis
away from danger after Egger and Kostelic had skied on the edge in
an effort to catch up.
	   Until Egger came along, it looked as if the 16-year-old
Croatian, who started 53rd and placed 12th in the morning run,
might write an improbable chapter in World Cup history. Her time of
46.12 seconds was the fastest of the afternoon and vaulted her nine
spots in the standings. Egger almost matched it with a 46.14-second
effort while Hrovat, safely ahead the entire way, needed only a
47.24 to climb the top step of the podium.
	   It was a disappointing for defending champion Ylva Nowen of
Sweden, who had to rally just to take 10th, 1.36 seconds behind.
	   And defending race champion Zali Steggall of Australia was
unable to keep pace after sitting second in the mornng, slipping
back to seventh in the final rendering.
	   While Kostelic gave Croatia its first-ever World Cup podium,
Vicky Grau gave tiny Andorra its first points, placing 19th.

Palestinians say Israeli release of thieves violates accord

demonstration

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, the Palestinians charged Saturday that Israel violated the
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace deal by releasing 150 common criminals
instead of detainees who fought Israeli occupation.
	   The Palestinians said they protested to the United States over
``a violation of the accord'' since only 100 of the 250 prisoners
released on Friday were accused in the struggle against Israel.
	   Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 9.1
percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum signed last month, Israel
is slated to withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January in tandem with Palestinian steps against
anti-Israeli activity.
	   The pullbacks in three phases will grant the Palestinians
partial or total control over 40 percent of the area.
	   ``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S.
President Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi,
a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not
fair and shows bad intentions.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response that
the peace accord did not stipulate that Israel free prisoners with
Jewish ``blood on their hands.''
	   ``There is no way that I will free murderers,'' Netanyahu said
in a statement. ``I said at Wye that I won't free terrorists with
blood on their hands.''
	   Despite the smooth transfer of the territory, three Palestinians
were lightly injured on Saturday when Israeli soldiers fired rubber
bullets to disperse a demonstration of some 200 Palestinians near
the northern West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.
	   The Palestinians were protesting against what they said was the
uprooting of trees by Jewish settlers in the area but the army said
the Palestinians tried to damage an Israeli building.
	   The army declared the area a closed military zone and arrested
three Palestinians, a military spokesman said.

radical group Hamas, relatives said. Since the signing the accord,
Palestinian police have arrested hundreds of members of Hamas,
which opposes the peace process and has taken responsibility for
several deadly attacks on Israelis.

Yagudin, Butyrskaya wins singles: French take pairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Update with men's results &QL; 
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Alexei Yagudin beat Michael Weiss in a quad faceff
to take the men's title at the Lalique Trophy figure skating
competition Saturday.
	   Maria Butyrskaya rallied from third to beat Nicole Bobek to take
the women's event in another Russian victory over an American.
	   Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis of France won the pairs
program for their major international victory.
	   Yagudin landed another clean quad jump for the second
competition in a row in his impressive routine to ``Lawrence of
Arabia.'' He had seven triples and was superb in choreography that
had him pumping his fists at the end of the program. It was his
fifth victory in five weeks.
	   Landing another quad excited him.
	   ``You don't know how fanstistic a feeling it is to land one,''
Yagudin said. ``With triples I can do from different positions. You
go into a quad and if your technique is a bit off, you don't do
it.''
	   ``After my opening jumps, I try to keep my energy for the quad.
You go into it and don't think about being artistic,'' Yagudin
said.
	   With marks of 5.8 and 5.9 throughout, it was perhaps his best
routine of a season filled with good routines, such as when he
landed nine triples at Skate America.
	   Weiss, who led after the short program, couldn't match the
fireworks of Yagudin although he tried. He tried his quad and
two-footed it slightly according to his coach Audrey Weisiger.
Weiss has been just missing the quad for the past two years.
	   He fell out of a triple axel and had a spill in the middle of
steps but had six triples.
	   ``I did a good program but the level is incredibly high now,''
said Weiss. ``The competition is becoming so strong.''
	   He ended with notes from 5.5 to 5.7 to the music from the Disney
movie ``Mulan.''
	   Third went to Canadian Emmanuel Sandhu who moved up from fifth.
	   In the women's event, Bobek wanted to rebound with her first
international victory since 1995 when she won the U.S. title. Since
then she has had a lot of downs, which culminated with a 17th at
the Olympic Games.
	   She has since gone back to train with Richard Callaghan, with
whom she won the national crown. Callaghan coached Tara Lipinski to
the Olympic gold medal.
	   ``Definitely I think it is a new start. I think we accomplished
a lot in this competiton and the other competition,'' Bobek said.
	   She showed potential in taking the short program on Friday but
couldn't hold on to the lead in Saturday's free program.
	   Although Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian
did the more difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand
Prix victory of the season. She won also at Skate America.
	   Bobek's music to ``Evita'' was inspiring, her skating was not.
	   Bobek started well with a triple lutz-double toe loop
combination. Then she proceeded to scale down three triple jumps to
doubles in her next four attempts. She ended with just three
triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from her eyes while
waiting for her marks.
	   ``Of course the emotions came out, '' Bobek said.
	   She scored technical marks between 5.0 to 5,4 and only a little
better in the presentation marks.
	   Butyrskaya skated well enough to win. Finishing with only four
triples, she still scored more than two-tenths better than Bobek on
nearly every mark to win easily.
	   Although Butyrskaya, the European champion and third at the
world championships, went down on one triple jump and had to put a
hand down on another, the overall quality and quantity of the jumps
gave her the win.
	   ``I.m happy with the result, the win but I am not happy with the
way I skated. I didn't do the things I can do in practice or last
year at Europeans,'' Butyskaya said. ``But this is my sixth
competition of the year and I am very tired.''
	   Third went to Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena
Liashenko of Ukraine.
	   Abitbol and Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer
mistakes of the top couples. To the music of `Acropolis' they were
off in individual jumps but had some unusual lifts to maintain
first.
	   Americans Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman moved from fourth to
second although he had trouble with jumps.
	   The Lalique Trophy is the fourth in the International Skating
Union's that features Olympic-eligible skaters.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Miss Universe Wendy
Fitzwilliam visited with youths at a home for neglected and abused
children on St. Croix Saturday as part of a five-day tour of the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   The native of Trinidad and Tobago was greeted by tourism
officials and hundreds of people from around the Caribbean who
cheered her arrival. Fitzwilliam was the guest of honor for
Caribbean Unity Week activities that began Monday.
	   The highlight of the celebration was to be a Caribbean Unity
Ball Saturday night at Marriott's Frenchman's Reef Beach Resort
hosted by humorist and author Paul Keens-Douglas, a fellow
Trinidadian.
	   At the Queen Louise Home on Saturday, she met briefly with
officials and then chatted with children and signed autographs.
	   Fitzwilliam met with students on St. John and St. Thomas earlier
in the week and was scheduled to visit the British Virgin Islands
before returning to Trinidad on Monday.

Cuban doctors finally allowed to help Nicaragua after Hurricane
</HEADLINE>
Mitch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ After a controversial weeks-long delay
apparently caused by political concerns, the first teams of Cuban
doctors arrived in Nicaragua on Saturday to help treat victims of
Hurricane Mitch.
	   The conservative government of President Arnoldo Aleman had
accepted only food and medicine from Cuba, saying it couldn't
transport doctors to the areas affected by the storm.
	   But the government _ whose relief efforts have been sharply
criticized _ accepted the help of doctors from other countries. On
Friday, the government said it would accept health teams Cuba had
offered earlier this month.
	   Cuba's Vice Minister of Health, Abelardo Rodriguez, accompanied
the 22 doctors organized in six medical brigades as they landed at
Managua's international airport.
	   The teams were met by Maria Angeles Arguello, Rodriguez'
Nicaraguan counterpart, who said they would help in ``prevention
and control of diseases'' in hard-hit northern provinces of
Chinandega, Nueva Segovia and Esteli.
	   The rejection of Cuban doctors appeared to stem from the bad
relations since Aleman was elected president last year.
	   Cuba was a strong ally of Nicaragua's Sandinista government of
the 1980s, which Aleman had opposed and which had imprisoned him.
Aleman has maintained tight relations with the Cuban exile
community in Miami, which strongly opposes Fidel Castro.
	   The rejection of the Cuban doctors was sharply criticized by
Nicaraguans, some of whom noted that even the staunchly
anti-communist Somoza regime permitted Cuban doctors to help after
a 1972 earthquake struck Managua, killing 10,000 people.
	   Nicaragua's Health Ministry said it asked Cuba for help this
week, after some of the transportation difficulties were resolved.
	   Nicaragua has had outbreaks of diarrhea, dengue, cholera and
other diseases, many stemming from the river contamination caused
by the hurricane.

Palestinians say Israeli release of thieves violates accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REFILING with full Netanyahu quote

 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, the Palestinians charged Saturday that Israel violated the
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace deal by releasing 150 common criminals
instead of detainees who fought Israeli occupation.
	   The Palestinians said they protested to the United States over
``a violation of the accord'' since only 100 of the 250 prisoners
released on Friday were accused in the struggle against Israel.
	   Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 9.1
percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more
Palestinian prisoners.
	   Under the U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum signed last month, Israel
is slated to withdraw from a total of 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January in tandem with Palestinian steps against
anti-Israeli activity.
	   The pullbacks in three phases will grant the Palestinians
partial or total control over 40 percent of the area.
	   ``We didn't go to Wye River to use the services of (U.S.
President Bill) Clinton to release car thieves,'' said Ahmed Tibi,
a senior aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``This is not
fair and shows bad intentions.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in response that
the peace accord did not stipulate that Israel free terrorists or
activists of Islamic militant groups responsible for anti-Israeli
attacks.
	   ``There is no way that I will free murderers,'' Netanyahu said
in a statement. ``I said at Wye that I won't free terrorists with
blood on their hands, not murderers and not Hamas members.''
	   Despite the smooth transfer of the territory, three Palestinians
were lightly injured on Saturday when Israeli soldiers fired rubber
bullets to disperse a demonstration of some 200 Palestinians near
the northern West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.
	   The Palestinians were protesting against what they said was the
uprooting of trees by Jewish settlers in the area but the army said
the Palestinians tried to damage an Israeli building.
	   The army declared the area a closed military zone and arrested
three Palestinians, a military spokesman said.

Hrovat holds off Austrian
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Urska Hrovat of Slovenia lost most of a
huge first-run margin but still held off Sabine Egger of Austria by
.38 seconds to win a women's World Cup slalom Saturday.
	   Croatian teen-ager Janca Kostelic, predicted to reach greatness
in the future, showed some on Saturday by taking third, giving her
a podium finish in only her fifth World Cup start.
	   Hrovat dominated the morning run, leading by 1.1 seconds, and
that margin paid off in victory in the afternoon. Egger, fifth
after the first run but 1.48 seconds back, skied brilliantly in
carving more than a second off the leader's time.
	   Hrovat's winning aggregate was 1 minute, 36.91 seconds. Egger
finished in 1:37.29 for second with Kostelic in 1:37.60.
	   Hrovat got her fifth career victory with a solid if
unspectacular run. She made use of her huge lead, keeping her skis
away from danger after Egger and Kostelic had skied on the edge in
an effort to catch up.
	   ``After the first run, I just really felt safe,'' Hrovat said.
``I said, `OK, for the second run, you must come down, you don't
need to attack so much,' because I was so much ahead of the others.
	   ``I just said keep it going and it will be enough,'' she added.
``Just push but use your head.''
	   Until Egger came along, it looked as if the 16-year-old
Croatian, who started 53rd and placed 12th in the morning run,
might write an improbable chapter in World Cup history. Her time of
46.12 seconds was the fastest of the afternoon and vaulted her nine
spots in the standings. Egger almost matched it with a 46.14-second
effort while Hrovat, safely ahead the entire way, needed only a
47.24 to climb the top step of the podium.
	   Kostelic appeared cool amid the uproar over her performance.
	   ``I wasn't nervous,'' she insisted. ``The first run in Cortina
last year I was nervous,'' since it was her first World Cup event.
	   ``I didn't think I'd do so well,'' she admitted. ``I though if I
could get into the second run, I'd be very happy. this is like a
dream.''
	   It was a disappointing for defending champion Ylva Nowen of
Sweden, who had to rally just to take 10th, 1.36 seconds behind.
	   And defending race champion Zali Steggall of Australia was
unable to keep pace after sitting second in the mornng, slipping
back to seventh in the final rendering.
	   While Kostelic gave Croatia its first-ever World Cup podium,
Vicky Grau gave tiny Andorra its first points, placing 19th.

Surprise! A Brit makes the cut

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Emma Carrick-Anderson gave Britain's
skiing a boost Saturday, finishing 14th in the opening run a
women's World Cup slalom and for the first time in her career
cracking the top 30 to qualify for a second run.
	   ``I'm so excited. I can't hardly believe it,'' the red-haired,
freckle-faced Scotswoman said. ``It felt quite good. I've been
skiing well in training and this didn't feel any different.
	   ``I had a second run in the world champs two years ago but never
in World Cup so it's real exciting.''
	   Even though she came up empty after falling in the afternoon
run, just getting to ski for World Cup points was an immediate
payback for the career change Carrick-Anderson made after last
season. Following two seasons on her own with a coach, she was
allowed to join the Finnish team for training.
	   ``It's so brilliant to have other people to compare with _ and
to laugh with, and everything else, too,'' she said. ``I just need
other people around me.
	   ``I could do timing (in 1997 and 1998) but I had nobody to push
me, whereas the girls this year are very good and I've had to go
every run.''
	   Bouyed by her Finnish training regimen, Carrick-Anderson took a
large leap forward from a 60th starting position.
	   ``This year, I decided I'd had enough starts in the back,'' she
said. ``I'd just had enough of that.''
	   And yet, making it into the top 15 for the second run didn't
seem all that difficult after she'd done it.
	   ``At the start today, I was really relaxed, unlike last year
when I was really tense and felt I had to do it. This year, I
didn't feel I had to do it. I love the skiing and if I do it,
that's great. I'm surprised. My run felt good but it didn't feel
anything special and I always thought to get into the top 30 you
had to do something really special.''

Yagudin, Butyrskaya wins singles: French couples win two events

	   PARIS (AP) - Alexei Yagudin beat Michael Weiss in a quad faceoff
to take the men's title at the Lalique Trophy figure skating
competition Saturday with Russians and French sharing the
victories.
	   Maria Butyrskaya rallied from third to beat Nicole Bobek to take
the women's event in another Russian win over an American.
	   For France, Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Benardis won the pairs
program and Ice dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat also
won.
	   Yagudin landed another clean quad jump for the second
competition in a row in his impressive routine to ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' that had him pumping his fists at the end. He had seven
triples and was superb in choreography the program for his fifth
victory in five weeks.
	   Landing another quad excited him.
	   ``You don't know how fanstistic a feeling it is to land one,''
Yagudin said. ``With triples I can do from different positions. You
go into a quad and if your technique is a bit off, you don't do
it.''
	   ``After my opening jumps, I try to keep my energy for the quad.
You go into it and don't think about being artistic,'' Yagudin
said.
	   With marks of 5.8 and 5.9 throughout, it was perhaps his best
routine of a season filled with good routines, such as when he
landed nine triples at Skate America.
	   Weiss, who led after the short program, couldn't match the
fireworks of Yagudin although he tried. He tried his quad and
two-footed it slightly according to his coach Audrey Weisiger.
Weiss has been just missing the quad for the past two years.
	   He fell out of a triple axel and had a spill in the middle of
steps but had six triples.
	   ``I did a good program but the level is incredibly high now,''
said Weiss. ``The competition is becoming so strong.''
	   He ended with notes from 5.5 to 5.7 to the music from the Disney
movie ``Mulan.''
	   Third went to Canadian Emmanuel Sandhu who moved up from fifth.
	   In the women's event, Bobek wanted to rebound with her first
international victory since 1995 when she won the U.S. title. Since
then she has had a lot of downs, which culminated with a 17th at
the Olympic Games.
	   She has since gone back to train with Richard Callaghan, with
whom she won the national crown. Callaghan coached Tara Lipinski to
the Olympic gold medal.
	   ``Definitely I think it is a new start. I think we accomplished
a lot in this competiton and the other competition,'' Bobek said.
	   She showed potential in taking the short program on Friday but
couldn't hold on to the lead in Saturday's free program.
	   Although Butyrskaya fell once while Bobek stayed up, the Russian
did the more difficult jumps and was rewarded with her second Grand
Prix victory of the season. She won also at Skate America.
	   Bobek's music to ``Evita'' was inspiring, her skating was not.
	   Bobek started well with a triple lutz-double toe loop
combination. Then she proceeded to scale down three triple jumps to
doubles in her next four attempts. She ended with just three
triples and was disappointed and wiped tears from her eyes while
waiting for her marks.
	   ``Of course the emotions came out, '' Bobek said.
	   She scored technical marks between 5.0 to 5,4 and only a little
better in the presentation marks.
	   Butyrskaya skated well enough to win. Finishing with only four
triples, she still scored more than two-tenths better than Bobek on
nearly every mark to win easily.
	   Although Butyrskaya, the European champion and third at the
world championships, went down on one triple jump and had to put a
hand down on another, the overall quality and quantity of the jumps
gave her the win.
	   ``I.m happy with the result, the win but I am not happy with the
way I skated. I didn't do the things I can do in practice or last
year at Europeans,'' Butyskaya said. ``But this is my sixth
competition of the year and I am very tired.''
	   Third went to Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, overtaking Elena
Liashenko of Ukraine.
	   Anissina, a former Russian, and Peizerat, had a dramatic routine
to music from ``The Man in the Iron Mask '' featuring an unusual
move where she lifts him off the ice for a long distance down the
ice.
	   The world runners-up gained marks of 5.7 up to 5.9 for
presentation in a performance that appeared to be better than their
victory in Skate America.
	   Second were Italians Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio.
	   Abitbol and Bernadis took the pairs event making the fewer
mistakes of the top couples. To the music of `Acropolis' they were
off in individual jumps but had some unusual lifts to maintain
first.
	   Americans Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman moved from fourth to
second although he had trouble with jumps.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Cup of Russia in Moscow. The series culminates with the March final
in Russia, two weeks before the world championships in Finland.

Russia corrects path of international space station module
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Saturday developments. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space officials gave the first module of
the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it
into higher orbit, and convened a meeting on Earth to map out its
future.
	   Flight controllers fired one of the module's two maneuvering
engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in
space, the station's public affairs office said.
	   Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters
the maneuver was carried out ``with great accuracy,'' and the
24-ton core module was cruising through space without any problems.
	   The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted off Friday from the
Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit 200
kilometers (125 miles) above Earth.
	   Zarya is to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the
international project, providing propulsion, power and
communications. It will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous
with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched
Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to
Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded by space
officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international
cooperation in space in the 21st century.
	   The heads of the space agencies of the United States, Russia,
Japan and Canada, along with the European Space Agency, met in
Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The space agency heads agreed on a schedule for future meetings
and on holding a scientific conference on the project somewhere in
Europe, at an unspecified date.
	   Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir
Lobachev, was quoted as saying that Russia would take the lead role
in managing the international space station during its first five
years.
	   Previously, space officials have said the station would be
jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space
agency NASA taking a lead role.
	   According to Interfax, Lobachev said it made sense for Russia to
control the project because the Russian-built Zarya and a
Russian-built service module would perform most of the life support
and navigational functions for the station's first five years.
	   ``Furthermore, Russian engineers are more experienced in this
job and NASA officials are aware of this,'' he said.
	   The space station is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion,
of which the United States is expected to pay dlrs 24 billion.
Russia's financing problems delayed the initial launch by a year,
and some critics have said the station amounts to an expensive way
for NASA to keep Russia's beleaguered space program alive.
	   The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting
astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.

Mallorca leader on downing Barcelona 1-0; Valencia slams Madrid
</HEADLINE>
3-1 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mallorca regained the league leader's spot
Saturday on downing defending champion FC Barcelona 1-0 while two
goals by Argentine striker Piojo Lopez helped Valencia zap Real
Madrid 3-1.
	   The victory left Mallorca with 22 points, two more than Celta
who went into the 11th round league leader but slumped 2-0 against
second-last Alaves.
	   Mallorca went ahead in the 21st minute when Barcelona defender
Sergi Barjuan misheaded a clearance following a cross from the wing
and sent the ball into his own net.
	   Barcelona mounted attack after attack against Mallorca but the
Balearic Island team held out in defense.
	   Barcelona slipped a place to No. 3 in the 20-team division with
19 points.
	   Other 11th-round results were: Tenerife 0, Athletic de Bilbao 1;
Atletico de Madrid 6, Valladolid 1; Oviedo 0, Betis 1 ; Real
Sociedad 0, Zaragoza 0.
	   Remaining games to be played Sunday include: Deportivo La Coruna
vs. Villarreal; Salamanca vs. Extremadura and Espanyol vs. Racing
Santander
 &UR; Valencia 3, Real Madrid 1 &QC; 
	   Miguel Angel Angulo dampened Real Madrid's spirits with a
35th-minute goal for the homeside. Brazilian Savio raised the side
hopes momentarily in the 57th minute with an equalizer but
Argentina's Claudio `Piojo' Lopez made it 2-1 for Valencia in the
62nd. Piojo finished Madrid with a third for Valencia in the 74th
minute.
	   Madrid now lies No. 4 with 18 points while Valencia moves up to
one place behind with the same points.
 &UR; Alaves 2, Celta 0 &QC; 
	   Struggling Alaves dealt Celta a deadening blow in the 27th
minute when midfielder Gerard Lopez scored. The northern side took
another knock seconds into the second half when its key striker
Michel Salgado was sent off and then it went 2-0 down in the 69th
with a goal by Arturo `Sivori' Igoroin.
	   Celta moved to No. 2, two points behind Mallorca while Alaves
with four wins, now has 12 points.
 &UR; Atletico de Madrid 6, Valladolid 1 &QC; 
	   Under pressure for results, Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi got a
break with a 6-1 thrashing of Valladolid. Brazilian defender Julio
Cesar gave Valladolid false hope by scoring in the second minute.
It took Atletico 25 minutes to equalize and even then on an own
goal by defender Juan Manuel Pena. Atletico had to wait until the
41st minute to take the lead with a goal by Yugoslav midfielder
Vladimir Jugovic.
	   But the second half had only started when fellow countryman
Zoran Njegus made it 3-1. Uruguayan Fernando Correa, Kiko Narvaez
and Jose Mari Romero each slotted in goals to bury a helpless
Valladolid.
	   The result left Atletico with 17 points, two more than
Valladolid.
 &UR; Oviedo 0, Betis 1 &QC; 
	   Betis continued its upward surge under former Spanish team coach
Javier Clemente with an 1-0 away win on a 33rd-minute goal by
Oliverio Alvarez. The Seville-based side moved toward mid-table
with 14 points while Oviedo stays with 15.

Davenport to face Hingis in Chase final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with second semifinal. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Top-ranked Lindsay Davenport avenged her recent
loss to Steffi Graf on Saturday and advanced to a meeting with No.
2 seed Martina Hingis for a chance at a dlrs 500,000 payoff in the
Chase Championships.
	   Displaying the game that made her the world's best player,
Davenport beat Graf 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, eliminating the German six days
after losing to her in the title match of a tournament in
Philadelphia.
	   ``Last week in Philadelphia she was playing unbelievable,''
Davenport said. ``She made a few more mistakes today.''
	   In the final, Davenport will face the Swiss teen-ager she
replaced at the top of the rankings. Hingis beat Romania's Irina
Spirlea in the other semifinal Saturday, 6-2, 7-6 (9-7).
	   Spirlea, like Graf, was unseeded in this 16-player,
season-ending tournament at Madison Square Garden.
	   Sunday's finale will be a best-of-5 sets, the only time women
play more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs 500,000,
with dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The first semifinal was a battle of wills as much as forehands,
and Davenport proved just as tough in both. She played mostly to
Graf's backhand, daring her opponent to come up with a winning
solution.
	   Graf was the crowd favorite until nearly the last game of the
match. It made no difference to the U.S. Open champion, who finally
won them over with gutsy play and big strokes.
	   Whenever Graf seemed to gain the upper hand, Davenport would
rally with yet another winner. She finally got the crowd cheering
for her on the second point of the final game when, after making
several off-balance shots to stay in the point, she won with a
sharply angled crosscourt forehand.
	   That made it 15-all, and Graf won only one more point in the
match.
	   ``We were both trying to hold our serves at the end,'' Davenport
said. ``I just was able to hold mine a little more.''
	   Graf broke Davenport in the opening game. But any thoughts of a
romp by the German were quickly dispelled when Davenport broke
right back, aided by Graf's double fault.
	   Graf is accustomed to the the season-ending tournaments, having
won five of them. Trailing 5-1, she fought to deuce before the
American held to close the opening set.
	   After Graf held at love to lead 5-2 in the second set, Davenport
took a three-minute medical timeout. As a trainer treated a blister
on Davenport's left foot, Graf took advantage of the break to leave
the court.
	   When play resumed, Davenport lost her serve for the second
straight time as Graf wrapped up the second set to even the match.
	   Following the sixth game of the final set, Graf called for the
trainer, who worked on her right hamstring, wrapping the thigh.
	   Hingis, at 17 the youngest of the semifinalists, ripped through
the first set in 22 minutes. The second set was another matter.
	   Spirlea, one of the game's most talented players, matched
strokes with Hingis. Twice she had her serve broken. Twice she
broke Hingis.
	   Hingis began the tiebreaker with an ace. Then Spirlea pulled
ahead and reached set point at 6-4 with a sharply hit forehand down
the line.
	   Then errors returned to Spirlea's game. She needed a backhand
while serving for the set. On the next point, she pushed a backhand
wide, causing Hingis to fan her face in relief.
	   Another Spirlea error gave Hingis match point, which the
Romanian saved with a backhand passing shot. Two shots later,
Hingis was in her second Chase Championships final in three years.
She lost to Graf in five sets in her Championships debut in 1996.

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) _ Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis, the top
Dutch team soon to disband, advanced to the finals of the ATP World
Doubles Championship with a 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 victory Saturday over Don
Johnson and Francisco Nestor.
	   The winners will face Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel
Nestor of Canada for the title Sunday. That match will be the last
time Eltingh and Haarhuis play together.
	   Eltingh announced earlier this week he will retire from tennis
after the tournament. The 28-year-old became a father this year and
wants to stay close to home. He retired from singles in 1997
because of knee problems.
	   Knowles and Nestor, the fourth-seeded team in the eight-team
field, won their semifinal 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 against Olivier Delaitre
and Fabrice Santoro.
	   Eltingh and Haarhuis improved their 1998 record to 45-4, the
best percentage on the ATP Tour this season. Together they have won
38 titles, including this year at Wimbledon.
	   ``It's not like the guys are giving it away,'' Eltingh said.
``We're playing good tennis.''
	   Against Johnson and Montana, the Dutchmen landed 73 percent of
their first serves to their opponents' 65 percent. Eltingh served
six of his team's nine aces and did not face a break point.
	   On the eve of the title match, neither Eltingh nor Haarhuis,
dwelled on the final outing. Eltingh had plans for an early dinner
and a stroll before turning in. Haarhuis was itching to watch the
Florida State-Florida football game.
	   ``Actually, I haven't thought about it,'' Haarhuis said. ``I
think it will be strange when the match is over tomorrow.''

Four-goal Feyenoord increases league lead

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Feyenoord's strikers used the
Saturday night game against Cambuur Leeuwarden for shooting
practice and the Rotterdammers ran out 4-0 winners.
	   Feyenoord (10-2-1) stretched its lead in the Dutch premiership
to three points with a game in hand over second-placed SC
Heerenveen, which was held to a 1-1 draw at De Graafschap
Doetinchem.
	   Vitesse dropped back in the race to head an unusually
competitive Dutch top division after a 3-1 loss at Roda JC
Kerkrade.
	   And FC Twente leapfrogged into fourth above the Arnhem side with
a 5-1 slaughter of Willem II Tilburg.
	   Julio Ricardo Cruz and Jon Dahl Tomasson both hit a post as
Feyenoord dominated the first half but had to wait 40 minutes for a
1-0 lead, which came from a Peter de Roo own goal.
	   After the break the shooting became more accurate and Cruz
scored twice before Peter van Vossen rounded off a handsome win in
the final minute.
	   Saturday's other game was a 1-1 draw between NAC Breda and
Fortuna Sittard.
	   In Sunday's games, struggling PSV Eindhoven travels to FC
Utrecht with its third-choice keeper, after losing Ronald Waterreus
to a red card and Patrick Lodewijks to a concussion in last week's
2-2 draw with Ajax.
	   But the Amsterdammers should pick up some easy points travelling
to bottom club RKC Waalwijk.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors paid an unannounced visit
to a suspected Iraqi weapons site on Saturday, the first such visit
since Baghdad blocked their work completely three weeks ago. The
official Iraqi News Agency said that a missile team ``made a
surprise visit to an establishment to check the monthly declaration
of its output.'' Meanwhile, in Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States believed Iraq
was obliged to hand over documents requested by UNSCOM chief
Richard Butler. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi,
said Friday that many of the documents were destroyed, never
existed or had already been turned over. He placed conditions on
viewing a particularly contentious Iraqi air force document. (IRAQ,
US-IRAQ)
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered
Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most
prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing
was widely considered to be politically motivated. President Boris
Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the
investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was
gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her
apartment. The shooting occurred in a building along St.
Petersburg's atmospheric Griboedova Canal, site of another
notorious Russian crime _ the murder that was the central event in
Fyodor Dostoevsky's 19th century masterpiece, ``Crime and
Punishment.'' Like that fictional crime, which shone a light on
social ferment in the St. Petersburg of its day, the death was
immediately seized upon as a seminal event in the Russia of the
late 1990s. (RUSSIA-ATTACK)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, Palestinians charged Saturday that Israel violated the
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace deal by releasing 150 common criminals
instead of detainees who fought Israeli occupation. The
Palestinians said they protested to the United States over ``a
violation of the accord'' since only 100 of the 250 prisoners
released on Friday were accused in the struggle against Israel.
Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 9.1
percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more
Palestinian prisoners. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from former strongman Suharto, Indonesia's current head of state,
B.J. Habibie, launched a commission of inquiry on Saturday into
corruption allegations against his predecessor and one time mentor.
The probe into Suharto's wealth appears to be a major concession to
protesting students who have fought bloody street battles with the
military. The students have demanded that Suharto, 77, be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during his 32 years as
president of the Southeast Asian nation. About 200 students staged
a protest near Suharto's residence Saturday, where the ex-president
has lived as a virtual recluse since quitting amid riots and
protests on May 21. (INDONESIA)
	   ROME (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel leader was freed in Rome on Saturday
amid a new barrage of protests from Turkey, which wants him handed
over as a terrorist. Abdullah Ocalan left the hospital where he'd
been in custody since his Nov. 12 arrival in Italy for a private
residence on Saturday morning. He told the thousands Kurds from
throughout Europe who came to Rome in his support to return home.
``Go back to your towns and your jobs and continue supporting the
Kurdish cause,'' he said in a statement. Obediently, the most
visible group, several hundred supporters who'd camped out for the
past week in a Rome piazza, peacefully packed up and left.

Fugitive banker's arrest could shed light into ruling party's

financing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The recent arrest of a politically
influential banker accused of bilking banks of dlrs 700 million
could shed light on fraud cases around the country _ and on the
campaign financing tactics of Mexico's ruling party.
	   Mexico City prosecutors announced Saturday they had charged
Carlos Cabal Peniche _ arrested Nov. 10 in Melbourne, Australia,
after after fleeing Mexico four years ago _ with frauds amounting
to dlrs 60 million.
	   Those charges are related to Cabal's alleged practice of lending
money from his bank to himself. That practice is subject to strict
amount and reporting limits under Mexican law.
	   Mexico City is governed by the left-center Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, which could reap major political advantages if Cabal
is extradited and found guilty of fraud. Mexico has said it will
seek his extradition.
	   The PRD has repeatedly accused Cabal of allegedly making illegal
contributions to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI. The new charges are the latest round in a politically-charged
battle to uncover the truth behind the PRI's campaign financing
tactics.
	   On Monday, electoral authorities agreed to consider the
complaints raised by PRD Chairman Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who
charged that President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994 campaign received
dlrs 4 million from Cabal.
	   ``President Zedillo has to explain why he received financing
from Cabal in his campaign in 1994,'' Lopez Obrador said. ``Let him
say if it is true or not that Cabal financed the PRI in 1994.''
	   Prosecutors have found evidence that Cabal made large
contributions to a 1994 governorship election in the Gulf coast
state of Tabasco, but it is not known whether any of the money went
into the PRI's national campaign coffers.
	   The decision by Mexico's electoral institute prompted PRI
representatives to walk out of the session. The PRI has denied any
wrongdoing and says the matter should be a dead issue because
election officials had earlier accepted its campaign spending
reports.
	   However, in previous investigations, the Federal Electoral
Institute has only looked at the amount and nature _ not the source
_ of campaign funds. The PRI argues that political parties are not
responsible for the origin of contributions under Mexican law.
	   A day after Cabal's arrest, the Reforma daily newspaper
published in its front page a 1994 photo of Zedillo and Cabal
sitting side by side at a fund-raising event.
	   Many also have protested that Cabal's unpaid debts are among
those that would be paid for under a government proposal to have
taxpayers pick up the tab for an estimated dlrs 55 billion in bad
loans left behind after the 1994 peso devaluation and banking
crisis.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian space officials gave the first module of
the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it
into higher orbit, and convened a meeting on Earth to map out its
future.
	   Flight controllers fired one of the module's two maneuvering
engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in
space, the station's public affairs office said.
	   Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters
the maneuver was carried out ``with great accuracy,'' and the
24-ton core module was cruising through space without any problems.
	   The module, called Zarya, or Sunrise, lifted off Friday from the
Baikonur launchpad in Kazakstan into an initial orbit 200
kilometers (125 miles) above Earth.
	   Zarya is to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the
international project, providing propulsion, power and
communications. It will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous
with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched
Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
	   The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to
Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded by space
officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international
cooperation in space in the 21st century.
	   The heads of the space agencies of the United States, Russia,
Japan and Canada, along with the European Space Agency, met in
Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The space agency heads agreed on a schedule for future meetings
and on holding a scientific conference on the project somewhere in
Europe, at an unspecified date.
	   Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir
Lobachev, was quoted as saying that Russia would take the lead role
in managing the international space station during its first five
years.
	   Previously, space officials have said the station would be
jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space
agency NASA taking a lead role.
	   According to Interfax, Lobachev said it made sense for Russia to
control the project because the Russian-built Zarya and a
Russian-built service module would perform most of the life support
and navigational functions for the station's first five years.
	   ``Furthermore, Russian engineers are more experienced in this
job and NASA officials are aware of this,'' he said.
	   NASA spokesman James Hartsfield said Saturday that no change had
occurred in how the station will be managed. NASA maintains
oversight and approves all plans for the station, while Russian
flight controllers will direct real-time ISS operations based on
the approved plans.
	   ``They do real-time direction, but oversight of the program as a
whole rests with NASA. We're the lead partner,'' Hartsfield said.

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, Rhode Island (AP) _ Anthony Quinn is heading
off-off-off-Broadway for his next role.
	   Quinn will join local actors and several practicing lawyers in a
benefit performance, recreating the sensational 1833 murder trial
of the Rev. Ephraim Avery.
	   The Methodist minister was accused of hanging a young mill
worker to cover up his love affair with her. He was acquitted.
	   The Welsh actor, a three-time Academy Award winner, will portray
Samuel Eddy, chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court at the
time of the trial.
	   The sellout play, being staged Sunday, will raise money for
renovating the historic Bristol Courthouse and Statehouse, The
Providence Journal reported Friday.
	   Quinn owns a home in Bristol.

	   HERZLYIA, Israel (AP) _ Banned sprinter Ben Johnson warned high
school students not to run with the crowd when it comes to drugs.
	   ``As a kid, I didn't know much better. I kind of went with the
flow. If I had discipline it would not have happened,'' the
Canadian runner said Friday. ``Don't make the mistake I did.''
	   However, he suggested that he was singled out unfairly and that
Canada did not back him up when he was stripped of his gold medal
in the 1988 Olympics after testing positive for steroids. He was
banned from the sport for life in 1993 after failing another drug
test.
	   Johnson said ``all the top athletes'' used steroids 10 years ago
and many still do.
	   He wore a T-shirt with a picture of soccer star Diego Maradona,
who hasn't played since testing positive for a controlled substance
last year.
	   He said he trains 20 to 25 hours a week and hopes to compete in
the 2000 Olympics in Australia.
	   ``I can still run just as fast as before,'' said Johnson.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Have you ever dreamed of walking around on the arm
of a hunky leading man or a sleek supermodel?
	   Here's the next best thing _ a chance to walk around with a
watch that's been on the arm of a celebrity.
	   Seventy-five celebrities have donated watches for a New York
auction to raise money for charity, watch auctioneer Antiquorum
announced Friday.
	   All of the money raised from the Feb. 24 sale will go to
charities nominated by the donors, whose choices range from the
Children of Chernobyl Foundation to the Palm Beach School of Arts.
	   One watch comes from retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who
during the Gulf War wore two timepieces _ one set to Saudi Arabian
time and another to Eastern Standard Time.
	   Bidders can also buy Oprah Winfrey's cherished Breguet Marine
gold self-winding watch and Bob Hope's red, white and blue watch,
which the comedian wore on his Christmas tours.
	   ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Cher is refusing to discuss Sonny Bono's
reported dependence on painkillers at the time of his death.
	   ``I've always been forthright with the press. I've never shied
away from any questions. But this is a family matter not open for
discussion,'' Cher said of her late ex-husband in a statement
released Friday by publicist Jill Fritzo.
	   The congressman's widow, Mary Bono, said in an interview in TV
Guide, a weekly magazine, that Sonny Bono's secret battle with
prescription drugs contributed to his death in a January skiing
accident. Bono crashed into a tree in South Lake Tahoe, in
California.
	   Jean Bono, the late congressman's mother, disputed that notion.
	   ``The whole thing is a big lie,'' she said. ``He was not what
she's painting him out to be. He was a good man. He brought her up
to where she is and she's trashing him in return.''
	   Mary Bono succeeded her husband in congress and is now on the
committee considering whether to impeach President Bill Clinton for
lying about his affair with a White House Intern.
	   ___
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Boxing promoter Don King has
pledged millions of dollars for a gymnasium at Shaw University that
will bear his name.
	   At a convocation Friday, King was introduced by Willie Gary, the
Board of Trustees chairman who donated dlrs 200,000 toward building
the Don King Fitness Center.
	   Then King pledged the unspecified amount of money, saying: ``If
Willie Gary is going to pledge dlrs 200,000 for a building named
for me, I'm going to have to pledge some millions. This is a great
country. You've got to make it work. God bless you all.''
	   King was also given an honorary doctorate from the historically
black private college.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. inspectors paid an unannounced visit
to a suspected Iraqi weapons site on Saturday, the first such visit
since Baghdad blocked their work completely three weeks ago. The
official Iraqi News Agency said that a missile team ``made a
surprise visit to an establishment to check the monthly declaration
of its output.'' Meanwhile, in Seoul on Saturday, U.S. National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the United States believed Iraq
was obliged to hand over documents requested by UNSCOM chief
Richard Butler. Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi,
said Friday that many of the documents were destroyed, never
existed or had already been turned over. He placed conditions on

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered
Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most
prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing
was widely considered to be politically motivated. President Boris
Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the
investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was
gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her
apartment. Starovoitova, 52, was an outspoken deputy in the lower
house of parliament who inspired strong feelings from both her
friends and enemies. A leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic
Choice party, she was planning to run for president in 2000.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest tangle in the land-for-security
accord, Palestinians charged Saturday that Israel violated the
U.S.-brokered Mideast peace deal by releasing 150 common criminals
instead of detainees who fought Israeli occupation. The
Palestinians said they protested to the United States over ``a
violation of the accord'' since only 100 of the 250 prisoners
released on Friday were accused in the struggle against Israel.
Palestinian police continued on Saturday to move into the 9.1
percent of the West Bank they received a day earlier but the latest
disagreement threatened to jeopardize the release of 500 more
Palestinian prisoners. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Exactly six months after he took power
from former strongman Suharto, Indonesia's current head of state,
B.J. Habibie, launched a commission of inquiry on Saturday into
corruption allegations against his predecessor and one time mentor.
The probe into Suharto's wealth appears to be a major concession to
protesting students who have fought bloody street battles with the
military. The students have demanded that Suharto, 77, be tried for
illegally enriching himself and his family during his 32 years as
president of the Southeast Asian nation. (INDONESIA)
	   ROME (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel leader was freed in Rome on Saturday
amid a new barrage of protests from Turkey, which wants him handed
over as a terrorist. Abdullah Ocalan left the hospital where he'd
been in custody since his Nov. 12 arrival in Italy for a private
residence on Saturday morning. He told the thousands Kurds from
throughout Europe who came to Rome in his support to return home.
Ocalan was freed by a court decision a day earlier that rejected a
Turkish warrant for his arrest because Italian law forbids
extradition to countries where someone faces the death penalty. The
court said Ocalan had to stay in Rome, but that order could be
lifted next month. Turkey, which is trying him in absentia on
capital crimes, was outraged and warned Italy once again against
granting Ocalan political asylum. (ITALY-KURDS-TURKEY)

Dutch pop music gets a boost from the government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Pop music, with its flashy videos,
heartthrob singers and simple-but-catchy tunes, has an unlikely new
fan _ the Dutch government.
	   The government gives more than 2 million guilders (dlrs 1
million) a year in subsidies to the National Pop Institute in hopes
of pushing Dutch bands from near-obscurity onto center stage.
	   The institute in turn subsidizes venues who ``take the risk'' of
booking Dutch bands, distributes a free music magazine and archives
the history of the under-appreciated Dutch music scene.
	   Though the Dutch love pop music, they have traditionally
preferred British and American imports such as the Spice Girls and
Backstreet Boys. Pop homegrown in Holland made up only one-quarter
of the Netherlands' 1 billion guilders (dlrs 500 million) worth of
music sales last year.
	   But the country where ``artist'' is more often linked with
Rembrandt and Van Gogh than the likes of singers Ilse de Lange or
Marco Borsato is surprisingly pro-pop.
	   University students in Amsterdam can take classes in Abba and
Madonna, and video fans can watch both MTV and its popular Dutch
equivalent, The Music Factory channel.
	   ``We support all kinds of culture,'' said Annette Lubbers, a
spokeswoman for the Dutch Culture Ministry. ``We want to help
facilitate the creativity of artists.''
	   Last month, the ministry presented the pop institute _ housed in
a historic canal house painted in day-glo yellow, orange, green and
blue _ with a gift of a half-million guilders (dlrs 260,000) to
build a ``mediatheque.''
	   The mediatheque, a multimedia library of Dutch music and
memorabilia, will feature an electronic encyclopedia where pop fans
can access music and press clippings from the country's bands.
	   The government gift comes as Dutch bands get more attention at
home and abroad.
	   Anouk, whom critics have nicknamed the ``Dutch Alanis
Morissette,'' is the first Dutch artist to be nominated for an MTV
Europe music award with her first single, ``Nobody's Wife.'' She
recently promoted her own version of girl-power on a U.S. tour.
	   ``Dutch music used to be considered an inferior product,'' said
Gert Verbeek, head of the mediatheque. Now, radio stations play
more Dutch music and local music magazines are beginning to put
Dutch acts on their covers.
	   Most of the memorabilia in the collection he's been piecing
together since 1990 was donated when people moved or cleaned out
their attics. Journalists gave their old clippings of music
reviews. Bands sent demo tapes.
	   The '80s teen-dream band Doemar donated boxes of fan letters
from young girls pledging undying love. Attention from fans proved
too much for the group, and they disbanded.
	   ``They couldn't live with it,'' Verbeek said, picking through
the hundreds of envelopes decorated with hearts and flowers.
	   Nearby, toppling piles of ``Rolling Stone'' magazines and boxes
of concert T-shirts and cassette tapes give the place the feeling
of a music fan's garage sale.
	   Though some may scoff at the University of Amsterdam's new
``Madonna 101'' class, Verbeek thinks students can learn more than
lyrics and melodies from pop.
	   The genre, often criticized for being simple and unoriginal, can
offer insights into current society for students of sociology,
history and business.
	   ``Yes, it's mass-produced,'' Verbeek said. ``But what does that
stand for? Why does it appeal to so many people? People find their
identity with rock music. That's what makes it so interesting.''

Harold Evans: Born a Briton, telling the story of the American
</HEADLINE>
Century &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ He is married to a formidable woman _ Tina
Brown, esteemed editor emeritus of The New Yorker. But for more
than half his life, journalist and erstwhile Briton Harold Evans
has been embroiled in an unrepentant affair. The name of his
beloved: America.
	   For the past decade, he has been working, reading, absorbing,
compiling, researching. By his own count, he has digested 5,400
books on the topic. The result: ``The American Century,'' a
710-page tome of incisive text and unusual photos that tell a
nation's tale.
	   ``I want to acquaint people with their country,'' says Evans,
now editorial director of U.S. News and World Report and New York's
Daily News. ``America is imperiled the more it loses touch with its
own past. No society can be true to itself unless it knows where it
came from.''
	   To distill an entire century into a cogent, resonant book is a
difficult job, but Evans has pulled it off. His American century _
1889-1989, from the centennial of the U.S. Constitution to its
bicentennial _ is peopled with an appropriate mix of the famous and
the ordinary. It's easy to read _ one of his main concerns _
without ever being simplistic. Humor and playful language shine
through. And virtually every page is a self-contained article,
giving it an accessible, cataloglike feel.
	   Evans visited the United States in 1956 to do civil rights
reportage. He traveled the South and beyond _ 40 states in two
years, from Navajo and Cherokee households to Nevada ghost towns _
and was smitten by the land's openness, its people's willingness to
accommodate newcomers and, sometimes, new ideas. He found legend
and fact equally interesting.
	   He was planning to write a book on how much of the ``American
ideal'' remained.
	   ``I was captured by that romantic, she-wears-a-yellow-ribbon
kind of thing,'' he says. ``I fell in love with the idea of the
free America. One's imagination becomes influenced with these
people.''
	   They all called out to him, he said: New York Mayor Fiorello
LaGuardia, assassinated Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Louisiana
Governor Huey Long, Native American leader Sitting Bull, FBI
founder J. Edgar Hoover. And lesser-known names, too.
	   There was Ed Gumm, the Christian Scientist farmer from Illinois
who turned down dlrs 2,000 in subsidies because it would cause
others to be taxed. There was Jason Betzinez, an Apache and the
last of Geronimo's tribe, who rejected free tools from the
government because he wanted to make them on his own.
	   And the newspaper editor in Mississippi who satirized the
Citizen's Council and was firebombed. And the woman who stood up to
a bully trying to get people to vote Democratic in the 1956
election. And on and on and on.
	   ``They make up the tapestry,'' Evans says.
	   He was hooked. But he went home, and he became one of Britain's
most-respected journalists. Then, in 1984, he came back to teach at
Duke University and began to read voraciously about the American
past. His deep interest grew into this project.
	   ``The American Century'' was originally set for publication in
1989, on the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution, but it
kept getting more elaborate. ``The book got longer because I was
trying to make it deeper,'' Evans says.
	   Some of the images are amazing, the result of a vow by Evans and
photo editor Gail Buckland to use unusual pictures, not merely old
standbys. They scoured sources across the land and found thousands
of photos, choosing many that had never been printed.
	   In the Boston Public Library, Evans dredged up death masks cast
of Sacco and Vanzetti after their 1927 execution. Head-to-toe
arrest photos of John Erlichman, H.R. Haldeman, Charles Colson and
John Mitchell _ all indicted in the Watergate scandal that brought
down President Richard Nixon _ are memorable alone, unforgettable
when juxtaposed. And there's a wonderful, solemn picture of movie
star Jimmy Stewart, standing with 18 ``other less well-known young
men'' and being sworn in to the Army in 1941.
	   But what of now?
	   ``I don't think the American century has ended in terms of the
capacity of America to lead, although this is a bad moment,'' Evans
says. ``I think the country will come back. There's no problem that
can't be solved by the free exercise of the American people.''
	   In such a swirl of change, Evans sees certain things _ thoughts,
ideas, principles _ that have endured. His favorite,
egalitarianism, or at least the self-image of it, remains, he says,
``the consciousness of being as good as the next man and the
fleeting attempts to make a reality out of it.''
	   ``Me, who comes from England, we never heard that everybody is
as good as everybody else,'' Evans says. ``My father thought that
knowledge was something that had to be wrested from the upper
classes.''
	   Today a naturalized American, Evans marvels at the task he has
completed, not because it was so daunting, but because he can't
believe the material he gathered for so long has been distilled
into one volume. And as long as he touches a reader or two, he'll
be pleased.
	   ``To me, American history is so close, so vivid. They are all
there _ all these people. And when they coalesce, you get a
society,'' Evans says.
	   ``The lack of historical perspective is kind of alarming at the
moment. And the lack of historical knowledge, too,'' he says. ``If
I can get those ideas into the heads of young people, it will be
read. It'll be history through stories. American history won't be
just the Hawley-Smoot Tariff anymore.''

A man in full three-piece suit: Tom Wolfe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY338 &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY McSHANE &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It is impossible to imagine that this impeccably
dressed man, his collar high enough to infiltrate the Manhattan
skyline, his pale three-piece suit just so, that this man, this
dandy is the writer of a rap anthem, ``Ram Yo' Booty.''
	   Yet here he sits, the lyricist for Doctor Rammer Doc Doc. And he
is no one-trick pony: The man with the silk tie also provides
lyrics for ``Peel Yo' Cap'' by those country-metal favorites, Pus
Casserole.
	   Award-winning author Tom Wolfe _ the man who created both
fictional performers in the course of his latest work _ smiles when
asked about his musical foray.
	   ``I have not been given proper credit for this,'' says Wolfe,
resplendent in his trademark plumage. ``There have even been
reviews that said these were not good rap lyrics. That's
ridiculous, of course.
	   ``People have said that Pus Casserole is not a realistic name
for a musical group today,'' he continues evenly. ``I say, `Au
contraire.' It just happens to be a brilliant, putrid name, as
opposed to an uninspired, putrid name.''
	   The 68-year-old Wolfe is clearly having fun with his first
published novel in 11 years _ ``A Man in Full.'' It arrives after
several false starts, an assortment of discarded manuscripts and a
near-fatal heart attack for the acclaimed chronicler of our times.
	   The novel does for 1990s Atlanta what ``Bonfire of the
Vanities'' did for New York City of the 1980s: skewer its people
and pretensions from every angle _ from the mayor's office to the
wealthy to university students.
	   Throw in satiric shots at the art world and the fitness craze,
trophy wives described as ``boys with breasts,'' his rap and metal
parodies, a jewel-encrusted football hero named Fareek ``The
Cannon'' Fanon, and you've got a book in full _ another Wolfe
winner.
	   The book, long in the creating, was highly anticipated; first
printing was 1.2 million, and it was nominated for a National Book
Award a full month before its publication date.
	   Wolfe blames himself for the length between books.
	   ``It took me an awful long time to realize the obvious: This
book should be set in Atlanta,'' he explains over glasses of club
soda in his New York City home, a 12-room apartment with a
spectacular view of Central Park. ``I made that switch very late in
the game.''
	   That was in November 1995, after he submitted an unfinished
800-page manuscript to his editor _ one of the book's several
incarnations. Wolfe remembers saying, ``sort of wistfully,'' that
he sometimes wished he'd set the book in Atlanta.
	   ``Without skipping a beat, (the editor) replied, `Why don't
you?' That became my permission _ eight years after `Bonfire' _ to
turn this into an Atlanta book.''
	   The book represents a sort of return to roots for Wolfe, a
Richmond, Virginia, native. His family's ties in the southern
state, on the paternal side, date back to 1710. Wolfe attended
college at Washington and Lee University before going north line to
earn a doctorate in American studies from Yale University.
	   Wolfe made his name in the 1960s vanguard of New Journalism,
combining fiction-writing styles with his keen reporter's eye for
details. The technique served him extraordinarily well for ``The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,'' his look at Ken Kesey and the Merry
Pranksters, and ``The Right Stuff,'' his study of the space
program.
	   The latter won the American Book Award for general nonfiction,
while ``Bonfire'' _ one of the top 10 bestsellers of the 1980s _
was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.
	   His 1987 switch to novel writing led Wolfe to appropriate a new
term for his work.
	   ``I consider it, to steal a word from my favorite writer Zola,
`naturalism,''' Wolfe says. ``It's fictional, because none of these
things have never happened. But I do want the details to be
right.''
	   They are. In a tour-de-force ``Man in Full'' chapter called
``The Saddlebags,'' Wolfe details the relentless work of corporate
workout artiste Harry Zale on a debt-ridden Atlanta real estate
developer, Charlie Croker.
	   Croker enters the room a master of the universe, and leaves with
sweat rings so immense that they stretch from his underarms to meet
mid-sternum _ hence the saddlebags. Wolfe describes the scene this
way:
	   ``Croker looked as if his breath had been knocked out. He no
longer looked furious. He still stared at Harry, but his stare was
frozen and opaque. The Artiste! Oh yes, this was artistry! ...
(Croker was) sitting white and plump in his birthday suit, a
sinner, a debtor, a deadbeat minus his dignity, naked before an
unsparing dun.''
	   Wolfe inhaled the details during interviews with several of the
``artistes'' _ including one whose signature move was donning
skull-and-crossbones suspenders for each meeting.
	   Once Wolfe opted to move his book to Atlanta, a heart attack and
bypass surgery in August 1996 laid him low. Even then, Wolfe's
thirst for information was evident; he can now provide a fairly
detailed explanation of the bypass process.
	   Once healthy in June 1997, he quickly cranked out ``A Man in
Full,'' finishing this September. ``Which,'' he says,
``substantiates a statement I made a long time ago: All books are
written in six months. All the rest is dancing around.''
	   Criticism? Wolfe is mostly immune to it.
	   ``Some people disparagingly call me a journalist as novelist,''
he says. ``To me, that's a badge of honor. That's what it's all
about, getting out there and finding some keys to the
imagination.''
	   Wolfe, married for 20 years to his wife Sheila, has two
children: Alexandra, 18, and Tommy, 13. The kids' friends become
aware that he's home and working when they hear a sound totally
foreign to their ears: the tap-tap-tap of typewriter keys. Wolfe
continues to work exclusively on a 1966 Underwood. ``It's like a
1958 Thunderbird,'' he says.
	   ``My children's friends will come into the house and say,
`What's that noise?''' he relates gleefully. ``They've never heard
a typewriter. They don't know what it is.
	   ``I have to get with the program.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When French singer Charles Aznavour was 50, he
had a small birthday party. He decided he'd have another one when
he turned 100. Now 74 and his singing voice sounding vital and much
younger, he is almost half way to that next party.
	   Aznavour, who has just finished a four-week engagement on
Broadway, tours as a singer every year. His New York engagement was
to be followed by one in Los Angeles. He also writes his songs and
he acts, preferring television films because they're made quickly.
	   He has been in some 60 movies and likes switching between
singing and acting. ``I change the fatigue. I love it.
	   ``I do about three movies a year for TV. That's very easy
because it takes 23 days to make one TV movie. I find that very
comfortable,'' Aznavour says. ``I did the movie `The Adventurers'
in America years ago. It was seven months. I had to be there one
month and come back another eight days and so on. It was terrible.
I like to finish the thing.''
	   This time in America, he left out some listeners' favorites,
``Isobel,'' ``You Let Yourself Go'' and ``Happy Anniversary.'' He
sang ``She,'' ``The Old Fashioned Way'' and ``Yesterday When I Was
Young'' _ a U.S. hit for country singer Roy Clark.
	   ``Very often; I drop a song and don't sing it for a long, long
time. As I'm living long, I can take it back,'' he says.
	   When he composes, ``Something has happened or some news I read
in the paper gives me advices. The subject is what is happening
around me.'' Aznavour says, ``I'm not talking about love songs.
Them, you find the title and follow the title.''
	   He's thought of in the United States as specializing in love
songs. ``Yes, I know. In my show there is not so much love songs,
maybe four. I sing songs about love stories. I love to show that
things are as they are, even though some lines can shock people.''
In America, he sings some songs in English and some in French and
leaves any shocking words in French.
	   ``I write more than ever,'' Aznavour says. One current project
is a musical, aimed for Bournemouth, England, next season, then
Broadway, about painter Toulouse-Lautrec. Aznavour has almost
completed it, writing words and music.
	   The singer, who lives in Geneva, Switzerland, was born in Paris
of parents who had fled from Armenia in 1920. ``My grandfather had
a restaurant, then my father had a restaurant. He was a singer; my
mother was an actress,'' Aznavour says. ``It was difficult for
them, not knowing the language. They worked for the Armenian
community in Paris.
	   ``I started performing at 9, in the play `Carmen,' in French.
Until the age of 17 I was in theater.'' He also acted in movies as
a child and left school at 11. His name, Aznavourian, was declared
too long for a marquee by a theater manager so his mother shortened
instead of changing it.
	   After he started singing, he was half a cabaret duo, toured with
Edith Piaf and appeared in second-rate clubs. His first solo
success was in Casablanca, at age 32. He thinks his voice may have
had a texture similar to Muslim singers popular there. After the
Casablanca triumph, he was quickly hired to headline at the Moulin
Rouge and at the Olympia and Alhambra in Paris.
	   Although he had been performing without much success before
Casablanca, he wasn't surprised at making a hit there. ``Can you
imagine an artist being surprised because he is making success?''
Aznavour asks with a little indignation in his tone. ``I don't
think so.
	   ``I was much more surprised at what happened to me after that _
that it went really high. My dream was not as big as that. My dream
was to work every day, to have a name and not to have a day off.
Now I like day offs.''
	   Still, he works, writing songs on ``day offs.'' ``I believe that
writing is the best work somebody can do _ because you can do it at
home.
	   ``I started to write because I couldn't find the kind of song I
wanted to sing. Writers used to say, `You're not known. We can't
write a song for you.'
	   ``You're never better served than by yourself.''
	   Unlike America's Tony Bennett, who has been discovered by young
listeners in the '90s, Aznavour says, ``I always had the young
people.'' The reason, he says, is that young French performers have
liked him and their fans have followed suit.
	   After the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, the singer and his manager
set up a foundation, Aznavour for Armenia, which builds and
restores schools and builds retirement homes. He did two benefit
concerts and, with 89 artists, made a benefit recording.
	   Mainly, he says, ``I beg. It's easy because it isn't for myself.
The schools have used the same books for 75 years. We want to
change that. We gave electricity to the country two hours every day
when it was difficult. We've built surgeries and a factory of
artificial limbs.''
	   Aznavour feels totally French. ``Of course my heritage is
Armenian. I don't write and read in Armenian. I understand
everything but those who are there speak Armenian differently than
those who are living outside. I'm French.''
	   He has recorded 450 songs and written some he hasn't recorded.
Aznavour's latest album is ``Plus Bleu ...'' ``I'm not somebody who
spends much time in a studio. The maximum for me cutting an album
is three sessions _ nine hours.''
	   He sang ``You Make Me Feel So Young'' on Frank Sinatra's first
duet album. ``I received his tape and I changed the second part
because I harmonize very easily. In America, very often they sing
the same musical line. I like to harmonize.''
	   Aznavour looks so trim one expects to hear an account of
exercises. Instead: ``In summertime I swim a little bit. On stage,
I walk.''
	   ``The moment I have to pose it is finished,'' Aznavour tells the
photographer who has come to his suite at the French-owned Parker
Meridien Hotel. ``I have to be natural _ that's the only way to
have a picture with me. And no makeup. The moment I have makeup, I
look like a Chinese duck _ a Peking duck.''

Angeles &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK KENNEDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Edward Norton braces for The Question.
	   The actor knows it's only a matter of time before it pops up _
yet again _ in a discussion of his new film. And when it does, his
jaw hardens ever so slightly.
	   Who really made ``American History X''?
	   The question is unavoidable when dealing with a film that
generated one of the ugliest post-production struggles in recent
years, as the star dueled the director for final control.
	   The apparent loser, first-time director Tony Kaye, is so
embittered by the experience that he vows never again to speak to
New Line Cinema or Norton, whose name induces a flood of
expletives.
	   ``I provided him an ambiance and a stage and the freedom for him
to do his best work,'' says Kaye. ``And he repaid me by stabbing me
in the back a million times.''
	   Norton pauses before responding.
	   ``The best thing about making a film is that they're
collaborative,'' he says wearily. ``And the worst thing about
making them is that they're collaborative.''
	   In other words, welcome to the jungle _ Hollywood-style.
	   It began with a gritty, profane script: A reformed white Nazi
skinhead, freed from prison after murdering two black teen-agers,
tries to prevent his younger brother from following in his
destructive goose-steps.
	   ``The first time I ever read it, I put it down and said, 'That's
a tragedy,''' says Norton. ``In a classic, dramatic structural
sense, it's a drama with a prescriptive lesson. Here's a guy who
comes fully to understand what his flaw has been, and yet it's too
late to accept the consequences.''
	   Norton signed on. Thanks to a steady, protein-rich diet, he
gained 30 pounds (14 kilograms) of muscle, shaved his head, hung
out with skinheads and stuck an enormous black swastika over his
heart.
	   ``The big challenge of this for me was to introduce a character
who is nightmarishly awful, who is coming back at you in slow
motion and you're just going: 'That is the worst nightmare! That is
evil!''' says Norton.
	   ``By the end, though, I wanted the audience not to be able to
use the word evil because he's too completely humanized in a sad
way. I wanted people to feel pain _ emotional impact, maybe even
empathy _ over the fact that this character has fallen so hard.''
	   So far, so good. The film showcases Norton at his sociopathic
best, a performance that recalls his riveting debut as the angelic
teen-ager on trial for murder in 1996's ``Primal Fear.''
	   Norton beat out 2,000 other unknowns for the ``Primal Fear''
role after Leonardo DiCaprio turned it down, and won a Golden Globe
and an Academy Award nomination. Norton's unexpected flashes of
savagery impressed critics.
	   After that, Norton did a U-turn, playing _ and singing _ a goofy
role in Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You,'' tackling the
roles of an unimposing lawyer in ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and
a hard-core gambler in this fall's ``Rounders.''
	   Norton was soon seen as a breakthrough star, and touted as the
next Sean Penn or maybe even the future Dustin Hoffman. Directors
flooded his agent with scripts.
	   ``What lifts him into the stratosphere and creates those moments
that are just unforgettable on screen is the depth of his
concentration and intelligence,'' says producer John Morrissey.
``His focus is total.''
	   Norton, a Maryland-born, Yale University-educated preppie who
speaks fluent Japanese, spices up interviews with mouth-twisting
terms like ``realm of theatricality,'' ``hyperbolic'' and
``behavioral naturalism.'' But he's also painfully thoughtful and
reserved.
	   ``Look, I just feel that sharing intimate elements of my
personal life gets them trivialized and oversimplified,'' he says.
``I don't want everything of value in my life to become an
anecdote.''
	   That wouldn't be easy once he wrapped on his ``Uber-neo-Nazi.''
	   Controversy, of course, is often a marketing gold mine, and
``American History X'' has generated a mountain of buzz for a film
that cost only dlrs 10 million. It just wasn't the kind of buzz the
studio was expecting.
	   The trouble began after Kaye, 46, delivered his cut of the film
to New Line Cinema. Even though it reportedly scored well with
screening audiences, Kaye was unsatisfied.

	   He asked for _ and was granted _ time to make a second, shorter
cut. When it arrived, the studio thought it lacked the necessary
emotional punch and permitted Norton _ at age 29 and lacking any
directorial training _ to get his own crack at it in the editing
bay.
	   Kaye was incensed. He publicly renounced the re-edited version
in a campaign that included full-page ads in Daily Variety and the
Hollywood Reporter lampooning the studio and the star.
	   Relenting, New Line permitted Kaye a number of weeks to come up
with an acceptable version of his film. When the deadline elapsed,
however, Kaye showed up empty-handed.
	   New Line, tired of waiting and having already missed several
delivery dates, decided to release the so-called ``Norton cut.''
Kaye demanded that his name be removed from the final product. The
studio declined.
	   Kaye, an award-winning advertising director, says the ``crippled
version'' of his film is a ``huge embarrassment.'' He holds Norton
mainly responsible.
	   ``This guy basically destroyed my opportunity of debuting with a
pretty ... good film, which is quite rare,'' says Kaye. ``I don't
know if he did it knowingly or if he really is a fool. He reduced
it into a performance. That's really all that's left.''
	   Norton, who insists his version of the film changed Kaye's
original vision by ``no more than 5 percent,'' says he's more
shocked that the studio indulged the director for so long.
	   ``He has whipped up an imagined chasm in his mind that's way
beyond what's really there,'' Norton says of Kaye. ``I think that's
a function of him having a letting-go anxiety.''

Hey Bruce! It's your aunt! You made the Hall of Fame!
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY McSHANE &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When The Boss received word of his induction
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it came from an unlikely
source.
	   ``I think my aunt told me,'' a laughing Bruce Springsteen said
in an interview three days after word of the honor became public.
``She's 80 years old. She goes on the Internet. That's how I found
out.''
	   The announcement came Nov. 10 _ the same day that Springsteen
released the four-CD, 66-song boxed set ``Tracks.'' The amazing
assembly of unreleased material and B-sides makes an eloquent
argument for Springsteen's inclusion.
	   The set opens with Springsteen's first Columbia Records
recordings, acoustic versions of four songs off his debut
``Greetings From Asbury Park.'' It winds through the years with the
E Street Band, stretches into his solo work in the late 1980s and
'90s and ends with a song recorded just three months ago.
	   It also makes one thing clear: Springsteen's rejects are a lot
better than most everybody else's keepers.
	   ``Goin' in, I knew it would be quite a job, 'cause I knew there
was a lot of material,'' Springsteen said. ``It wound up being a
lot easier than I thought.''
	   Typically, Springsteen started the project several years ago.
	   ``I think it might have been before (1995's) `Ghost of Tom
Joad,' I decided, `I think I'm going to listen to everything I've
ever done,'' he said with a chuckle. ``So the engineer sent me a
big box of tapes, and I spent a week or more going through 'em.''
	   But then he released an album, and did his first solo acoustic
tour. And the tapes were still waiting when he returned home.
	   The first cut winnowed the 25 years worth of recordings into a
more manageable 130 songs. Springsteen was surprised by how
complete _ and how entertaining _ most of the recordings were.
	   ``I'd left off a lot of the stuff that was the most fun _ must
be my Catholic upbringing,'' he joked. ``One after another, rocking
party songs, bar band numbers ... I was having a lot of fun
listening.''
	   The material runs the gamut from the 8-minute extravaganza
``Thundercrack,'' from 1973's sessions for ``The Wild, The Innocent
and the E Street Shuffle,'' to a string of three- and four-minute
late '70s/early '80s gems: rhythm and blues tunes like ``Give the
Girl a Kiss'' and ``So Young and in Love,'' rockers like ``Loose
Ends'' and ``Rendezvouz.''
	   ``Put that together, and there's a missing album,'' Springsteen
said. ``It could have come out a year after `The River,' if I was
less neurotic.''
	   Springsteen remains one of the most bootlegged artists in rock _
a 20-CD collection dubbed ``The Lost Masters'' circulated in recent
years. But he says those illegal releases had nothing to do with
his decision to open the vaults.
	   ``Not at all,'' he replied quickly to the question. Why, then?
``There's always a guy at the show with a piece of cardboard,
waving it around, with some obscure song written on it,'' said
Springsteen.
	   This collection, it seems, is for that guy. And for fans
interested in hearing the E Street Band develop into one of rock's
great groups, and listening to Springsteen hone his songwriting.
	   Springsteen is somewhat bemused by comments about his prolific
writing.
	   ```Born in the USA,' I remember at night I sat at home ... and I
spent a year searching for music,'' he recalls. ``That state of
mind, struggling to get enough songs, you don't find the other
songs sitting there.
	   ``Sometimes it's just overthinking.''
	   Springsteen would plead guilty to that charge. While
contemporaries like Neil Young or John Mellencamp have steadily
produced albums, Springsteen has remained content to put out music
about every three years or so. In the '90s, he's released just
three albums _ two of them simultaneously.
	   Which doesn't mean he didn't have the material. While
Springsteen was ``struggling'' for songs in the early '80s, he
recorded the gorgeous ``Wages of Sin,'' the catchy ``Rockaway the
Days,'' the hilarious ``TV Movie'' and the epic ``Frankie,'' among
others.
	   None were ever released; all appear on the box set.
	   ``My ideas about what constitutes an album have always been
pretty strict,'' Springsteen said. ``First, you're asking people
for the most valuable thing they have: Time.
	   ``When they sit down and put on my album, I want it to deliver
on different levels. I wanted it to be entertaining, exciting. And
when you listened to the whole thing, it added up to more than the
sum of its parts.''
	   That concept led to the wild sprawl of ``Born to Run,'' the
moody edge of ``Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' the sad tales of
``The Ghost of Tom Joad.'' It also led to hundreds of outtakes that
didn't quite fit an album's mood.
	   ```Give the Girl a Kiss' and `So Young and in Love' are great,
but they didn't quite fit into `Darkness,'' Springsteen said,
laughing at a suggestion that they could have followed the dour
``Factory.'' (``I'll have to try that,'' he cracked.)
	   The fourth CD, Springsteen's most recent work, contains a series
of mid-tempo tunes, most of them from an early '90s experiment
where the Freehold, New Jersey, native was writing songs on his
bass. It's not a sign that Springsteen has given up on rock 'n'
roll.
	   ``Part of putting this set together was a way I felt like
reconnecting myself to singing loud and playing loud,'' Springsteen
said. ``That's a central part of my work since I started.''
	   Playing loud? Singing loud? Does this mean ... the return of the
E Street Band, an event that fans would find only slightly less
exciting than hitting the lottery?
	   ``Wait a minute, I'll dodge that one as best I can,''
Springsteen said, laughing again. ``I don't have any concrete
touring plans. As I've talked to the guys over the years, it's
always a subtext in our conversations.
	   ``I'd love to do it at some point, but we'll see what happens.''

and out in the 1930s and '40s with songs praising labor unions,
Jesus Christ and Pretty Boy Floyd.
	   On every wall, Guthrie's earnest yet slightly puckish
countenance stares down from posters and photos. True to his
spirit, you don't need any ``do re mi'' to visit _ the archive is
available by appointment for free.
	   ``A lot of young guys show up with their guitars,'' said
archivist George Arevalo. ``They're interested in mining the song
lyrics for inspiration.
	   ``We get writers, researchers, journalists and students doing
dissertations. We had one young guy come up who was writing a book
on famous dishwashers. And wouldn't you know, Woody was once a
dishwasher?''
	   Guthrie was plenty more: social crusader, essayist, painter,
environmentalist, recording artist and influence to a generation of
folk-rock artists from Dylan to Bruce Springsteen and more.
	   Born in Okemah, Oklahoma, in 1912, he traveled the country
during the Depression, playing a guitar that had the slogan ``This
machine kills fascists'' pasted onto it.
	   The songs he wrote and sang with his reedy tenor, including ``Do
Re Mi,'' ``Dust Bowl Blues'' and ``Union Maid,'' were a testament
to the suffering he witnessed among the poor and the powerless.
These and other recordings of Guthrie performing solo and with
contemporaries like Pete Seeger and The Weavers are part of the
archive and can be sampled.
	   And the quick-tempo singing, guitar strumming and harmonica
playing is a technique Guthrie pioneered, Arevalo said.
	   Joe Klein, author of ``Woody Guthrie: A Life,'' called Guthrie
the patron saint of teen-age rebelliousness.
	   ``There's always someone who's sick of the way things are in
town who hops a train and heads West,'' he said. ``That is a very
classically American image. He and Leadbelly together are the
fathers of rock 'n' roll and gangster rap.''
	   The bulk of the Guthrie archives came from the singer's business
manager, Harold Leventhal, who was given numerous boxes of
Guthrie's doodlings, musings and unpublished lyrics by the second
of Guthrie's three wives (Marjorie) in 1961. The boxes sat in
Leventhal's office _ where the archive is now organized _ until the
early 1990s.
	   Starting with a dlrs 100,000 donation from recording artists and
companies, Leventhal and Guthrie's daughter, Nora, hired Arevalo.
With their assistant, Amy Danelian, they began organizing and
restoring the works. The archive opened in April.
	   Among the most requested items for viewing is a framed sheet of
paper with the original handwritten lyrics to Guthrie's most famous
song, ``This Land Is Your Land.'' It shows the original title and
chorus, ``God Blessed America.'' The title and some lyrics were
crossed out and reworked, and the piece is signed ``Woody G., Feb.
23, 1940.''
	   For Nora Guthrie, who was 17 when her father died, organizing
the archives allowed her to get to know her father, who had been
ill all her life.
	   ``You know how you never think your parents are really
interesting?'' she asked with a laugh. ``I knew he was famous and
people liked his songs. But my first impression when going through
the archives was that this guy had something, especially in his
thoughts about women. For a long time he had mostly been a 'guy'
thing.''
	   She was particularly touched by a then unpublished poem, ``I Say
to You Woman and Man,'' which her father wrote when the family
lived in the New York borough of Brooklyn in the mid-1940s, before
Ms. Guthrie was born.
	   Ms. Guthrie said, ``In it he basically tells the woman that she
has a lot of power and a lot of juice and lot of beauty and that
she should go out there and go for it. He says go dance, your life,
your politics, your music, your voice.''
	   The archive is rich with personal glimpses of her father.
	   Some 600 of his art works, done in marker and watercolor on
everything from construction paper to paper towels, can also be
viewed. They are so fragile that Arevalo wears white, cotton gloves
to handle them.
	   Several are serious studies of the human form; others are bawdy
cartoons of the same. Still others are loving portraits, such as
the pencil sketch of his oldest daughter drawn in the Guthrie home
in Coney Island. ``Cathy's Got the Mumps'' was dated 1946, the year
the little girl died in a fire.
	   The tragedy was one of many in Guthrie's life. His sister also
died in a fire; a son died in a car accident; his mother succumbed
to Huntington's disease, a genetic neurological disorder that took
15 years to kill Guthrie and later, two of his eight children.
	   And in the 1950s Guthrie was blacklisted, which prompted a
typically glib response: ``I ain't a Communist necessarily, but I
been in the red all my life.''
	   The archive's photos of him in the last days of his life are
haunting. A woman lights a cigarette for the vacant-eyed Guthrie,
while his teen-age son, Arlo, now a renowned folk singer, watches,
looking bewildered.
	   Arevalo said that many private collectors and auction houses
have approached Ms. Guthrie hoping to buy portions of the archive,
but were rebuffed. The archive is a national treasure and should be
preserved as such, he said.
	   In conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution, the archivists
are putting together a Guthrie traveling exhibit to open in
Sacramento, California, in March. It's part of a fund-raising
effort to expand and preserve the archive.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Thousands of Albanians and foreigners
prepared to fan out across the country to monitor a tense
referendum that could give this impoverished nation its first
post-communist constitution.
	   Albania's government readied helicopters to fly ballot boxes to
and from remote regions on Sunday while police maintained a full
alert nationwide to prevent violence during voting which starts at
07:00 local time (0600 GMT) and ends at 6 p.m.(1700 GMT).
	   ``We are hoping for a vote without incident,but are prepared for
any possible violence,'' said a senior official from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who requested
anonymity.
	   Albanian police are accompanying the 88 groups of foreign
monitors who will watch for violence and voting irregularities at
polling booths ranging from Albania's southern border with Greece
to the border with Yugoslavia in the north.
	   The Sunday vote follows a calm Saturday after opposition leaders
called off a planned protest in downtown Tirana where they promised
to gather 50,000 people to oppose the proposed constitution.
	   On Saturday, opposition leader Sali Berisha canceled the rally
but reiterated calls to boycott the vote on the proposed
referendum, drafted by the government after a year of consultation
with Western legal experts.
	   The draft Constitution outlines private property rights and
gives Albanians the right to legally change their religion and
identify themselves as a member of an ethnic minority.
	   Berisha's Democratic Party said these clauses are
``anti-Albanian'' and will encourage citizens to turn away from
Islam, the national religion, hoping to emigrate to richer,
non-Muslim European countries.
	   ``I call on all Albanians to boycott the referendum in the name
of the nation, liberty and democracy,'' said Berisha, waving a
draft copy and raising his gravelly voice in an emotionally charged
news conference Saturday afternoon. He didn't say why he canceled
the rally.
	   Western officials fear opposition members, particularly in
remote, lawless towns will intimidate residents into staying away
from the nation's 2,700 polling booths.
	   Observers say the opposition will claim all abstentions as their
supporters even though at least 300,000 of the 1.9 million eligible
voters live abroad, with no access to polling stations.

Raymond Benson turns from 007 fan club to 007 author

	   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) _ A waitress in a loud and lively Tex-Mex
restaurant makes eye contact with the roguish figure shrouded in
shadow and cigarette smoke, sitting alone at a table in the corner.
	   ``What ... what would you like to drink, sir?'' she says,
fumbling over her words as she stares into his eyes for more than
an appropriate moment.
	   The man leans forward, smiles briefly and says in an
unmistakably stiff, British accent, ``Iced Tea. Shaken, not
stirred.''
	   Bond. James Bond. In Texas?
	   Such a fiction doesn't seem so funny to Raymond Benson, the
latest writer to take over the chore of crafting the 007 capers,
continuing the work started by the late Ian Fleming, whose estate
owns the character.
	   Benson's third stab at writing the James Bond books, ``The Facts
of Death,'' brings the suave, clever hero to the Lone Star State
for the first time while on the trail of chemical terrorists. The
book, released in the summer, takes Bond to Bastrop and Austin and
to dinner at Chuy's, a Tex-Mex restaurant.
	   Benson, who has had an insatiable passion for Bond since he was
a boy growing up in Odessa, Texas, said his Bond will remind people
why they fell in love with the smug, dapper agent in the first
place. He's taking Bond back to his womanizing, cigarette-smoking,
hard-drinking, cold-blooded roots.
	   ``Bond is not a nice guy,'' Benson said during an interview from
his home in Chicago. ``Bond is a killer. The politically correct
treatment he started to get in the 1980s was the culmination of
both films and books, especially with the advent of AIDS. He became
a kinder, gentler Bond.''
	   Ironically, the passive Bond is similar to the real-life Benson,
who is married, doesn't smoke, and says he would never own a gun.
	   ``The stories really get interesting when you explore what must
be going on in Bond's mind,'' Benson said. ``He is an anti-hero. He
has flaws you don't like but you can't help but like him. He's
cool. ... He's good looking, he's charming, he's tough _ he's the
epitome of masculinity.''
	   Fans have raved about Benson's treatment of Bond.
	   ``I'm not sure if they'll ever make these books into movies but
they certainly should,'' said Will Samms, president of ``007 Fan
Club,'' one of the largest group of Bond followers.
	   ``Benson gets into the nitty-gritty stuff, but also deals with
the psychology behind Bond. He's written stories that, in my
opinion, leave the recent movies in the dust. The action is just as
good as the movie, but has a much more realistic feel,'' said
Samms.
	   Benson's Bond work has also received critical acclaim.
	   The Boston Sunday Herald said in a review that Benson's Bond
``may never win a Pulitzer, but is as irresistible as ever.''
Kirkus Reviews said the book was ``a postmodern treat for fans and
newcomers that lovingly, if not ironically, duplicates a formula so
familiar that originality would be sacrilege.''
	   The 43-year-old Benson took an unlikely path toward becoming the
premier Bond author. After graduating from the University of Texas
with a theater degree in the late 1970s, he directed plays at the
Ally Theater in Houston and in New York City. While directing, he
saw a James Bond novel in a storefront window and decided it would
be fun to compile a book of Bond lore.
	   ``A friend of mine who was a writer pitched the idea to her
publisher and he liked it,'' Benson said. ``A lot of this was good
fortune.''
	   And thus ``The James Bond Bedside Companion,'' an anthology of
Bond books, movies, quotes and trivia, was born.
	   The book captured the attention of the Fleming estate, which
owns the character that Ian Fleming created, and established Benson
as an expert on Bond. That led the estate to ask him in 1995 to
consider writing Bond books when author John Gardner decided to
call it quits.
	   ``When I got back up off the floor, I said, `Sure,''' Benson
said.
	   Since then, he has written ``Zero Minus Ten'' and a novelization
of the movie ``Tomorrow Never Dies,'' both published last year.
	   Benson, who said he will always have a special place in his
heart for his home state, was happy to bring Bond to Texas for an
adventure.
	   ``I was able to do it within the confines of a good story, and
for once, I didn't have to do much research,'' he said.
	   Benson is only the fourth author _ and first American _ to write
authorized Bond novels.

David Kelly zooms to stardom in an Irish sleeper

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ David Kelly walks into Dublin's poshest
hotel so nattily dressed that it's hard to imagine the same actor
now being celebrated on screen for a fleeting appearance in the
buff.
	   We're not talking ``The Full Monty,'' even if ``Waking Ned
Devine'' may well be this year's sleeper equivalent of last year's
most, er, revealing Oscar nominee.
	   Instead, the scene under discussion finds the elfin, 69-year-old
Kelly speeding off naked on a motorbike _ just one of the many
misadventures suffered by his character, Michael O'Sullivan, in a
moment that has been described as ``the full Honda.''
	   ``I was cold and frightened and scared,'' Kelly recalls, on this
particular autumn day in his native Dublin looking anything but.
``By the time it came to my Steve McQueen setpiece with my clothes
off and the cold, I didn't give a damn who saw what.''
	   First-time writer-director Kirk Jones' film casts Kelly as
cohort to best mate Jackie O'Shea (played by Ian Bannen) in a ruse
to spread proceeds of a winning lottery ticket equably across the
citizenry of a snoozy Irish town, population 52.
	   The hitch? Michael must pretend to be winning villager Ned
Devine, who had the bad luck to die before claiming loot totalling
seven million Irish pounds (dlrs 10.3 million).
	   It doesn't help that Michael is as essentially honest as pal
Jackie is prone to a scam, and Jackie's wife Annie (Fionnula
Flanagan) isn't the only one to wonder whether honor and decency
ought to come before profit.
	   ``Basically, it's not about money,'' Kelly said of ``Waking Ned
Devine,'' settling into a sofa _ and a pack of cigarettes _ at the
Merrion Hotel in his native Dublin. ``It's about friendship, about
love.''
	   The movie, he said, walks ``a thin line that for my money works
very well. It's not just the avarice thing, which would have been
unacceptable or unpleasant, nor the fact that we're two cheeky
crooks.''
	   Instead, Kelly views them as ``big kids on a vast adventure.
That's really what does it _ the fact that the movie is about this
wonderful adventure.''
	   The ``adventure'' within the film has been paralleled by its
success ever since ``Waking Ned Devine'' stormed the Cannes
festival in May, where Fox Searchlight paid more than dlrs 4
million to snap it up.
	   ``As soon as the film ended, everyone was at the back of the
cinema within five minutes wanting to buy it,'' said Kelly, who got
swept up in the media circus.
	   ``I was interviewed by Lebanese TV, for God's sake. It was
non-stop. One guy said, `You have made my week at Cannes.
Otherwise, it's been rape and pillage and monsters.' I thought,
`Jesus, this is what it's all about.'''
	   Not that he or anyone else anticipated such a reaction during
the five-week shoot last year on the Isle of Man, where a working
fishing village stood in (for reasons of economy) for the fictional
Irish town of Tully More.
	   The actor deflected praise to his young novice director, Jones.
	   ``People call Kirk a first-time director, which gives the
impression that he's a beginner, and he's no beginner. He has made
some of the best commercials around, so Kirk knows the meaning of a
look or a second. There's absolutely no wadding at all,'' Kelly
said.
	   The result has thrown Kelly into the international spotlight
after decades making a household name for himself at home on stage
in plays by Brian Friel (``Give Me Your Answer, Do!'') and Beckett
(``Waiting For Godot,'' ``Krapp's Last Tape''), as well as a
popular Irish sitcom, ``Upwardly Mobile,'' now in its fourth year.
	   Much of his career has been spent acting opposite his wife of 37
years, Laurie Morton, as well as ``constantly to-ing and fro-ing''
between stage and television work in Dublin and London. (The couple
have two children, one of whom, Miriam, is an actress.)
	   Movies have beckoned less often, though any film set _ no matter
how dispiriting _ would seem to be grist for Kelly's story-telling
mill.
	   On Roman Polanski's notorious 1986 flop ``Pirates,'' for
instance, Kelly got to wear handmade shoes from Rome and stand
around a lot.
	   ``I spent five months in Tunisia and a month in the Seychelles
for a five-minute shot that wasn't used, and I was on the wrong
island anyway,'' he said.
	   Things went better on ``A Man of No Importance'' and ``Run of
the Country,'' both with Albert Finney, except that neither film
was barely even seen.
	   Next up is a guest stint in ``Ordinary Decent Criminal,'' the
Kevin Spacey gangster film now shooting in Dublin. ``A couple of
scenes with Kevin Spacey, I thought, `Why not?''' Kelly said.
	   Whatever the role, it will have to make use of the actor's
fine-boned physique and almost foppish charm.
	   ``I shot up to eight-and-a-half stone'' _ 116 pounds (52.5
kilos) _ ``during `Waking Ned Devine,' and that was it,'' he said.
``I eat very well, but I just can't put on weight, though actually
I don't mind because it's good for business.''

Cartoon Town becomes boom town as animated films flood the market
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ How do you market Moses?
	   For the animated biblical epic ``The Prince of Egypt,''
DreamWorks has shunned the usual movie merchandising tie-ins. That
means no Holy Happy Meals, no action figures leading the Israelites
to the Promised Land.
	   ``But I've still got to sell the movie. I've still got to get
people in,'' says DreamWorks marketing director Terry Press.
	   Thus was born ``The Prince of Egypt'' gift pack _ commercial but
not tacky _ containing a CD of songs ``inspired'' by the movie, a
storybook, even tickets to the film.
	   DreamWorks is marketing movies differently because it's making
them differently. And team Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen isn't alone.
	   Cartoon Town is a boom town these days, with more movies and
more selection. Three films hit theaters in the next few weeks
alone _ ``The Rugrats Movie'' (this weekend), ``A Bug's Life''
(next week) and ``The Prince of Egypt'' (Dec. 18) _ and at least 15
are on tap through the end of 2000.
	   Credit a combination of unrelated moves whose common aim is to
get some of that Disney action _ one every seven weeks, on average.
	   Disney, which pioneered the medium with such classics as ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' ``Cinderella'' and ``Sleeping
Beauty,'' still dominates the industry. And the appealing and
technically innovative ``A Bug's Life'' proves the Mouse House
still has a feel for family-friendly fare.
	   But despite a decade or so of attempts by others to carve a
niche in the animation market, rival studios believe it remains
under-exploited. They say the appetite for films that break the
Disney mold is obvious, given the success of the more sophisticated
``Antz,'' a DreamWorks film that has grossed dlrs 81.1 million to
make it one of the biggest non-Disney animated features.
	   That has led not only to an increase in films but to changes in
stories, music and animation art.
	   ``The shackles have come off of animation ... in the perception
of the audience and the studios, as a one-genre medium,'' said 20th
Century Fox animation president Chris Meledandri.
	   The animation renaissance actually began almost 20 years ago
when Don Bluth led a dozen young animators from Disney, which had
entered a low production period, to set up his own animation shop
and make his first feature, ``The Secret of NIMH.'' It flopped. But
his ``An American Tail'' in 1986 earned almost dlrs 47 million and
``The Land Before Time'' also did well.
	   Disney's new production team of Michael Eisner and Jeffrey
Katzenberg ushered in a new era in the 1980s with ``The Great Mouse
Detective,'' ``Oliver and Company,'' ``The Little Mermaid'' and
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a co-production with Steven Spielberg.
	   With the huge success of ``The Little Mermaid,'' which married
smart merchandising, good music and animation excellence, Disney
production soared, culminating in ``The Lion King'' in 1994 and
``Toy Story'' in 1995. ``Toy Story'' also showed effective use of
computer animation.
	   But as animation changes so must the sales efforts. And so do
the risks, as Warner Bros. realized this year with a disappointing
dlrs 22.4 million gross for its ``The Quest for Camelot.'' With
more diverse animated films, studios now are putting their cartoons
squarely up against the live-action movies, increasing the pressure
to deliver.
	   The creation of upstart DreamWorks has had as much impact as any
other studio on the changing face of animation.
	   DreamWorks partner Jeffrey Katzenberg has emphasized that
animation is a style of movie-making, not a limitation upon it.
	   For the ``Antz'' follow-up, DreamWorks offers another PG-rated
film in ``The Prince of Egypt,'' with a subject matter so sensitive
the traditional animation marketing practices had to be scrapped in
favor of the gift pack promotion.
	   Next year, DreamWorks releases ``El Dorado,'' a Western about
two scoundrels, with songs by Elton John.
	   At 20th Century Fox, animators are also eyeing the older
audience after playing it safe.
	   Its new Arizona-based, in-house animation operation debuted with
the very Disney-esque ``Anastasia,'' a musical that grossed a
respectable dlrs 56.5 million last year and has done well on video.
Next up is the sci-fi adventure ``Planet Ice,'' in 2000, a
nonmusical, action-suspense film geared more toward teens and
adults.
	   Paramount is going for a little bit of every audience as parent
company Viacom taps its Nickelodeon and MTV networks for feature
film material. The exploitation of Viacom's TV-to-film pipeline has
rivaled DreamWorks' efforts in shaping the animation business.
	   It was Paramount that took two offensive animated kids named
Beavis and Butt-head and made them into movie stars, and it now
hopes to do the same for the diapered characters of the G-rated
``The Rugrats Movie.''
	   A ``Rugrats'' sequel is already in the works, with producers
using the same cost-cutting strategy of farming out the drudge work
to cheap animation studios overseas.
	   Next year, the studio will release the ``Beavis and Butt-head''
sequel for older audiences and bring the foul-mouthed kids from
``South Park'' to the big screen in what could be a rare R-rated
animated feature.

	   At Warner Bros., the studio is dusting itself off from the
``Camelot'' setback and insists it's still committed to animated
features, with its next effort, ``The King and I,'' out next year
followed by the science fiction-based ``Iron Giant.'' Warners
seriously dented Disney's animation monopoly with its impressive
dlrs 48.5 million two-week take in 1996 for ``Space Jam,'' which
combined live action with animation.
	   Then there's Disney, which is obviously not going away. ``We are
at any cost committed to animation. It is the soul and heart of our
company,'' Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co., said in a
recent interview.
	   Disney's marketing prowess is the best in Hollywood, bolstered
by the theme parks, studio stores, ABC broadcast network and video
operations. And its ambitious slate of three features in 1999
appears promising, including ``Tarzan,'' ``Toy Story II'' and
``Fantasia 2000.''
	   Still, other studios believe that there's plenty of room for
everybody.
	   Albie Hecht, head of Nickelodeon movies and an executive
producer on ``The Rugrats Movie,'' said that bucking the Disney
style is ``just good business sense.''
	   ``We don't think you have to make them like that,'' he said.
``We're not into a house style. We're not the animation studio that
will create this giant animation operation, with big overhead, that
cranks out features that look the same.''
	   In ``Rugrats,'' the Hollywood animation house Klasky Csupo
satirizes yuppie life with a hip soundtrack that includes No Doubt,
Elvis Costello and Busta Rymes. Of the film's ankle-high view of
the world and abstractly drawn characters, studio co-founder Arlene
Klasky says: ``I couldn't draw like Disney if I wanted to.''
	   Disney remains the animation leader, with lush and lavish
landscapes and figures, and live, brilliant colors. Unlike some
studios, it does not send its animation work abroad to save money.
At its Animation Building in Burbank, it has combined computerized
and traditional animation in such films as ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' and has used computer animation alone in ``Toy Story'' and
``A Bug's Life,'' raising the technique to an art form in itself.
	   Only Bluth has come close to the Disney animation richness with
``An American Tail,'' ``The Land Before Time'' and ``Thumbelina.''
Still, DreamWorks believes that ``The Prince of Egypt'' will set a
new standard for animation beauty, while other rivals, like the
scrappy ``Rugrats'' gang, go for completely different styles,
which, though not as lush as Disney, establish their own animation
imprint.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A congressional
mediation group rejected criticism of current peace talks by
leftist rebels. One legislator said Saturday the guerrillas weren't
interested in negotiating seriously.
	   The complaints by largely Indian Zapatista rebels about a lack
of logistical and security preparation for the talks threatens to
mar the first peace talks in almost two years aimed at solving the
conflict in southern Chiapas state.
	   ``The current Zapatista leadership doesn't even want to permit
dialogue, and thus they don't want democracy, they don't want
peace, they don't want anything,'' said Sen. Carlos Payan Velver of
the left-center Democratic Revolution Party.
	   The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in January 1994 to
demand greater democracy and Indian rights and have refused to meet
with government negotiators since 1996. However, they agreed to
meet Friday with the congressional mediation commission _ which
they view as a more objective body _ for talks scheduled to last
through Sunday.
	   Those talks were delayed for several hours Friday after an army
patrol stopped International Red Cross vehicles carrying rebel
delegates to this central Chiapas city for the talks. The
government had previously pledged not to interfere with the rebel
delegation.
	   On Saturday, a group of unarmed female police officers were
dispatched to provide a security cordon for the convention center
where the talks are being held.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ After a delay apparently caused by
political rivalry, the first teams of Cuban doctors arrived in
Nicaragua on Saturday to help treat victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Twenty-two Cuban doctors are being dispatched to the hard-hit
northern provinces of Chinandega, Nueva Segovia and Esteli to help
control and prevent the spread of disease.
	   The government of President Arnoldo Aleman announced Friday it
would accept health teams from Cuba after initially rejecting the
offer.
	   Cuba was a strong ally of Nicaragua's Sandinista government of
the 1980s, which Aleman had opposed and which had imprisoned him.
	   The rejection of the Cuban doctors was sharply criticized by
Nicaraguans. Some people noted the staunchly anti-communist Somoza
regime permitted Cuban doctors to help after a 1972 earthquake
struck Managua, killing 10,000 people.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Rio de Janeiro commuters may soon
get a way to avoid the city's busy roads and inefficient rail
service: going to work by sea.
	   Brazilian Transport Minister Eliseu Padilha is backing the
introduction of a hovercraft service along Rio's coast.
	   ``This is a very simple project, easy to set up at a reasonable
cost,'' he was quoted as saying in the O Jornal do Brasil newspaper
Saturday.
	   Padilha urged Rio city authorities to work on the idea. A plan
to link seven neighborhoods along about 20 miles (30 kilometers) of
Rio's coast to the city center with a hovercraft service was drawn
up in 1995 but did not progress.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Fearing illegal enrichment charges, relatives
and business associates of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari filed legal appeals to protect themselves against
arrest, local media reported Saturday.
	   Carlos Salinas' sister, Adriana Salinas, was told she must post
a dlrs 4.2 million bond if she wants protection from warrants, the
reports said.
	   Her other brother, Raul Salinas, is imprisoned and standing
trial for illegal enrichment. He is accused of unlawfully
appropriating the same amount as his sister's bond. He was arrested
in 1995, shortly after his brother left office.
	   Adriana Salinas' accountant and his daughter were also told to
post bond. An appeal was denied to another Salinas brother, Sergio,
and lower bond payments were set for Raul Salinas' wife and other
associates.
	   Mexican law allows citizens to seek a court's protection even
before formal charges are filed against them.

Davies falters but still leads by two
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ England's Laura Davies, stumbling for the first
time on the par 5s, went 18 holes without a birdie in a 3-over-par
75 Saturday but still managed to hold a two-shot lead in the third
round of the American LPGA Tour Championship.
	   The magical hold Davies had on the par 5s at the Desert Inn
Country Club evaporated in a round that brought a handful of
players back into the tournament she had led by four strokes at the
midway point.
	   One of those players was American Meg Mallon, who shot a
bogey-free 67 to move from 10 shots back into second place. Another
stroke back were compatriots Juli Inkster, Pat Hurst and Tina
Barrett.
	   Davies, who has struggled with her putting all year, had 38
putts on a day where two errant tee shots also cost her at least
two strokes.
	   ``If I putt like that tomorrow I've got no chance,'' a
disconsolate Davies said. ``But that's what I expected to be
honest. And it's probably why I got it.''
	   Davies started the round with a four-stroke lead, but promptly
hit a palm tree with her iron shot off the first tee and then
missed an 2 1-2-meter (8-foot) putt that seemed to set the tone for
the day.
	   Davies had seven makeable birdie putts on the back nine, but
made none.
	   ``Laura isn't exuding a lot of confidence,'' Mallon said after
making up eight shots on another mild, windless day on the course
bordering the Las Vegas Strip. ``I've definitely been in that
position before.''
	   Davies, who hadn't made worse than birdie on the par 5s in the
first two rounds, had three pars and a bogey on the long holes
Saturday as the short-game woes that put her in her worst slump of
her career returned.
	   Even when Davies managed to reach a par 5 in two, as she did on
15, she 3-putted for par.
	   ``I could have shot 7 under on the back nine. I shot level,''
Davies said. ``It's not like I'm not playing well. I just should be
doing better.''
	   Playing with Barrett in the last group of the elite field of top
30 money-winners, Davies consistently blasted her drives 45 meters
(50 yards) past her playing partner. But after making par for the
first time on a par 5 on No. 5, she then pulled her tee shot into
the water on the par-5 9th and made bogey.
	   She regrouped to hit good shots on the back nine, but couldn't
make them pay off.
	   ``I just feel gutted,'' said Davies, who has gone 20 months
without winning on the American LPGA tour.
	   Mallon, meanwhile, was feeling lucky after vaulting into
contention with a sparkling round that included five birdies.
	   ``It's nice to actually be able to have a chance to win
tomorrow,'' the 12-year tour veteran said. ``I've lost a lead
before. I know that that is like. That's why you keep playing.''
	   Mallon, who started the day one under, capped her round with a
chip-in for birdie from about 5 meters (18 feet) on 17. She
credited a talk she had with herself midway through Friday's round
with getting her back on track.
	   ``I got upset because I wasn't making any putts. I got really
mad and I just said, forget about it,'' she said. ``I took the same
attitude out there today and things started to happen. I played
very smart and very patient today.''
 &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Sweden's Annika Sorenstam, trying to become the first
golfer on the American LPGA tour to average less than 70 strokes a
round, shot a 71 Saturday and was at even par. Sorenstam, who
entered the tournament with a 69.88 average, needs to shoot 72 or
better Sunday to break 70 for the year. She has already wrapped up
the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, along with player of
the year and the money title.

	   ``Crackle'' (Beggars Banquet) _ Bauhaus
	   ``Lift'' (Red Ant) _ Love and Rockets
	   ``Crackle'' offers a collection of songs from 1978 to 1983 that
proves Bauhaus to be the godfathers of gothic rock.
	   Bauhaus' music-ghoul image was certain when they played their
signature song, ``Bela Lugosi's Dead,'' in the opening club scene
of the 1983 film, ``The Hunger.''
	   Key tracks like ``Double Dare,'' ``In a Flat Field,'' ``She's in
Parties'' and ``Dark Entries'' mark Bauhaus' influence on ensuing
gothic performers and demonstrate the band's passing similarities
to contemporaries like the Birthday Party and the Cure.
	   Despite this compendium's omission of Bauhaus' covers of Brian
Eno's ``Third Uncle'' and T. Rex's ``Telegram Sam,'' it does
include the band's electrifying take on David Bowie's ``Ziggy
Stardust.''
	   And while Bauhaus founders Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins
carry on successfully as the group Love and Rockets, and vocalist
Peter Murphy pursues his solo career, this groundbreaking quartet
from Northampton, England, can always look to ``Crackle.''
	   Meanwhile, as Murphy gets set to release another solo disc, Love
and Rockets burrows deeper into electronic dance mode with their
7th album, ``Lift.'' They continue the house rhythms from their
1994 album, ``Hot Trip to Heaven,'' in efforts like ``Bad for
You,'' ``Ghosts of a Multiple Feature,'' ``R.I.P. 20 C'' and the
title track.
	   Tunes like the sensual ``Pink Flamingo,'' the hushed ``Holy
Fool'' and standout track ``Delicious Ocean,'' feature a more
traditional Love and Rockets pop sound.
	   ``Lift'' will indeed provide a lift for Love and Rockets
faithful.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``How We Quit the Forest'' (Columbia) _ Rasputina
	   With ``How We Quit the Forest,'' Rasputina adds to their 1996
debut, ``Thanks for the Ether,'' by incorporating more experimental
sounds.
	   ``Rose K,'' ``Herb Girls of Birkenau'' and ``The New Zero'' are
similar to cuts on ``Ether.'' In contrast, ``Things I'm Gonna Do,''
``LeechWife,'' the loopy David Lynch-like ``DwarfStar,'' and the
galloping title track reflect Rasputina's newer metal and
industrial tendencies.
	   Adding spice to the brew are the fetching ``Olde HeadBoard,''
the sing-along ``TrenchMouth,'' the satirical ``Diamond Mind'' and
a convincing version of Leslie Gore's ``You Don't Own Me.''
	   The album is certainly novel, but never mere novelty. Rather,
it's an inventive pop-up book of songs propelled by Rasputina's
newly harnessed firepower, and is heavily recommended for its
fantastic sense of adventure.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Powertrip'' (A and M) _ Monster Magnet
	   Rock 'n' roll roars on Monster Magnet's fourth album,
``Powertrip.''
	   During a sobering Las Vegas sojourn, Monster frontman Dave
Wyndorf conceived ``Powertrip,'' 13 songs inspired by the busted
gamblers and burned-out seekers of the American dream.
	   ``Some people go to bed with Lucifer, then cry when they don't
greet the day with God,'' Wyndorf sings in ``Bummer.'' Contempt is
tempered by Monster Magnet's subtle humor in songs like ``Atomic
Clock,'' ``Crop Circle'' and ``Third Eye Landslide.'' And there's
whimsical pleasure with the belly-dance rhythms of ``Temple of Your
Dreams.''
	   Monster Magnet retools their early single ``Tractor,'' a song
about addiction: ``Got a knife in my back; got a hole in my arm;
when I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm.''
	   Monster Magnet's ``Powertrip'' solidifies the best of a hard
rock legacy that includes the Stooges, Blue Cheer, MC5, Led
Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and more recently, Soundgarden.
	   Watch for Monster Magnet, currently on tour with Rob Zombie.
	   _ J.W. Lim, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``REO Speedealer'' (Royalty) _ REO Speedealer
	   Just as REO Speedealer was starting to generate a buzz, the
Dallas-based punk group was approached by REO Speedwagon to change
its name. But the group still came out with its eponymous debut
album using the same name.
	   Known for its blistering 20-minute live sets, Speedealer slaps
down 15 cuts of high-octane rock, brewed with diesel by veteran
producer Daniel Rey (White Zombie, L7, Ramones).
	   From ``Schlitterbahn'' to ``Crank Bait,'' the album is a
relentless ride that distills the raunchiest Motorhead and the
punchiest Antiseen, seasoned with the sharpest 1980s hard-core
sounds from Negative Approach to Void.
	   _ By J.W. Lim, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ```Whatever' soundtrack'' (Tangerine-Medicine) _ Various
	   ``Whatever,'' director Susan Skoog's debut film, sports an early
1980s rock soundtrack, partial to guitar-based new wave. The songs
spur the movie's graphic portrayal of adolescent blues and the
suburban youth subculture.
	   Like band names scrawled on a notebook cover, tracks by Blondie,
The Cramps, The Ramones, The Pretenders, David Bowie and Rush hit
their marks. Surprises include The Jam's ``In the City,'' Siouxsie
and the Banshees' ``Playground Twist,'' and chestnuts by Iggy and
the Stooges and Patti Smith Group.
	   ``Whatever'' concludes with ``I Should Have Known'' by ex-Til
Tuesday's Aimee Mann, providing a resonating end.

Australia to host Andersen Consulting Matchplay in 2001
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ Australia will host the 2001
edition of the Andersen Consulting matchplay championships, which
will be played for the first time in California in February.
	   The tournament will launch a new world championship series with
three events in the first year and expanding to four from 2000.
	   It will feature the top 64 players on world rankings and will be
played at La Costa for the first two years. The prizemoney for each
of the series' tournaments is U.S. dlrs 5 million.
	   David Ciclitira, chairman and chief executive of Parallel Media
group, a London-based sports promotion and marketing company, said
``It's an annual event, which takes place in various parts of the
world and in the year 2001 it's going to be in Australia.''
	   The PGA Tours International Federation, composed of the five
leading golf tours, will run the world championship series.
	   The NEC Invitational, which replaces the World Series of Golf at
Firestone in Akron, Ohio, will be a 72-hole stroke play in August
among members of the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams. The
American Express Championship will be played in November at
Valderrama in Spain, a stroke-play event for top money-winners on
the five tours.
	   Prize money from the three tournament will count as official
money on the respective tours _ the PGA, European, South Africa,
Japan and Australasia.
	   The federation is still working on eligibility and format for
the World Cup team play, which begins in 2000. It will start in the
United States, moving to South Africa in 2001 and Japan in 2002.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The scene: his brother's loft in Los Angeles, 4
a.m., windows open on a hot night to catch the hint of a breeze.
Sleep is fitful, so Chris Isaak lies in bed listening to a Mexican
station on the radio.
	   Suddenly he hears a voice that stuns him, heartbreaking enough
to impress even this master of melancholy. He has to have that
record.
	   He doesn't know the name of the song. He doesn't know the name
of the singer. He doesn't even know the call letters of the radio
station. That doesn't dissuade him.
	   Isaak picks up the phone and begins calling radio stations. At
the third one, he pleads with a disc jockey to tell him everything
the station played during the past half hour. He'll buy all the
records, just to find that voice again.
	   When the bewildered disc jockey balks, Isaak tries another
approach, singing the only English line of the song that he
remembers. The disc jockey answers immediately: ``Maya Rodriguez.''
	   That's the easy part. Isaak spends the next day searching
through more than a dozen record stores before finally finding a
Maya Rodriguez record.
	   ``I bring her music when I'm making a movie,'' he said.
``Whenever I'm in a dark mood and I want to cry, she just does it
every time.''
	   It's the kind of obsession known only to those who love, and
live for, music. This Californian has always been that way. Seven
years after the brooding ``Wicked Game'' put Isaak on the map as a
Roy Orbison for the 1990s, he's still making albums with the kick
of rock 'n' roll and enough sadness to make Maya Rodriguez proud.
	   A day before he flies to Australia, Isaak, 42, pauses in a New
York record company office to talk about his seventh album, ``Speak
of the Devil.''
	   1. Are you speaking of any devil in particular?
	   Isaak: Women. The chested devil _ the woman. The type of woman
who, when she walks by, you'd be talking to your friend about your
pancreatic cancer surgery and suddenly you see his eyes glaze over
and as you're talking, his head swivels past. The show completely
stops for a beautiful woman.
	   2. You've never hesitated to draw from your life experiences
when writing songs. Have you ever regretted it?
	   Isaak: No. When I've put things from my life in my songs I've
tried not to put things in that somebody else would find
unappealing about their life. I don't write about my
ex-girlfriends. I wouldn't put something mean-spirited about them
in a song. ... On this record, I have names on there of people I've
gone out with. I don't think they were mentioned in any way
offensive: `Tyree, what a team we could have made.' It was somebody
I went out with long ago and she probably never thinks of me at
all. But it's a way of me saying, 'I haven't forgotten you.' If
I've got mean-spirited things to say, I just say it on the tour
bus.
	   3. You don't like to talk too much about your music. Why?
	   Isaak: It's not my favorite thing to do. Usually, I make jokes
about things when people ask me about music. Because when you
really think about how you write songs, there's no easy way to tell
people. It's either so simple or so complex that it's ineffable.
You can't say it. The other problem is _ besides not being able to
describe that process very well _ is that when you do try to
describe it, you sound like a (jerk).
	   4. You wrote a song with (``My Heart Will Go On'' author) Dianne
Warren. How did that happen and how did it work out?
	   Isaak: I was just trying to do different things. If you're a
painter and you've always painted with a brush and you want to do
something new, grab a can of spray paint. I don't do a lot of
writing with other people, and I wanted to try doing it. But I
didn't want to do it with someone who writes like I do. If they
write minor key, introspective music, if it's at all in the same
realm of what I do, what do I need that for? I thought if we could
get one of those big, soaring choruses with my minor key verses, it
would be a good combination, which is kind of what we ended up
getting.
	   5. Do you listen to a lot of other music?
	   Isaak: Yes, I do. I've listened to Beck a lot in the last year
or two. He's fun because he's combined country and blues to rap and
elements of hip-hop. You're just going, what is this? He's throwing
a lot of stuff together and that's really fantastic. They had a guy
who used to do it like that _ Elvis. He put together country and
blues and made something new. I like the Verve, they had a very
good album. I bought it for the single and I stayed for the whole
movie. I looked at (singer Richard Ashcroft's) picture, if we were
at a party, me and him would probably be rassling in the bean dip.
He looks like he'd be a troublemaker. But looks are deceiving.

Plenty of work left before NBA lockout is settled

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A day after finally getting somewhere, the
opposing sides in the American National Basketball Association
lockout dealt Saturday with the realization that plenty of work
remains to be done.
	   More than 120 players held a conference call and were told that
the club owners had heeded the union's call for compromise
bargaining. But the sides are at odds over numerous issues that
won't be settled easily.
	   ``Our best offer and their best offer are not matching, and that
means there's still a pretty big gap between us. And that's going
to be a problem,'' commissioner David Stern said. ``It's really
quite a hill that we have to climb.''
	   An exact date for a resumption of talks has not yet been set,
but a meeting should take place early in the week.
	   The owners also spent the day assessing the compromises
discussed during an all-day bargaining session Friday that both
sides agreed was their most productive to date. Each side gave
ground on the percentage of revenues they are seeking and the rules
dealing with the establishment of an ``escrow tax'' that might be
levied on player salaries.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   Owners, who had been asking that player salaries be limited to
50 percent of their revenues, moved two percentage points.
	   Players, who want a similar system to U.S. Major League Baseball
whereby teams that exceed a cap pay a ``luxury tax'' on the amount
they exceed the cap, also moved off their demand by two points for
60 pecent of revenues.
	   The players proposed system would tax clubs for exceeding the
cap and that money would be distributed to poorer teams.
	   ``We did some yeoman work today, but this deal is so varied and
complex that there's still a lot more to be done,'' Stern said.
``There are a huge number of issues and an enormous number of
details that stand between us and a deal.''
	   Among them:
	   _ Owners still want a maximum salary tied to a fixed percentage
of the salary cap (25 percent for players with 1-6 years of
experience, 30 percent in years 7-9 and 35 percent for 10-year
veterans). Players still want a luxury tax on owners to be the main
deterrent against any player signing a contract for more than dlrs
15 million annually.
	   _ Owners want a four-year rookie salary scale with an additional
right of first refusal. The union has offered a four-year scale
with no right of first refusal.
	   _ Owners want changes to the ``timing rules'' that benefit teams
who sign other teams' free agents while below the cap and then
re-sign their own free agents under the Larry Bird exception to
exceed the cap. The union says such a change would stifle player
movement.
	   _ Owners want to lower the maximum annual raise from 20 percent
to 5 percent, although Bird exception contracts could have
10-percent raises. The union wants raises to be tied to the greater
of 10-percent or the annual percentage increase in league revenue.
	   _ Both sides have offered higher minimum salaries for veterans,
but they are apart on exactly how much higher.
	   Each of those issues could take days to be settled, and there
are at least a dozen other non-economic items on which the sides
are completely at odds.
	   Even when an agreement is reached in principle, it could take a
week to put it on paper and have it signed before the lockout will
be lifted and training camps can open.
	   The bottom line: It still appears the season won't start until
1999.

Davenport vs. Hingis in Chase final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS with Spirlea quotes, detail, doubles championship. &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ This was for pride more than revenge.
	   Displaying the game that made her the world's best player,
Lindsay Davenport beat Steffi Graf 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 Saturday to
advance to the final of the dlrs 2 million Chase Championships.
	   The victory came six days after Davenport lost to Graf in the
title match of a tournament in Philadelphia.
	   ``Last week in Philadelphia she was playing unbelievable,''
Davenport said. ``She made a few more mistakes today.''
	   In the final, Davenport will face the teen-ager she replaced at
the top of the rankings, No. 2 Martina Hingis, a 6-2, 7-6 (9-7)
winner over Romania's Irina Spirlea.
	   ``I am playing for my pride,'' Hingis said.
	   Spirlea, like Graf, was unseeded in this 16-player,
season-ending tournament at Madison Square Garden.
	   Sunday's finale will be a best-of-5, the only time women play
more than three sets. The winner will collect dlrs 500,000, with
dlrs 250,000 going to the losing finalist.
	   The first semifinal was a battle of wills as much as forehands,
and Davenport proved just as tough in both. She played mostly to
Graf's backhand, daring her opponent to come up with a winning
solution.
	   Graf was the crowd favorite until nearly the last game of the
match. It made no difference to the U.S. Open champion, who finally
won them over with gutsy play and big strokes.
	   Whenever Graf seemed to gain the upper hand, Davenport would
come back with yet another winner. She finally got the crowd
cheering for her on the second point of the final game when, after
making several off-balance shots to stay in the point, she won with
a sharply angled crosscourt forehand.
	   That made it 15-all, and Graf won only one more point in the
match.
	   ``We were both trying to hold our serves at the end,'' Davenport
said. ``I just was able to hold mine a little more.''
	   Graf broke Davenport in the opening game. But any thoughts of a
romp by the German were quickly dispelled when Davenport broke
right back, aided by Graf's double fault.
	   Graf has won five of these season-ending tournaments, so she is
not about to fold when pressured. Even in the sixth game, trailing
5-1, she fought back to deuce before the Californian held to close
the opening set.
	   After Graf held at love to lead 5-2 in the second set, Davenport
took a three-minute medical timeout. As a trainer treated a blister
on Davenport's left foot, Graf took advantage of the stoppage to
leave the court.
	   When play resumed, Davenport lost her serve for the second
straight time as Graf wrapped up the second set to even the match.
	   Following the sixth game of the final set, Graf called for the
trainer, who worked on her right hamstring, wrapping the thigh.
	   Hingis, at 17 the youngest of the semifinalists, ripped through
the first set in 22 minutes. The second set was another matter.
	   Spirlea, one of the game's most talented players, more than
matched strokes with Hingis. She won five consecutive games for a
5-1 lead before Hingis matched her with a five-game streak of her
own.
	   ``I said at 5-1, you go for your shots and see what is going to
happen,'' Hingis said. ``I was able to pull it out. ... I was a
little lucky also on some of the shots.''
	   Spirlea refused to admit she had a 5-1 lead, insisting it was
5-2.
	   ``I think I was more careful,'' she said, ``didn't take the
risk. I was just waiting for her mistakes, and they never came. So
when it was 5-4, you get more tight.''
	   Hingis began the tiebreaker with an ace. Then Spirlea pulled
ahead and reached set point at 6-4 with a sharply hit forehand down
the line.
	   Then errors returned to Spirlea's game. She needed a backhand
while serving for the set. On the next point, she pushed a backhand
wide, causing Hingis to fan her face in relief.
	   Another error by Spirlea gave Hingis match point, which the
Romanian saved with a backhand passing shot. Two shots later,
Hingis was in her second Chase Championships final in three years.
She lost to Graf in five sets in her Championships debut in 1996.
	   Davenport teamed with Natasha Zvereva of Belarus to capture the
doubles title, defeating Natalie Tauziat and Alexandra Fusai of
France 6-7 (6-8), 7-5, 6-3. The winners split dlrs 200,000, while
the French pair shared dlrs 100,000.
	   It took Zvereva, ranked No. 1 in the world in doubles, and
Davenport 2 hours, 9 minutes to outlast their opponents. It was the
sixth doubles crown they have won this year, and they were
runners-up in all four Grand Slam tournaments.
	   During the doubles final, Davenport took another injury timeout,
this time to have a trainer work on her back.

Hrovat holds off Austrian in slalom race
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS. &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) _ Urska Hrovat has never enjoyed the long
flight from Slovenia to the United States. Winning, however, makes
it a bit more bearable.
	   ``If you don't do well, it's difficult to forget the trip,''
Hrovat said. ``Now I change my opinion; it's starting to be nice.''
	   Hrovat continued the best start of her career on Saturday,
parlaying a huge first-run margin into victory in a women's World
Cup slalom.
	   Hrovat, the leader by 1.1 seconds after the morning run,
prevailed by .38 seconds over Austria's Sabine Egger and Croatian
super teen Janica Kostelic, who claimed a spot on the podium in
only her fifth World Cup start.
	   ``I waited a long time to start a season well,'' said Hrovat,
fifth in Thursday's giant slalom. ``In my career, I never started a
season as well as this year.
	   ``I was always better in the last races in World Cup. I thought
it was a great victory for me today. It will make me more confident
and powerful.''
	   Hrovat's huge first-run margin was just too much for Egger, who
was fifth but 1.48 seconds back. As it was, she skied brilliantly
in carving more than a second off the leader's time.
	   Hrovat's winning total was 1 minute, 36.91 seconds to Egger's
1:37.29. Kostelic finished in 1:37.60.
	   Egger was thrilled to be on the podium, considering she
underwent surgery on her back in April. The operation forced her to
adopt a more upright skiing technique.
	   ``I had to train hard,'' Egger said. ``I only started skiing in
September. That's why I'm very happy with this result.''
	   Hrovat got her fifth career victory with a solid if
unspectacular second run, keeping her skis from danger after Egger
and Kostelic had skied on the edge in an effort to catch up.
	   ``After the first run, I just really felt safe,'' Hrovat said.
``I said, `OK, for the second run, you must come down, you don't
need to attack so much,' because I was so much ahead of the others.
	   ``I just said keep it going and it will be enough. Just push,
but use your head.''
	   Until Egger came along, it looked as if the 16-year-old
Croatian, who started 53rd and placed 12th in the morning, might
write an improbable chapter in World Cup history. Her time of 46.12
seconds was the fastest of the afternoon run, and vaulted her nine
spots in the standings.
	   Egger almost matched it with a 46.14-second effort while Hrovat,
safely ahead the entire way, needed only a 47.24 to easily take the
winner's trophy.
	   Kostelic, who preferred tennis as a youngster and thinks she was
a better handball player than skier until recently, appeared cool
amid the uproar over her performance.
	   ``I wasn't nervous,'' she insisted. ``The first run in Cortina
last year, I was nervous,'' because it was her first World Cup
event.
	   ``I didn't think I'd do so well,'' she admitted. ``I thought if
I could get into the second run, I'd be very happy. This is like a
dream.''
	   It was a disappointing day for defending champion Ylva Nowen of
Sweden, who had to rally just to take 10th, 1.36 seconds behind.
	   And defending race champion Zali Steggall of Australia was
unable to keep pace after sitting second in the morning, slipping
back to seventh.
	   While Kostelic gave Croatia its first spot on the World Cup
podium, Vicky Grau gave tiny Andorra its first points, placing
19th.

Authorities consider more evacuations from Mexican volcano
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Authorities in the western state of Jalisco
prevented over 100 people from returning to their homes on the
flanks of the Colima volcano after lava began to flow faster than
expected.
	   Residents of the village of Juan Barragan who were evacuated
Wednesday from their homes about eight kilometers (five miles) from
the crater had been promised they could return Saturday.
	   But glowing, semi-solidified lava began to emerge around the
crater of the 3,820-meter peak late Friday. It was moving down one
of the volcano's slopes faster than it had in previous, similar
eruptions, said Maritza Oropeza, spokeswoman for the Jalisco State
Civil Defense Unit.
	   The volcano, Mexico's most active, sits on the border between
Jalisco and Colima states near Mexico's western Pacific coast.
	   Colima Gov. Fernando Moreno Pena said officials there were
weighing whether to evacuate the village of La Becerrera, about 10
kilometers (six miles) south of the crater. On Wednesday, all 140
residents were evacuated from the hamlet of Yerba Buena, Colima,
just 8 kilometers (five miles) from the peak.
	   During an eruption in 1991, lava didn't flow far enough down the
volcano's slopes to threaten any villages.

	   CHANGJON, North Korea (AP) _ When a South Korean cruise ship
sailed into North Korea's eastern port of Changjon this week,
passengers could hear shouts of drilling soldiers carrying clearly
on the cold winter air.
	   As the tourists crowded the ship's deck, they were treated to
the sight of hundreds of fatigue-clad soldiers marching down a
waterfront road, singing military songs and shouting slogans.
	   Anchored nearby were seven warships, weighing up to 1,000 tons.
	   One, its guns clearly visible, sailed past the curious tourists,
who stood on the cruise ship's open deck to take a first look at a
land that had been off limits to them for the past half century.
	   But they were also getting a glimpse of one of the most closely
guarded secrets in this reclusive, Marxist nation _ a major
military base opened to view in impoverished North Korea's
desperate search for hard cash.
	   Officials of South Korea's Unification Ministry, who accompanied
the tourists, said North Korea's military strongly opposed opening
Changjon, but were overruled by leader Kim Jong Il.
	   The Unification Ministry is charged with guiding policy toward
the North, and about half a dozen of its officials were aboard the
tour ship. The North initially objected, but eventually relented
and allowed them to debark.
	   The scene symbolized a subtle but significant change taking
place along the tense Korean border, the world's last front line in
a Cold War that began to evaporate a decade ago.
	   It was a difference that U.S. President Clinton pointed to in a
joint news conference Saturday with South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung as he endorsed Kim's policy of engagement with North
Korea.
	   ``The significance is far reaching,'' Hong Yong-chan, an
economic professor at Seoul's Hankook University of Foreign
Studies, said of the North Korean decision to open Changjon to
South Korean tourists.
	   Hong was one of the some 800 tourists who arrived in Changjon
Thursday aboard the first cruise ship operated by a South Korean
conglomerate in a joint venture with North Korea.
	   Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea fought in the
early 1950s in a war that ended without a peace treaty, leaving
them still technically at war. Their border is the world's most
heavily armed, with 2 million troops deployed on both sides.
	   But apparently for economic reasons, the North opened the
military port at Changjon to South Korean tourists under a dlrs 905
million deal with Seoul's Hyundai Group.
	   The Unification Ministry officials said that's enough money to
fill the starving country's annual shortfall of 1.5 million tons of
grain until 2004.
	   Changjon is the gateway to Diamond Mountain, a remote region of
high crags, deep valleys and thundering waterfalls only 16
kilometers (10 miles) from the border with the South.
	   Changjon's harbor, nestled below Diamond Mountain in an
excellent natural shelter, was until recently the home base of a
major North Korean naval fleet.
	   Most of the fleet was relocated farther north before the tour
started, according to the South Korean officials. The port's
facilities looked very old. Some were built during Japan's colonial
rule in the early part of the century.
	   Berthing facilities were rusting and shore embankments were
unrepaired. Along the long ridge of the mountain stretching into
the sea were several huge tunnels used as shelters for warships.
	   Their entrances were temporarily blocked and camouflaged after
the ships were relocated. Matchbox-shaped gray concrete buildings
used by soldiers and their families dotted one side of the shore.
	   Most of those buildings were empty, their occupants transferred
to other bases.
	   Lee Chang-sung, 69, who once served as a North Korean sailor at
Changjon before the Korean War, said the port facilities looked
just the same as he remembered them.
	   ``No improvement was made from my days in 1949 and 1950,'' Lee
said. He was captured during the Korean War, later freed and chose
to live in South Korea.
	   Hyundai plans to spend millions at Diamond Mountain in building
a hotel, golf course, restaurants and other facilities in an effort
to make Diamond Mountain a major tourist attraction.
	   But major obstacles remain to be overcome after decades of
conflict and mistrust.
	   Every movement of the first South Korean visitors was closely
watched by North Korean officials. They blocked transmission of
reports by 200 journalists who accompanied the tour, a major news
event in South Korea.
	   Most of the tourists were elderly natives of North Korea who
were separated from their families during the war, a fate shared by
about 10 million Koreans on both sides of the border.
	   But the visitors were confined to strictly designated areas and
no reunions with separated family members were allowed. No contact
with any North Koreans civilians was allowed.
	   For Lee Young-shik, 67, a South Korean businessman, the tour
stoppped only about 1,000 meters (yards) from where he was born and
raised.
	   ``My native home is just over there, but I can not go,'' Lee
said fighting back tears. ``I am returning with a broken heart, but
I will come back.''

Howards says no to aboriginal memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An official memorial for Australian
Aborigines killed in conflicts with white settlers would be
inappropriate, Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday.
	   At the launch last week of his new book ``Sacred Places,''
Australian historian Ken Inglis raised the issue of creating a
suitable national memorial.
	   Governor-General Sir William Deane, who launched the book, also
noted the absence of memorials to the nation's original
inhabitants.
	   ``There are few memorials to the colonial conflicts of the 19th
century, certainly almost none at least of an official kind, to the
Aborigines who were slaughtered in the black wars of that period,''
Deane said.
	   But Howard on Sunday ruled out the idea.
	   ``I wouldn't think that would be appropriate because I don't see
that in the context of people who died in wars between Australia
and foreigners,'' he told the Nine television network's Sunday
program.
	   ``I mean you could have a very lengthy argument about the legal
status of the British settlement of Australia.
	   ``But my understanding of the High Court in the Mabo decision
(is that it) did not regard the British as having conquered the
then Australian land mass, but rather settled it, and therefore if
you want to be legalistic about it the state of war didn't exist.''
	   The Australian High Court, in a landmark decision, ruled that
Aborigines had a common-law entitlement to ownership of their
traditional lands in some circumstances. Now known as the Mabo
decision, it stemmed from a land claim by the late Eddie Mabo and
his Torres Strait island clan on the tiny Murray Islands off
northern Australia.
	   Howard did not rule out establishing some kind of memorial for
Aborigines killed while fighting in world wars for Australia.
	   ``I think that is a separate issue, I'm not sort of jumping and
saying yes or no to that but I think it's inappropriate in the
context of the War Memorial,'' he said.

Canadian kidnappers jailed in British Columbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia (AP) _ Two convicted Canadian
kidnappers have been jailed in British Columbia, after serving nine
years in Brazilian prisons.
	   Christine Lamont and David Spencer were transported from Brazil
Friday night to Canada to serve out their sentences at home. They
were jailed Saturday.
	   But how long they remain in jail is unclear. By Dec. 28, they
will have served a third of their 28-year terms and can apply for
parole under Canadian law.
	   Their case became a cause celebre in Canada after they claimed
that guards at Sao Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary tortured them and
routinely violated their rights _ allegations that prison
authorities denied.
	   They staged two hunger strikes in recent months in Brazil to
protest their imprisonment. Both were released under a new
bilateral prisoner exchange treaty with Canada.
	   Lamont, Spencer and eight others _ five Chileans, two Argentines
and one Brazilian _ were convicted of kidnapping Abilio Diniz,
owner of Brazil's largest supermarket chain, in 1989.
	   Although the Canadians claimed for years they were innocent,
they later admitted they helped hold Diniz hostage for six days in
an underground cell before police freed him unharmed.
	   At their trial, the kidnappers claimed to be political prisoners
since they wanted to funnel a dlrs 30 million ransom for Diniz to
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. The ransom was never paid.

Top three teams keep winning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will UPDATE with night game &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The national college football championship
picture didn't clear up at all Saturday as the top three teams kept
winning.
	   Fullback Shawn Bryson ran for two touchdowns, including a
58-yarder in a 24-point second period, as No. 1 Tennessee
overwhelmed emotionally-drained Kentucky 59-21 at Neyland Stadium.
	   The Vols (10-0, 7-0 SEC) should remain in the top spot in the
BCS standings that will determine which two teams play for the
national championship in the Fiesta Bowl. Tennessee can complete a
perfect season with a win next Saturday at Vanderbilt and a victory
in the SEC title game on Dec. 5 against either Arkansas or
Mississippi State.
	   ``We might have played our best game defensively. Offensively,
maybe,'' coach Phillip Fulmer said after his Vols sacked Tim Couch
six times and forced him into numerous errant passes despite being
without injured linebacker Al Wilson.
	   If Tennessee wins out, Kansas State and UCLA will need to win
their season finales in two weeks and hope the BCS computer tips
the scales in their direction.
	   The second-ranked Wildcats (11-0, 8-0 Big 12), who are one spot
behind UCLA in the BCS standings, got one touchdown pass and one TD
run from Michael Bishop to complete the first undefeated regular
season in school history with a 31-25 win at No. 19 Missouri.
	   The third-ranked Bruins beat error-prone Southern California
34-17 to win their 20th straight game behind 109 yards rushing and
four touchdowns from DeShaun Foster.
	   ``If we beat Miami, we should go to the Fiesta Bowl,'' coach Bob
Toledo said. ``That's my opinion.''
	   Looming on the outside if two of those three teams lose, are No.
5 Florida State and No. 7 Ohio State, who beat their rivals on
Saturday.
	   Peter Warrick had a 32-yard (meter) touchdown reception and
threw a 46-yard touchdown pass off a reverse as the Seminoles
scored the final 17 points to beat the Gators 23-12.
	   The Buckeyes beat No. 11 Michigan 31-16 for just the second time
in 11 years to win a share of the Big Ten title. But Ohio State
lost a chance to go to the Rose Bowl when No. 13 Wisconsin beat No.
16 Penn State 24-3.
	   In other games Saturday, it was Mississippi State 22, No. 9
Arkansas 21; No. 10 Notre Dame 39, LSU 36; No. 12 Tulane 48,
Houston 20; No. 14 Georgia 24, Mississippi 17; No. 20 Air Force 22,
Rice 16; No. 21 Georgia Tech 63, Wake Forest 35; No. 23 Virginia
Tech 47, Rutgers 7; and No. 24 Syracuse 38, Temple 7.
 &UR; No. 1 Tennessee 59, Kentucky 21 &QC; 
	   Kentucky (7-4, 4-4), playing for the first time since last
week's truck crash that one player and severely injured another,
was unable generate any offense in the first half as Tennessee
scored on seven consecutive possessions to take a 38-7 halftime
lead.
 &UR; No. 2 Kansas St. 31, No. 19 Missouri 25 &QC; 
	   Missouri (7-4, 5-3) has lost 35 straight games to Top 10
opponents over the last 17 years and has lost six straight to
Kansas State, but made this one close. Missouri was at the Kansas
State 42 when Corby Jones overthrew John Dausman at the 10 with
1:19 to go.
 &UR; No. 3 UCLA 34, USC 17 &QC; 
	   At Pasadena, California, the Trojans (7-4, 5-3) turned the ball
over seven times, including four fumbles in 22 1-2 minutes, as they
lost to UCLA for the eighth straight time.
 &UR; No. 5 Florida St 23, No. 4 Florida 12 &QC; 
	   At Tallahasse, Florida, Sebastian Janikowski kicked three field
goals, and Florida State's top-ranked defense limited the
high-powered Gators (9-2) to just 201 yards and 14 yards rushing.
 &UR; No. 7 Ohio State 31, No. 11 Michigan 16 &QC; 
	   At Columbus, Ohio, Joe Germaine tossed three touchdown passes
and Ohio State turned a pair of punt mistakes into scores as the
Buckeyes (10-1, 7-1) beat the Wolverines (8-3, 7-1) for the first
time in four years.
 &UR; Mississippi St. 22, No. 9 Arkansas 21 &QC; 
	   At Starkville, Mississippi, Brian Hazelwood kicked a 27-yard
field goal with seven seconds left as Mississippi State upset
Arkansas to take control of the SEC West race.
	   Mississippi State (7-3, 5-2) wins the SEC West title if it can
win at Mississippi on Thursday night, or if Arkansas (8-2, 5-2)
losses at LSU the following day.
 &UR; No. 10 Notre Dame 39, LSU 36 &QC; 
	   At South Bend, Indiana, Jarious Jackson passed for 276 yards,
ran for 80 more and engineered the winning fourth-quarter touchdown
drive as Notre Dame (9-1) beat LSU (4-6) to keep alive its hopes
for a Bowl Championship Series appearance.
 &UR; No. 12 Tulane 48, Houston 20 &QC; 
	   At New Orleans, Shaun King threw a career-high five touchdown
passes as Tulane remained unbeaten and won the Conference USA
championship. The Green Wave (10-0, 6-0) accepted CUSA's automatic
bid to the Liberty Bowl if they are not invited to the BCS.
 &UR; No. 13 Wisconsin 24, No. 16 Penn State 3 &QC; 
	   At Madison, Wisconsin, Tom Burke had four sacks, and Nick Davis
scored on an 82-yard punt return as the Badgers beat Penn State
(7-3, 4-3) to earn a probable berth in the Rose Bowl.
 &UR; No. 14 Georgia 24, Mississippi 17 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Olandis Gary ran for 132 yards and two
touchdowns, and Georgia (8-2, 6-2 SEC) stopped Mississippi (6-3,
4-4) twice at the 1-yard line.
 &UR; No. 20 Air Force 22, Rice 16 &QC; 
	   At Air Force, Mike Tyler returned an interception 26 yards for a
touchdown with 8:23 remaining, as the Falcons claimed a berth in
the WAC championship game.
	   Air Force (10-1, 7-1 WAC) clinched the WAC's Mountain Division
title and will meet Pacific champion Brigham Young for the league
title on Dec. 5 in Las Vegas.
 &UR; No. 21 Georgia Tech 63, Wake Forest 35 &QC; 
	   At Atlanta, Charlie Rogers scored three touchdowns and Joe
Hamilton threw for two other scores as Georgia Tech (8-2, 7-1 ACC)
grabbed a share of the ACC title and a Gator Bowl bid.
 &UR; No. 23 Virginia Tech 47, Rutgers 7 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Virginia, Al Clark threw two long touchdown
passes to Ricky Hall in the first half, and Virginia Tech (8-2, 5-2
Big East) returned two of its six interceptions for touchdowns.
 &UR; No. 24 Syracuse 38, Temple 7 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, Dee Brown ran for two touchdowns, Quentin
Harris returned a 47-yard interception for another score and Rob
Konrad added a 2-yard TD run as Syracuse (7-3, 5-1) beat Temple
(2-9, 2-5) to advance to a showdown with Miami for the Big East
title.

Howard criticizes Olympic organizers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard criticized
the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) on
Sunday, urging board members to stop their squabbling in order to
protect Australia's reputation.
	   His call follows a report in the Sunday Telegraph that Sydney
Games bid organizer Rod McGeoch was considering quitting the SOCOG
board because of attempts to discredit him.
	   Howard made it clear on Network Nine's Sunday television program
that he was concerned about the brawling within SOCOG.
	   ``It's unseemly and I think it does relate in part to political
concentration,'' Howard said.
	   Asked if the Games were being put at risk because of moves by
the New South Wales state Labor government to get rid of a
non-Labor person, he said: ``I just think there is a danger because
of the political concentration and you all know what I am meaning .
. . when I say that.
	   ``And I just ask those people to whoa back a bit and remember
this is an Australian event and the reputation of Australia is at
stake.''
	   He said McGeoch had done a magnificent job in masterminding the
bid.
	   ``And I think a lot of people in Australia would feel that it is
a sorry pass if the man who did more than anybody else to get
Sydney the Games should perhaps be treated poorly,'' he said.
	   McGeoch's threat to quit after what he described as a very
difficult week followed criticism that his agent demanded 8,000
Australian dollars (5,200 US dlrs) for him to give a speech to a
group of visiting American businessmen.
	   The Sunday Telegraph reported a confidential letter by a former
Olympic marketing officer had queried whether McGeoch's job as a
director for a state automobile club could deter possible Game
sponsors.
	   McGeoch rejected the suggestion, saying many SOCOG directors
held outside business interests which were in competition with
Games sponsors but this did not mean they were breaching
guidelines.
	   ``I don't pretend to know all of the detail but could I just say
to all of them, don't squabble,'' Howard said.
	   ``We want the Games to be a success, they are an Australian
event, they are not just a Sydney event although they are being
held in Sydney, they are primarily an Australian event.
	   ``And we want honor to be done and brought to Australia. And
that's what I hope everybody keeps in mind.''

Butcher leads England's run feast at the Gabba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Opener Mark Butcher shrugged off his
lack of pre-test form to join England's other batsmen in a surprise
attack on Australia in the first cricket test at the Gabba on
Sunday.
	   After Australia had amassed 485 in its first innings, England,
resuming on 53 for one, replied boldly with 179 for three at lunch
on the third day.
	   Butcher, unbeaten on 93 at the break, and Nasser Hussain (59)
continued from where they left off overnight, extending their
second-wicket alliance to 134 runs in 84 minutes of exhilarating
batting.
	   Australia did well to remove Hussain and skipper Alec Stewart
(eight) in the space of four overs in an eventful morning. But
Graham Thorpe, six not out, kept Butcher company in seeing the side
through to lunch.
	   Butcher, who had managed just nine runs in five first-class
innings before the first test, set eyes on his second century in a
brief 15-match career.
	   He was lucky to survive when he played on to a Michael
Kasprowicz no-ball on 92 and England on 174 for three.
	   Hussain was the first to reach his half century and soon after
Butcher cover drove Damien Fleming to post his 50. Another four off
the next brought up the 100 stand for the second wicket.
	   After Butcher and Hussain had banished leg spinner Stuart
MacGill out of the attack, taking 22 runs in his three overs at the
start, Stewart swept a full toss to Kasprowicz at the square leg
boundary.
	   Butcher has hit 15 boundaries off 154 balls.
	   Hussain, softened up by a Kasprowicz bouncer, edged the next
ball to Healy. (ik/djp)

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Rob Niedermayer scored the
tying goal to cap a six-goal second period Saturday as the Florida
Panthers twice came from behind for a 3-3 tie with the New Jersey
Devils.
	   Niedermayer backhanded the rebound of Scott Mellanby's shot to
pull the Panthers even at 3-3 with a power-play goal at 14:23.
	   In the third, Florida wasted a great opportunity when Lyle
Odelein and Vadim Sharifijanov both got penalties for slashing Ed
Jovanovski at 8:59. The Panthers got only two shots on the
five-on-three power play.
	   Dave Gagner and Ray Whitney also scored for Florida, which
played a second straight tie. Sergei Brylin, Denis Pederson and
Petr Sykora had the Devils goals as New Jersey extended its
unbeaten streak against Florida to five at 3-0-2.

Speculators snap up new flats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a sign of growing confidence in the economy,
thousands of people swamped a developer's sales office and snapped
up apartments at a new housing development this weekend, newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   Nearly 85 percent of the 1,268 flats on sale at Island
Harbourview of Olympian City, developed by property giant Sino
Land, were sold Saturday for between 4,280 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 549) to 5,300 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 679) per square
foot.
	   The sale was seen as a market barometer as it came one day after
commercial banks cut interest rates by 0.25 percent, to 9.5
percent. The development is at a prime location on top of an
airport express train station.
	   Property prices have plunged by as much as 60 percent since they
peaked last August. To kick start the market, the government has
suspended government land sales until next March and is writing
cheap loans for first-time home buyers.
	   The economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this year,
while unemployment is at a record high of 5.3 percent. But share
prices have rebounded moderately in the past weeks.

Clinton warns North Korea against nuclear ambitions

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Warning North Korea to forsake nuclear
weapons, President Bill Clinton showed off American military power
in a pre-Thanksgiving holiday visit with troops on watch near the
world's most heavily guarded border.
	   Before flying by helicopter to a training center, Clinton
attended Sunday services at the 8th Army memorial chapel at the
U.S. Army headquarters for Korea at Yongsan base in Seoul.
Accompanied by Gen. John Tilelli, commander of U.S. forces in
Korea, Clinton listened to a gospel choir and a sermon before
lingering later to shake hands with a mix of troops both in
camouflage uniforms and civilian dress.
	   Clinton spoke Saturday of a ``strong suspicion'' that an
underground construction project in the communist North that is
barred from U.S. inspection is nuclear related.
	   Saying the United States has an ``unshakable alliance'' with
Seoul, Clinton urged North Korea to seize ``an historic
opportunity'' for peace extended by South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung in his policy of engagement with his neighbor.
	   Kim said North Korea ``is cautiously but noticeably taking
measures to increase interaction and cooperation.'' But Kim, in
office less than a year, said he and Clinton agreed that ``we will
not tolerate any possible attempt of North Korea to proliferate
nuclear weapons, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction.''
	   The two leaders spoke at a news conference at the Blue House,
Seoul's presidential residence.
	   To underscore the U.S. military commitment, Clinton was flying
north of Seoul to a training center bristling with military
hardware, from Apache attack helicopters to M-1 Abrams tanks and
Bradley Fighting Vehicles. He also planned to address American
troops at Osan Air Base from a U-2 spy plane hangar.
	   In his weekly radio address, the president called the Korean
Peninsula ``the last fault line of the Cold War'' where almost
40,000 Americans are helping South Korea defend its freedom.
	   An armistice, not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War,
and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Close to 2
million troops are deployed on both sides of the border.
	   Security worries and Asia's economic collapse were Clinton's top
themes in South Korea, as they were earlier in Japan.

Officials studying whether Marcos general's right to military
</HEADLINE>
honors

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government is studying whether to
bestow military funeral honors to a former Philippine military
chief under the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos or allow him to be
buried at a heroes' cemetery, officials said Sunday.
	   Gen. Fabian Ver, 78, died Saturday of lung malfunction at a
hospital in Bangkok, a family spokesman said. Ver had been linked
to widespread human rights violations and to the 1983 assassination
of anti-Marcos opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said a military team was
reviewing guidelines to find out whether Ver could be given
military honors when his body is brought back to the Philippines or
if he could be buried at a heroes' cemetery in an army camp in
metropolitan Manila.
	   Mercado said other family members of Ver, including three sons
who were former military officers, could return home anytime
because they no longer pose threats to national security.
	   ``Their era has long passed and we don't think there'll be
trouble if they return,'' Mercado said in a Manila radio interview.
He added there has been no request from Ver's family to bury him in
the heroes' cemetery, where militarymen are traditionally laid to
rest.
	   Ver was one of the most powerful figures during the 20-year rule
of Marcos, heading the presidential security force before being
appointed by Marcos as his chief of staff.
	   He fled with the Marcos family to Hawaii after the strongman was
ousted in the military-backed ``people power'' revolt in February
of 1986.
	   Former presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos had banned the
return of Ver and his three sons, all former military officers, on
grounds that they posed a security threat.
	   President Joseph Estrada, however, has allowed Ver's return on
condition the former general would face charges against him.
	   Before he died, Ver was able to talk on the telephone to his
wife, Aida, and his youngest daughter Faida in California, sons
Wyrlo and Rexor in Hawaii, and another son, Irwin, in San
Francisco, said Mel Amado Jr., a spokesman for the Ver family.
	   Ver underwent lung surgery last year and a gall bladder
operation early this year, which may have led to a deterioration of
his health.
	   Former congressman Roquito Ablan Jr., a close friend of the
Vers', told The Associated Press by telephone from Bangkok, that
they plan to bring Ver's body back to Manila on Tuesday or
Wednesday.
	   One of the last images of Ver seen by Filipinos was at the
height of the 1986 revolt when he was urging Marcos during a live
television broadcast to give the order to bomb mutinous troops
holed up in two suburban camps surrounded by hundreds of thousands
of civilian supporters.
	   Ver rose from the rank of private to four-star general in his
four decades in the military.
	   Ver was accused of involvement in the assassination of Aquino,
Mrs. Aquino's husband, at Manila's airport but was acquitted while
Marcos was still in power.
	   After Mrs. Aquino took office, the Supreme Court ordered a new
trial in which 16 soldiers were convicted of killing her husband.
Ver, who was accused as an accomplice, was not tried in absence and
the case against him had been shelved.
	   The trial, however, failed to determine who ordered the killing.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with other games &QL; 
 &UR; Florida Panthers 3, New Jersey Devils 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Rob Niedermayer scored the
tying goal to cap a six-goal second period Saturday as the Florida
Panthers twice came from behind for a 3-3 tie with the New Jersey
Devils.
	   Niedermayer backhanded the rebound of Scott Mellanby's shot to
pull the Panthers even at 3-3 with a power-play goal at 14:23.
	   In the third, Florida wasted a great opportunity when Lyle
Odelein and Vadim Sharifijanov both got penalties for slashing Ed
Jovanovski at 8:59. The Panthers got only two shots on the
five-on-three power play.
	   Dave Gagner and Ray Whitney also scored for Florida, which
played a second straight tie. Sergei Brylin, Denis Pederson and
Petr Sykora had the Devils goals as New Jersey extended its
unbeaten streak against Florida to five at 3-0-2.
 &UR; Boston Bruins 5, Washington Capitals 4, Overtime
	   At Boston, in an NHL game marred by 270 minutes in penalties and
12 ejections, Jason Allison scored his second goal of the night
with 30 seconds left in overtime as the Boston Bruins beat the
Washington Capitals.
	   Ten Bruins and six Capitals were sent to the penalty box in the
first period as 264 minutes in penalties were handed out. That
included a fight at 11:42 of the opening period that involved every
player on the ice and saw all of them ejected, including
goaltenders Byron Dafoe of the Bruins and Washington's Olaf Kolzig.
	   The NHL record for most penalty minutes is 406 in a game between
the Minnesota North Stars and Bruins on Feb. 26, 1981.
	   Brendan Witt and Steve Konawalchuk scored third-period goals for
the Capitals, who fought their way back from a 3-0 deficit to tie
at 4.
 &UR; Toronto Maple Leafs 2, Buffalo Sabres 1
	   At Toronto, Mike Johnson and Igor Korolev scored in the second
period to lift the Toronto Maple Leafs over the Buffalo Sabres.
	   Alexei Zhitnik scored in the first period for Buffalo, which had
a nine-game undefeated streak snapped (6-0-3).
	   Korolev beat Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek on a breakaway at
12:32 of the second period, breaking a 1-1 tie and giving the Maple
Leafs (10-8-2) sole possession of first place atop the Northeast
Division. The Sabres (8-4-4) are two points back but have four
games in hand.
 &UR; Colorado Avalanche 3, Montreal Canadiens 2
	   At Montreal, Valeri Kamensky scored 3:06 into the third period
to lift the Colorado Avalanche over the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Peter Forsberg intercepted Vladimir Malakhov's clearing pass and
slipped the puck to Claude Lemieux, who fed Kamensky for a tap-in
that gave Colorado its fourth win in five games.
	   Milan Hejduk added a goal with 4:09 left before Malakhov got one
back for Montreal on a power play with 11 seconds left for the
final margin.
	   Stephane Yelle scored in the first period for Colorado and
Benoit Brunet tied it for Montreal in the second.
 &UR; Ottawa Senators 4, Atlanta Flames 1
	   In the Ottawa suburb of Kanata, Alexei Yashin produced his first
two-goal game of the season as the Ottawa Senators defeated the
Calgary Flames.
	   Shawn McEachern scored his sixth goal at 3:58 of the third to
break a 1-1 tie. Jason York, with his second of the season, also
scored for Ottawa.
	   Jarome Iginla scored for Calgary.
 &UR; Pittsburgh Penguins 5, Tampa Bay Lightning 2
	   At Pittsburgh, Martin Straka scored twice as the Pittsburgh
Penguins beat Tampa Bay, extending the Lightning's losing streak to
five games.
	   Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso left the game after one period.
The team said he re-aggravated a back injury and was held out as a
precaution. Barrasso missed 10 games earlier this season with a
groin injury.
	   The Penguins beat Tampa Bay for the second time in three nights.
Straka's first goal gave Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead at 17:22 of the
first and was the Penguins' first shorthanded score of the season.

WHO calls for upped taxes, other measures against tobacco
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tobacco smoking is becoming one of the worst
health disasters in history, and China is being badly hit, the
director-general of the World Health Organization said Sunday.
	   Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland said 3.5 million people worldwide will
die from smoking this year. That figure is expected to triple to 10
million into the next century, with possibly around 2 million of
the deaths in China, she said in a speech to Beijing's elite
Qinghua University.
	   ``China's share of this tragedy may be huge,'' she said,
according to a text of her speech. Tobacco is ``one of the greatest
emerging health disasters in human history,'' she added.
	   Brundtland called for stronger tobacco taxes, curbs on tobacco
smuggling and enforced bans on tobacco advertizing.
	   To succeed, the measures will need ``firm political direction
and strong public support,'' she added.
	   China now logs the highest number of deaths from smoking of any
country, having recently overtaken the United States. If current
smoking patterns persist in China _ where two-thirds of the men
become smokers before the age of 25 _ tobacco will kill about 100
million of the 300 million males now under 30, according to a new
study published last week in the British Medical Journal.

England wins its first World Cup of Golf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WHANGAPARAOA, New Zealand (AP) _ English youngster David Carter
sank a birdie putt on the 18th to give England its first ever World
Cup of Golf victory Sunday.
	   The 26-year-old held firm down the stretch alongside four-time
Grand Slam title winner Nick Faldo to seal a 2-shot victory over
Italy.
	   Carter ended even par with Faldo on 8-under, giving United
States' Scott Verplank the International Trophy for the best
individual score at 9-under.
	   Faldo was equal second with Italy's Costantino Rocca in the
individual competition.
	   England, which had finished second three times before but never
won in the 43 previous tournaments, finished with 568. Italy had
570 and the U.S., Scotland and Argentina tied for third on 571.
	   Carter and Faldo collected U.S. dlrs 200,000 each from the total
U.S. dlrs 1.5 million prizemoney.
	   The U.S. was 13-under for the final round. Verplank led the
charge with a 9-under 63 to equal the course record set earlier
Sunday by Sweden's Patrik Sjoland.
	   Daly and Verplank led at 6-under through 16 holes but Daly
struggled down the stretch, dropping shots at the par-5 17th and
par-4 18th with near misses.
	   Argentina's Angel Cabrera and Richard Gonzalez were 1-shot
behind England in the final group but slipped to 4-under as they
both suffered bogeys at 16. Gonzalez earned the share of third with
a birdie at the last.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie had a 68 and Andrew Coltart had a
66 Sunday.

Trial of jailed Malaysian dissident Anwar resumes Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The politically charged corruption
trial of Anwar Ibrahim resumes Monday amid growing outcry to U.S.
Vice President Al Gore's remarks supporting the ousted Malaysian
deputy prime minister.
	   The Malaysian government had recessed Anwar's trial so it would
not interfere with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of
21 Pacific Rim leaders, which ended last week.
	   The week-long pause, however, only intensified the global
spotlight focused on Malaysia and the government's treatment of the
former No. 2 leader.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his firing by
Mahathir sparked massive anti-government protests. The current
trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on
another corruption count, as well as five of sexual misconduct, at
a later date.
	   The 51-year-old dissident leader denies all the charges and says
they're part of a political vendetta orchestrated by his former
mentor Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Malaysia, meanwhile, has accused U.S. Vice President Gore of
meddling in its domestic affairs, following a speech he delivered
during the APEC summit in which he expressed support for the
political reform movement started by Anwar.
	   Gore's remarks have triggered a nationalistic fervor. A hotline
advertised in the government-backed New Straits Times was hooked up
over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S. sentiments.
	   Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat said a task force would be
set up to strengthen patriotism and tackle foreign interference.
	   ``The foreign attack on the country is too big, but if people
love the country and stand united, they can reject any kind of
propaganda aimed at humiliating us,'' the minister was quoted as
saying in Sunday's Star newspaper.
	   During the APEC summit, top-ranking officials from Australia,
Canada and the United States, as well as Philippines President
Joseph Estrada, angered Malaysia by meeting privately with Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail, to voice concern.
	   Anwar's case sparked international outrage when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was
blindfolded by police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   A special police team appointed to investigate the beating
completed its report and submitted it on Thursday to Attorney
General Mohtar Abdullah.
	   Mohtar has not yet disclosed details of the report. He said he
was studying it with senior prosecutors.
	   The prosecution's case suffered several apparent blows when its
first seven witnesses took the stand earlier this month. Prime
Minister Mahathir has been named as one of 52 witnesses that could
be called to testify against Anwar.
	   When the trial opened, the head of police intelligence, Mohamed
Said Awang, startled the court by testifying police had coerced
statements from arrested people and made them retract accusations
leveled against Anwar, then deputy prime minister. He also
testified that he would lie under oath if ordered to.
	   Another police intelligence officer, Abdul Aziz Hussin,
demonstrated how he had forced two key witnesses to retract their
allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   Anti-government demonstrations in support of Anwar have been
held since his ouster. The trial is expected to last through next
year.
