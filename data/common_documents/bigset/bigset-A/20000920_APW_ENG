<HEADLINE> D.C. Child Cases Said Not Probed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional investigation into the
District of Columbia's child welfare agency says that since May
more than 1,200 reports of neglected children went uninvestigated
for two days -- breaking a court-set deadline -- and at least 150
went unexamined for more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary findings by the General Accounting Agency were
reported reported in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post.
The GAO probe also discovered children being placed in unlicensed
and potentially unsafe foster homes, and children younger than age
6 are being housed in group homes for as long as two years, even
though a court order restricts such housing to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The data came a day before the second congressional hearing into
the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency. Members of a
congressional committee overseeing the district government have
ordered the agency's chief, federally appointed receiver Ernestine
F. Jones, to appear at a hearing Wednesday on an emergency plan to
improve the agency. They also want to know why her agency is not
complying with court orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The subcommittee is deeply concerned that, since our previous
hearing last May, the agency has made no changes that would
preclude more children from being mistreated, or even dying, under
its care,'' David Marin, a spokesman for Rep. Thomas M. Davis III,
R-Va, told the Post. Davis is the chairman of the House Government
Reform subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators also found 45 children have been placed in
unlicensed foster homes in the district since May, and 48 percent
of children's case records have not been entered into the agency's
computer tracking system.

<HEADLINE> Policy Breakthroughs Said Rare  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vietnam, India and Mexico may not seem to have
much in common but U.S. relations with each of these large,
important countries have improved lately as distortions partly
induced by the Cold War have been overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The gains are not in the same league as Tuesday's breakthrough
in which President Clinton, following months of arm-twisting, was
able to achieve a major foreign policy victory: final congressional
approval of a China trade bill that proponents say could be a boon
for the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the China case, presidential prestige was on the line;
Clinton had to overcome the opposition of powerful constituencies.
In the cases of Vietnam, India and Mexico, the stakes have not been
nearly as high but each can be put in the foreign policy success
column.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many successes. Clinton has struggled to make
a difference in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo,
Haiti, Colombia and North Korea, among other areas. His goals of
renewing links with Iran and removing the Iraqi regime have not
borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
   And with the window fast closing on his presidency, it is not
clear whether Clinton will be able to claim outright victory on any
of these challenges.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took office, the United States had neither trade
nor diplomatic ties with Vietnam. The mention of Vietnam in those
days gave rise to accusations that Clinton dodged the draft as a
youth to avoid military service in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Clinton restored both trade and diplomatic ties with
Vietnam and, come November, he will become the first president to
go to Vietnam in more than 30 years. His objective all along has
been reconciliation, and he seems to be achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   The question arises: Why would Vietnam be eager to receive the
representative of a country responsible for the deaths of 3 million
of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, State Department officials say, is self interest.
Vietnam has a historic fear of China, with which Vietnam fought a
brief but bloody border war in 1979. As the officials see it, an
amicable relationship with the United States gives Vietnam a
measure of insurance against potential Chinese hostility.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that relations with the world's most powerful
economy fits nicely with Vietnam's goal lifting living standards of
its many impoverished people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clearly is pleased with the developing relationship with
India, as was evident in the effusive welcome he offered to Indian
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, democratic but pro-Soviet India was little more
than an afterthought for the Reagan administration, which
assiduously pursued close ties with the military dictatorship in
Pakistan, an anti-communist ally.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pakistan is the afterthought, its strategic usefulness
having faded, and India has become a willing partner of Washington
despite differences on nuclear issues. Vajpayee says the United
States and India are ''natural allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seems dazzled by the promise of ties with India. ''It's
inconceivable to me that we can build the kind of world we want
over the next 10 to 20 years unless there is a very strong
partnership between the United States and India,'' he said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before Vajpayee's visit, Clinton welcomed Mexico's
president-elect, Vicente Fox, to the White House. Fox is widely
admired here for having dethroned the political empire that has run
Mexico since 1929, one that was in the Cuban camp for much of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did something during his visit with Clinton that struck
analysts as highly unusual: He pointedly thanked Clinton for the
$20 billion peso stabilization package he offered to Mexico at the
time of the Mexican financial crisis five years ago. ''When we were
in crisis, we always got and saw the hand of a friend,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Radu, a Mexico expert at the Foreign Policy Research
Center in Philadelphia, says that given the psychological burdens
Mexico has carried for years in its cross-border relations, a
public expression of gratitude toward Washington has been taboo for
any Mexican leader. ''It would have been political death,'' Radu
says.
</P>
<P>
   Fox takes office on Dec. 1, seven weeks before the inauguration
of Clinton's successor. Both sides seem eager to be good neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has come down solidly in favor of
trade and engagement with China in historic legislation that
President Clinton says will promote prosperity in America and
freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
   In a decisive 83-15 vote, the Senate on Tuesday approved
permanent normal trade status for China, laying the framework for a
new trade arrangement under which China is to open its doors to
American businesses and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which Clinton and others have praised as the
most positive development in U.S.-China relations since President
Nixon's visit to Beijing in 1972, now goes to the White House for
the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent trade status will end the annual
review of U.S.-China trade relations that has been a source of
contention between the two countries. Approval also sets the stage
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. With WTO entry
later this year or early next year, China is committed to opening
its markets and drastically cutting tariffs on American and other
imports.
</P>
<P>
   ''In return for normal trade relations,'' Clinton said, ''China
will open its markets to American products, from wheat to cars to
consulting services, and we will be far more able to sell goods in
China without moving our factories there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that new trade status and WTO membership could affect
the Chinese far more profoundly. ''Our high-tech companies will
help to speed the information revolution there. Outside competition
will speed the demise of China's huge state industries and spur the
enterprise of private sector involvement. They will diminish the
role of government in people's daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But detractors, led by labor, human rights and conservative
groups, said it was wrong to sacrifice trade as a policy tool that
could help force China to stop proliferating weapons and start
improving its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signal we send by granting PNTR (permanent normal trade
relations) now is a signal of abject weakness. It is a signal of
greed. It is a signal of ambivalence on the issue of
nonproliferation,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Roger W. Chastain, president of the American Textile
Manufacturers Institute, said China's entry in the WTO could cost
150,000 U.S. textile-related jobs but ''will do nothing to change
China's outlaw behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calls for a congressional-executive commission
to monitor human rights in China and creates a so-called surge
mechanism to help American industries and workers hurt by an
increase in Chinese imports.
</P>
<P>
   China welcomed the Senate vote as a boon to economic and
political relations with the United States but objected to the
creation of a commission to monitor Chinese human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation contains ''certain clauses that are irrelevant
to trade and are intended for interfering in the internal affairs
of China and harming China's interests,'' Hu Chusheng, a Trade
Ministry spokesman, said in remarks carried by the government news
agency, Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
   Most business and farm groups and their political allies were
strongly behind the legislation. PNTR, said U.S. Chamber of
Commerce President Thomas Donohue, ''opens China's markets, brings
China into a rules-based trading system and promotes peace and
stability in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the agreement would boost annual U.S. exports
by about $13 billion in five years, cutting into China's current
$68 billion surplus. American farm exports could jump by $2 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have grain piled up everywhere in this state, a near-record
harvest on the way, and we need buyers,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson said in a statement. ''Opening a huge new market like
China is crucial for Wisconsin farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, under WTO rules China would have to give U.S.
businesses full rights of distribution, open the nation to American
financial and service industries and allow U.S. investment in
Chinese telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, support permanent trade status with China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Hoping To Whittle Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are hoping that passage of a
near-$33 billion measure financing the Treasury Department and
other programs will jump-start their drive to settle their budget
differences with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides acknowledge they have a pile of disputes to
resolve before Congress can adjourn for the year, sending lawmakers
home for the last weeks of this year's presidential and
congressional campaigns. With just 11 days until the Oct. 1 start
of fiscal 2001, just two of the 13 annual spending bills for next
year -- both covering defense programs -- have been signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seemed ready to give the measure final congressional
approval Wednesday. In a sign of the GOP's eagerness to get
Clinton's signature on the bill, the legislation represented a $1.2
billion increase over the amount the House initially approved in
July.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget chief Jack Lew said the bill was still
''unacceptable,'' however, because its $8.6 billion for the
Internal Revenue Service is $300 million less than Clinton wants.
But Lew did not say Clinton would veto the legislation, and GOP
leaders said the administration's demands for extra money could be
handled in later bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll address that,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also has less than Clinton wants for counterterrorism
programs. Overall, it would provide $30.4 billion for the Treasury
Department and smaller agencies, and $2.5 billion for Congress' own
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also repeal the 3 percent federal tax on
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   It would let members of Congress receive a $3,800 pay raise, or
2.7 percent, putting their salaries at $145,100 beginning in
January. More than 1,000 top executive branch officials -- starting
with the vice president -- would receive the same percentage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also stand to receive a modest pension break from the
bill. A measure in the legislation would roll back mandated
increases in out-of-pocket contributions toward retirement,
affecting lawmakers as well as other federal workers. For members
of the House and Senate, the change would mean a savings estimated
at $700 a year for 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   On other budget fronts, Republicans were putting final touches
on a proposed measure financing the Interior Department and
cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   Participants speaking on condition of anonymity said the
proposal would provide about $500 million less than the $970
million Clinton wants for purchasing new federal, state and local
park lands. The measure would also provide $1.75 billion for
battling forest fires, said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., an author
of the bill, compared to Clinton's $1.6 billion request.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also include language the administration has
opposed blocking proposed restrictions on the use of land in the
Northwest's Columbia River basin, and exempting New Hampshire's
White Mountains from policies aimed at limiting logging.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring their resolve on the issue, the House voted 401-20
to again pass a measure aimed at using 90 percent of next year's
projected budget surplus to pay down public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bill, which passed the House on Monday, was attached to
a measure that would expand retirement savings in hopes of
increasing the likelihood that the Senate will consider it.

<HEADLINE> Senate Speeds Up Visa Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators hope to consider in the waning days
of Congress a bill allowing computer software and other high-tech
companies to bring in more workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   However, some lawmakers are determined to tie it to other
immigration issues, which could kill its chances for passage this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Senators decided 97-1 to force a vote later this week on whether
they should consider the popular high-tech worker visa bill known
as H1B. Only Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want amendments, however, to deal with other
immigration questions, mainly involving Hispanics. Republicans say
if Democrats succeed, it probably will kill the popular measure for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way. ''We're still talking,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ''We're taking it one step at a time,'' said Ranit
Schmelzer, spokesman for the minority leader, Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton predicted Saturday that Congress would pass
the bill and did not mention linkages to other immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to consider the H1B visa bill, but ''if the
Senate can pull a clean H1B bill through, I think it would
facilitate our ability in the House,'' House Majority Leader Dick
Armey said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House members pushed through three immigration bills
Tuesday, including one to stop what some lawmakers called unfair
deportation of aliens for past crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress broadened the number of crimes that would
trigger deportation and included retroactivity provisions, which
led to the deportation of some noncitizens who had steered clear of
trouble after earlier minor brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under current law, many legal residents can be deported for
minor offenses that were not deportable offenses when they pled
guilty to them,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, a supporter of
fixing the 1996 law. ''The bill will bring sensible relief for
those who have paid for past infractions and will give people a
chance to remain in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, also would allow aliens
deported for minor offenses under the 1996 law to appeal for the
right to return.
</P>
<P>
   The House also decided to make it easier for foreign-born
adoptees to get American citizenship, including automatic
citizenship for some, and extended until 2003 a program that sets
aside 10,000 visas a year for foreign religious workers to conduct
activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   H1B visas allow skilled workers to enter the United States for
specified periods to do specific jobs for which employers say
American workers are unavailable. The technology industry says the
need is as high as 300,000 a year. Labor unions say the high-tech
industry recruits overseas mainly to hire a less expensive work
force than Americans provide.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would increase the number of visas for each of
the next three years to 200,000 a year. Otherwise, the current
115,000 falls to 107,500 in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and
65,000 a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bill's popularity, it ran into problems when Clinton
said in May that any visa increase had to be linked to the changes
involving Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders insist the two questions have nothing to do
with each other and should be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would offer permanent residence to political
refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti similar to
that granted people from Cuba and Nicaragua. Another amendment
would grant amnesty for illegal immigrants who have lived in the
United States since 1986. The current registry deadline is 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president believes that we can and should do both of those
things,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday. ''And we'll continue
to work to get both of those things done.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   The bill is S. 2045.

<HEADLINE> Clint Eastwood Defends Hotel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Eastwood insists he's on the right
side of the law in a federal case accusing him of violating the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-director defended himself Tuesday at a press
conference outside the courthouse where a lawsuit against his hotel
will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were scheduled to hear opening statements Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is fighting a lawsuit filed by Diane zum Brunnen, who
has multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair. She claims a bathroom
and other parts of Eastwood's Mission Ranch hotel in Carmel were
inaccessible in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I have doubts about that, and that's why I'm here,''
Eastwood told reporters. More than a dozen autograph-seeking fans
surrounded the actor following the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood contends her claims are bogus, and says his 31-room
hotel has had a wheelchair-accessible bathroom since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   While Eastwood's star power has drawn public attention to the
case, plaintiff's attorney John Burris said he hopes it will not
bias the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the jurors to hold him accountable like everyone else,
and because he's a celebrity, they might want to give him the
benefit of the doubt,'' Burris said. ''Our job is to make them look
beyond him as a celebrity, director and actor.''

<HEADLINE> Rick Springfield Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Rick Springfield spent a night in jail
after he was arrested for alleged spousal assault.
</P>
<P>
   The pop singer and former soap opera star was arrested Monday
night at his Malibu home and booked for investigation of spousal
assault, said Sgt. Chuck Stringham of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield posted $50,000 bail and left the jail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old entertainer said Tuesday night that he and his
wife, Barbara, had an argument and ''a third party called the
police.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're together and we're going to work it out,'' he told The
Associated Press during a break from taping an anniversary special
for the VH1 channel's ''Behind the Music'' program.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield and his wife have been married 18 years and have two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   With hits such as ''Jessie's Girl,'' the singer-actor was a teen
idol in the 1980s, and captivated ''General Hospital'' viewers in
his role as Dr. Noah Drake. He was recently on a nationwide tour
with ''Karma,'' his first album in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   When his music fell off the charts, Springfield returned to
acting in such low-profile efforts as the syndicated TV series
''High Tide.'' He also landed a recurring role on the NBC-TV comedy
''Suddenly Susan.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fans with video cameras will get to shoot the
new Stone Temple Pilots video.
</P>
<P>
   Band frontman Scott Weiland says he's had it with music videos,
so he's giving fans a shot at the band's new ''No Way Out'' single.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had been agonizing over which way to go with the video in
terms of direction and were so nauseous over the state of music
videos today that we decided we should leave it up to our fans,''
Weiland said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead singer added it will be ''the true rock music fans who
will have their part in turning back the tide of current
Mouseketeer song and dance shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The band will perform ''No Way Out'' for about 400 fans --
selected by Los Angeles station KROQ -- at the El Rey Theater on
Sunday, and the budding directors will be asked to film whatever
they choose on a video camera of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes will be collected and viewed, with the most compelling
being compiled to make the clip. The director's credit for the
video will read: ''The Listeners of KROQ.''

<HEADLINE> Rosa Parks Wins Domain Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- In 1955, Rosa Parks fought for her space on a
bus. This time, she was battling for her spot on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Parks, 87, won domain name rights to www.rosaparks.com, a
site created by a man who planned to auction it off, according to
Parks' Chicago lawyer, Oscar Alcantara.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara said that he sent a cease and desist letter to Lester
Shaw of Tulsa, Okla., after which Shaw agreed to give up the domain
name.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara said Tuesday that Shaw violated a new federal law
banning ''cybersquatting,'' the pre-empting of Internet domain
names with the aim of selling those names to companies or people
with trademark associations to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prominent people like Rosa Parks are most likely to fall into
this kind of abuse,'' Alcantara said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw did not return calls seeking comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in
Detroit will use the Web site to educate visitors on civil rights
and Mrs. Parks, according to Alcantara's law firm. The institute
now has the site www.rosaparks.org.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus was
a turning point in the civil rights movement.

<HEADLINE> Census Response Rate Tops 1990  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans have reversed the declining
participation that marred the last two censuses, with two-thirds of
households returning their forms this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people stepped forward and sent in their forms,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday, reporting a 67
percent response rate via mail and Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''That result halts a (long) slide and actually begins to
reverse it,'' said Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta.
</P>
<P>
   The wider participation also saves money, Prewitt said, because
every percentage point of mailed response represents 1.2 million
households that don't have to be visited by Census workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that improvement in response, the $6.5 billion effort
''will be in the black,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau budgeted for a 61 percent response rate,
following declines from 78 percent in 1970 to 75 percent in 1980
and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census field workers are completing follow-up visits to homes
that failed to answer their forms, said Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 rate was topped despite controversy about questions on
the long form that some people felt were intrusive. Prewitt said
the return rate for the short form was about 11 percent better than
for the long form, but the difference was made up during follow-up
visits to people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   An actual tabulation of the nation's population must be
delivered to President Clinton by Dec. 31. The Supreme Court last
year ruled those figures must be used to reapportion the 435 seats
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Population figures, adjusted by using a statistical method known
as ''sampling,'' are scheduled for release by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers will be based on adjustments to the head count
after a survey of 314,000 households. Sampling has provoked
controversy and continues to face scrutiny in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for people missed in
prior counts, especially the poor, minorities and inner-city
residents -- segments of the population that tend to vote
Democratic. Opponents including Republican leaders in Congress
contend that only an actual head count can be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The state and local numbers are used in drawing legislative
district lines and allocating billions of dollars in federal and
other aid.
</P>
<P>
   The top response rate, 76 percent, was scored by Iowa, and 14
states topped 70 percent, the agency said. Puerto Rico had the
lowest rate at 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Report Critical of Russian Policy  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is disputing a report by
Republicans in Congress that claims the Clinton administration
ignored corruption in Russia, offered bad economic advice and has
done little to help nurture the former communist state into a
free-market democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Made public just seven weeks before the presidential election,
the 209-page report claims the White House botched the ''greatest
foreign policy opportunity for the United States since the end of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of World War II, we had the prospects of somehow
trying to make free-enterprise democracies -- friends -- out of
imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. That was a tall order, but it was
accomplished,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of
the panel of Republicans who are making the report public on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the advent of the new Russian federation, we had the same
opportunity -- to help Russia rapidly become a prosperous,
free-enterprise economy allied with the United States. What mainly
has occurred is that we have seen a great deal of U.S. taxpayer
dollars poured into the Russian central government and it's been
all burned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed the report a partisan document aimed at
attacking Vice President Al Gore, who has been the administration's
point man in dealing with the Russians. Gore is co-chairman with
Russia's prime minister of the U.S. Russia-Commission on Economic
and Technical Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very diligently over the last eight years to
engage the Russians to try to promote democracy and to make the
world a safer place,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart
said when asked to respond to the GOP charges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress quickly defended the White House too.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been a massive reduction in nuclear weapons,'' said
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., the ranking Democrat on the House
International Relations Committee. ''Americans face 5,000 fewer
nuclear weapons and 500 fewer missiles. Kazakhstan, Ukraine,
Belarus were de-nuclearized by removing 3,300 warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson called the report an ''election-year gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by 12 Republicans, says the United States
poured too much money into the Russian central government and
relied too heavily on ties with individual Russian personalities
instead of establishing better relations within the nation's
legislature. Russians' view of Americans has soured, the report
says, and the nation is developing stronger relations with China
and other non-Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   --President Clinton, in his early years at the White House, did
not focus on Russia. Oversight for U.S.-Russia relations fell to an
insular ''troika'' of subordinate officials: Gore, deputy secretary
of state Strobe Talbott and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   --By using ''lending and aid to plug the gap in the Russian
central government's operating budget'' the administration
''exposed these funds to theft and fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration disputes this claim. Last July, Leon Fuerth,
Gore's national security adviser, said in a speech that the
administration has ''continuously sought to tighten our internal
auditing procedures to achieve accountability for U.S.
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Clinton administration continued relations with former
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Anatoly Chubais,
former finance minister who heads Russia's electricity monopoly,
even after they were accused in Russia of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says Gore ignored a CIA report in 1995
containing allegations that Chernomyrdin had accumulated billions
of dollars in private assets in his position as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find New Obesity Gene  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Australian scientists have identified a new
gene responsible for controlling appetite in humans -- a discovery
experts said could lead to the first gene-based drug to treat
obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Collier, a professor of microbiology at Deakin University
in Melbourne, discovered the gene while researching diabetes in
Israeli desert rats. The gene, which he called Beacon, cranks up
the appetite and the rat version is identical to the human one.
</P>
<P>
   The find, presented Tuesday at a conference of the European
Society for the Study of Diabetes, is the third gene linked to
obesity, after leptin and NPy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sir George Alberti, president-elect of the
International Diabetes Federation, said a drug based on Beacon
could be available sooner than one targeting the other two genes
because the rat and human genes are a 100 percent match. This means
drug research could proceed more quickly than normal because the
results in rats would be more relevant to humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very exciting development. It could be a very
important step in the whole obesity, diabetes pathway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collier and his team took sand rats from the Negev desert in
Israel to a laboratory in Melbourne for diabetes research. On their
cactus diet in the desert, the rats were lean and healthy. But
placed in a Western environment, where rat chow was abundant, some
ate a lot, got fat and developed diabetes; others ate reasonable
amounts and remained lean.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted the researchers to look for genetic differences.
They removed the rats' brains, examined every gene to find whether
any were more active in the fat rats and came up with the Beacon
gene.
</P>
<P>
   Genes direct the formation, or expression, of proteins that a
cell uses to function, repair or defend itself, and to divide. In
the obese rats, the Beacon gene was working in overdrive, forming
too much appetite-stimulating protein.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had deciphered the sequence, or unique code, of the
rat gene, the scientists searched for a match on an Internet gene
databank.
</P>
<P>
   They found an 81 percent match with the earthworm, said Dr. Paul
Zimmet, professor of diabetes at Monash University in Caulfield,
Australia, who participated in the research.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 million years of evolution separate the earth worm
from the Israeli sand rat, said Zimmet, adding that a gene which is
preserved 81 percent over 800 million years of evolution must play
an important role.
</P>
<P>
   Collier then searched the libraries of human genetic information
for anything that matched the rat gene sequence. He found the
identical gene sequence in human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon gene produces a protein that stimulates the appetite.
NPy does the same thing, whereas leptin switches off the appetite.
In some obese people, the body does not respond to leptin.
</P>
<P>
   Collier then produced the protein from the human Beacon gene and
injected it into the brains of lean rats with normal behavior of
the gene. They gained about 5 percent of their own body weight in 7
days.
</P>
<P>
   When he injected protein from both the Beacon and NPy human
genes, the rats ate even more and ballooned by 10 percent in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary studies show the human gene is the same across
various regions and ethnicities, Collier said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Collier said, is to subject the protein to
hundreds of chemicals to see if any can block its action.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that a drug could fix the problem if the gene is
pumping out too much of the protein. The proposed drugs would then
be tested on rats before being given to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might for all we know be a bubble, but it looks really good
next to Leptin and NPy because the animal is an exact model of
human obesity and diabetes,'' Zimmet said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the gene, located on chromosome 19, is
scheduled to be published in the journal Diabetes next month.

<HEADLINE> Bon Jovi Tells the Tale on VH1  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After nearly two decades of rock 'n' roll,
Jon Bon Jovi has many stories to tell -- about his 17 Top 40 hits,
seven records, five world tours and an Oscar nomination for best
song.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most memorable is the story of Bon Jovi's
performance on the MTV Video Music Awards in 1989, when he and
guitarist Richie Sambora took to the stage to perform acoustic
versions of their hard-rocking hits ''Livin' on a Prayer'' and
''Wanted Dead or Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All I could think of was, 'How are we going to make Madonna
and Bob Seger and David Lee Roth stand in their chairs and
applaud?''' Bon Jovi said in an interview. ''The guys were like,
'Don't. Sit down with two guitars and play the way you wrote the
song.' So, I went out there barefoot with two acoustic guitars. ...
I thought it was a complete failure until I read the papers the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV credits the performance for giving birth to ''Unplugged,''
the music channel's critically acclaimed show featuring the world's
top acts in acoustic settings with small audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''It flips everyone out,'' Bon Jovi said.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the stories that Bon Jovi plans to tell when the
band kicks off the third season of VH1's ''Storytellers'' on Friday
at 10 p.m. EDT. The show will be taped Friday afternoon at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The inception of ''Storytellers'' marked the music channel's
move from contemporary music video fare to a blend of rock, pop and
hip-hop programs for an aging MTV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the first new breed of VH1 shows, and I think it's when
we started to come on the idea of the stories behind the music,
which, in turn, has become our mantra,'' said series executive
producer Bill Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi said it was that approach that drew him to
''Storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They understood that careers have peaks and valleys, and
understood that a career is a marathon, not a sprint,'' he said.
''They understood that three or four years ago when MTV was jumping
on flash-in-the-pan kids' stuff, boy bands and the rap things that
have one record, maybe two.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, VH1's ''Storytellers'' also has spawned the popular
''Behind the Music,'' hour-long documentaries of sorts about the
rise, fall and rise again of some of the world's top acts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ''Storytellers'' that remains the flagship of VH1
programming, giving musicians a setting to tell the story behind a
particular song and then perform the song before an audience of
several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   The show's popularity also has lent itself to ''Saturday Night
Live'' parodies and the Priceline.com commercials featuring a
singing William Shatner.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Flanagan said, VH1 knew ''concerts just
don't do well on TV. You just can't get people to watch a concert
on television, unless it's a real big event.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of thought about, 'Well, if we can't do on
television what happens in Madison Square Garden, what could we do
on television that you can't do in the Garden?' Intimacy. What you
cannot do in any concert situation is have the experience of
sitting across the room from the artist and have them really talk
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has drawn more than 60 performers, ranging from Billy
Joel to Elton John to Wyclef Jean.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intimacy of it has been great, like playing in my living
room,'' said Pete Townshend, who performed last season.
</P>
<P>
   With an ongoing world tour and ''Crush,'' Bon Jovi's first new
album in four years, the ''Storytellers'' audience can expect a
blend of old and new material -- with a bit of nostalgia thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they get a sense of who we are as individuals and what
got us over the peaks and the valleys,'' he said. ''In a weird way,
I think our success was based on one simple fact: We were a garage
band you could have been in. So, hopefully they'll feel like a part
of that again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger audience members -- who were in their infancy
during Bon Jovi's heyday and may be wondering what all the ruckus
is about -- he has an answer: ''I say, 'Go ask your momma.' It's
great. It's still relevant to a whole new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer, who will perform with Sambora on ''Storytellers,''
said the TV performance doesn't signal a departure from their
trademark in-your-face stadium shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big rock band doing big rock songs,'' he said. ''But
it's very capable of breaking it down to two acoustic guitars.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday as
the market sought to hold on to the gains from the previous session
that sent tech stocks soaring but left blue chips struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The market opened on news that the U.S. trade deficit had soared
to a record $31.9 billion in July as oil prices climbed to a
10-year high, but it wasn't immediately clear what effect that
report had on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose
0.88 to 3,866.52.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 14.43 to 10,803.72, but
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 5.15 at 1,454.75.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, bargain hunting helped push the tech-dominated
Nasdaq up 139.12 to 3,865.64, its largest advance since July 12.
But the Dow fell 19.23 to 10,789.29 after fluctuating in an
80-point range throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, one of Tuesday's most highly traded issues, again rose
Wednesday, up $1.56 at $61.94. But Cobalt Networks, which had
surged 39 percent on news it was being acquired by Sun
Microsystems, was off 19 cents at $57.
</P>
<P>
   And, after selling energy stocks on profit-taking Tuesday,
investors renewed their focus on them Wednesday, boosting
Schlumberger up $2.81 to $83.69. Exxon Mobil was up $1.25 at
$89.25.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.38 to 522.93.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.07 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.37 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.85 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off
0.38 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading Wednesday as the
market struggled to hold on to the gains from the previous session
that sent tech stocks soaring but left blue chips down.
</P>
<P>
   Trading began shortly after news that the U.S. trade deficit had
soared to a record $31.9 billion in July as oil prices climbed to a
10-year high.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Nasdaq composite index fell

But the Dow fell 19.23 to 10,789.29 after fluctuating in an
80-point range throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Tuesday, the stock market has been down
for most of September, dogged by persistent worries about corporate
profits as the economy shows increasing signs that it is slowing
down.
</P>
<P>
   Higher oil prices are also adding to investor uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that oil prices are now about $36 per barrell has
probably become a temporary roadblock for the market,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities. ''I think the majority of investor concern is over
corporate profits, but I think there's been some anxiety over how
long and how oil prices have moved higher, and further anxieties
about outcome of the president election.''
</P>
<P>
   Give these concerns, Galvin said he doubted that the escalating
trade deficit has any influence on investors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, one of Tuesday's most highly traded issues, again rose
Wednesday, up $1.56 at $61.94. Cobalt Networks, which had surged 39
percent Tuesday on news it was being acquired by Sun Microsystems,
was up 6 cents at $57.25.

Schlumberger up $3.06 to $83.94. Exxon Mobil was up $1.31 at
$89.31.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.25 million
shares, slightly ahead of the 131.03 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.78 to 521.53.

<HEADLINE> Preview of Fall TV Season  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Picture the whole TV business under one roof, in
one house. It's a spinoff of ''Big Brother,'' where we watch
network executives try to save their new shows from banishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, I'll plan my fall schedule,'' says houseguest-programmer
Josh. ''But first, another beer and a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bottom line,'' says Eddie, ''any of youse (BLEEP) with my
lineup, I'll (BLEEP) your (BLEEP).''
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a network boss and beautiful, too, is hard,'' says Jamie
-- ''even for someone with a 4.0 average.''
</P>
<P>
   Ugh. This sounds even worse than the actual CBS series. But with
the fall season happening at long last, we can all take heart from
the soon-to-wrap ''Big Brother'': Every one of the 30 new series is
better.
</P>
<P>
   To tell us about them, the networks have promoted their fall
fare for months (doesn't it seem like CBS has been hawking
''Bette'' since the Golden Age of Radio?).
</P>
<P>
   But does anybody care? Does the new fall season even matter? Is
all this just a holding action until January brings us ''Survivor
II''? And will any of the stars of the networks' fall series shine
as brightly as Colleen, Rudy or Rich?
</P>
<P>
   At least Bette Midler is never dull. She stars in a new sitcom
in which she plays a personality named Bette Midler who is very
much like the woman who plays her. Her series is the one named
''Bette.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some viewers may feel that, like its leading lady, a
little ''Bette'' goes a long way -- especially since, with Bette,
there's always plenty going on. But in any case, ''Bette''
indisputably does justice to its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable entry from CBS is ''The Fugitive,'' with Tim
Daly in a lively reprise of the 1960s original.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Geena Davis' ABC sitcom is thinner than that
see-through gown she wore to the Emmys. And in their respective
comeback bids, TV favorites Michael Richards (formerly of
''Seinfeld'') and John Goodman (''Roseanne'') have hit snags and
raised doubts. Due to unexpected overhauls, neither new series is
yet ready for preview.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' witty sitcom ''Welcome to New York'' pays snide homage to
Manhattan, where (as TV news director Christine Baranski explains
to Jim Gaffigan, her new hire from the heartland), people never
wear brown. ''We wear black! And that's only until something darker
comes along!''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Oliver Platt as an investigative journalist (and a
tippler of Bushmills), the NBC drama ''Deadline'' is terrific.
</P>
<P>
   The WB's ''Gilmore Girls,'' a comedy-drama about a 32-year-old
single mother and the 16-year-old daughter with whom she shares a
sisterly bond, is charming.
</P>
<P>
   Another family show, CBS' ''That's Life,'' follows a
thirtysomething New Jersey women as she breaks out of her
blue-collar world to attend college. Thanks to the writing's
authenticity and a splendid cast led by Heather Paige Kent, it's
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Most Endangered Great New Series: ''Gideon's Crossing,'' the
powerful ABC hospital drama starring Andre Braugher of ''Homicide:
Life on the Street.'' Recklessly slotted Wednesday against NBC's
''Law &AMP; Order,'' with the Michael J. Fox-less ''Spin City'' as its
lead-in, ''Gideon's'' would seem already to be living on borrowed
time.
</P>
<P>
   A new ABC sitcom, ''The Trouble With Normal,'' earns a double
honor. First, it shares with Fox sitcom ''Normal, Ohio'' the
coveted ''Copying the Other Person's Paper'' Award for their
confusingly similar titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trouble'' (which was first titled ''People Who Fear People'')
is further distinguished as the season's most wretched new comedy.
Hey, go ahead and poke fun at the mentally ill (in this case, the
clinically paranoid) if you must. But at least make it funny.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ''Titans'' takes the cake as the season's
(unintentionally) funniest new drama. This NBC soap was created by
Aaron Spelling and features Yasmine Bleeth, Victoria Principal and
a circa ''Dynasty'' state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Want to talk retro? In the first episode, Sonny Boy recites a
telegrammed message from his rich industrialist father: ''Getting
married. Stop. Come to the wedding. Stop.'' Stop!!! Who --
especially a zillionaire from Beverly Hills -- has wired anyone a
telegram since the Carter administration?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ''Titans,'' many new fall series recognize the new
millennium. On UPN's ''Level 9,'' a high-tech strike force battles
a cyber-terrorist. On Fox's ''Dark Angel,'' the only voice of truth
is a cyberspace news channel. On Fox's ''FreakyLinks,'' a Web site
investigates paranormal mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget ''The Fugitive,'' which, unlike Aaron Spelling,
knows about the Internet. This time around, when Dr. Kimball
searches for the one-armed man, he uses -- yup -- a computer search
engine!
</P>
<P>

   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
   '48 HOURS': As part of an investigation on growing consumer
dissatisfaction in America, CBS News' ''48 Hours'' examines one of
the most recognized retailers on the Internet, Priceline.com. ''48

complaints against Priceline since its inception. And as a result
of customer complaints, the Better Business Bureau has revoked the
company's membership in Connecticut, ''48 Hours'' reports. While
Priceline executives declined an on-air interview request, William

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks continued their slide Wednesday amid
persistent concerns about corporate profits and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading, the Nasdaq composite index slipped
16.90 to 3,848.74, giving back some of its 139-point advance of
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, furthering a week-long
decline, was down 36.07 at 10,753.22, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
was off 16.12 at 1,443.78.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that oil prices are now about $36 per barrel has
probably become a temporary roadblock for the market,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
persistent worries about corporate profits as the economy shows
increasing signs that it is slowing down. Higher oil prices are
also adding to investor uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again shunned stocks whose companies warned of
unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $5.56 to $35.25 after the telecommunications company
said earnings will be lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Online financial news provider thestreet.com tumbled $1.13 to $5
after saying its profits would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors renewed their focus on energy stocks, which tend to do
well when oil prices are fising. Schlumberger was up $2.13 at $83
and Exxon Mobil was up 88 cents at $88.88. On Tuesday,
profit-taking sent the sector down.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 325.42 million
shares, slightly ahead of the 323.79 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.68 to 521.63.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sinks 112; Nasdaq Falls 26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Persistent concerns about corporate profits and
rising oil prices sent stocks sliding Wednesday, eroding some of
the gains made by technology issues in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Dow Jones industrial average, furthering
a week-long decline, was down 112.47 at 10,676.82.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index slipped
26.21 to 3,839.43, giving back some of its 139-point advance of
Tuesday, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 16.25 at 1,443.65.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that oil prices are now about $36 per barrel has
probably become a temporary roadblock for the market,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities. ''I think the majority of investor concern is over
corporate profits, but I think there's been some anxiety over how
long and how oil prices have moved higher, and further anxieties
about outcome of the president election.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those doubts, Galvin said he doubted the news Wednesday
that the U.S. trade deficit had soared to a record $31.9 billion in
July would have much influence on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
persistent worries about corporate profits as the economy shows
increasing signs that it is slowing down. Higher oil prices are
also adding to investor uncertainty. A barrel of light sweet crude
traded midday at $37.50 on the New York Merchantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again shunned stocks whose companies warned of
unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, Sprint fell $5.06 to $35.75 after the
telecommunications company said earnings will be lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings of lower corporate profits also sent the private
security firm Wackenhut down $1.56 to $8.
</P>
<P>
   Online financial news provider thestreet.com tumbled $1.13 to
$5, an 18-percent drop, after saying its profits would not meet
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were again buying energy stocks, which tend to do
well when oil prices are rising. Schlumberger was up $2.31 at
$83.19 and Exxon Mobil was up $1 at $89. On Tuesday, profit-taking
sent the sector down.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 482.52
million shares, lagging behind the 569.92 million in the previous
session.
</P>

   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.60 to 520.71

<HEADLINE> Conference Targets 'Blood Diamonds'  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- Only a partnership between
governments, businesses and diamond experts can stop the
international trade in diamonds mined by rebel groups in
war-wracked African countries, Canada's U.N. ambassador told a
conference on conflict diamonds Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day gathering is geared toward restoring the integrity
of the international diamond trade, worth some $6 billion a year,
in the wake of revelations that profits from rebel-mined diamonds
have helped fuel civil wars in Sierra Leone, Angola and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cooperation is necessary if we are to attain our common goal:
eliminating diamonds as a source of armed conflict, and preserving
diamonds as a force for prosperity,'' said Paul Heinbecker,
Canada's ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has banned the purchase of diamonds from
rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone. Heinbecker is chairman of the
committee monitoring the Angola embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community as a whole wants these conflicts
to end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sagaren Naidoo, an analyst with the Institute for Global
Dialogue, criticized the United Nations' embargoes as toothless,
since the world body has not punished countries that have ignored
the bans.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations would establish a plan to enforce the
embargoes by the end of the year, Heinbecker said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on conflict diamonds brings foreign ministers and
other officials from 20 countries involved in the diamond trade
together with human rights groups and diamond firms to discuss ways
to end the trade in so-called ''blood diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials estimate these diamonds account for only 4
percent of the world diamond trade, but human rights organizations
say that number could be as high as 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The international diamond industry adopted strict new measures
in July to stop the flow of diamond money to rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the diamond sales, however, is laced with
hypocrisy, said Greg Mills, the national director of the South
African Institute of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Countries such as the United States, are railing against the
rebel-mined diamonds, but had few qualms about buying oil from
corrupt African regimes or governments that had not been granted
international recognition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diamonds have been used to fund African guerrilla movements --
that much is undeniable. But they are also an easy campaign target
because they are viewed as less of a strategic national interest''
and more of a luxury item, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against ''blood diamonds'' runs the risk of
damaging the reputation of diamonds in general and hurting the
economies of stable African countries -- such as Botswana and
Namibia -- that depend heavily on diamond revenue to survive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The international community should instead focus on resolving
the actual conflicts, fostering honest, stable governments and
assisting the creation of well-functioning economies, he said.
International organizations should link their foreign aid to
violence-wracked African countries to proof of good governance and
lack of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Addressing the issue of diamonds addresses one of the
symptoms, rather than the root causes of conflict,'' Mills said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Ireland Visit in Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in a week, the Clinton
administration got an update Wednesday from officials involved in
the Irish peace process and discussed the possibility of President
Clinton's visiting Ireland before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration has been very much to the fore in
being of assistance to us in developing a peace process that will
be sustainable into the future,'' said Brian Cowen, the Irish
foreign minister, after a brief meeting with Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would like to visit Ireland for a final time
as president if he can help peace efforts, but the White House has
been wary of committing to a visit while the peace process was
unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped broker the 1998 peace agreement that established
a power-sharing government with representatives of pro-British
Northern Ireland unionists and Sinn Fein, the mainly Roman Catholic
party linked to the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The power-sharing government faltered earlier this year, but the
Clinton administration says it is now back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the president met with David Trimble, leader of
Northern Ireland's main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, and
Seamus Mallon, a leader of the moderate Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hostages Rescued in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine government on
Wednesday portrayed the escape of two French journalists as
vindication of its decision to use force against Muslim rebels
holding hostages in the jungles.
</P>
<P>
   The attack by thousands of elite troops on the Abu Sayyaf rebels
had been strongly criticized by French President Jacques Chirac,
who said it could endanger the 19 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The two television journalists, who had been taken captive July
9, headed home Wednesday. They credited their nighttime escape to
the army assault on the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine President Joseph Estrada beamed as he presented the
journalists at a news conference in Manila, an arm around each, as
a vindication of his decision to use force.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can see for yourself, these two gentlemen are in good
shape,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists -- Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura of
France-2 television -- were the first hostages recovered from Jolo,
a remote southern island, since Estrada ordered the military
assault Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were seized while visiting a rebel camp to interview
other hostages and escaped Tuesday evening amid confusion as the
guerrillas fled the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took the opportunity of the military pressure,'' Le Garrec
said. He said the two bolted as the rebels were crossing a road.
After hiding overnight in the jungle, they flagged down a military
truck at dawn and were taken to an army camp.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials had said initially that the military
rescued the two hostages after a clash with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 2&AMP;frac12; long months for us, but we feel very good,'' Le
Garrec said. ''Of course we are very happy today and we are in a
good shape, as you may judge, for people who have not been sleeping
for some nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Abu Sayyaf have kidnapped scores of people since
March. Most have been released, with Libya and Malaysia reportedly
paying more than $15 million for 19 foreigners. Estrada's decision
to attack the rebels last weekend has been widely supported by
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said Wednesday he would order a halt to the assault if
the other hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada also said an American hostage, Jeffrey Schilling, had
been spotted and that troops hoped to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also are holding three Malaysians, a Filipino
kidnapped from a Malaysian diving resort in April, and 12 Filipino
Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., converted to Islam in 1994 and
visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his wife on Aug. 28 and was
reportedly abducted because of an argument over religion with the
rebels. His wife was not seized.

<HEADLINE> New Antibiotics Drugs on Horizon  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A new family of bacteria killers on the horizon
for pneumonia and other diseases should offer an alternative to
standard antibiotics that have lost their punch because germs are
growing resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Medicines called macrolides are a standard treatment for many
bacterial infections that cause respiratory diseases. They include
such antibiotic warhorses as erythromycin. However, bugs like strep
and staph are growing resistant to them, as well as to the primary
backup medicines, known as quinolones.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry's latest salvo are the ketolides. They are
derived from the macrolides, but they are chemically different, so
they will kill bacteria that are resistant to macrolides.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on two varieties of ketolides were presented in Toronto
on Wednesday at an infectious diseases meeting sponsored by the
American Society for Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis Pharmaceuticals filed with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in March for permission to sell its new ketolide,
called Ketek or telithromycin. A similar drug made by Abbott
Pharmaceuticals, code named ABT-773, is also in early-stage human
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers presented 10 separate Ketek studies at the
conference involving nearly 2,500 patients. They were intended to
show that once-a-day Ketek is equivalent to other standard
antibiotics for treating a variety of bacterial diseases, including
pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and sore throats.
</P>
<P>
   Macrolides work by gumming up bacteria's ability to make new
proteins. Some bacteria elude the medicine by quickly pumping it
out before it does any harm. Because the ketolides are chemically
different, the resistant bacteria do not spit them out this way.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome J. Schentag, a pharmaceutics professor at the State
University of New York in Buffalo, noted that quinolone resistance
is a growing worry. ''A new class of antibiotics is welcome right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Craig of the University of Wisconsin called the
ketolides ''a major step'' because they give new life to the
macrolides, which have long been used and have a good safety
record.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that since Ketek is given for just five days, which
is shorter than most antibiotics, bacteria may be less likely to
grow resistant to the new drug.

<HEADLINE> Ray's Statement on Whitewater Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray issued the following statement
today:
</P>
<P>
   This Office has now concluded, with certain limited exceptions,
its investigation of the matters commonly referred to as ''Madison
Guaranty/Whitewater.'' At this time, it is appropriate, in the
public interest, and consistent with the law to inform the public
of the findings and conclusions regarding the core matters within
this Office's Madison Guaranty/Whitewater jurisdiction. Except for
limited pending matters, the Madison Guaranty/Whitewater
investigation is now closed.
</P>
<P>
   Following enactment of the Independent Counsel Reauthorization
Act of 1994, this Office was established on August 5, 1994 to
continue the work of regulatory Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske
Jr. to investigate the relationship of James B. McDougal and
President and Mrs. Clinton to Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan
Association (''Madison Guaranty''), Capital Management Services,
Inc. (''CMS''), and the Whitewater Development Corporation
(''Whitewater Development''). Eleven months ago, on October 18,
1999, the judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit's Division for Appointing Independent
Counsels appointed me as Independent Counsel with respect to all
matters within the previously ordered jurisdiction of this Office,
including the Madison Guaranty/Whitewater investigation. Since my
appointment, this Office has concluded two matters within our
jurisdiction -- matters commonly referred to as the ''FBI Files''
matter and the ''Travel Office'' matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison Guaranty/Whitewater investigation resulted in the
conviction of 12 defendants, including former Arkansas Governor Jim
Guy Tucker, Jim and Susan McDougal, and former Associate Attorney
General Webster L. Hubbell. This Office investigated whether Jim
and Susan McDougal committed any crimes in connection with Madison
Guaranty, CMS, or Whitewater Development by using control of two
financial institutions -- Madison Guaranty and Madison Bank &AMP; Trust
-- to lend money to or for the benefit of Whitewater Development and
to pay Whitewater Development financial obligations at a time when
the McDougals and the Clintons jointly owned Whitewater
Development. In May 1996, Jim and Susan McDougal were convicted in
federal court in Arkansas of various crimes involving Madison
Guaranty, CMS, and Whitewater Development. According to one federal
bank regulatory agency, the failure of Madison Guaranty cost the
taxpayers $73 million.
</P>
<P>
   This Office investigated whether President and Mrs. Clinton
knowingly participated in any criminal conduct related to Madison
Guaranty, CMS, or Whitewater Development or had any knowledge of
such conduct. This Office determined that the evidence was
insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that
either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any
criminal conduct involving Madison Guaranty, CMS, or Whitewater
Development or knew of such conduct. The evidence relating to their
testimony and conduct, in connection with this investigation and
other investigations involving the same entities, was also, in the
judgment of this Office, insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a
reasonable doubt that either of them committed any criminal
offense, including perjury (18 U.S.C. 1621) or obstruction of
justice (18 U.S.C. 1503).
</P>
<P>
   The following findings and conclusions relate to publicly
disclosed matters investigated by this Office. Information obtained
through grand jury proceedings or other confidential methods is not
included in this statement. Upon conclusion of pending matters,
this Office intends to submit to the Court a final report ''setting
forth fully and completely a description of the work'' of the
Office. 28 U.S.C. 594(h).
</P>
<P>
   1. The investigation made the following findings and
conclusions: This Office investigated whether President Clinton
gave knowingly false testimony when he testified in the 1996 trial
of Mr. McDougal, Ms. McDougal, and Governor Tucker that he ''never
borrowed any money from Madison Guaranty,'' ''[never caused anybody
to borrow any money for [his benefit,'' and ''[never ha[d any
personal loan with Madison Guaranty at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Susan McDougal's 1999 trial for criminal contempt (18 U.S.C.
402) and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1503) for her refusal to
testify about matters that included an alleged $27,600 Madison
Guaranty loan to President Clinton, the government introduced two
checks as evidence of the alleged loan. The first check was an
actual Madison Guaranty cashier's check, dated November 15, 1982,
made out to ''Bill Clinton'' in the amount of $27,600 that was
found, by happenstance, among other Madison Guaranty records in the
trunk of a car in July 1997 following a tornado. The second check
was a microfilm copy, dated August 1, 1983, from the James B.
McDougal Trustee account in the amount of $5,081.82 made out to
Madison Guaranty. The latter check was signed by Susan McDougal,
and the government presented testimony at trial that the amount of
the check was precisely equal to the amount of principal and
interest remaining due on the alleged loan at the time. The memo
line of the check contained the words ''Payoff Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither check reflected a signature or endorsement by Bill
Clinton. The backs of both checks contained bank stamps, indicating
that they had been deposited and processed. The government
presented evidence at trial that both checks were used to the
benefit of Whitewater Development. A government agent testified at
trial that the fingerprints on the $27,600 check were not
sufficiently clear to permit a comparison to any known
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence regarding this alleged
loan was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
President Clinton borrowed money from Madison Guaranty, caused
anyone to borrow money for his benefit from Madison Guaranty, or
had any personal loan at any time from Madison Guaranty.
Consequently, the evidence was, in the judgment of this Office,
insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his testimony
regarding the alleged loan was knowingly false. This Office also
investigated whether President Clinton gave knowingly false
testimony when he testified at the same trial that he did not know
of a $300,000 loan made by CMS to Susan McDougal in April 1986 that
benefitted Whitewater Development and that was the subject of Susan
McDougal's 1996 convictions for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton knew of the
loan or that his testimony regarding the loan was knowingly false.
This Office investigated whether President Clinton gave knowingly
false testimony at the same trial regarding the circumstances of
Madison Guaranty's retention of the Rose Law Firm.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton's testimony
regarding these matters was knowingly false. This Office also
investigated whether Mrs. Clinton made knowingly false statements
to the Resolution Trust Corporation regarding the relationship
between Madison Guaranty and the Rose Law Firm, as well as her own
work related to Madison Guaranty.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence, including evidence
reflected in the billing records of the Rose Law Firm, was
insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her statements
to the RTC regarding these matters were knowingly false. This
Office investigated whether Mrs. Clinton was involved in any effort
to obstruct this or other investigations by withholding relevant
evidence or information in connection with Rose Law Firm billing
records.
</P>
<P>
   On January 5, 1996, some 18 months after Mrs. Clinton received a
subpoena for all records in her possession involving Madison
Guaranty and related entities, a copy of the Rose Law Firm billing
records reflecting the Firm's and Mrs. Clinton's representation of
Madison Guaranty and related entities were produced by counsel for
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances surrounding the 18-month delay in producing
the billing records could not be established. Mr. Hubbell testified
in the Senate that he and former Deputy Counsel to the President
Vincent W. Foster Jr. had the billing records in February/March
1992. Carolyn Huber, an assistant to President Clinton, testified
in the Senate that she found certain documents in the White House
residence in August 1995 and placed them in an office where they
remained until January 1996. She also testified in the Senate that
in January 1996, she found them again and realized that those same
documents were the billing records. At that time, they were
produced to this Office.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the handling of the records between March 1992 and
August 1995 and January 1996 was inconclusive and thus was
insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any person,
including Mrs. Clinton, knowingly and wilfully possessed the
billing records with the intent to obstruct justice or that any
person, including Mrs. Clinton, gave knowingly false testimony
regarding the handling of the billing records.
</P>
<P>
   This Office investigated whether the employment of Webster L.
Hubbell by supporters of the President following Mr. Hubbell's
resignation from the Department of Justice constituted a criminal
quid pro quo to obstruct this investigation's access to truthful
testimony from Mr. Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the employment of Mr. Hubbell
constituted a criminal quid pro quo and, consequently, the evidence
was also insufficient, in the judgment of this Office, to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that President or Mrs. Clinton was
involved in any effort to provide such a quid pro quo to Mr.
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   This Office also investigated whether contacts between White
House and Treasury Department officials regarding the Resolution
Trust Corporation's criminal referrals involving Madison Guaranty
and President and Mrs. Clinton constituted an effort to obstruct
justice by corruptly influencing the handling of the referrals.
</P>
<P>
   This Office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any White House official, or
President or Mrs. Clinton, was involved in any effort to obstruct
justice in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   * * * * *
</P>
<P>
   As in the Travel Office investigation, this Office experienced
delay caused by the White House and others involving both the
production of relevant evidence and the filing of legal claims that
were ultimately rejected by the courts. Delays in obtaining
relevant evidence included Susan McDougal's refusal to testify,
despite a court order compelling her testimony, and the failure of
the White House to produce the Rose Law Firm billing records until
January 1996. Unmeritorious litigation by the White House included
its claim to an attorney/client privilege between an individual
involved in a federal criminal investigation and a government
lawyer. In re: Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 112 F.3d 910 (8th
Cir. 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the remaining matters within this Office's
Madison/Whitewater jurisdiction include pending appeals and the
continuing investigation of the White House's failure to search and
produce relevant records, including electronic mail, to this and
other investigations. Former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker's
second appeal of his conviction for conspiracy and mail fraud has
been pending before the Eighth Circuit since oral argument on
September 13, 1999. Governor Tucker's sentence of restitution for
one million dollars on his tax fraud conspiracy conviction was
remanded to the Eastern District of Arkansas for resentencing,
which is scheduled for October 27, 2000. Once these matters are
concluded, this Office intends to file a final report promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the Madison Guaranty/Whitewater investigation, with
the exception of these matters, is now closed. The investigation of
other remaining matters within the jurisdiction of this Office
continues.
</P>
<P>
   1. Under the Independent Counsel statute, a report filed with
the Special Division remains under seal until such time, if at all,
the Special Division authorizes its public release. Historically,
public release occurs only after those persons named in a report
are notified, pursuant to the statute, and have a full opportunity
to read the relevant portions of the report that pertain to them
and to prepare and file comments. This process typically takes
several months after a report is filed.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-India Relations Improving  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's prime minister suffered acute
knee pain through most of his U.S. visit and achieved no agreement
with American leaders on any major issue: not on nuclear weapons,
relations with Pakistan, economic sanctions or speedier opening of
the Indian economy.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Atal Bihari Vajpayee's 13-day trip was the
friendliest, most successful visit by an Indian leader to
Washington in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The secret ingredient was ''the feel-good factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Following President Clinton's trip to India in March -- when he
coupled his official meetings with a tiger safari and the Taj Mahal
-- Vajpayee's sojourn in Washington marked the true end of the Cold
War distrust between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''India and America can change the world,'' Clinton declared at
a lavish farewell dinner for Vajpayee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, our two nations reached out to each other as never
before,'' Vajpayee responded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mother of all banquets,'' Indian newspaper headlines
declared Tuesday. A Hindu priest's prayer before Vajpayee's address
was front-page news, as was the guest list of Indian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feel-good factor still prevails,'' bubbled New Delhi
Television reporter Rajdeep Sardesai outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was all this for real?'' The Times of India said in an
editorial Wednesday. ''If Vajpayee's American visit has acquired an
overblown look, surely there is a reason for it. Fifty years of
Indo-American estrangement have conditioned many of us to view
every U.S. action with understandable suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   The distrust began when India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal
Nehru, adopted socialist economic policies modeled on the Soviet
Union. They included state control of banks and major industries,
bans and exorbitant tariffs on imported goods that left India
technologically backward until the 1990s computer software boom.
</P>
<P>
   Those policies -- and cozy relations with Soviet leaders, Cuba's
Fidel Castro and North Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh -- continued under
Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, and subsequent Congress party
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Washington tilted toward India's rival and neighbor, Pakistan,
governed by a series of anti-communist military dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   Many Indians became anti-American. Pepsi, Coke and IBM were
kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, was
imprisoned during Indira Gandhi's state of emergency in 1975. When
he came to power, he had no stake in maintaining Congress' policies
and no pro-Soviet baggage.
</P>
<P>
   His government has moved faster than any other to end state
monopolies and push technological imports.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee returned to India and scheduled his knee replacement
surgery after the Oct. 2-4 visit of Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union disintegrated, India remained friendly
with Russia. Last month, India completed a major submarine purchase
from Russia; the air force flies mostly Soviet-made MiGs. India
last month released five Russians convicted of weapons smuggling,
but a Briton convicted in the case remains imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington, an anti-communist Pakistan is no longer
strategically important. But a Pakistan that supports Afghanistan's
Taliban regime and harbors groups Washington considers terrorists,
makes the United States -- like India -- nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that because of terrorism, ''We're all in the same
boat together. We must find a way to steer together.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, that statement was considered a major victory. It was
viewed as a semi-acknowledgement, although Pakistan was not
mentioned, of India's charges that Islamabad sponsors cross-border
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military leadership denies it. Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who overthrew an elected government last October and got barely a
handshake from Clinton at the U.N. Millennium Summit, says he only
supports the cause of those trying to wrest Kashmir away from
India.	   Vajpayee bragged on his way home that Washington had put no
pressure on India to quickly sign the nuclear test ban treaty. He
says India will probably sign it after a national consensus.
</P>
<P>
   India tested nuclear weapons in 1998, followed by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made clear that economic sanctions Clinton
imposed after the nuclear tests will remain until the treaty is
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now quite clear that Mr. Vajpayee did not make any of
the concessions expected of him -- not on the CTBT issue, not on a
dialogue with Pakistan, and certainly not on American mediation in
Kashmir,'' The Times of India said approvingly. ''On the other
hand, the U.S. seemed to have come to terms with India possessing a
nuclear arsenal.''

<HEADLINE> Bees Could Help in Alcoholism Fight  </HEADLINE>
By DANNY M. BOYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Honey bees and humans have at least one
thing in common: They both drink alcohol, and researchers want to
know whether the insects can be used to test drugs designed to curb
alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Some animals have to be injected or tricked into consuming
alcohol, but not bees. In studies, honey bees harnessed on a small
metal holder consumed solutions with various levels of ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can even get them to drink pure ethanol, and I know of no
organism that drinks pure ethanol, not even a college student,''
said Charles Abramson, a comparative psychologist at Oklahoma State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Research could determine within a few months whether bees are
suitable subjects that would allow drug companies to use fewer
vertebrates in the first line of drug testing, Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson, assistant Gina Fellows from the University of
Hertfordshire in England and other students have begun giving bees
the drug Antabuse, which makes alcoholics sick when they drink in
order to curb consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is administered gradually to bees, allowing them to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it does have an affect on the bees,'' Abramson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have been limited to the lab, but the team has begun
conducting experiments in a more natural setting, with bees living
in a hive atop a university building. The bees are trained to come
down to a third-floor window to drink and are marked for
observation before buzzing away.
</P>
<P>
   Bees and people are more alike than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Bees have a complex social structure, including language and
division of labor, that could make them similar to people in the
way they treat their problem drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The likeness might allow researchers to come up with more ways
to treat alcoholism, Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said naturalist John Lubbock found in experiments in 1888
that ants puzzled by the drunken behavior of a nest mate would
nonetheless pick up the sot and carry it home. A drunken stranger
ant would be tossed in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   So far, tests have shown that alcohol impairs bee locomotion and
learning ability, just as it does in people. Overconsumption of
ethanol kills bees just as overconsumption of alcohol can kill
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson has collaborated on research into the effects of
insecticides on learning in the Africanized honey bee. He published
preliminary findings on bees and alcohol consumption last month in
the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.

<HEADLINE> Robinson To Address Human Rights  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Globalization can make things better for the whole
world only if the rich and powerful link it tightly to respect for
human rights, the United Nations rights chief said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until now, human rights have been irrelevant'' in the move to
clear obstacles to trade and business, Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said she would confront global financial leaders with
her message about human rights at next week's meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers have been unaware of the human rights
commitments under international law that their own governments have
made, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was done by another arm of government as a kind of foreign
policy hoping nobody would ever pin them to it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that in Prague ''what I will be saying is a quite
simple message really -- that the international human rights norms
and standards are part of the rules of the road to shape
globalization and make it fairer and make it work for people.''
</P>
<P>
   So far globalization has been shaped primarily by opening up
markets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result is the globalization that we have, which is unfair
and divisive and marginalizing and making it worse for vulnerable
sectors of population and for least-developed countries,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's ours for the shaping.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said there was a ''big window of opportunity'' to
advance the cause of human rights because of widespread concerns
that the globalization of the world's economy was leaving a lot of
poorer countries and individuals behind.
</P>
<P>
   There has been wide debate between rich and poor countries about
whether standards of human rights should be taken into account as
the world moves toward more opportunities for free trade between
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some developing countries say human rights often improve along
with standards of living and that rich nations are using human
rights concerns as a smoke screen to keep from opening their own
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a former president of Ireland, said she believed human
rights should always be taken into account, and that the private
sector would play an increasing role in putting pressure on nations
to meet their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If chief executives of corporations considering investing in a
country are versed with the covenants and conventions that that
country has subscribed to and talk that language, it will make a
huge difference to the perception of the government of how relevant
a good human rights record is to attracting investment and to their
development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson admitted that there was still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are 15 years behind the environment debate. Corporations
have seen the relevance of environmental standards, of clean air,
of having good environmental policies. The debate on human rights
is just as relevant but only just beginning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I will be arguing is that international human rights
norms and standards are deeply relevant, that they are compulsory
not optional, and that the more effective we make the enforcement
of that, the more we shape fairer, more equitable, more
transparent, more people-centered fruits of globalization.''

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter China Campaign Begins  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Children across China are being primed for a
revolution, this time through the bewitching world of boy wizard
Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   A publicity and printing campaign unprecedented for China began
this week to introduce the globally popular Harry Potter book
series to a Chinese audience. If the plan works, Harry Potter -- or
''Ha-li Bo-te'' as he is known in Chinese -- could be the biggest
thing since Chairman Mao's little red book, and shake up the staid,
preachy world of Chinese children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children's literature in China is too earnest. Things that
inspire the imagination are too few. Bringing Harry Potter to China
is a kind of breakthrough,'' said Ma Ainong, one of four
translators, all women, working on the series.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherding the ambitious undertaking is the stately,
state-owned People's Literature Publishing House. Its editors
compressed into four months the translation, marketing and
distribution of the first three of the four books in author J.K.
Rowling's series for a planned Oct. 6 launch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' ''Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets'' and ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban'' will be released as a boxed set in a first-run of 600,000
volumes -- the largest first printing for a commercial release ever
in China, said editor Wang Ruiqin.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Wang and colleagues battled adversaries worthy of
the dark sorcery fictional Harry and his wizard-school classmates
face: nervous bureaucrats, skeptical literary critics and canny
black-marketeers. The endeavor says much about China's publishing
industry and its competition for readers.
</P>
<P>
   People's Literature bested a dozen or so firms to become the
36th foreign publisher of Harry Potter, paying as much as $165,000
-- a dear sum in China -- for the Chinese rights. Wang wouldn't
disclose the actual price.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the investment, proofs have been guarded, special
light green paper was used for printing and the boxed set's
packaging has been kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Already, pirated Potters have appeared. The Beijing Youth Daily
reported finding translations of all four books in a small
bookstore recently. Suspiciously, the books carried the names of a
translator of Taiwan's Chinese edition and the Tibet Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what I've feared all along,'' said Wang. Although the
Taiwanese publisher and the Tibet company denied involvement, Wang
said the pirated books forced her to consider moving up the launch
date.
</P>
<P>
   This week, People's Literature sent pamphlets with the first
book's 12th and 17th chapters to bookstores. The China Children's
News carried the 12th chapter in its Wednesday editions,
distributed to nearly 1.2 million primary and secondary schools. A
Web site is being prepared to entice readers, offering them
wizardry graduate certificates for answering questions about the
books.
</P>
<P>
   All the hoopla has left critics wondering whether ''Ha-li
Bo-te'' will sell to an audience raised on politically correct fare
of a very different kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be as successful as in the West,'' said Chen Xiaomei,
an editor of the Chinese Readers News. ''All this talk of
sorcerers, spells and phantasms is from the Western literary
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese children like to read about beautiful, pure things.
The stories are very simple, not so complicated,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   A small test-market audience -- the children of publishing house
executives -- felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''While reading the first book, I really wanted to read the
second,'' said Liu Muran, an 11-year-old sixth grader and son of
People's Literature's distribution chief. ''My heart was thumping
beng-beng.''
</P>
<P>
   The translators and editors found much in Harry Potter that will
resonate with Chinese readers. Translators drew on China's
2,500-year-old tradition of ghost stories and current pulp martial
arts fiction. For Harry's magical spells, they alluded to
incantations legendary kung-fu masters recited before fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the most relaxed and happy translation experience I
ever have had,'' said Ma, the translator. She previously rendered
''Anne of Green Gables'' into Chinese, and her partners have
translated ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer,'' among other titles.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to remain faithful to Rowling while giving her words life
in Chinese, the translators hewed to their original sounds.
''Muggle'' -- ordinary humans who aren't sorcerers -- becomes
''ma-gua,'' playing on a Chinese idiom for stupidity. Less
successful is ''Hogwarts,'' the wizardry school. ''Huo-ge-wo-ce''
carries none of the allusions of the original to either the beast
or a witch's brew ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the talk about spells and incantations sent in-house
government censors querying whether the books might promote the
occult in the midst of the communist government's campaign against
superstition and the outlawed Falun Gong sect.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said, 'Don't the books have to do with magic?' But we had
read the books and told them it promotes the 'three goods''' --
kindness, courage and loyalty, said People's Literature editor Ye
Xianlin.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Aide to Duchess of York Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police on Wednesday arrested the Duchess of York's
former personal assistant on suspicion of murder after her
millionaire boyfriend was found stabbed to death at their London
home.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day search, police found Jane Andrews, 33, sitting
in her car, which was parked at dawn by a highway in Cornwall,
southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Alan Mobbs, spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police, said
she was found ''in a distressed state.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was taken by police to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth to
undergo medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   The body of her boyfriend, Tom Cressman, was found by a work
associate on Monday. Police said he died from a single stab wound
in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Chief Inspector Jim Dickie said that officers were
keeping an open mind as to the circumstances of Cressman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Cressman, 39, ran a successful business supplying covers for
classic cars and was a business partner of former racing driver Sir
Stirling Moss. Andrews and Cressman had been together for two
years, and had recently returned from a vacation in France and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was the duchess's dresser and accounts manager, and also
a close companion who traveled with her on foreign trips.
</P>
<P>
   She made headlines in 1995 after jewelry worth $325,000 was
stolen from one of the duchess's suitcases, which Andrews had
checked onto an airplane in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews discovered the theft when she opened the bag on their
return home. The jewelry -- a diamond necklace and bracelet given to
the duchess as a wedding gift from Queen Elizabeth II -- had been
stolen by a baggage handler. It was later recovered and returned to
the duchess.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the duchess's employ, Andrews has worked in the
London fashion industry and most recently was employed by a leading
London jewelry store.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was divorced from her husband, Christopher Dunn-Butler,
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Mirror newspaper quoted the duchess, the former
Sarah Ferguson, as saying she was ''overwhelmed and shocked'' at
Cressman's killing and the ensuing police hunt for Andrews, who
worked for her from 1988 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess, or Fergie as she is known in the tabloid press, was
married to the queen's second son, Prince Andrew, in 1986. The
couple divorced in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Missile Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials on Wednesday confirmed the armed
forces had conducted tests of an anti-missile missile that would
guard against short-range rocket attacks, but would not comment on
a report one of the weapons had crashed into its launcher shortly
after it was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said a Russian S-300 air-defense
missile had turned upside down but by ''fantastic luck'' had failed
to explode after crashing back into its launcher, which was just
200 yards from a launcher containing another missile.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Defense Ministry and Air Force on Wednesday
confirmed that the exercises had taken place, but did not confirm
the report that a missile had crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashuluk training grounds in the Astrakhan region, some 800
miles south of Moscow, were cordoned off by troops after the
accident, Moskovsky Komsomolets said. The accident appeared to have
been caused by the failure of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Defense-2000'' exercises in the Astrakhan region last week
were held to practice shooting down tactical missiles, the daily
Izvestia reported. The S-300 is designed to defend specific targets
-- a much smaller system than the nationwide anti-ballistic missile
defense that the United States is working on.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says its proposed system would serve to guard against
threats from countries such as North Korea and Iran. Moscow opposes
the U.S. plan, saying it would alter the balance of power that has
helped prevent a nuclear conrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Simonov, general director of the Russian Agency for
Navigation Systems, said several types of missiles were tested and
the results would set the course for future development.

<HEADLINE> Israel: West Nile Virus An Epidemic  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Health authorities declared West Nile virus
infection an epidemic Wednesday, saying the mosquito-borne illness
has killed 13 people in Israel this summer and infected thousands
more.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has been around in Israel for decades, but had not
been seen in the Western Hemisphere until last year, when it killed
seven people in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is the first country to have declared an epidemic since
the virus spread to the United States. The virus is also found in
Africa, other Middle Eastern countries, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It can lead to encephalitis, a swelling of the brain, but most
people recover. The elderly and sick are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess thousands have been infected. There are 160 confirmed
cases, but those are mainly patients who came to the hospitals,''
said Dr. Silvio Pitlik, director of internal medicine and
infectious disease at Rabin Medical Center and an adviser to the
government on how to combat the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ''For each of these patients, there are maybe 10 or 20 with the
mild symptoms of the disease,'' he said. Symptoms include fever,
rashes and aching muscles.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most cases are concentrated in Israel's central coastal
plain and have not reached outlying or hilly areas, including
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing that infections have reached epidemic
proportions, health officials on Wednesday asked Israelis to take
extra precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent
and wearing long sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   A few communities have been dusting against mosquitoes. However,
the Environment Ministry has vetoed blanket dusting, saying air
quality concerns must be taken into consideration as well.
</P>
<P>
   This year's outbreak was the worst in Israel in several years,
said Pitlik. He said there was no clear-cut explanation, but that
experts suspected it could be linked to changing patterns in bird
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have said the virus was probably brought to
Israel by wild birds migrating from Europe to Africa. Concerned by
the cases in Israel, neighboring Jordan has asked hospitals and
clinics throughout the kingdom to notify the Health Ministry if any
cases were detected.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has been known in Israel for decades. Outbreaks were
recorded among Israeli soldiers in the 1950s and 1980s. Some 15
percent of Israelis have antibodies against the virus, indicating
they had it in the past. All the wild birds tested in Israel's
national parks carry the antibodies, health officials said.

<HEADLINE> Inhalable Insulin Plans Brighten  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prospects that inhaled insulin may one day
allow some diabetics to live without needles looked brighter
Wednesday when researchers reported that inhaling seems to work for
at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists had only studied how safe and effective it
is to inhale insulin for three months. Early tests were
encouraging, but it wasn't known what would happen if people took
it for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   The results, the first examination of the long-term effects of
inhaled insulin, indicated inhaling is as effective as injecting,
and it doesn't damage the lungs. The next, final stage of research
will have to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented at a conference of the European
Association for the Study of Diabetes in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say some diabetics, such as those whose bodies do not
make insulin, known as Type I diabetes, may not be able to live
without needles, but could be able to reduce their daily
injections.
</P>
<P>
   Eleazar Shafrir, a professor of biochemistry at Hadassah
University Hospital in Jerusalem, who was not connected with the
research, said he doubted inhaled insulin could entirely replace
injections.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be effective for long-range treatment of
patients,'' Shafrir said, adding that an alternative to injections
would be most useful for children who are likely to develop Type I
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Some children have diabetes antibodies and a genetic
predisposition to developing Type I diabetes and studies have
indicated that insulin shots can head off the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalers could also provide an alternative to injections for
diabetics who need a rapid boost of insulin in an emergency,
Shafrir said.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 million people -- 2 percent of the global population --
have diabetes. Experts expect the number of cases to exceed 250
million by 2025 as obesity and unhealthy lifestyles take their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of diabetes. Type I occurs suddenly as a
result of an immune system problem which destroys the body's
ability to make insulin, a hormone that takes sugar in the blood to
tissues to be used for energy. It usually strikes in childhood and
afflicts about 15 million people, who now need regular insulin
injections for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Type II diabetes develops gradually and accounts for about 90
percent of all diabetes. It happens when the body doesn't use
insulin properly. It is strongly linked to obesity and is
increasingly found in adolescents and children. About 40 percent of
those with Type II diabetes eventually have to take regular insulin
injections.
</P>
<P>
   The study, involving 114 patients, found that Type I diabetics
were able to reduce their daily injections from two or three to
one.
</P>
<P>
   People with Type II who were already taking insulin got the same
benefit from the inhaler, also replacing all but one of their daily
injections, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   A third group, people with Type II diabetes who were not doing
well on pills and would otherwise need injections, were able to
avoid needles altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements of sugar in the blood and the dose of insulin
needed were comparable for injected and inhaled insulin and
remained constant over the two years, said the study's lead
investigator, Dr. William Cefalu, a professor of medicine at the
University of Vermont College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Lung performance remained the same during the two years and
tests showed no abnormalities, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, inhaled insulin does not appear to have adverse
effects on the lungs, and it works, and it appears to be
sustained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts challenged the inhaled insulin's
performance and questioned its safety, saying it should bring blood
sugar levels lower and the study could not measure lurking lung
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Cefalu said the next phase of research into the drug, made by
Pfizer and Aventis, will tackle those issues, but he believed any
lung damage would likely have surfaced by now.
</P>
<P>
   Other alternatives to injections being investigated include
nasal inhalers, mouth sprays, patches with mini-needles,
implantable insulin pumps and transplants of cells that make
insulin.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pressures on Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia is stepping up its opposition to the United
Nations' sanctions against Iraq with new challenges aimed at
undermining the rules and bringing Saddam Hussein's regime out of
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled airline Aeroflot is negotiating with Iraq
on resuming flights to Baghdad, and Russian business executives
have flown to the Iraqi capital for talks on reviving trade.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long claimed that the sanctions don't work, but
avoided confrontation with the United States and Britain, the two
main supporters of the controls. Moscow has changed its strategy in
recent weeks, encouraged by growing international questioning of
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has a lot to gain by aiding Iraq, a Soviet-era ally and
important customer. The cash-strapped Russian government hopes
helping to end sanctions will mean lucrative oil and weapons
contracts with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia has gotten frustrated that its urges to revise the
sanction regime were not getting positive responses from the
western members of the United Nations,'' said Boris Makarenko, an
analyst with the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Aeroflot officials say only technical issues remain to be
resolved before flights are resumed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain oppose the resumption of air
service between Moscow and Baghdad, arguing that civil flights to
Iraq constitute an economic resource, and therefore violate the
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The United
Nations said sanctions would remain in place until its observers
verify Baghdad has dismantled all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it strictly observes the sanctions, but claims that
the rules do not explicitly prohibit civilian flights.
</P>
<P>
   ''As before, we take the standpoint that in the corresponding
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council there are no bans on
carrying out regular passenger flights to Baghdad, and we will be
ready to restore them as soon as possible,'' the Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Moscow has been encouraged by signs of other
nations opposing the sanctions. Jordan has also considered resuming
air service, while Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez got red-carpet
treatment in a defiant visit to Baghdad last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Russians are seeing an opening where they can take
the position to what's a little closer to what they would like to
do without it being quite as dangerous vis-a-vis their relations to
the United States,'' said Phyllis Bennis, a fellow of the Institute
for Policy Studies in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegations from Russian government agencies and
state-controlled oil companies have made trips to Iraq in recent
months. Russia has also sent humanitarian missions to Iraq without
awaiting permission from the U.N. sanctions committee -- though it
got U.N. permission for the latest flight, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the humanitarian missions have been mixed with Russia's
business and political interests. The Sunday shipment of medicine
was accompanied by a delegation from pipeline company
Stroytransgaz, which wants to boost ties and possibly open an
office in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Russian companies say they are doing what makes good business
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aeroflot does not get involved in politics -- our job is to
carry passengers,'' said Alexander Lopukhin, deputy director of
Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
   Resuming flights would boost Russia's status in Iraq. And
President Vladimir Putin wants Iraq to pay back some $8 billion on
Soviet-era debt.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges to the sanctions began under former President Boris
Yeltsin, but Putin shows signs of wanting to step up Moscow's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is strong pressure to develop ties with Iraq, and it is
a large debtor,'' said Alexander Pikayev, an analyst with the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''Putin needs somehow
to react to that.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Battle in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan and India traded heavy
artillery and mortar fire for the third straight day Wednesday on
the frontier in disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan said seven civilians were killed and 11 injured
Wednesday when India fired some 600 shells on the Dudhnail hamlet
in northern Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides both described heavy fighting Tuesday night in a
nearby region known as the Lipa sector.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan said India launched the assault with up to 80 troops,
but claimed the Indians retreated after 14 of their soldiers were
killed, and eight were seriously wounded. India's Defense Ministry
said 10 Pakistani commandos and one Indian soldier were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan said its forces also repulsed an Indian attack in the
area before dawn Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides routinely issue conflicting claims following the
almost daily skirmishes in the divided Himalayan territory. Both
sides have reported heavier than normal fighting in Kashmir in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict often heats up in the fall, as Kashmiri guerrilla
fighters try to infiltrate Indian territory, and Indian forces try
to stop them, before the winter snows restrict movement in the
mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been the
flashpoint for two wars between the two countries since they won
independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmiri militants opposed to Indian rule of the territory have
been waging an insurgency for 11 years. India says Pakistan arms
and trains the militants, a charge Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan insists it provides only moral and political support,
though it also permits militant groups to operate from its
territory.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Sharply Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chips led the stock market lower Wednesday
as investors again worried about rising oil prices and their impact
on corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average,
furthering a week-long decline, tumbled 157.23 to 10,632.06 after
being down more than 200 points in earlier trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators also fell sharply. The Nasdaq composite index
slipped 42.51 to 3,823.13, giving back some of its 139-point
advance of Tuesday, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 22.75 at
1,437.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that oil prices are now about $36 per barrel has
probably become a temporary roadblock for the market,'' said Tom
Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities. ''I think the majority of investor concern is over
corporate profits, but I think there's been some anxiety over how
long and how oil prices have moved higher, and further anxieties
about outcome of the president election.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those doubts, Galvin said the news Wednesday that the U.S.
trade deficit had soared to a record $31.9 billion in July -- in
part because of high oil prices -- would not come as much of a
surprise to the market, which already is reacting to the rising
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
persistent worries about corporate profits as the economy shows
increasing signs that it is slowing down. Higher oil prices are
also adding to investor uncertainty, particularly in the case of
large manufacturers, who rely heavily on fuel for production .
</P>
<P>
   A barrel of light sweet crude traded at $37.40 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again shunned stocks whose companies warned of
unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, specialty chemicals company Polyone fell $1.69
to $7, a nearly 19 percent drop, after it warned of lower corporate
profits because of higher energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation company CNF slid $1.81 to $23.25 after the
company said third-quarter earnings would be below analyst
estimates because of a slowdown in its air freight business.
</P>
<P>
   And Sprint fell $7.56 to $33.25, a more than 18 percent drop,
after the telecommunications company said earnings will be lower
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even energy-related stocks, which tend to do well when oil
prices are rising, dragged. Halliburton declined $1.13 to $49.44.
Baker Hughes fell 38 cents to $35.75.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, online financial news provider thestreet.com
tumbled $1.31 to $4.81, a 21 percent drop, after saying its profits
would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But chipmaker Intel traded up $1.67 at $62.05, a day after a
Banc of America Securities analyst upgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   E-billing company Alysis also rose $1.13 to $3.50 on news it had
signed a deal to bundle its software with some of computer company
IBM's products.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 733.27
million shares, ahead of the 674.52 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.88 to 518.43.

<HEADLINE> Dems Call for More Schools Built  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats, joined by Clinton
administration officials and GOP allies, said Wednesday that
Congress should approve money to rebuild deteriorating schools
before lawmakers finish work for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The richest, most powerful country there has ever been should
not be educating its children in closets,'' Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said at a news conference in support of a measure
that would provide $24.8 billion in zero-interest school
modernization bonds over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, said they would resist any new program
that required local schools to spend federal money in a specific
way. ''There's a profound philosophical difference between
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.,
chairman of the House Appropriations panel on education. ''The
president's approach wants Washington control.''
</P>
<P>
   The school construction issue is expected to be central to
negotiations between the White House and GOP leaders on the
remaining budget bills for fiscal 2001 that must be passed before
Congress can adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans oppose President Clinton's top educational
priorities -- targeting federal funds to reduce class sizes and
build new schools -- saying they would increase federal bureaucracy
and control over local schools. They prefer easing federal mandates
and providing grants that states and local schools could use in
ways they feel are most appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The school bond legislation, sponsored by Reps. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., and Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., would subsidize $24.8 billion
in bonds, with the federal government providing tax credits for the
interest normally paid on a bond.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allocate 60 percent to states based on school-age
population, with the rest directed to the 125 school districts with
the largest number of low-income students. The estimated five-year
cost to the federal government would be $1.74 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has 228 co-sponsors, a majority, and Rangel said that
''with the Clinton administration laying down the gauntlet, I am
confident congressional leaders will finally give this issue the
attention it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Any final budget agreement worth its salt between Congress and
the administration must include this tax proposal,'' Education
Secretary Richard Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, the House passed, 222-201, a
non-binding Democratic motion to restore to an education spending
bill now in a House-Senate conference some $3 billion the president
wants to reduce class size and build schools. Eighteen Republicans
joined in supporting the motion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., top Democrat on the Appropriations
Committee, said Democrats don't object to a GOP-backed funding of
$3.1 billion in block grants that school districts can use
according to their needs. But ''this country is healthy enough and
prosperous enough to fund both your priorities and ours.''
</P>
<P>
   States need $322 billion for school construction -- roughly 10
times what they currently spend and nearly three times what the
federal government has estimated, according to a National Education
Association survey of state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4094

<HEADLINE> Japanese Bank Pres. Commits Suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The new president of Nippon Credit Bank, appointed
to revive the ailing bank under a privatization deal, committed
suicide by hanging himself from a curtain rod in an Osaka hotel
room, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tadayo Honma, 60, was found hanging with a rope round his neck
by his secretary, said Noboru Kakei, a duty officer at the Sonezaki
police station in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Kakei said the former central bank executive left several
suicide notes, but their contents were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Honma was in Osaka, a commercial center in western Japan, to
visit local bank branches and business partners, Japanese media
reported. Nippon Credit Bank officials could not be reached
immediately for comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, Honma was named Nippon Credit Bank president under a
deal transferring control of the bank from the state to a private
consortium led by Internet investor Softbank Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon Credit Bank was taken over by the state in 1998 after it
collapsed because of bad loans. The bank had at least $28.8 billion
in stock valuation losses and unrecoverable or high-risk loans.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already pumped in about $27 billion to cover
the bad loans and more public cash is slated for the bank, which is
to be renamed Aozora Bank next year.
</P>
<P>
   Suicides in Japan are at a record high, driven up in part by the
county's prolonged economic slump. Nationwide, some 33,048 people
killed themselves in 1999, up from 32,863 in 1998, police said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Kharrazi Can Tour Colleges  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In another gesture to Iran, the Clinton
administration has approved visits to American colleges by Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi, the highest-ranked official from Tehran
permitted to travel widely in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's consistent with our people-to-people exchanges, with our
desire to foster a dialogue between the United States and Iranian
people,'' the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Wednesday. ''This is completely consistent with what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kharazzi visited the Kennedy School at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Mass., on Monday to arrange for exchanges of scholars.
He spoke to students and faculty members. On Thursday, he is due at
UCLA in Los Angeles to speak to students and also Iranian-Americans
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other college visits, each of which needs specific
U.S. approval. At this point, Kharrazi, who was given a visa to
attend U.N. meetings in New York, has not made further requests.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said ''we have had some easing of the embargo on Iran to
allow people-to-people exchanges and contacts to the benefit of
Iranian people and Americans. We do think that we can continue to
expand this policy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Boucher said Iranian support for terrorism had not
declined, nor had U.S. concern with Iran's pursuit of weapons of
mass destruction and opposition to peacemaking in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton asked Russian President Vladimir Putin at the
U.N. Millennium Summit two weeks ago in New York to shelve a
proposed Russian sale of laser technology to Iran because of
concern it could be used in a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mohammad Khatami as Iran's President three years
ago, and a perception that he was a force for moderation, prompted
the Clinton administration to pursue a dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright participated
with Kharazzi at the United Nations in an eight-nation meeting on
Afghanistan. It was the first time U.S. and Iranian officials on
that level had worked together since Iranian militants overran the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   They took 53 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she and Kharrazi were on opposite sides of a
horseshoe-shaped table and did not have a direct conversation
during the session.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Albright said she was pleased that Iran and the
United States took the same stand deploring Afghanistan's drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Wednesday there were some ''positive signs'' in
Iran, election of moderate candidates to the parliament, support
for reform and ''the movement of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try to reciprocate in the people-to-people
fashion,'' the U.S. official said. ''We have no problem with
people-to-people contacts between the United States and Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Iranian officials also have traveled in the United States
in the last two years with U.S. approval. But Kharrazi is the
highest-ranked official given permission, another U.S. official
said.

<HEADLINE> New Antibiotic Drugs on Horizon  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A new family of bacteria killers on the horizon
for pneumonia and other diseases should offer an alternative to
standard antibiotics that have lost their punch because germs are
growing resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Medicines called macrolides are a standard treatment for many
bacterial infections that cause respiratory diseases. They include
such antibiotic warhorses as erythromycin. However, bugs like strep
and staph are growing resistant to them, as well as to the primary
backup medicines, known as quinolones.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry's latest salvo are the ketolides. They are
derived from the macrolides, but they are chemically different, so
they will kill bacteria that are resistant to macrolides.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on two varieties of ketolides were presented in Toronto
on Wednesday at an infectious diseases meeting sponsored by the
American Society for Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis Pharmaceuticals filed with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in March for permission to sell its new ketolide,
called Ketek or telithromycin. A similar drug made by Abbott
Pharmaceuticals, code named ABT-773, is also in early-stage human
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers presented 10 separate Ketek studies at the
conference involving nearly 2,500 patients. They were intended to
show that once-a-day Ketek is equivalent to other standard
antibiotics for treating a variety of bacterial diseases, including
pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and sore throats.
</P>
<P>
   Macrolides work by gumming up bacteria's ability to make new
proteins. Some bacteria elude the medicine by quickly pumping it
out before it does any harm. Because the ketolides are chemically
different, the resistant bacteria do not spit them out this way.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome J. Schentag, a pharmaceutics professor at the State
University of New York in Buffalo, noted that quinolone resistance
is a growing worry. ''A new class of antibiotics is welcome right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Craig of the University of Wisconsin called the
ketolides ''a major step'' because they give new life to the
macrolides, which have long been used and have a good safety
record.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that since Ketek is given for just five days, which
is shorter than most antibiotics, bacteria may be less likely to
grow resistant to the new drug.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues With Highway Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel pressed ahead Wednesday with a highway
around Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem, handing out eviction
notices to Arab landowners even as negotiators for both sides
resumed low-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians pledged to stop the highway project, charging that
Israel intends to confiscate more than 250 acres of Palestinian
land, though Israel might end up handing parts to the Palestinians
in peace negotiations now in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts between Israel and the Palestinians sputtered on with
no progress reported, after Israel suspended the talks Tuesday and
then quickly renewed them.
</P>
<P>
   Hindering the talks is a dispute over control of holy sites in
the Old City of Jerusalem. Palestinians complain Israel is blocking
them from renovating Islamic holy sites there.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has started giving eviction notices to Arab landowners to
make room for a superhighway around the city, Jerusalem official
Hagai Elias confirmed. He said compensation would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The project, called the ring road, is an Israeli plan to reduce
congestion in Jerusalem, plagued by narrow streets and constant
traffic jams. The road around the west side of the city, where Jews
live, is mostly completed.
</P>
<P>
   Building the ring around Jerusalem by encircling Palestinian
neighborhoods is a political scheme, not a transportation plan,
said Ziad Abu-Zayyad, a Palestinian Cabinet minister who deals with
Jerusalem affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to ''make east Jerusalem an integral part of west
Jerusalem,'' Abu-Zayyad told The Associated Press. He said the
Palestinian Authority would take steps to force Israel to halt
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Israel annexed the Arab section of the city two weeks after
capturing it in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel used to claim all of
Jerusalem inside the expanded 1967 boundaries as its capital.
However, in recent negotiations, Israel has offered the
Palestinians control of Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Meir Margalit, a member of the Jerusalem city council, said the
road would allow Palestinians to drive from one section of the West
Bank to another without going through Jerusalem, but Israel should
have consulted the Palestinians about the plan. ''They did it the
wrong way,'' he said. He suggested narrowing the road to reduce
damage to Palestinian houses.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official who did not want his name used said the road
could be discussed in Israel-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Husseini, director of the Islamic Trust that runs the
mosque compound, charged Wednesday that Israel is preventing the
renovation of Islamic holy sites on the disputed hill. Israel has
been stopping trucks with building materials from entering the
compound, also the site of the biblical Jewish Temples.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis say the Muslims are destroying Jewish sites in
their construction work on the disputed hill, known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, the Noble
Sanctuary. Both sides claim sovereignty there.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat met Wednesday with lawyer
Gilead Sher, representing the Israeli side, after Israel canceled
their meeting a day earlier. In a series of confused signals,
Israel first said it was suspending the talks, then said the
contacts were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said there have been no real
negotiations since Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat turned down
American proposals at the failed Camp David summit in July. He said
if Arafat agrees to discuss the ideas, negotiations will resume.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in a volatile session
Wednesday amid persistent concerns about rising oil prices and
corporate profits. Blue chips fell sharply while technology issues
moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average traded down 75.84 at 10,713.45
in late trading after dropping nearly 220 points earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-tech focused Nasdaq composite index was up 34.93 at
3,900.57 after being down most of the day. And the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 was off 7.57 after 1,452.33, but was also up from its
lows of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a terribly horrible day going on until the later
afternoon when we had a nice turnaround,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''But the market rallied nicely.
You can attribute some of that to the price of oil trading down a
little bit. I also think there's clearly some bargain hunting going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
worries about corporate profits as the economy shows increasing
signs that it is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the markets Wednesday were more erratic than usual, with all
the major indexes recording significant swings.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, which is trading at decade-high levels, is one of the
reasons for the swings, said Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at
Donaldson, Lufikin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. A barrel of light sweet
crude traded at $37.50 Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the majority of investor concern is over corporate
profits, but I think there's been some anxiety over how long and
how oil prices have moved higher, and further anxieties about
outcome of the president election,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those doubts, Galvin said the news Wednesday that the U.S.
trade deficit had soared to a record $31.9 billion in July -- in
part because of high oil prices -- would not come as much of a
surprise to the market, which already is reacting to the rising
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, the Jefferies analyst, also said some of the blue chip
struggles can be blamed on weakness in the euro, the chief European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beverage stocks, Coke and Pepsi, are getting beat up
because of the currency effect. They're multinationals and do more
than 50 percent of their business overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was down $4.29 to $49.94. Pepsi fell $1.95 to $41.94.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again shunned stocks whose companies warned of
unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, specialty chemicals company Polyone fell $1.63
to $7.31, a nearly 19 percent drop, after it warned of lower
profits because of higher energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $7.31 to $33.50, an 18 percent drop, after the
telecommunications company said earnings will be lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even energy-related stocks, which tend to do well when oil
prices are rising, dragged. Halliburton declined $1.563 to $49.
Baker Hughes fell 63 cents to $35.50.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, online financial news provider thestreet.com
tumbled $1.13 to $5, an 18 percent drop, after saying its profits
would not meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But chipmaker Intel traded up $2.56 at $62.94, a day after a
Banc of America Securities analyst upgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   E-billing company Alysis also rose 81 cents to $3.19 on news it
had signed a deal to bundle its software with some of computer
company IBM's products.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 894.79
million shares, ahead of the 789.63 million in the previous
session.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The record-breaking economy grew solidly in
the late summer but there were additional signs the breakneck pace
of earlier months was slowing, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's latest survey of business activity around the country,
based on reports from its 12 regional banks, said home sales and
construction activity, which have been engines of the vibrant
economy, continued to soften in August and early September.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity and has been the biggest driver of robust growth -- ''was
flat to modestly higher'' in August compared with late spring and
early summer, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers will use the survey when they meet Oct. 3 to
review their stance on interest rates. A spate of recent economic
reports indicate that the Fed's six interest-rate increases over
the last 15 months are working to cool growth.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports, along with the survey, are bolstering analysts'
belief that the Fed is through raising interest rates for this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more evidence the economic situation is stable enough
for the Fed to be on hold,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of
Waldman Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the present time, the tightening that we have seen has
impacted growth moderately and has slowed it down,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, known as the ''beige book'' for the color of its
cover, is based on information collected before Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in August and
early September even though further signs of slowing growth were
noted in several districts,'' the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe the economy has slowed in the current
third quarter to a growth rate of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent,
compared with the vigorous 5.3 percent rate posted in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Even with evidence that the economy is cooling a bit, the Fed
said the nation's labor market continues to be tight, meaning
companies are scrambling for workers. New York, for instance, cited
a ''severe shortage of computer 'techies' as well as unmet demand
for office workers,'' according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   And, there were widespread reports of employers boosting wages
to recruit and retain workers. Companies in New York said salaries
for office workers were up more than 10 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Fed said there were few indications that such wage
increases were being passed along to consumers in the form of
higher product prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher productivity and competitive pressures held firms'
prices in check,'' the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy gains in productivity -- the amount of output for each
hour of work -- means companies can pay employees more, hold the
line on prices and still deliver increased profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several districts indicated that the recent sharp
increases in health care and energy costs ''might eventually be
passed through to consumers,'' the survey said
</P>
<P>
   Observed Waldman: ''Stresses on the economy such as the tight
labor market remain but for now they aren't worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   In another report, the U.S. trade deficit soared to a record
$31.9 billion in July as oil prices climbed to a 10-year high, the
Commerce Department said. America set record deficits with China,
Japan, Western Europe and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Malpractice Victims Lobby Congress  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PACE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California man whose wife died during
cosmetic surgery in 1997 urged Congress on Wednesday to open a
secret government database that tracks disciplinary actions and
malpractice payments by physicians and other health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the House Commerce Committee, Ruben Fernandez
said his wife would not have chosen Dr. William Earle Matory Jr. to
perform a face lift, liposuction and other procedures if she had
known that he had been sued for malpractice four times previously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe if I had been provided access to the National
Practitioner Data Bank, it would have saved the life of my beloved
Judy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Board ultimately ruled that Matory had
been ''grossly negligent and incompetent'' in the death of Judy
Fernandez and revoked his license.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was joined at Wednesday's hearing by two other medical
malpractice victims who told lawmakers they had been victimized by
doctors because they had no way of discovering adverse information
in their backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such information is maintained in the National Practitioner Data
Bank, which was created by a 1986 federal law that requires
insurance companies, hospitals and state and federal regulators to
report malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against all
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   But the law prohibits public disclosure of identities of the
providers, limiting access to insurance companies, hospitals and
federal and state health regulators.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press review of the public version of the data
bank -- with the names removed -- found that nearly 500 doctors and
dentists across the country have been slapped with at least 10
disciplinary actions and malpractice payments over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News, The Hartford Courant and the AP also
have used the public version of the database and court records to
identify doctors with large numbers of malpractice payments or
disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, introduced legislation earlier this month to open the
data bank to the public and expand its reach to include all felony
and some misdemeanor convictions of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors routinely require consumers to give patient histories
before treatment,'' Bliley said. ''I think that patients should
have the right to obtain physician histories before placing their
very lives in the hands of a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley has vowed to push for House passage of the legislation
before Congress adjourns for the year, but it has attracted little
support within his committee. Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,
challenged Bliley on Wednesday to bring it to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want the world to know how few members of the Commerce
Committee will vote for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused Bliley of introducing the legislation and
using the hearing to punish the American Medical Association, the
main doctors' lobby, for supporting patients rights legislation
that would permit lawsuits against managed care companies and
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They also used the hearing to urge Bliley and House GOP leaders
to drop their opposition to the patients' rights legislation, which
passed the House last year but has been bottled up in a conference
committee ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership in the House is trying to retaliate
against the AMA for supporting the patients bill of rights,'' said
Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Richard F. Corlin, the AMA's president-elect, said Congress
never intended when it created the National Practitioner Data Bank
that the information would be available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   He said the data bank's reports on malpractice payments
''provide at best an incomplete and haphazard indicator of a
physician's competence or quality.''

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Meet on Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- European Union transport ministers met for
emergency talks in Luxembourg on Wednesday to try to stop fuel
price protests that have blockaded fuel depots, disrupted ports and
blocked roads across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, now in their third week, showed signs of spreading
to Canada where 1,800 independent truckers warned they would go on
strike at Friday night unless something was done to reduce fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 European Union ministers gathered in Luxembourg to try to
find a way to end the demonstrations against the high price of fuel
in Europe -- where fuel taxes range from 51 to 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were considering appealing to the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce more oil. They were also
considering making a call for a unified fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fishermen and farmers throughout Spain shut down
ports, surrounded wholesale fish markets and blockaded fuel
distribution centers in the sixth day of protests on the Iberian
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 farmers on tractors and in trucks shut off fuel
delivery to parts of southern and eastern Spain when they
temporarily surrounded three fuel distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   On the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, about 60 fishing
boats blockaded the ports of Palma de Mallorca and Alcudia, even
blocking passenger ferries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the edge of an economic abyss,'' said Pep Bonnin,
spokesman for the Mallorcan Fisherman's Guild. Diesel fuel in Spain
has gone up 55 percent in the past year to about $1.70 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, some 300 taxis brought traffic to a near-standstill
in the northern city of Kiel. The drivers threatened fare increases
of 15 percent if the government didn't come to their aid to defray
fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   But only some 30 trucks turned out for a go-slow protest in
Frankfurt, far fewer than police expected.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Luxembourg meeting, German Transport Minister
Reinhard Klimmt criticized other countries for bringing in ''wild''
measures to try to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He was alluding to partial remedies introduced by some
countries, such as Finland, which announced a cut in the road tax
for truckers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Germany pledged measures to help commuters pay for
gas and needy apartment dwellers pay for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Klimmt backed the idea of credits for hard-pressed transport
firms. Transport of goods by roads accounts for 85 percent of all
cargo traffic in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began in France on Sept. 4. Although settled there
by concessions, the actions spread across Europe.

<HEADLINE> Cervical Cancer Test Catching On  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A more definitive cervical cancer screening test
that helps reduce uncertainty in diagnosing the disease is gaining
support from doctors and health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, on Wednesday became
the latest plan to cover the new DNA test that checks for the
presence of a virus that studies show causes more than 99 percent
of cervical cancers. The test is used when a Pap smear proves
inconclusive -- which happens about 5 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, United Healthcare and most Blue Cross and
Blue Shield plans already cover the test for human papillomavirus,
or HPV, according to the test's maker, Digene Corp. of Gaithersburg
Md. About 400,000 U.S. women had the HPV test in the past year, a
Digene spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   If the test shows no sign of HPV, a woman is assured she doesn't
have cancer. If the HPV virus present, there is a greater
likelihood the woman has cancer and she is sent for additional
testing which most likely include a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aetna is a bellwether for the adoption of HPV testing as a
standard of care in cervical cancer screening,'' said Evan Jones,
Chairman and CEO of Digene Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 million Pap smears are performed annually in the United
States. Before the HPV test was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1999, women who had an inconclusive Pap test
would have to get another Pap test or an outpatient procedure that
would likely include a biopsy. The results of a biopsy could take
two weeks, a period in which the woman would not know if she had
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An HPV test can be done typically in a lab the same day as a Pap
test, and it is done using the same Pap smear. Aetna is working
with its clinical labs for them to automatically do the HPV test
when the Pap test proves inconclusive, or mildly abnormal.	   ''For the patient
this is a tremendous value, because the
anxiety of being told you have an abnormal Pap is taken away,''
said Dr. Arnold Cohen, Aetna's medical director for women's health.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen estimated that about 60 percent of HPV tests done after an
inconclusive Pap test will show no signs of the virus that causes
cervical cancer. Thus, for Aetna and other health insurers, the HPV
test eliminates the cost of paying for further office visits and a
biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 12,800
cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed this year and 4,600
women will die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the HPV test can help make sure women are
diagnosed earlier when the disease is more easily treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real breakthough, a great advance in cervical cancer
screening,'' said Dr. Mark Schiffman, who is studying the impact of
HPV testing at the National Cancer Institute But how widely the
screening is used will depend on whether Digene makes the price
affordable, especially for public health clinics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for the HPV test to check for cancer is about $50. In
comparison, the conventional Pap test costs about $10.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of cervical cancer screening test, which was
approved in the mid 1990s, is the ThinPrep or Prep Pap test. In
those tests, which cost about $30, a computer rather than a
laboratory technician scans the Pap smear slide for abnormalities.
Studies show this test typically can better identify abnormal cells
than the conventional Pap test.

<HEADLINE> Dissident Decries China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- One of China's best known dissidents on Wednesday
harshly criticized the U.S. vote to normalize trade with China,
saying it will embolden China's leaders to step up repression.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's approval of permanent low-tariff trade ties with
China rewards the communist government's determination to stifle
free speech and political opening, said Wei Jingsheng, speaking in
a telephone interview from New York, where he lives in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's passage ends the contentious annual reviews used as a
forum to criticize Beijing ever since the military quelled the
Tiananmen Square democracy movement 11 years ago -- and dampens
hopes among ordinary Chinese for peaceful political change in their
country, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tells the common people of China that the world doesn't
care about their rights or livelihoods, but only about their own
wallets,'' said Wei, imprisoned for 18 years in China for urging
more democracy and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled Chinese workers and farmers taxed into desperate
poverty may now take up more extreme measures to seek redress, he
said, referring to recent instances of large-scale violence against
corrupt authorities by angry farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent normal trade relations will ease China's entry to
the World Trade Organization and open barriers to U.S. goods and
services. Along the way, proponents argued, foreign ideas and a
vital private sector will propel China toward democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   While the trade bill sets up a special commission to monitor
China's observance of human and labor rights, Wei and human rights
groups criticized the panel as toothless and faulted Washington for
not striking a harder bargain on rights.
</P>
<P>
   Wei's opposition contrasted with the view of a dissident still
living in China, who said China's greater exposure to the outside
world will erode the Communist Party's grip on political debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more interaction the better,'' said Ren Wanding, a seminal
figure in the dissident community who spent 11 of the past 21 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   With the greater foreign attention on China that increased trade
will bring, ''the Chinese government will have to give democracy
groups more freedom to speak out. Otherwise, it will lose face in
front of the world,'' Ren said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove Ren mistaken, a Chinese court on Tuesday
sentenced writer Qi Yanchen to four years in prison for writing
critical political articles. Another dissident, Guo Qinghai, was
arrested on similar charges last week, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's Senate approval, after a closely fought May vote in
the House of Representatives, followed 10 months of often heated
debate that pitted the business lobby against rights, labor and
environmental groups. President Clinton, a strong supporter of the
bill, must now sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   China's foreign and trade ministries welcomed approval of the
trade bill as boosting U.S.-China trade and smoothing political
ties. But they angrily objected to the human rights commission as a
meddlesome attempt to inject politics into trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who want to interfere in our internal affairs, that
would be totally unacceptable to us,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sun Yuxi told reporters.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Hits All-Time High  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit climbed to an all-time
high of $31.9 billion in July as rising world oil prices pushed
imports to a record level.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that America's deficit
with China soared to the highest level ever recorded with a single
country. The United States also set new records in its deficits
with Japan, Western Europe and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The July deficit was up 6.9 percent from a revised $29.8 billion
June trade gap.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, America's trade deficit is running at an
annual rate of $353.7 billion, far above last year's record of $265
billion, as trade remains the one blot on an otherwise sterling
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said that nearly half of this year's
deterioration in the trade balance has come from a surge in world
oil prices but pointed to hopeful signs of a rebound in U.S. export
sales over the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the trade deficit is significantly greater than a year
ago, U.S. exports have clearly been strengthening in response to
stronger economic growth abroad,'' Commerce Undersecretary Robert
Shapiro told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   However, other economists predicted that the trade deficit will
only get worse in the next few months as any gains in exports are
offset by the big jump in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The value of crude oil shipments rose to a record $8.4 billion
in July as the price per barrel hit a 10-year high of $27.76. This
week, prices on world markets have climbed above $35 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund this week pointed to the rising
deficits as one of the principle threats facing the global economy.
The concern is disruptions which could occur in U.S. stock and bond
markets if foreigners suddenly lost confidence in U.S. economic
prospects and begin dumping their sizable holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lord help the U.S. financial markets if foreign investors get
their fill of dollar-denominated investments,'' said Ken Mayland,
chief economist at ClearView Economics. ''It would be a 9.0 Richter
scale earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report on trade came a day after President Clinton
scored one of his biggest triumphs in Congress, winning passage of
legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations with
the United States as part of an agreement in which China will lower
its barriers to American exports.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wednesday's report showed just how far the United
States must go to close the trade gap with China. For July,
America's deficit with China rose to a record $7.6 billion, the
highest monthly deficit the United States has ever suffered with
any country.
</P>
<P>
   The China deficit surpassed the imbalance with Japan,
traditionally the leader in this category, which also set a record
in July of $7.5 billion. Other record deficits in July included
$4.7 billion with Canada, America's biggest trading partner, and
$7.2 billion with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Huether, chief economist at the National Association of
Manufacturers, said part of America's trade woes, especially with
Europe, reflected the dollar's strength relative to the new common
currency among 11 European countries, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in currency markets that the United
States and other major industrial countries may use weekend
meetings in Prague to discuss some coordinated effort to sell their
currencies and buy the euro to boost the European currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that possibility, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers told reporters in Washington that the Clinton
administration's position favoring a strong dollar had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As always, we're watching developments closely, but American
foreign-exchange policy hasn't changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The widening of July's overall deficit reflected the fact that
American exports of goods and services dropped 1.5 percent to $89.7
billion, as sales of commercial aircraft sagged, while imports rose
to an all-time high of $121.6 billion, pushed up by higher oil
prices and stronger demand for foreign autos, clothing and toys.

<HEADLINE> Critics propose tighter water regulations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Environmentalists on Wednesday proposed
sweeping changes to the state's proposed water quality rules and
said only by changing them can the Whitman administration forestall
overdevelopment and the water pollution it causes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she will consider her critics'
suggestions, but stopped short of endorsing them.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a state proposal to allow developers who propose
building projects in areas of the state eligible for sewer service
to skirt strict new environmental reviews. Under the plan, such
tight state reviews would only be required in more pristine areas
of New Jersey that are not included in sewer service areas.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman proposed the new regulatory system to discourage
building in ecologically sensitive areas and to blunt sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists fear builders will take advantage of the
loophole by paving over open space anyway and contributing to
overtaxed sewer plants and polluted rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Some state lawmakers are also wary of the proposed rule. A
majority of the 120-member state Legislature wrote a letter to the
governor in July asking her to rescind the special exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from 27 environmental organizations repeated
that call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see nothing, given the political climate and the
legislative support for a strong rule, that can't prevent our
blueprint from being implemented very quickly,'' said David Pringle
of the New Jersey Environmental Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokeswoman said the governor will not be forced into
taking quick action.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to wait until the public comment period on
the proposed regulations closes on Oct. 2 before deciding whether
to proceed with them as proposed, withdrawing them entirely, or
reaching a compromise position, spokeswoman Jayne O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor noted that other groups such as builders, who oppose
the rules for different reasons, are also weighing in with
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor does not expect her proposals all to be adopted
without change,'' she said. ''We're always open to discussion about
how better to achieve her goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the governor said she appreciated the input from
the environmentalists, with whom she has sometimes had a strained
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is always helpful when interested parties present specific
and detailed concerns, rather than levying broad generalizations,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the grandfather clause for development in approved
sewer areas was but one of 15 specific suggestions offered by the
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection, meanwhile, may
be laying the groundwork for a compromise, according to an internal
memo.
</P>
<P>
   In the memo written to the governor Aug. 1, DEP Commissioner
Robert C. Shinn Jr. predicted it will take about four years for
related planning regulations to stem new development in the areas
exempt from the tight water quality proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Shinn suggested three alternatives to appease
environmentalists' concerns. But none of the options include an
immediate removal of the objectionable grandfather clause.
</P>
<P>
   ''This memo looks like their way of delaying what they should be
doing, and that is fixing the rule rather than salvaging a bad
rule,'' said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra
Club.

<HEADLINE> SE Asia Flood Workers Face Problems  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS DECHERD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A boat awaiting a cargo of aid for
flood victims caught fire and sank Wednesday, highlighting problems
faced by relief workers trying to get help to more than 4.5 million
people hit by Southeast Asia's worst flooding in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The rain-swollen Mekong and other rivers have been rising fast
for two months, inundating villages and fields in Cambodia,
Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, the rice bowl of Southeast Asia. More
than 180 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is taking desperate people and making them more
desperate,'' Richard Neville, an adviser to the Cambodian Red
Cross, said. ''It is an overwhelming job for the resources of this
country, even for resources to be brought in from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical blow to relief efforts was felt Wednesday when a
wooden boat waiting to load an aid cargo on Tonle Sap river in
Phnom Penh suffered an electrical problem, caught fire and sank,
police said. Two mechanics were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
national governments say more than 4.5 million people have lost
either their homes, belongings, land, livestock or kin: 1.6 million
people in Cambodia, 1.5 million in Vietnam, 1.2 million in Thailand
and 200,000 in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in Cambodia from flood-related accidents is 131,
34 in Vietnam and at least 18 in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of resources and the slow arrival of aid is hampering
relief efforts in the poverty-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to rely on my family only,'' said Pok Khun, a
77-year-old woman, who took refuge in her niece's raised wooden
house five days ago. ''I cannot rely on authorities. I never see
them,'' she told a reporter in her village, Cheu Teal Phlu, 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbor, Sin Oeun, 47, is caring for a family of 10 that
includes a mentally handicapped brother and a sick husband. She
said the family has only 22 pounds of rice left that would last
five more days.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has appealed for $3.4 million in aid for Cambodia
and Vietnam but has received less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disaster situations always pose dilemmas, especially when the
access is as difficult as it is in Cambodia,'' said Seija
Tyrninoksa of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies. ''We are fighting against time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials are also worried that waterborne diseases could
spread to epidemic levels. A Red Cross report said most evacuees
are drinking river water infected by animal corpses without boiling
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mekong, still rising an average of two-four inches a day, is
expected to peak early October and could reach its 17-foot record
level set in 1961, officials said.

<HEADLINE> PSC says Verizon must work to ensure high-speed access to Internet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's Public Service Commission has
directed Verizon telephone company to ensure high-speed Internet
access is more readily available to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the company must make available to
competitors the same services for the digital subscriber line as it
does to its own affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon has been directed to allow competitors the capability of
offering ''line splitting'' - which allows the lines to transmit
voice and data - by March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 1.1 million people in New York get local voice service from
Verizon's competitors. But the customers do not have access to DSL
without ordering a separate line.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Verizon was instructed, where feasible, to provide
competitors access to certain facilities so the 15 percent of
customers who cannot get DSL because of technical
incompatibilities, will be able to get the high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Remaining Calendar  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Given the superhuman hours President Clinton
is known to keep, few would accuse him of being a clock-watcher. He
is, however, keeping a rather precise eye on the calendar these
days, as he revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got 120 days, more or less, to be president,'' Clinton
noted halfway through a folksy speech to a convention of bishops
from the Church of God in Christ, a mainly black denomination.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, he mentioned the figure again as he promised to keep
working hard until the end on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to give you 120 hard days,'' Clinton said. ''I'm
going to finish the peace process in the Middle East, I'm going to
try to get as much done in education ... as I can with this
Congress, and I'm going to do what I can to take my case on
America's future to people who wish to listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Wednesday, Clinton actually has 123 days left.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also looked ahead to what he will do when the countdown
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm not president anymore, I'm still going to try to be a
good citizen,'' he told the bishops. ''I'm going to try to use all
the things I've learned and all the things I've done to be of some
use in the world. And if I can be of some use to you, all you've
got to do is call.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps looking far, far ahead -- after all he is only 54 --
Clinton mused a little about his dotage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our life expectancy, I think in the next 20 years, will go
from 77 years to over 90,'' he said. ''So what are all these old
folks going to do? I hope to be one of them. ... We've got to show
up for some kind of work every day. How are we going to be useful?
How are we going to avoid being vegetables?''

<HEADLINE> Harvard-taught lawyer among those charged in unprecedented prosecution </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Harvard-educated lawyer who operated one of
the nation's largest immigration asylum firms and seven others were
charged Wednesday with enabling smugglers of Chinese aliens to
sneak scores of them into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Porges, a Manhattan law firm, earned more than $13 million
illicitly over the last seven years as it forged a relationship
with Chinese smugglers known commonly as snakeheads or bosses,
federal prosecutors alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The widescale fraud may have changed the outcome of as many as
7,000 asylum cases, forcing the government to review every one to
determine whether each person should have been allowed to stay in
the country, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manhattan attorneys in three-piece suits do not typically come
to mind when the public pictures the criminals who traffic in human
cargo and who profit in the desperation of migrants who are seeking
a better life,'' said Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner joined U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White at a news conference
to announce the charges in a case she said illustrated the kind of
''well organized, well planned international enterprises that have
become a multibillion dollar problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake about it, the eight people indicted today are
just as ruthless and unscrupulous as the snakeheads with whom they
collaborated for profit,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   White said the government sought to send a stern message by
using racketeering charges for the first time against a law firm
specializing in immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The racketeering enterprise was in name a law firm but in
reality functioned as a multimillion dollar assembly line factory
for immigration fraud and assistance to snakehead alien smugglers
to ensure a continuing flow of new clients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm operated by Robert Porges, 61, and his wife, Sheery
Lu Porges, 47, was at the heart of a sprawling criminal enterprise,
White said. If convicted, Porges, a 1962 Harvard Law School
graduate, could face up to 175 years in prison while his wife could
face life, White said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no answer Wednesday at the firm. A message was not
immediately returned. Others charged in the case included the
firm's office manager and four of its paralegals.
</P>
<P>
   White said that Porges had become one of the largest immigration
asylum firms in the nation, representing aliens throughout the
country at nearly every major INS detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, its techniques for circumventing immigration laws and
aiding violent criminals was unprecedented, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm teamed up with smugglers who charged desperate aliens
between $40,000 and $50,000 to sneak them into the country, White
said.
</P>
<P>
   When aliens were captured by U.S. authorities, the law firm
built a tower of lies for each alien to qualify them for asylum,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Porges' techniques were so elaborate that it used a ''mentality
scale'' to grade the intelligence of each alien on a scale of one
to five, and then make up an asylum story the client could
remember, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the firm managed to win freedom for the aliens, it
delivered them into the hands of ruthless smugglers who held them
captive until the smuggling fee was paid up, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cold hard reality of alien smuggling is that the smugglers
deceive clients who pay large sums of money,'' Meissner said.
''Those who are lucky enough to survive the voyage, whether it is
aboard a freighter or in the cargo hold of a container ship, do not
find the American dream and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead, they find a life of indentured servitude, working ...
18 hour days to pay off the smuggling debt. Others are forced into
prostitution or into working as enforcers for the smuggling
operations. Those who try to escape are subject to the extortion of
their family members, to torture, to maiming and even death,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 101; Nasdaq Adds 32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Persistent concerns about rising oil prices and
their impact on corporate profits sent stocks sharply lower
Wednesday, but bargain hunting late in the session pulled
technology stocks higher, enabling them to rally for a second
straight day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials, down as much as 227 points in
afternoon trading, recovered more than half that drop and closed
down 101.37 at 10,687.92 , according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 31.80 to 3,897.44
after being down most of the day. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was
off 8.56 at 1,451.34, also up from its lows of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a terribly horrible day going on until the later
afternoon when we had a nice turnaround,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''The market rallied nicely. You
can attribute some of that to the price of oil trading down a
little bit. I also think there's clearly some bargain hunting going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
worries about corporate profits as the economy shows increasing
signs that it is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But the markets Wednesday were more erratic than usual, with all
the major indexes fluctuating throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, which is trading at decade-high levels, is one of the
reasons for the volatility, said Tom Galvin, chief equity
strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. A barrel of
light sweet crude sold for $37.20 Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after trading as high as $37.80.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the majority of investor concern is over corporate
profits, but I think there's been some anxiety over how long and
how oil prices have moved higher, and further anxieties about
outcome of the president election,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those doubts, Galvin said the news Wednesday that the U.S.
trade deficit had soared to a record $31.9 billion in July -- in
part because of high oil prices -- would not come as much of a
surprise to the market, which already is reacting to the rising
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, the Jefferies analyst, also said some of the blue chip
struggles can be blamed on weakness in the euro, the chief European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beverage stocks, Coke and Pepsi, are getting beat up
because of the currency effect. They're multinationals and do more
than 50 percent of their business overseas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was down $4.35 to $49.88, an 8 percent drop. Pepsi
fell $2 to $41.88.
</P>
<P>
   Investors once again shunned stocks whose companies warned of
unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $7.75 to $33.06, a nearly 19 percent drop, after the
telecommunications company said earnings will be lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty chemicals company Polyone fell $1.56 to $7.38, a
decline of more than 17 percent, after it warned of lower profits
because of higher energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even energy-related stocks, which tend to do well when oil
prices are rising, dragged. Halliburton declined $1.94 to $48.63.
Baker Hughes fell 63 cents to $35.50.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay shot up $10.81 to $76.50 -- a 16 percent gain -- after
the Internet auctioneer released sales projection implying revenue
growth approaching 50 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel traded up $2.69 at $63.06, a day after a Banc of America
Securities analyst upgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 14-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to nearly 1.10
billion shares, ahead of the 1.02 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.88 to 521.43.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.07 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 2.49 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
1.93 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 1.90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tech Firms Show New Privacy Gagets  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major technology companies showed off their
latest privacy-enhancing gizmos at the Capitol on Wednesday as
Congress appeared unwilling to act on any new measures to thwart
business surveillance of consumers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 20 bills aimed at online privacy have languished
in committees since May, when a Federal Trade Commission report
recommended industry self-regulation to protect consumers' personal
information stored in the computers of financial institutions and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have technological problems, you must first have
technological solutions,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said at the
privacy fair. He added that no consensus has emerged on what, if
any, government regulation should take place.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson supports a modest bill that would create a commission
to study privacy issues but has expressed misgivings during
hearings about any bill that would curtail surveillance by
businesses or the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more moderate bills, by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
would make employers inform their workers about what kind of
monitoring -- e-mail, phone, Web use -- takes place at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Though the measure would not have stopped employers from
monitoring their workers in any way, it was quietly killed by
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many industry groups feel that the business owns the
information and they do not need to tell the employee,'' said Ari
Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which helped
organize the fair. ''That's not common sense, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said it is likely that there will be privacy
legislation next year, when there is more time to consider the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, sponsored by the Congressional Internet Caucus,
featured 19 companies, including some big campaign donors such as
American Express and the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Electronic Privacy Information Center
released a report on the state of privacy around the world and
emerging threats.
</P>
<P>
   The center's David Banisar, who prepared the report, said New
Zealand is one of the most privacy-conscious countries. Several
nations recently passed sweeping privacy legislation, including
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Chile and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The report is mostly critical of the United States, citing the
FBI's new e-mail surveillance tool, Carnivore, and a lack of
leadership in the White House and Congress on privacy.

<P>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, N.J. (AP) - The Burlington County medical examiner
said Wednesday that a woman whose body was found in a pond here
drowned, but State Police are awaiting toxicology reports before
determining whether the death was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner confirmed that the body found in Mill Dam
Pond in the township's Vincentown section was that of 28-year-old
Nicole Apostol. She and her husband were out in a small boat
Saturday night when the boat began to submerge.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Apostol told police he swam to shore, then called for
help when he realized that his wife was not with him.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers found her body Monday evening after searching for
two days.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner labeled the death a drowning and said there
were ''no other traumatic injuries noted,'' said State Police
spokesman Sgt. Al Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
   But he said State Police are awaiting results of toxicology
tests before determining whether her death was accidental.

<HEADLINE> More cars pulled from bottom of Ocean County lake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Three more cars were pulled
Wednesday from the bottom of a lake that has become a dumping
ground for stolen and unwanted vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicles - a 1987 Nissan, a 1988 Buick Regal and a 1960s-era
Volkswagen Beetle - brought to 12 the number discovered in Crystal
Lake, just off Route 37.
</P>
<P>
   State Police dive teams used fish-finding sonar to monitor the
bottom of lake in the search for cars. Earlier this month, three
late-model sport utility vehicles and a red Porsche were found
submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Using vehicle identification numbers, authorities hoped to track
the cars to their owners and figure out whether fraud was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if they were all stolen,'' said Dover Township
police Det. Doug Murray, a member of a special State Police unit
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are three possibilities: One is abandonment of a stolen
vehicle, another is the abandonment of a fraudulently reported
stolen vehicle and the third is the discarding of an unwanted
vehicle that has lost its value.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the car dumpings may not be related to one another.
</P>
<P>
   The lake is located on an 8,000-acre tract of land that formerly
housed a mining company.

history of photography from daguerreotypes to motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Another series of traveling exhibitions will be organized from
the museums' collections between 2003 and 2009. Tentatively titled
''American Focus,'' they will focus on the uniquely American
contribution to the development of photography.
</P>
<P>
   The museum memorializing photography magnate George Eastman, the
founder of Eastman Kodak Co., has been housed since 1949 in his
50-room Colonial Revival mansion in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   It contains the originals of the most famous photos the world
has known - an archive of 400,000 images. It is also home to 25,000
motion-picture titles, 5 million publicity stills, 15,000 cameras
and a comprehensive library of photographic books, manuscripts and
journals.
</P>
<P>
   The International Center of Photography, founded in 1974, is the
only museum dedicated exclusively to photography in New York City.
Drawing largely on late 20th-century photojournalism, it stages
about 20 exhibitions a year. Its school serves more than 5,000
students, making it one of the biggest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The museums plan to develop a joint Web site that combines their
vast collections of photographs, enabling viewers to search for
images by subject rather than just the photographers' names.

<HEADLINE> Mayor pushes hard for west side stadium; opponents push back  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said a plan for a new
stadium on the west side of Manhattan is still in its infancy, but
continued to push for the project Wednesday, even as opponents
gathered to condemn it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, New York Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson has
hired Peter Powers - Giuliani's close friend and a former deputy
mayor - and Kieran Mahoney, a close advisor to Gov. George Pataki,
as consultants to work toward building a west side stadium for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' lease at Giants Stadium expires in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani reiterated his desire to build a west
side stadium with a retractable dome and 50,000 to 100,000 seats on
the current site of the west side rail yards from 30th to 34th
streets and Tenth Avenue to the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The land is owned primarily by the state-run Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the stadium could be used by the Jets and
baseball's New York Yankees or Mets as well as the site for the
opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, which the city is pushing to
host.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said in addition to sports, the stadium could be used
for conventions and concerts. Even if the city fails to lure a
sports team, Giuliani said, the facility still made sense because
New York needs a large multi-use facility for large conventions and
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing I'm interested in is getting a domed stadium built -
that's my major interest - on the west side of Manhattan,'' said
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation, said Giuliani, would be provided by existing
rail, bus and ferry lines and the extension of the No. 7 subway
line.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Giuliani was discussing the city's need for the
stadium, political leaders from the west side gathered on the steps
of City Hall on Wednesday to denounce it, citing increased traffic,
pollution and noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''A west side stadium for sports events and rock concerts would
create even more traffic, congestion and disruption in the Chelsea
and Clinton neighborhoods and the theater district,'' said
Assemblyman Richard Gottfried.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has also been cool to the idea in the past.
</P>
<P>
   A Pataki spokesman said Wednesday that the governor is ''taking
a look at the proposals,'' and ''wants to make sure we end up with
a first-class, world-class convention center.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman would not comment on the proposed sports aspect of
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Yankees and Giuliani pushed to build a
baseball stadium at the same site, but the plan stalled. The team's
lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Sentinel chickens fail to warn of West Nile  </HEADLINE>
By LORI HINNANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After dedicating $22,000 of its $970,000
mosquito control budget to establish a series of ''sentinel
chicken'' coops to detect the West Nile virus, state officials have
admitted the birds failed to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't been as good a sentinel as crows, and we're going
to have to reevaluate their use at the end of the season,'' said
Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and
Senior Services.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who maintain the sentinel chicken program said they
expect to meet in late fall or early winter to discuss whether to
continue to use the chickens as an early warning system for the
disease, which killed seven people in New York last year. Chickens
are not sickened by it because of a strong antibody response.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at the Center for Disease Control,
chickens have been used successfully in other states to help detect
diseases similar to West Nile, such as St. Louis encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokeswoman Nicole Coffin said the agency will also examine
the sentinel chicken program at the end of the season and discuss
whether to continue using the birds in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Crans, a Rutgers University scientist who helps monitor
the chickens, said hundreds of crows, two horses and two people
came down with the disease in New Jersey this summer, but the 45
flocks of chickens stationed around the state showed no sign of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that they've worked anywhere in the Northeast
the way that we'd hoped,'' he said. ''They should have been an
adequate warning system. We're a little bit concerned because
they're anything but early.''
</P>
<P>
   Crans said a surprising indicator for the disease has been dead
crows, which are gathered by residents and sent to the state for
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that's worked the best is the one we didn't even
plan on, and that's the crows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the state Department of Health and Senior Services
reported that two people have tested positive for the disease in
New Jersey - a 43-year-old Jersey City man who has since recovered
and a 54-year-old man with homes in Cliffside Park and Brooklyn,
N.Y. Twelve people have tested negative for West Nile and 20 tests
are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Also as of Monday, the state department had counted 725 crows,
two horses and a cockatiel have tested positive for the disease. On
Wednesday, Camden County reported two more crows had tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   An international equestrian event scheduled to bring competitors
and spectators from 22 countries to Somerset County next month was
canceled after the European Union came up with a new list of
restrictions for horses traveling between Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the World Singles Driving Championship, scheduled
for Oct. 18-22, said more than $1 million already had been spent on
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of West Nile infection also prompted the United States
Equestrian Team, based in Bedminster, to move the Olympic dressage
trials from New Jersey to Florida this March.
</P>
<P>
   Though no chickens have tested positive for West Nile
antibodies, Crans said not to blame the birds for their failure to
warn of the spread of the disease, but rather the insects'
unpredictable feeding choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would all be behavioral on the part of the mosquito,'' he
said. ''There's a biological explanation, but we're going to have
to check it out. Mosquitos are very complicated creatures. The more
we look at them, the more they do things we never were aware of.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Surviving driver won't be charged in Ocean City crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE MAY COURT HOUSE, N.J. (AP) - The surviving driver of a June
11 boat crash that killed four people will not be criminally
charged, Cape May County Prosecutor David E. Blaker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Lego, 52, of Lansdale, Pa., who was previously issued a
summons for failing to avoid a collision, was not to blame for
crashing his 30-foot cabin cruiser into a 26-foot speedboat piloted
by Dominick Laspata, 26, of Westville, Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Laspata and three passengers in his boat died when Lego's cabin
cruiser broadsided it in Peck's Bay, along the Intracoastal
Waterway. Toxicology tests revealed that Laspata had a blood
alcohol content above the legal limit of .10, while Lego had no
alcohol or drugs in his system.
</P>
<P>
   Lego may have been negligent but he wasn't reckless, Blaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the surviving operator ... was potentially negligent
in his evasive efforts, the principle cause of the boating accident
was the reckless operating of the boat operated by Dominick
Laspata,'' Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Lego's summons will be returned to Ocean City Municipal Court
for disposition, Blaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Laspata and his cousin, John ''Mickey'' Flynn, 42, of
Sicklerville died at the scene. The bodies of Jean Greenwood, 30,
and James G. Fisler, 25, both of Sewell, were recovered three days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Lego and all eight of his passengers - who were teen-agers
attending a graduation party at his summer home - were thrown
overboard on impact, but none was injured seriously.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Italian PM Talk in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton discussed the upcoming
Yugoslav elections with the leader of Italy, a southern European
neighbor to Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia and a key ally in last
year's US-led NATO bombing of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an extensive conversation on the Balkans,
particularly a discussion on the upcoming (Yugoslav) elections,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said after Clinton's midday
meeting with Italian Prime Minister Guiliano Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic faces tough opposition in Sunday's presidential
elections. Clinton has cheered the opposition, but warned Tuesday
that Milosevic, whom the United States regards as a war criminal,
could steal the election if he fears a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Milosevic is stepping up his repression,'' Clinton said
Tuesday. ''Surely he is capable of stealing the election. But if he
does we must make sure, all of us, that he loses whatever
legitimacy he has left.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Amato also discussed the effect of the high price of
oil on European and Asian economies, and a grab bag of trade
issues, said David Stockwell, a spokesman for the White House
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''They discussed the negative impact that the high prices are
having in Europe and in Asia, and they noted that it is
counterproductive for producers, too,'' Stockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, Clinton ignored a reporter's question about
oil prices as he and Amato walked through the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited Italy and met with Amato in June.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Support Milosevic Rival  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More than 150,000 people jammed the
streets outside parliament Wednesday, jeering at President Slobodan
Milosevic and chanting, ''He's finished,'' in an election rally for
his top opponent that dwarfed a pro-Milosevic gathering nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica promised a ''different
Serbia'' in an address to the crowd outside Belgrade's Federal
Parliament building in a boisterous display of anti-Milosevic
sentiment before presidential and parliamentary elections Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many shouted, ''He's finished,'' waving signs with the same
slogan or pictures of Milosevic headed out the door. Others
chanted, ''Save Serbia from this madhouse, Kostunica,'' or jeered
loudly at any mention of the president's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a great chance and hope that after (Sunday's)
elections, we will begin a new life in different Serbia,''
Kostunica told the joyful crowd, concluding his speech with: ''May
God help you to have enough courage ... to win freedom! For
Serbia!''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic labeled his opponents ''rats and hyenas'' while on a
campaign stop earlier Wednesday in Montenegro, the smaller of
Yugoslavia's two republics, where pro-Western leaders have urged
residents to boycott what it considers an unfair vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the president later addressed about 10,000
supporters in a sports hall across the Sava River while Kostunica
prepared to speak. Although the size of the hall limited the crowd,
the turnout for the candidates' rallies backed the message of
recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys show Kostunica with a double-digit lead on
Milosevic. There are fears, however, that Milosevic would not
concede a loss and could try to stay in power by rigging the vote
or imposing martial law.
</P>
<P>
   At the sports hall, in a gathering complete with standing
ovations and the orchestrated rhythmic clapping, Milosevic said the
opposition is ''incited (by the West) to spread terrorism and crime
... and destroy families through religious sects, spy groups and
drug lords.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to fight the ''evil'' opposition ''which wants to
destroy the minds of our children and youth ... just like we fought
the aggressors,'' during last year's NATO bombing that forced
Milosevic to cede control of Kosovo to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On his visit to Montenegro, Milosevic lashed out at the West,
Montenegro's leadership and Serbia's opposition, calling them
''rabbits, rats and even hyenas who wish to transform this gigantic
nation into a poodle at the whim of its foreign master.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 troops and Serbian police who accompanied Milosevic
from Belgrade secured the military base where he spoke, while a few
miles down the road, heavily armed local police loyal to
Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic stood guard in the town of
Berane, 40 miles northeast of the republic's capital, Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic arrived by helicopter to the previously undisclosed
location and limited his visit to the base. That he took such
precautions even in northern Montenegro, considered a stronghold of
his supporters, reflects rising tensions ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's leadership has broken virtually all ties with
Belgrade and enjoys substantial support from the West for taking up
market and pro-democracy reforms. Western governments are carefully
watching Montenegro this weekend, fearing military clashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our country is the focus of much attention from the world's
strongest nations, as if mankind has no other worries but how ...
Serbs and Montenegrins will govern their joint state,'' Milosevic
told over 10,000 cheering supporters during his Montenegro stop.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd were bused in from nearby pro-Serb
strongholds. People shouted ''Slobo, Slobo,'' ''We Love You
Slobo,'' and ''We are all Yugoslavia,'' and carried Milosevic's
framed pictures and posters.

<HEADLINE> Duke To Supply Human Tissue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke University Medical Center will supply
human tissue left over from surgery to a private company that will
sell it to researchers, an unusual deal that raised questions about
a hospital's role in for-profit ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The deal involves the Duke hospital and Ardais Corp., which
announced a similar arrangement three weeks ago with Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tissue, Ardais will create a nationwide library of
samples to sell to genetic researchers. Pooling the tissue samples
could help scientists to develop new drugs and other treatments for
cancer, heart disease and other disorders that may be tied to
genetic causes.
</P>
<P>
   Patient participation will be voluntary, and surgeons will not
be informed of the decisions to avoid any conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Duke won't be paid for the tissue, but its researchers will be
able to use the Ardais library, Ardais chief executive Eric Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and other academic medical centers already often save
tissue for specific studies by their own researchers. But those
involved in this effort say it's noteworthy because it involves a
private company launching a major effort to collect and market
human tissue specimens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew there would be a public relations problem, but there's
no other way to do this,'' said Robert Taber, vice chancellor for
science and technology development at Duke. ''It was a case of
someone having to stick their neck out to potentially create a
resource that has never existed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke plans to start collecting tissue by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see why this would be a sensitive issue for some
people,'' said Dean Harris, who teaches health care law and ethics
at the University of North Carolina. ''Some people may have moral
or religious objections to having their tissue used.''
</P>
<P>
   Most leftover tissue is now thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and Beth Israel each own a small stake in the company, and
any profit will be earmarked for patient care or research. Ardais,
which employs about 25 people and is based in Lexington, Mass., has
also raised venture capital.

<HEADLINE> Tent King To Gain at IMF Meetings  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- It's the calm before the storm,
and tent king Tomas Doubek rushes around Prague's Strahov Stadium
tightening guy lines, double-checking mattress supplies and making
sure there's paper in the portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot of cunning to capitalize on anti-capitalism. But
the offbeat, bearded businessman intends to reap a cool quarter
million dollars when thousands of anti-globalization activists
descend on the city to protest the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Even they need a place to lay down their bedrolls when the IMF
and World Bank hold their annual meetings here, beginning next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Doubek, regional manager of Czech-based tent manufacturer
FAM Tents, rushed to cash in on that fact, exhibiting a flair of
entrepreneurial genius that would make the assembled captains of
global finance blush with pride.
</P>
<P>
   The former Boy Scout and self-described baseball fanatic
promised this spring to turn the stadium's midfield into a tent
city for protesters if the Czech government would let him charge
admission and keep any profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people who plan to protest have a place to sleep, regular
showers and food, they won't be as angry,'' Doubek argued, playing
on fresh memories of rampaging protesters who trashed Seattle
during the World Trade Organization and battled police during this
spring's IMF meeting in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they just slept in parks downtown, police would kick them
out and there would be a lot of fighting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that thousands of the same protesters have vowed to
disrupt the meetings in Prague, the Czech Ministry of the Interior
quickly handed over use of Strahov Stadium free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   And with the first protesters expected Thursday, 39-year-old
Doubek braved brisk winds in hiking shorts and sandals to make
final arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are renting mattresses because these stones are so
uncomfortable,'' he says, pointing to the gravel stadium floor. ''I
think it's a pretty good business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubek's dogged initiative symbolizes a new spirit of capitalism
that has made the Czech Republic one of the more successful
examples of the transition from communist command economy to the
free market under IMF tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   But Doubek's brash entrepreneurialism is even more grabbing
because his company is cashing in on the very people who despise
such free-market forces of global commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Doubek plans to charge each protester a one-time entry fee of
$37, giving them a place to sleep and access to hot showers and
toilets for the duration of the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Open-air Strahov Stadium, a monstrous, crumbling concrete
monolith of the communist era, has enough floor space for 12
football fields, and Doubek hopes to pack in 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, the stadium squats high on a remote
hillside far from the city center, out of sight and out of mind to
the townspeople down below.
</P>
<P>
   Doubek's company invested $250,000 in the venture, and is hoping
to double that in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead is low: Some campers will bring their own tents. But
for the others, Doubek put up a row of circus tents, equipped with
electricity, heat and cots, and pitched a neatly ordered town of
pup tents.
</P>
<P>
   He's also trucked in 200 porta-potties and arranged for more to
be available on two-hour notice.
</P>
<P>
   Doubek even rented plywood stalls to a legion of food vendors
hoping to cash in on hungry protesters -- serving mostly vegetarian
and vegan delights.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their anti-capitalist rhetoric, protesters don't
seem to mind Doubek's profit motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a small company. They're really doing a good job,'' said
protest organizer Alice Dvorska, an activist from Brno, the Czech
Republic's second-largest city. ''We wouldn't make contracts with a
multinational or a big company.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the touchy-feely charm of nature boy Doubek, who
got his start in the 1980s selling tents to Boy Scout camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teepees are the best tents you can find,'' he waxes. ''You can
do a fire inside and its very romantic and comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, a towering teepee is the first thing bedraggled
protesters see after passing through the stadium gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should have a place to voice their ideas too,'' Doubek
adds -- and to that end, he set up a media center where
demonstrators can hold press conferences and a television studio
where they can broadcast their cause.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only contingency the ever-practical Doubek is
planning for. Nearly 50 private security guards will be on hand
during the summit meeting to keep an eye on things in his hilltop
stadium shanty town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there will be some problems,'' he said. ''Hopefully,
they'll be so tired climbing up and down the hill, things won't go
wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Official: Milosevic To Win Anyway  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will
lose Sunday's presidential election but declare victory anyway, a
senior State Department official predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   James O'Brien, special presidential adviser on the Balkans, said
the United States would ''make it clear to Milosevic that he does
not have a free hand'' if he declares himself the winner of a
fraudulent election.
</P>
<P>
   He warned Milosevic not to underestimate U.S. ''willingness to
stand up for the stability of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien stopped short of threatening military action, but did
not detail what the U.S. response would be. He noted that U.S.
forces in the region demonstrate a ''robust military capability.''
Joint U.S. military exercises with Croatia beginning Monday have
nothing to do with the election, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a free and fair election, the opposition should expect to
win the presidency of Yugoslavia,'' O'Brien said at a State
Department briefing on the election.
</P>
<P>
   He said Milosevic already has taken steps to steal a victory,
including printing pre-marked ballots, manipulating voting
districts intimidating opponents, and planning to claim votes from
U.N.-controlled Kosovo where the U.N. administrator has declared
there will be no election.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will claim victory nevertheless,'' O'Brien said. ''He will
not be able to do so credibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections also will fill local offices and
parliamentary seats. An alliance of 18 opposition parties backs
presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica, who has been running
well ahead of Milosevic in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent millions of dollars supporting
opposition to Milosevic, but O'Brien said Kostunica has not
accepted any U.S. money for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien steered away from discussion of U.S. efforts to affect
the election, saying U.S. support for democracy is an effort ''to
level the playing field'' in comparison with Milosevic's use of the
vast resources of his government to gain victory.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Monday said Milosevic is ''capable of
stealing the election,'' but the world must ensure that he loses
any legitimacy and forces against him grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions
against Milosevic's government, including an oil embargo and bans
on travel by high officials and financial dealings by companies
associated with the regime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said steps could be taken to lift these if Milosevic is
replaced by a democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to suggestions that Milosevic might still try to
wield power even if forced to accept defeat in the election,
O'Brien said he would be isolated and severely weakened
politically.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Conductor George Szell once told Isaac Stern
that if he spent less time doing all kinds of other things besides
practicing, he could be ''the greatest violinist in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He has certainly been among the very greatest. And this musical
season begins with a birthday feast for Stern at 80, still doing
everything except practicing a lot - like talking about what music
does for children's minds and bodies.
</P>
<P>
   He's also talking about his latest artistic discovery: that Dr.
Wayne Isom, the surgeon who has saved Stern's heart - and his life
- ''is a true virtuoso of the knife.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview five days after he was released from
the hospital, the violinist chuckles when told a joke about his
image as a talking virtuoso: Two men are walking by Carnegie Hall
and one says to the other, ''Have you heard Isaac Stern recently?''
</P>
<P>
   The other responds: ''No - what did he say?''
</P>
<P>
   Stern had a lot to say about the five operating room sessions it
took to give him an artificial heart valve, plus a defibrillator
that regulates his heartbeat and some fine-tuning for ''little
things that go wrong from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   His three-week hospital stay was ''to make certain I'll be here
in full flower when I'm 100! - to make certain that I'll be here to
do the things I care very much about,'' Stern told The Associated
Press from his Upper East Side apartment. His voice was weaker than
usual, but his gusto for life seemed untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The human heartbeat, he explains, is more than a matter of
survival - ''it's the basis for all music, and the basis of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between a baby's first heartbeat and the first time a baby
hears a voice, the child makes the first sound. Children
instinctively understand that pulse gives order to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a politician on the artistic stump, he talks and talks
about why public schoolchildren should not be deprived of a music
education because of budget cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''From music can come order,'' Stern repeated to a group of New
York school superintendents several months ago at Carnegie Hall,
where he picked up his violin and gave them a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   His once supple bow arm and lively fingers are not what they
were in his past spectacular recordings. But no matter. Under his
guidance, Carnegie Hall is sponsoring music programs in almost 100
city schools.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a small part of Stern's personal legacy, which
transcends music and reaches into politics, diplomacy, even film.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, he's known as the man who saved Carnegie Hall
in 1960 when plans called for the hall torn down and be replaced by
an office building.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle to save Carnegie Hall was a watershed event in my
life,'' he says in his memoir, ''My First 79 Years,'' written by
Chaim Potok, based on conversations with Stern and the musician's
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Carnegie, Stern continues, ''taught me things about
myself I hadn't known before: I could sway influential people
through speech; I had the ability to stir crowds not only with
music but also with words; I possessed an instinctive ability to
navigate with some skill the tricky waters of politics and power.''
</P>
<P>
   After much lobbying from Stern, the state Legislature passed two
bills allowing New York City to buy the hall for $5 million and
lease it to the Carnegie Hall Corp. The corporation voted Stern
president - which he still is - and Carnegie's main hall was named
for him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The red brick edifice on West 57th Street, where Stern has
played more than 150 concerts, is marking his 80th year with a
musical feast this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Stern - who actually turned 80 on July 21 - planned to attend a
Sunday evening gala concert, following an afternoon of family
concerts. And an exhibit of memories titled ''Isaac Stern: For the
Sheer Joy of Music'' also is opening and will run through Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   On display are passports used by Stern, who cross-crossed the
world so many times with his violin that ''accordion'' foldouts
were added to accommodate all the border stamps.
</P>
<P>
   He is shown performing for Allied soldiers in World War II - a
sort of Bob Hope of classical music - and as an artistic ambassador
to the Soviet Union and China, the latter in an Oscar-winning
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes scores of violin concerti composed
especially for him, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and almost
100 honorary degrees. A letter from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is
among many fan letters ''from 6-year-olds to 86-year-olds, from all
over the world,'' says Gino Francesconi, the Carnegie archivist who
curated the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   And Stern was the envy of Jack Benny.
</P>
<P>
   In a telegram from 1950s, the comedian and amateur violinist
wrote to Stern: ''I'm following you into Cincinnati, so please
don't make it tough for me. Just make a few mistakes. Love, Jack
Benny.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's violin, a multimillion dollar Guarnieri del Gesu, is
shown at the exhibit only in a photograph. After all, he still uses
the instrument. ''Of course!'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And he now plans to practice. ''I didn't take my fiddle to the
hospital, but I'm going to start practicing very shortly,'' he
says. With a few extra pounds than in earlier years, ''I will try
to find which chin I'm gonna put the violin under!''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's no secret among musicians that Stern's playing has
slipped technically in recent years, he has continued to perform
from time to time, especially chamber music with colleagues like
cellist Yo Yo Ma and pianist Emanuel Ax.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about people's judgment of his playing - particularly
that of Szell, the conductor, that he could have been the world's
greatest - he says: ''I'd rather be what I am. And be as curious in
as many things as I am, and as happy, rather than playing the
fiddle. It ain't the beginning and end of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   More often now, he listens to budding talent. He is known for
his musical knowledge - from more than six decades of playing with
such luminaries as cellist Pablo Casals, conductor Leonard
Bernstein and composer Igor Stravinsky - and has mentored
generations of artists.
</P>
<P>
   At the Juilliard School, students knew that if he took an
interest in them and plugged them into his international musical
network - the nudge was priceless. But he also was known for being
fiercely demanding of those he backed.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky ones included Ma, violinists Itzhak Perlman and
Pinchas Zuckerman, and conductor Zubin Mehta. This tight-knit group
was jokingly dubbed the ''Kosher Nostra,'' and many of them came to
the aid of Israel in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   An indelible image of Stern shows him wearing a gas mask while
Iraqi Scud missiles hit Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. He calmed
an audience by playing Bach while air-raid sirens wailed outside.
</P>
<P>
   Stern started life as a Jewish boy in Kreminiecz, Poland. He
grew up in San Francisco with a precocious musical gift and made
his New York debut at age 17. He has no false modesty about those
years: ''I think I was a very gifted young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his gift is to promote the music he has performed all his
life - a kind of music that is ''the common language of civilized
life,'' he says. ''That's what I want to do 'til the last breath
that I will draw.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy on Wednesday hired a new advertising
agency in hope of sharpening its recruiting message.
</P>
<P>
   The Campbell-Ewald agency of Detroit replaces the advertising
firm Batten Barton Durstine &AMP; Osborn of New York, which the Navy
had under contract for more than a decade, Navy spokesman Cmdr.
Steve Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made in response to a Defense Department
recommendation that all the military services establish
incentive-based advertising contracts that tie compensation to the
level of success in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The new Navy contract is worth a maximum of $330 million over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's goal is to sign more than 1,000 recruits a week
during the budget year that begins Oct. 1. The Navy expects to meet
this year's recruiting goal of 55,000, Lowry said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Virginia Duffy watched through her tears as her
brother-in-law, Officer John Kelly, was laid to rest in a
traditional police funeral that brought out thousands, including
the mayor and the city's top police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, a former officer, stood with her relatives, many of whom
also are cops, and wholeheartedly accepted the sympathy given by
the rank-and-file, but bit her lip as a group of police brass -
including former Police Commissioner Howard Safir - paid their
respects to the 31-year-old Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The last years Kelly spent with the NYPD were not happy ones,
all because he filed a sexual harassment complaint on behalf of
Duffy, said his attorney, Jeffrey L. Goldberg. Kelly did so in
hopes of sparing Duffy any retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   But Duffy allegedly was still harassed, and so was Kelly, whose
story is a small part in what has turned into a $130 million sexual
harassment lawsuit filed in Federal Court. The department has
already been ordered to pay $1 million to a former deputy
commissioner who sued the NYPD, alleging she was fired after she
refused to rewrite her report critical of how police officials
handled Duffy's case.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are the city, the NYPD, Safir, several top Staten
Island police officials, and Joseph Monahan, the police lieutenant
who allegedly has harassed at least two female cops but has never
been punished. Monahan vigorously denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never seen a case that has involved and encompassed
chiefs, and brought in the police commissioner,'' said Goldberg,
who represents Duffy and other defendants, along with attorney
Daniel Gazan.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment was such a problem for the NYPD that in 1996
federal prosecutors brought a civil lawsuit against the department,
saying more needed to be done to prevent harassment of female cops
and employees. It was the first time the federal government had
taken such action.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit involved Officer Sheryll Goff, who claimed that
from 1989 to 1992, she was repeatedly harassed at the 110th
Precinct in Queens and her supervisors failed to intervene.
Photographs and drawings of naked women and men, many with her name
or initials on them, were left on her locker, car and chair, and on
a bulletin board, the lawsuit said. The precinct's lounge
television was regularly tuned to the Playboy channel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, under a consent decree stemming from Goff's case, the
NYPD agreed to require its officers to take mandatory programs on
preventing sexual harassment, and how to properly report it. It
also increased the staffing of its Office of Equal Employment
Opportunity to 30 investigators from 20.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have declined comment on sexual harassment
cases because of the litigation. An official with the U.S.
Attorney's Office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
prosecutors are monitoring the follow-up to the Goff case closely.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the consent decree has done little to prevent
sexual harassment, and point to the case involving Duffy, Officer
Stacey Maher and one female and two male officers who worked with
the women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sexual harassment is still prevalent. Women who filed
complaints are still made victims again by retaliation,'' Goldberg
said. ''It is not the environment we thought the decree was going
to give us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy says sexual harassment within the NYPD is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to take care of this problem. It's the NYPD,
it's the good ol' boys club.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Duffy has left the force because of harassment,
Monahan remains a cop, currently a platoon commander at the 66th
Precinct in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, a decorated officer, says the allegations are false and
without merit. He also says Maher stalked him and he had to file
departmental charges against her. Maher denies those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has made me sick to my stomach to be falsely accused,''
Monahan said. ''I'm on the job 20 years - how does this happen?
This is complete and utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan says he thinks about leaving the force every day, but
one thing keeps him from quitting - it's the same thing that keeps
Duffy and Maher focused.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to clear my name,'' he said. ''What they did to me is a
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   -
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Duffy comes from a family of cops - she has two
brothers and a sister on the force. She met her husband on the job,
after joining the NYPD in July 1984. Duffy enjoyed her career, but
in September 1996, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan became her boss at the 123rd Precinct in Staten Island,
and she was assigned to be his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he got transferred there, that's when the sexual
harassment started,'' Duffy said in an interview. ''He wanted me to
go out with him, he was making lewd and disgusting remarks, and he
touched me.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal complaint, Monahan stroked Duffy's
legs, shoulders and back while she was driving him to a meeting in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it clear I was happily married,'' Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan persisted, and Duffy resisted, the complaint says. In
November 1996 while both were on duty, Monahan allegedly told
Duffy: ''I would love to wrap your sexy legs around my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Monahan allegedly tried to punish Duffy by
telling another supervisor she was leaving work early. Duffy says
that charge is not true.
</P>
<P>
   In the precinct's small setting, word got around that Duffy was
having problems with Monahan, and Duffy saw the first bricks of the
so-called ''Blue Wall of Silence'' go up. Her supervisors - Lt.
Thomas Mulligan and Capt. Raymond Bischoff - told her in November
1996 ''not to take any action'' about Monahan, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy followed orders, but the harassment continued through
April 1997, with Monahan telling Duffy: ''You need to get rid of
your husband and get a boyfriend. You really need a boyfriend,''
the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy again resisted, but did not complain to her superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to deal with it on my own at first, hoping he would
get tired,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 21, 1997, Bischoff had Duffy removed as the
precinct's youth officer at Monahan's request, and changed her
hours and days off, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Duffy's brother-in-law, Officer John Kelly,
filed a sexual harassment complaint on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the complaint was filed, everything got worse,'' Duffy
said. ''The whole borough of Staten Island knew, and the job
started punishing me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were changing my tours, giving me undesirable
assignments, and no one would back me up,'' she said. ''All because
I blew the whistle, I broke the Blue Wall of Silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was retaliated against, too, for three years, Goldberg
said. After Kelly's wife, also a cop, gave birth, his request for a
transfer back to day hours was denied, Goldberg said. His request
to be transferred to another unit also was turned down. He worked
lousy hours, never in sync with his wife's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then on July 17, 2000, Kelly was killed in a car accident while
he was pursuing a stolen motorcycle on Staten Island. Kelly's
family remained silent about his treatment as top police officials
offered their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, who retired a year ago because she ''couldn't take it
anymore,'' remains outraged at how she and her brother-in-law were
treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did nothing wrong,'' she said. ''I still cannot believe that
they let this get so out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   -
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Duffy, who said she immediately rebuffed Monahan, Officer
Stacey Maher befriended Monahan after he allegedly harassed her.
</P>
<P>
   Maher's behavior was not uncommon, said Peggy Stockdale, a
psychology professor at Southern Illinois University and an expert
on workplace sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's common for people not to complain,'' Stockdale said.
''Only between 5 to 20 percent of people who say they have
experienced some kind of harassment will make a formal complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher first met Monahan in 1988, two years after she joined the
force, when she was assigned to the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn.
Monahan, then a sergeant, assigned Maher to be his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was carrying my equipment into the precinct, and he shouted
to me 'That one's mine,''' Maher recalled. ''Then on January 18,
1988, he stuck his hands down my shirt and pants.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident occurred while Maher was driving Monahan
and she promptly turned the car back to the precinct house. She
then told her uncle, Capt. Joseph Carney, what happened. After a
talking to from Carney, Monahan began treating Monahan well, she
said
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm on the inside. I have great assignments. I'm his
favorite,'' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   So she made no formal complaint, and the two actually become
friends. She is invited to his wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the friendship began to unravel. The complaint
said that Monahan helped get Maher's detective husband transferred
to a good post and then tried to force her into sex by saying he
could ''adversely influence'' her husband's assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Maher threatened to tell Monahan's wife, and Monahan allegedly
struck her in the eye in July 1996, the complaint said. Monahan was
then transferred to the 122nd Precinct on Staten Island, but a week
later, he ''made a sexual comment with regard to a female police
officer in his command, in front of several witnesses,'' the
complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan asked Maher to lie to the department's Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity if she was contacted about his past actions,
the complaint said. He also asked her if she would ask her uncle to
help get him transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Maher agreed, and Monahan was transferred in August 1966 to the
123rd Precinct on Staten Island, where he made Duffy his driver.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, Maher was transferred to the 123rd Precinct. It's
there that her friendship with Monahan ends, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had told everyone I was his ex-girlfriend, and he dumped
me, and I couldn't handle the dump, so I was stalking him,'' she
said. ''Nobody would work with me. Nobody would talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher finally decided to tell her story to someone in authority,
but Lt. Thomas Mulligan, the precinct's integrity control officer
at the time, ''failed and refused to report'' her case to
higher-ups, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Maher was contacted by Equal Employment Opportunity
officials in regard to Duffy's complaint and told them her story.
Maher's name was then added to Duffy's complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one ever wanted it to go like this,'' Maher said. ''We
expected the police department to take care of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Maher, who is on maternity leave from the force, is
determined to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love being a cop, I've always loved being a cop,'' she said.
''They think they took that away from me, but they're not getting
rid of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's expected to be months before the case of Duffy and Maher
goes to court. Their attorneys, Goldberg and Gazan, plan to take
three more depositions - one from Safir - next month.
</P>
<P>
   For now all the depositions in the case are sealed, which the
city's lawyers say is to protect privacy. But Gazan said the case
is going to cause a big stir when all the facts come out in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really amazing because this started out so small, but
high-ranking officers ignored the pleas for help and the
evidence,'' he said. ''This isn't going away. It just keeps
mushrooming to the point where it's now an atomic cloud and they
have to decide what to do about it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Works on Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton huddled with his senior
Mideast advisers in search of a way to salvage negotiations between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The White House meeting Tuesday included his senior Mideast
advisers, including Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, mediator
Dennis B. Ross and other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was described Wednesday by State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher as a review.
</P>
<P>
   During the session, Clinton discussed with Albright and Ross the
various discussions the three had on the sidelines of U.N. meetings
earlier this month with Israeli and Palestinian officials, a White
House official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. peacemaking is at a low ebb. The two sides have accused
each other of backtracking. There is no sign of compromise on the
future of Jerusalem, the eastern part of which Yasser Arafat claims
as a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be looking for ways to help them make the tough
decisions that lead to a last peace,'' Boucher said.
</P>

   On Tuesday, Israel announced a ''time-out'' in negotiations with
the Palestinians, but within hours said there would be more
meetings.

<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday told reporters ''you should expect, from time
to time, both sides to express some exasperation.''
</P>
<P>

at this moment.''

<HEADLINE> Defectors Criticize Cuba Healthcare  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Cuban doctors who defected to the United
States told lawmakers Wednesday that Cuba's ''disgraceful'' health
care system gives ''luxurious'' care for revolutionary leaders at
the expense of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign tourists and Cuban revolutionary leaders enjoy the
best medical attention, in luxurious and well-equipped hospitals,''
Drs. Leonel Cordova Rodriguez and Noris Pena Martinez said in a
statement Rodriguez read to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They said the average Cuban often has trouble getting some of
the most basic medical supplies such as antibiotics and pain
killers in what the doctors said was a deteriorating health care
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of a serious of hearings that the committee
chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called ''Fidel Castro: the
Kidnapper,'' the doctors told the harrowing story of their struggle
to defect from a Cuban medical mission in Zimbabwe in June.
</P>
<P>
   They said Zimbabwe security agents kidnapped them for a month on
the request of the Cuban president before they finally flew to
freedom in Sweden in late July and then to America.
</P>
<P>
   The pair also criticized the U.S. and Canadian embassies in
Zimbabwe for turning them away when they first sought asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt as if I were abandoned,'' Rodriguez said. ''I did not
know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena said in Spanish through a translator that U.S. officials
told them there ''was nothing they could do for us'' and referred
them to U.N. refugee officials. Helms said the treatment was
''benign neglect -- they just didn't want to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Canadian Embassy in Washington and State
Department did not immediately return phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a general practitioner, and Pena, a dentist, were on
one of Cuba's foreign medical missions -- a program under which Cuba
says some 2,500 doctors work abroad from Gambia to Haiti,
responding to natural disasters and providing other services.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have boasted they have overcome a costly U.S.
trade embargo to provide their citizens one of the world's best
health systems, dispatch these medical teams to impoverished
nations and train thousands of Third World doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez said the system sends ''tons of drugs (and)
medical equipment'' abroad while Cubans go without.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said ''those responsible for our disgraceful
situation are solely the totalitarian regime imposed by communism
in Cuba'' -- and that the health issue is on of a ''wide list'' of
problems ''caused by Castro's tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says its family doctor program ensures that all Cubans,
including those in remote areas, have access to free health care.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the country is heavily dependent for basic supplies
on donations by U.S.-based relatives and by humanitarian
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been complaints by ordinary Cubans that the best
care on the island is reserved for foreigners under a program
designed for those in need of medical treatment that is unavailable
or of substandard quality in their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a number of disaffected Cuban doctors serving in
Venezuela and Zambia have asked for political asylum in recent
months.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 101; Nasdaq Rises 32  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Persistent concerns about rising oil prices and
their impact on corporate profits sent stocks tumbling Wednesday
until a late round of bargain hunting pulled technology issues
higher and enabled them to rally for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street was able to partly recover from steep
losses, analysts cautioned that investors remain uncertain about
earnings and are likely to continue selling while they await the
release of third-quarter results during the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials, down as much as 227 points in
afternoon trading, regained more than half that ground and closed
down 101.37 at 10,687.92.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 31.80 to 3,897.44
after being down most of the day. And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was
off 8.56 at 1,451.34, but was also up from its lows of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened in the late afternoon was we saw bargain hunters
trying to get ahead,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''But higher oil prices and the low European
currency are still on the front burner, and that's not good for the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been down for most of September, dogged by
worries about corporate profits as the economy shows increasing
signs of slowing. But the markets Wednesday were more erratic than
usual, with all the major indexes fluctuating throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, which is trading at decade-high levels, is one reason for
the volatility, said Tom Galvin, chief equity strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities. A barrel of light sweet
crude sold for $37.20 Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after trading as high as $37.80.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the majority of investor concern is over corporate
profits, but I think there's been some anxiety ... how oil prices
have moved higher, and further anxieties about outcome of the
president election,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those doubts, Galvin said the news Wednesday that the U.S.
trade deficit had soared to a record $31.9 billion in July -- in
part because of high oil prices -- would not come as much of a
surprise to the market, which already is reacting to the rising
energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, the Jefferies analyst, also said some of the blue chips'
struggles can be blamed on weakness in the euro, the chief European
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beverage stocks, Coke and Pepsi, are getting beat up
because of the currency effect. They're multinationals and do more
than 50 percent of their business overseas,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola fell $4.35 to $49.88, an 8 percent drop. Pepsi
declined $2 to $41.88.
</P>
<P>
   The fluctuations in the market also reflect a more general
anxiety about the direction and health of the overall U.S. economy.
In recent weeks, there have been growing hints that economic growth
is slowing, thanks to a succession of interest rate hikes by the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what slower growth will mean for company profits.
The higher energy prices and weak euro have heightened that
uncertainty. And, as a result, investors are shunning companies
that have warned of unfavorable profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell $7.75 to $33.06, a nearly 19 percent drop, after the
telecommunications company said earnings will be lower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty chemicals company Polyone fell $1.56 to $7.38, a
decline of more than 17 percent, after it warned of lower profits
because of higher energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   But investors searching for growth companies boosted eBay up
$10.88 to $76.56 -- a 16 percent gain -- after the Internet
auctioneer released sales projection implying revenue growth
approaching 50 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   And Intel climbed $2.69 to $63.06, a day after a Banc of America
Securities analyst upgraded the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks have fared better than blue chips because their
earnings have been more in line with Wall Street expectations, said
Hyman, the Weatherly analyst. But he said the markets are clearly
worried about the long-term effects of oil and the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all caught off guard by this,'' he said. ''We have
been shocked by this dramatic rise in oil and dramatic drop in the
euro over the last month from already what seemed like exaggerated
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers 14-to-9 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.31 billion shares,
ahead of the 1.22 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.88 to 521.43.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.07 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 2.49 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
1.93 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 1.90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Meat Industry in Court over Testing  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bacterial contamination of meat and poultry
products has fallen because of salmonella limits the meatpacking
industry is fighting in court, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These standards are reasonable and reachable, and most
importantly, the standards are working,'' Glickman told the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Texas blocked the Agriculture Department from
closing down a Dallas beef processor that has failed at least four
sets of tests for the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The department says that the prevalence of salmonella in a plant
is a good measure of its overall cleanliness, a position that the
judge and the industry disputed. Industry officials say they don't
mind testing for the bacteria but don't believe there is a
scientific basis for using test failures to close a plant.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella rates have dropped on all types of meat and poultry
since USDA first imposed the bacterial limits, starting in 1998 for
the largest plants.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of salmonella in ground beef has dropped from 7.5
percent to 5 percent in 2000, from 20 percent to 9.9 percent in
broiler chickens, 8.7 percent to 7.7 percent in hogs, and 50
percent to 30 percent in ground turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials attribute the decline to measures that plants
have taken to sanitize animal carcasses, meat and equipment. They
say USDA's salmonella limits were arbitrarily set and don't taken
into account regional and seasonal differences in the incidence of
the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The limits were based on a survey of the average incidence of
salmonella in plants nationwide. For ground beef, no more than 7.5
percent of the samples taken in one testing can be positive for
salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such standards do not measure whether a product is safe or
whether the operation that produced the product is sanitary,'' said
Dane Bernard, vice president of the National Food Processors
Association.
</P>
<P>
   USDA, which is appealing the judge's decision, plans to issue
additional testing standards for camplyobacter, a bacterium
commonly found in chicken, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Such standards force plants to make improvements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without some kind of benchmark, we have no way of measuring
success and progress in reducing contamination and foodborne
illness,'' Glickman said. ''Without performance standards, we would
be relying on little more than an industry honor code.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, who will leave office in January, also said USDA needs
more legal authority to regulate meat processors, including the
right to order them to recall contaminated products. Recalls are
now done voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   He did not offer any examples of where companies had refused to
issue recalls. USDA officials recently told the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that they knew of no
cases where a processor had delayed making one.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also should be allowed to fine processors who violate
safety standards, Glickman said. The department's only options now
are to close a plant or to ask the Justice Department to file
criminal charges.

<HEADLINE> Dream home becomes costly nightmare for contractor  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Bryan Gallagher liked the house. That's
how the whole sorry saga started.
</P>
<P>
   It was big, and it was beautiful: A two-story contemporary home
with five huge bedrooms, three bathrooms, a Jacuzzi and a marble
fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   It was everything he wanted. And the price was right: $1. The
owner of the Longport house wanted it removed from its lot, and
demolition was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all Gallagher had to do was lift up the house and move it
to the vacant bayfront lot he owned in Barnegat Township.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, 38, of Little Egg Harbor, had done this before. A
marine contractor and professional house mover, he knew what the
move - 40 miles up the coast - would entail.
</P>
<P>
   But getting there wasn't half the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after he loaded it onto a barge, the barge and the
house remain mired in a salt marsh where they ran aground last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he faces jail, bankruptcy or both if he doesn't make them
go away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my dream house. Now, it's a nightmare,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A judge who fined Gallagher $4,620 for nuisance violations last
week has given him until Oct. 14 to remove the barge. If he can't,
he goes to jail for up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wake up every night, and it's the first thing I think
about,'' he says of the barge. ''It won't be there for all
eternity. But if the judge wants to put me in jail, Ocean City will
have to pay someone to move it because I'll go bankrupt, and I'll
be in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   After the barge was loaded last November, it sat moored in the
bay through the winter because Gallagher failed to get a permit
from Barnegat Township allowing the house onto his lot at 343
Bayshore Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Already the subject of more than a dozen building code citations
on his other properties in Barnegat Township, Gallagher put off
applying for the permit because he wanted those citations settled
first.
</P>
<P>
   Township Administrator Harold Demellier Jr. says the township
isn't to blame for the house-barge predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ''All he has to do is obey the law, like everyone else. If it's
a permitted use, he'll get the permit. If not, he won't get it.
It's that simple,'' Demellier said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 125-ton barge sat in the bay, next to a grassy
island in Elbow Thorofare. Then came an April storm whose tides
pushed the barge onto the island, which is just north of the Ninth
Street causeway.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a marine towing company to pull it free, to no avail. A
tugboat with a 1,200-horsepower engine was unable to budge it. Then
he pumped water onto the barge in hopes the increased weight would
sink it deeper into the sand, setting the stage for removal of the
water, which would lighten it and allow it to float away.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't work, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked the state Department of Environmental Protection
for permission to dig underneath the barge and place rollers under
it, as he had done to load up the house in the first place. They
said no, the digging would damage protected wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, the barge and house sat there in the marsh, a sort
of did-you-see-what-I-saw oddity for passing motorists heading in
and out of Ocean City on the causeway.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the state police marine division cited Gallagher for
the first of six nuisance violations, saying he ''did willfully
ground a barge upon riparian lands of the state for more than 10
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He was found guilty on four of the charges last Thursday and
fined $1,155 for each by Municipal Court Judge Richard Russell, who
called the stuck barge a monument to Gallagher's negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gallagher believes his only hope is a storm that pushes
high tide deep into the bay, lifting up the barge. He prays for
hurricanes; others fear them.

Fashion Week Hits Midstride with Lauren, Kors, Miller, Johnson

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Ralph Lauren envisions spring 2001 clothes in
just about any color - as long as they're black and white.
</P>
<P>
   As the spring fashion openings continue to unfold here, Lauren
devoted his entire collection Wednesday to dozens of variations on
the theme of black and white, veering off course only long enough
to show brown and white.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing traditional signs of spring like bright florals and
pink pastels, Lauren got graphic with geometric lines such as
striped evening gowns, bold windowpane-checked jackets, and black
contrast piping on fitted white leather dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren went back to basics with an easy formula destined to be
copied. Starting with a black pleated skirt and black cashmere/silk
tank top, he simply added accessories such as a chevron-striped
neck scarf and matching black-and-white spectator slides. For
evening the look segued into black and white sequined pinstriped
pants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Color is always great, but I have done so much color in the
past two years that I couldn't do another color,'' Lauren said
after his show, which attracted Kyra Sedgwick, Penelope Cruz,
Kristin Davis and director Joel Schumacher. ''Every 15 years brown
comes back, and black and white is a perennial. I feel what's
important is graphic, and I wanted to make a fresh statement.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was a winning look, said Neiman Marcus fashion
director Joan Kaner.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a fashion person, it's black and white and any combination
thereof,'' said Kaner, who called Lauren ''at the top of his
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors sent out a collection devoted to ''desert divas,''
with hints of the Southwest and items inspired by conversations
about New Mexico. The relaxed sportswear, cast in earthy shades he
dubbed cactus, sienna, barley and nutmeg, stayed the casual course
with suede pajama pants, leather short-shorts, and off-the-shoulder
shifts. Accessories including hip-slung wide belts and turquoise
Lucite jewelry also suggested a look that was West-dressed.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Kors' decision to send out for summer such
cold-weather items as thick cashmere pullovers, mink-backed jackets
and boots? The collection was an amalgam of walking oxymorons, in
which he paired bikinis with suede shirts, and linen skirts with
shearling jackets. What season is this, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   There's a method to the mixed-up madness. At his show Wednesday,
he opted for a studied mismatch, an improvisational way of dressing
designed to look thrown together even if it was meticulously put
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes clothes modern today is the rules have
disappeared,'' said Kors, whose customers include Gwyneth Paltrow,
Sharon Stone and Rene Russo. ''It's about mixing the seasons.
Ultimately people buy clothes to wear year-round. Putting your
wardrobe in storage and taking a new one out each season is from
the past. That's why we're showing camel hair with linen. And both
boots and sandals. Throw away your watch and all the rules you ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, Cyndi Lauper, Stephon Marbury of the New
Jersey Nets, Cheri Oteri, formerly of ''Saturday Night Live,'' and
the music group Destiny's Child turned out for Nicole Miller's take
on thoroughly modern materials.
</P>
<P>
   With enough luminescence to light up the night, the lustrous,
metallic pants, miniskirts and wrap dresses were composed of 70
percent copper and aluminum woven with 30 percent silk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely Star Trekky. It doesn't shine, it glows.
Whatever ambient light is around is picked up by the threads. It
makes every other fabric look like last century,'' said Nicole
Miller CEO Bud Konheim.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored points for hitting on several spring trends with
her asymmetrical wrap dress in gold denim, dresses slit high on the
thigh, and shoulder-baring blouses. Nearly everything was paired
with anklets in black or gold metallic with ankle-strap high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, celebrated for her prints, this season nodded to popular
geometric prints, which showed up on slip dresses, so fashionable
on runways this week.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson threw a curve into the typical reed-thin model
presentation by using 29 Playboy Playmates on her bubblegum pink
runway Tuesday night, the better to showcase her barely-there
skirts and babydoll nightgowns.
</P>
<P>
   The models were decked out in rabbit ears, cottontails, leonine
hairpieces and high, wooden heels. For those who actually looked at
the clothes, they were a raunchy ode to sexy fashion: a
valentine-red ''heart tart'' bikini, a bikini of fur, and enough
corsets to stock an entire Frederick's of Hollywood. But a woman's
closet can hold only so many tarty togs. Beyond the trash'n flash
were some wearable looks that took their cue from spring trends,
such as floral slip dresses, wrap dresses and metallics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clothes were looking really sexy, and I thought, if I had
my dream, who would I have show these clothes,'' said Johnson
backstage after her show. She was inspired by '50s Hollywood
glamour icons such as Marilyn Monroe, as well as disco diva Donna
Summer.

   With enough luminescence to light up the night, the lustrous,
metallic pants, miniskirts and wrap dresses were composed of 70
percent copper and aluminum woven with 30 percent silk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely Star Trekky. It doesn't shine, it glows.
Whatever ambient light is around is picked up by the threads. It
makes every other fabric look like last century,'' said Nicole
Miller CEO Bud Konheim.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored points for hitting on several spring trends with
her asymmetrical wrap dress in gold denim, dresses slit high on the
thigh, and shoulder-baring blouses. Nearly everything was paired
with anklets in black or gold metallic with ankle-strap high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, celebrated for her prints, this season nodded to popular
geometric prints, which showed up on slip dresses, so fashionable
on runways this week.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson threw a curve into the typical reed-thin model
presentation by using 29 Playboy Playmates on her bubblegum pink
runway Tuesday night, the better to showcase her barely-there
skirts and babydoll nightgowns.
</P>
<P>
   The models were decked out in rabbit ears, cottontails, leonine
hairpieces and high, wooden heels. For those who actually looked at
the clothes, they were a raunchy ode to sexy fashion: a
valentine-red ''heart tart'' bikini, a bikini of fur, and enough
corsets to stock an entire Frederick's of Hollywood. But a woman's
closet can hold only so many tarty togs. Beyond the trash'n flash
were some wearable looks that took their cue from spring trends,
such as floral slip dresses, wrap dresses and metallics.
</P>
<P>
   ''My clothes were looking really sexy, and I thought, if I had
my dream, who would I have show these clothes,'' said Johnson
backstage after her show. She was inspired by '50s Hollywood
glamour icons such as Marilyn Monroe, as well as disco diva Donna
Summer.

<HEADLINE> Tech Firms Show New Privacy Gadgets  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major technology companies showed off their
latest privacy-enhancing gizmos at the Capitol on Wednesday as
Congress appeared unwilling to act on any new measures to thwart
business surveillance of consumers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 20 bills aimed at online privacy have languished
in committees since May, when a Federal Trade Commission report
recommended industry self-regulation to protect consumers' personal
information stored in the computers of financial institutions and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have technological problems, you must first have
technological solutions,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said at the
privacy fair. He added that no consensus has emerged on what, if
any, government regulation should take place.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson supports a modest bill that would create a commission
to study privacy issues but has expressed misgivings during
hearings about any bill that would curtail surveillance by
businesses or the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more moderate bills, by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
would make employers inform their workers about what kind of
monitoring -- e-mail, phone, Web use -- takes place at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Though the measure would not have stopped employers from
monitoring their workers in any way, it was quietly killed by
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many industry groups feel that the business owns the
information and they do not need to tell the employee,'' said Ari
Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which helped
organize the fair. ''That's not common sense, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said it is likely that there will be privacy
legislation next year, when there is more time to consider the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, sponsored by the Congressional Internet Caucus,
featured 19 companies, including some big campaign donors such as
American Express and the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Electronic Privacy Information Center
released a report on the state of privacy around the world and
emerging threats.
</P>
<P>
   The center's David Banisar, who prepared the report, said New
Zealand is one of the most privacy-conscious countries. Several
nations recently passed sweeping privacy legislation, including
Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Chile and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The report is mostly critical of the United States, citing the
FBI's new e-mail surveillance tool, Carnivore, and a lack of
leadership in the White House and Congress on privacy.

<HEADLINE> Blood Transfusion Bags Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Baxter Healthcare Corp. is warning blood banks
and hospitals that some of its transfusion bags are defective and
could contaminate blood.
</P>
<P>
   While neither the company nor the Food and Drug Administration
have received reports of contamination or affected patients, a
spokesman for Baxter said the firm wanted to ''err on the side of
caution.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the product back because the system may be open (to
air) and there is a potential for the final product to be
contaminated,'' said Baxter spokeswoman Margaret Shubny.
</P>
<P>
   She said about 100 blood banks and hospitals were notified by
facsimile on Tuesday. Some blood banks serve several hospitals,
Shubny said, making it unclear how many facilities might be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of the largest manufactures of blood bags in
the country, producing about 200,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   After the recall was announced, the Northwest Florida Blood
Center in Pensacola quarantined its blood supply held in Baxter
bags -- about 40 percent of its supply, said Gene Roberts, the
center's executive director. The center also notified 18 hospitals
which it services.

<HEADLINE> Another document bolsters Pequots' claim of authenticity  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) - A state court decision from 1857 bolsters
the Mashantucket Pequots' claim of legitimacy, the former lawyer
for the tribe said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, the New London County Supreme Court of Errors
ruled that ancestors of modern-day Mashantuckets were members of
the Pequot tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling refutes the claim by Jeff Benedict, in his book
''Without Reservation,'' that the current tribe does not have
Pequot blood, said Tom Tureen, who represented the tribe in their
land claims against the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this out there, I think it is simply wrong to say there
is no evidence that there are any Pequots at Mashantucket. In fact
there is very good evidence - the best evidence - a court
decision,'' Tureen said.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said he would like to see the court decision and any
other documents the tribe possesses, but maintained that one new
document does not prove that tribe members are Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never take one document and isolate it from everything
else in the historical record and say this proves X,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case found that Sally George and her brother,
Peter George, are ''lineal descendants, of whole or unmixed blood,
from members of the tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally George is the sister of Austin George, from whom many
present-day tribal members claim ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The children of George and her husband, Augustus Babcock,
brought the case to court. Babcock was black, and the state
overseer for the tribe did not recognize the mixed-blood children
as members or eligible for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the court ruling were handed out Tuesday night to a
crowd of people who gathered at Ledyard high school to hear
Benedict speak.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Benedict traced the family links of former tribal
Chairman Skip Hayward's grandmother, Elizabeth George, and found a
faint connection to the Narragansett tribe of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The book, however, does not spell out what happened with the
George family line that is mentioned in the court decision.
Benedict said he researched the line and did not find any proof
that they were Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that different documents from 150 years ago say
different things. One Civil War document identifies one ancestor as
a Pequot and as a Mohegan on different pages.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict also said no record has been found of the evidence
brought in the 1857 case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Courts aren't always right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tureen responded: ''The court, after an evidentiary hearing,
found the ancestors of the current leaders of the Mashantucket
Pequot tribe were descended from the historic tribe. There's
nothing stronger than a court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tureen said no additional records exist to show what happened
after that court decision, and there is no known court ruling that
found that Sally George's children were members of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Tureen said that after the initial ruling, the overseer relented
and treated the children as part of the tribe, so the lawsuit was
moot.
</P>
<P>
   It has ''never been the rule, anywhere'' that mixed-race Indians
could not be part of the tribe, said Tureen, who has litigated
similar land claims in other New England states.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Gore Softer on Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- Big contributions seem to have helped soften
Al Gore's criticism of entertainment violence aimed at kids, George
W. Bush asserted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like he must be auditioning for a Broadway play
because he keeps changing his tune,'' said the Republican
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A day after his appearance on Oprah Winfrey's TV talk show, Bush
also tried some auditioning of his own -- a looser, more informal
campaign style that included his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning town-hall meeting in a Pittsburgh suburb, both
Bushes, microphones in hand, took questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor appeared buoyed by the generally positive
response that his Winfrey appearance had received, and by some
polls showing that he was running neck and neck with Gore,
regaining some of the Democrat's recent advances.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has tried to make Gore's credibility an issue, took
aim at the vice president's relationship with the entertainment
industry. Gore raised $4.2 million for the Democratic National
Committee Monday night in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the beginning of the week, he sounded awfully tough on
Hollywood. He talked about six months, sanctions. He talked a tough
line,'' Bush said. ''After a couple of fund-raisers, he's changed
his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Go out there to Hollywood to collect some money, no longer is
it six months and tough talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore last week gave the entertainment industry six months to
take action to make sure violent films are not marketed to
children, suggesting sanctions if nothing is done.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the California fund-raiser, Gore and running mate
Joseph Lieberman eased their rhetoric. ''We will nudge you but we
will never become censors,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he opposes censorship, too. But he said that if he is
elected he will summon industry leaders ''and explain to them, loud
and clear, that our country needs to do a better job of raising our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said parents should be more ''mindful of what their
children are watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, denied any Gore
flip-flop. ''Al Gore, unlike George Bush, is not afraid to disagree
with his friends,'' she said. ''Al Gore has repeatedly said that we
need to stop the marketing of violence to our children. George Bush
has yet to say what his approach would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Education Secretary William Bennett, one of
Lieberman's closest Republican allies, accused him of easing up on
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bennett and Lieberman have issued annual
''Silver Sewer'' awards to media outlets they deem ''cultural
polluters.'' But Bennett said Wednesday, ''I'm deeply disappointed.
He so softly voiced his criticisms in Hollywood that he was barely
audible.''
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, later in New York, Bush suggested that Gore
''exaggerated the truth to make a point about an emotional issue''
on prescription drugs. The Bush campaign has challenged Gore's
assertion that arthritis medicine for his mother-in-law costs $108
a month while the same formulation for their aging dog costs $37.80
a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the vice president will say whatever it takes to get
elected,'' Bush said in an interview with MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he didn't care if some critics complained that even
in the thick of the campaign he has been returning home to Texas
each weekend to spend time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate all the advice I get, but I'm taking my Sundays
off,'' he said. ''I'm going to take time off, but that doesn't mean
I don't want to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Pittsburgh-area meeting the Bush campaign picked a
community building that was formerly a church to underscore the
theme of the day: elimination of the so-called marriage-tax
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Tulle bridal trains hung from posts in the room as props, and a
Pennsylvania couple about to be married -- Dan Steele and Vicki
Tryden -- were in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the couple would suffer a net $996 annual increase in
taxes once they got married.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, a former elementary school teacher and librarian,
told the audience, ''Our favorite events are these, where we
actually get to meet with people.''
</P>
<P>
   She talked about education, saying, ''we really need to recruit
teachers.'' And she recommended several books by Texas authors:
''Gates of the Alamo'' by Steve Harrigan, ''Goodbye to a River'' by
John Graves and ''House on Mango Street'' by Sandra Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is a being closely fought by both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the changes that's happened today is that Laura Bush is
with him,'' said Elsie Hillman, a Republican National Committee
member from Pennsylvania for 22 years. ''They're talking about
getting more women back into the Republican fold. And it's very
important that people see Laura Bush. There's something very
appealing about her.''

<HEADLINE> Conditions Out for WWII Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The lighting for the proposed World War II
memorial could obscure night views of the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln Memorial, a planning commission staff report said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report came on the eve of a hearing before the National
Capital Planning Commission. A staff member said about 100
witnesses have signed up to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the design have called it far too large and urged
that a different site be found.
</P>
<P>
   The commission staff report said that a new lighting plan should
provide security for night visitors ''while not adversely affecting
views of the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument.'' The
staff also wants to see a design for a sculptured ''Light of
Freedom,'' the central element in the new monument, which is to be
placed in the middle of the Rainbow Pool.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture should not intrude on the east-west line between
the two present memorials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate in
Congress, is a leading opponent of putting the monument on the
planned site.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Harvey B. Gantt of Charlotte, N.C. chairs the
commission. Its approval, and the approval of the Fine Arts
Commission, is needed before a memorial can be built.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site has been approved by government commissions
and dedicated by President Clinton, criticism of both the site and
the plans continue. On Sept. 5 the Advisory Committee on Historic
Preservation told Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt that the new
monument would have ''serious and unresolved adverse effects on the
pre-eminent historic character of the National Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mall is the broad grassy strip that passes from the Capitol
to the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Admits on Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledged Wednesday that it
had access in 1998 to computer files that would have permitted the
agency to assess the damage of classified information entered on
unsecured computers by former CIA Director John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which only began its investigation in February,
initially blamed the delay on a lack of access to the documents or
computer files that contained the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the Pentagon confirmed that the CIA offered to
provide the relevant documents well before that -- an offer that
Defense Department investigators did not accept.
</P>
<P>
   ''It indeed appears an offer was made by CIA investigators to a
DOD investigator in June of 1998 to examine information ... that
the CIA had gathered in its investigation of Dr. Deutch,'' Rear
Adm. Craig Quigley said. ''That offer was declined by DOD
investigators without ever informing senior leadership within DOD
of the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley commented after a rare public dissent by the CIA, in
which the spokesman for the spy agency disputed the Pentagon's
original explanation this week for why it waited nearly two years
to begin investigating Deutch's security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch entered classified defense as well as intelligence
information on his unsecured computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon initially blamed the delay on the fact that it did
not have access to the documents or computer files that contained
the secrets.
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Wednesday the spy agency offered
in June 1998 to provide the Pentagon access to Deutch's computer
journals containing the classified information, but defense
officials never accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the CIA's statement, Quigley told The Associated
Press the Pentagon's latest version of events. He said that the
Pentagon investigators declined the offer because ''in their
professional judgment, no productive purpose would be served by
starting a separate effort'' parallel to the ongoing CIA probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigators had confidence in their counterparts over at
CIA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow said Wednesday, ''Our records show that the CIA did offer
them access on June 17, 1998, to the journals that Deutch was
working on. The journals were the parts that would have been of
interest to DOD. We did offer them access to that at the time. They
didn't pick up on it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlow added that the Pentagon was briefed in August 1999 on the
spy agency's findings about Deutch's handling of classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, defense officials ''didn't request the underlying
documents until February 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported Monday that internal Defense Department memos
show that in summer 1998 the CIA urged the Pentagon to conduct a
damage assessment because of Deutch's security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Those memos, however, did not mention the CIA's offer to provide
the Pentagon with the computer files relevant to the military data.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Quigley, a spokesman for Secretary of Defense
William Cohen, said, ''This was all about a potential compromise of
classified information on computers that we did not have in our
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear to me how we would have proceeded without
reinventing a lot of the effort that CIA investigators were doing
at the very same time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the Pentagon began its probe February, only after
the CIA provided the materials from its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was a former top Pentagon official before moving to the
CIA, where he was director from May 1995 to December 1996. Now a
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch has
apologized for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Harlow said that in June 1998, the CIA asked for help from the
Pentagon and at the same time, offered the journals with classified
defense information. The spy agency wanted Deutch's e-mails and
access to his DOD computer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made a determination to wait until our inspector general
report was completed,'' Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he could not estimate when the Pentagon's
investigation would be completed.

<HEADLINE> One killed, six overcome when gas leaks into room adjacent to hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - One person was killed and six overcome by fumes
Wednesday when gas leaked into a room in a small building next to
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was killed worked for GE Medical Systems, based in
Waukesha, Wis. He and other GE employees were installing an MRI
system for the hospital's medical school. Patients were never in
danger, the hospital said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the first accident of its kind in our 15-year history in
the MRI system,'' said company spokesman Charles Young.
</P>
<P>
   The company has installed more than 7,500 systems worldwide, and
more than 5,500 are currently operating, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's identity was withheld pending notification of his
family. Young said the man and the other workers were based in
Great Britain, and usually work out of a facility in Oxford. The
group was in the city temporarily to install the MRI system - the
process takes about four weeks, and the group had just begun its
work, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were pumping liquid nitrogen into the magnet to cool it
to prepare it before the helium was put in,'' Young said. Helium is
the coolant used in the system.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain why the pumps leaked liquid nitrogen into the
room, located at 525 E. 70th St., next to the main hospital. But
once the gas leaked, it removed all the oxygen in the room. The
pumps were disconnected and removed from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who went to the scene, said two other
workers tried to revive the victim, but were overcome by the fumes
and became dizzy. Those two workers and four other people -
including hospital workers and a firefighter - were treated at the
hospital and then released.
</P>
<P>
   MRI scans allow doctors to look inside the body without surgery
or X-rays. MRIs have coils on the machine that act as antennae to
pick up the body's electromagnetic signals and illuminate them.

   PARK RIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Sony Electronics on Wednesday said that
next month it will begin selling a portable MiniDisc
player/recorder with a digital PC link.
</P>
<P>
   The MZ-R70DPC MD, which will retail for about $300, will allow
buyers to download music from the Internet and record it on
minidiscs for about 12 cents per song, rather than taking up hard
drive space.
</P>
<P>
   The device will allow recording personalized music mixes with
near-CD quality sound. Tracks from CDs, records or cassette tapes
also could be recorded onto minidiscs.
</P>
<P>
   Part Ridge-based Sony Electronics said the player/recorder,
which weighs just four ounces, comes with a rechargeable battery
and can be plugged into a car stereo system with an optional
adapter.

<HEADLINE> More Republican protests over Corzine's income tax information  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A former federal judge joined the ranks of
Republicans urging wealthy U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine to
make public additional personal financial information.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Corzine released details of his $10 million in
charitable donations, but Republicans insist it is still not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The following day Republican Gov. Christie Whitman renewed her
call for the former investment banker to disclose his personal tax
returns, echoing a longstanding complaint from Corzine's Senate
race challenger, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-Union.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert J. Stern's turn came Wednesday, at the request of the
Franks campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Goldman Sachs, the former federal judge asked
Corzine's former employer to release the candidate from a
confidentiality agreement that bars the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that is what an informed public wants him to do,''
Stern said at a Statehouse news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine would release the information if he could, campaign
spokesman Tom Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim Florio released
hundreds of pages of his state and federal income tax returns and
repeatedly urged Corzine to do the same. Corzine then personally
asked his former Goldman Sachs partners to release him from the
contract, Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response was no,'' Shea said. A Goldman Sachs spokesman
refused to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Whitman praised the candidate for revealing the
donations made by his personal foundation, but said Corzine should
also release his personal income tax returns from his years as
chairman of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Corzine, half-disclosure is no disclosure at all,''
Whitman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's spokesman said all of these charges are the only way
Franks has to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about a candidate who has no message and no
money,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern conceded the Franks campaign asked him to write his
letter, but he insisted his motive is not partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to be a raving genius to understand that
privacy ends when you hold yourself out for public office,'' Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has provided a summary of his assets and income tax
information. He also has completed the financial disclosure forms
required by the U.S. Senate of all its current and potential
members, Shea said.

<HEADLINE> Serb Student Sentenced for War Crime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Serb student was sentenced to 20
years in prison Wednesday for killing ethnic Albanians in the first
trial for war crimes committed in Kosovo during the crackdown by
Yugoslav forces last year.
</P>
<P>
   Milos Jokic, 21, was found guilty of killing Rexhep Emerllahu,
27, ordering the killing of another ethnic Albanian and of raping
an ethnic Albanian woman. He was also found guilty of illegal
possession of arms. Jokic had denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial which took place in a local court with Kosovo
Albanian judges and one French judge, prosecutors leveled a charge
of genocide against the student, arguing that a single ethnic group
was targeted.
</P>
<P>
   But he was convicted of ''war crimes against civilians,'' and
not of genocide, said defense lawyer Zivojin Jokanovic, who said he
would appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without any reason, they have sentenced a young boy with the
harshest verdict,'' Jokanovic said after the trial. ''This is
shameless sentencing in order to satisfy an excited public.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerllahu was killed on May 9, 1999, when returning home to
collect food during NATO's 78-day bombardment of Yugoslavia to end
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's repression of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Residents had fled the village in the face of
a Serb crackdown, witnesses said during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing came four days before Yugoslav presidential and
parliamentary elections, which are also scheduled to be held in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had accused Jokic of running a paramilitary gang
that terrorized ethnic Albanians in the village of Vrban, about 40
miles south of the capital Pristina during NATO's bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began in May but was postponed on the opening
day after defense lawyers failed to attend, was adjourned in August
to allow defense witnesses from the Serb city of Kraljevo to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   All but one Serb witness refused to testify in the trial, citing
fears for their safety, defense lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jokic was arrested in October in Vitina, a town in the part of
Kosovo patrolled by U.S. troops.

<HEADLINE> New England lawmakers press for heating oil relief  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New England lawmakers pressed Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson and the Clinton Administration Wednesday to release
oil from strategic reserves and make sure poor people have enough
money to pay their heating bills this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're potentially looking at a major crisis here,'' Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said after a meeting with other senators
and Richardson. ''The amount of oil we have available in New
England is frighteningly low and the price of that oil is
frighteningly high. There's an emergency right at our doorstep and
we've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who also met with New England House members,
acknowledged a shortage in heating oil supplies. But he refused to
say whether he will recommend that Clinton tap the
570-million-gallon strategic oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is not going to hesitate to protect the American
people from a home heating oil problem,'' Richardson said. ''He's
going to decide what to do in the next few days. Right now, all
options are on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials estimate heating oil costs will jump to $1.31
per gallon this winter, up from $1.19 last winter and 80 cents the
winter before that.
</P>
<P>
   A typical winter home heating oil bill is predicted to cost $901
this year, up from $765 last year, energy officials say. That
figure could rise higher if temperatures are colder than normal.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Connor, commissioner of the Massachusetts Division of
Energy Resources, said New England has five million available
barrels of oil now, a 60 percent drop from last year's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers want the Clinton administration to immediately
release at least a million barrels of crude oil a day so it can be
refined into home heating oil in time for the winter. Using the
reserve oil would build up heating oil inventories and lower retail
prices, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we have a national security crisis, we deploy the
reserves,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. ''When we have a
national energy crisis, we should deploy the reserves. We should
ensure that all the oil that is needed is thrown into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has so far refused to tap the strategic
reserves. But Clinton earlier this year authorized a
two-million-barrel heating oil reserve specifically for the
Northeast, where home heating oil use is the highest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also want to increase the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance program from $1.1 billion to $1.65 billion. And they are
calling for an early release of the LIHEAP funds, which assist poor
people with their heating bills. Doling out that money before
winter starts will help families plan ahead and make sure they have
cash to pay their heating bills, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor warned that a shortage of oil will mean higher
prices for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the inventories are not substantially larger than they were
last year in the middle of the winter, then we're going to find
ourselves subject to short-term volatility and significant price
spikes,'' O'Connor said. ''That's going to affect every customer,
not just low-income customers.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Mourns Crew of Kursk  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Marking the 40th day of grieving, a Russian
Orthodox tradition, relatives of the sailors who died on a sunken
submarine mourned their loss Wednesday and questioned why the
government plans to risk more lives recovering the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has ordered an operation to retrieve
the remains of 118 crewmen who died when the nuclear submarine
Kursk was shattered by a massive explosion Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   But many who gathered for mourning services said they opposed
the idea, saying the bodies should be left in the submarine, 350
feet below the Barents Sea, until authorities try to raise the
vessel next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time ... the main thing is how to protect people's
lives from additional risk, which the divers would be exposed to,''
said naval cadet Dmitry Bagryantsev, whose father, Capt. Vladimir
Bagryantsev, was among the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why risk additional tragedies? Why deprive those divers'
families of fathers, as happened in this case?'' Bagryantsev said
on state-run RTR television.
</P>
<P>
   But Gleb Lyachin, son of the Kursk's commander, Capt. Gennady
Lyachin, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to do this as soon as possible. Everything should
be done out of respect for the dead,'' said Lyachin, a naval cadet
in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Services for the sailors were held across Russia, where Orthodox
Christians traditionally mark the 40th day of bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   Priests chanted liturgies on the military base of Vidyayevo,
from which the Kursk set out on its last voyage. Families of the
seamen packed churches in the city of Kursk, for which the
submarine was named and which was the hometown of many of the crew.
There were also services in St. Petersburg and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Rubin military design agency and Norway's Stolt
Offshore company were expected to sign an agreement Friday to begin
the recovery operation next month, said Igor Spassky, head of the
Rubin agency that designed the Kursk, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Stolt Offshore provided the team of divers who opened the
submarine's hatch after Russian efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
   Russian naval commanders and government officials say the Kursk
disaster appeared to have been caused by a collision with another
vessel, probably a foreign submarine, though U.S. and British
officials say none of their vessels were involved. Other theories
suggest a collision with a World War II mine or an explosion of one
of the Kursk's own torpedoes.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kursk sank, the naval command insisted for days that
some of the crew could be alive, and Russian rescuers struggled to
gain access to the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The government initially refused help from abroad. When
Norwegian divers finally arrived and opened a hatch, they found the
vessel completely flooded, with no hope of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty days ago we sincerely believed in a miracle,'' the
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper wrote. ''Sworn atheists recited
prayers. Nothing helped.''

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses suit by man who said Viagra gave him a heart attack </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge has dismissed an $85 million
lawsuit filed against Pfizer Inc. by a Queens man who says he had a
heart attack after taking Viagra, the drug manufacturer's impotence
pill.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision made public Wednesday, State Supreme Court Justice
Louis York said Robert Selig, 60, an antiques dealer, failed to
prove that the heart attack he suffered on July 8, 1998, was caused
by Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   York cited testimony by Selig's own cardiologist, who said the
heart attack was caused by ''a severe blockage to one of his
arteries.'' The judge also noted that Selig was overweight and had
high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   York refused to let Selig call an expert who would have
testified that Viagra causes cardiac problems and that Selig's
heart attack was caused by the three Viagra pills he took in April,
May and early July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's expert, Dr. George I. Mallis, based his opinion on a
study he did and on similar studies by others.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's experts said Mallis' methods and theories are not
generally accepted in the scientific community, York wrote. He said
scientific technique does not allow scientists to choose results
that support their theories and ignore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   One Pfizer expert, Dr. Edmund H. Sonnenblick, said Selig took
his last Viagra pill four to six days before his heart attack and
the drug would have been out of his system by the time he had his
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's lawyer, Ronald Benjamin, called York's decision
''moronic'' and said he will appeal. The lawsuit asked for $20
million actual damages, $60 million in punitive damages, and $5
million for Selig's wife Carrie for loss of her husband's
companionship and services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge has a fundamental misunderstanding of the law and no
understanding of the science in this case,'' Benjamin said. ''He
accepted the testimony of Pfizer's store-bought experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Yarin, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said that since Viagra
went on sale in April 1998, ''extensive testing, reported in the
scientific literature, has proven Viagra's safety as well as its
efficacy.'' She said some 10 million men worldwide have used the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Glickman, Pfizer's lawyer, refused to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Navy pilot buzzes Warren County hometown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A U.S. Navy pilot on an F-14
training flight from Virginia buzzed his hometown, flying as low as
100 feet and executing a barrel roll before leaving this Warren
County town, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Washington Township and Washington Borough said
Andrew Bordick had warned his mother that he would be flying in the
area, and she and a group of students were outside Memorial
Elementary School waiting when he flew by.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids loved it,'' borough police Sgt. Roger Doll told The
Express-Times of Easton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Other area residents were startled by the low-flying jet, and
officials at the county Office of Emergency Management reported
between 80 and 100 calls were placed to 911 about the airplane.
Local police stations also were inundated with telephone calls from
worried residents.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mark Haviland, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force,
confirmed that the jet was an F-14 out of Oceana Naval Air Station
in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy spokesman Mike Moss said the pilot had been approved
for a training flight in the area, but added that the low flight
was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still putting stuff together and probably won't finish
up till tomorrow morning,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Child Officials Under Fire on Hill  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE E. SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia child welfare officials --
accused of delaying investigations on hundreds of neglect cases --
promised Wednesday to give Congress an emergency plan to improve
before the agency returns to city control.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ernestine F. Jones, the federally appointed head of the
D.C. Child and Family Services agency, disputed some elements of a
congressional report detailing delays and improper handling of
children's cases.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report from the General Accounting Office said
that child welfare officials left 1,200 child-neglect reports
unexamined beyond the two-day deadline for looking into such
matters. The GAO also said that 150 reports may have been neglected
for a month or more and that children younger than 6 were placed in
group homes for as long as two years, even though a court order
restricts such housing to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, appointed to head the agency after a federal judge took
over it over in 1995, told the House Government Reform subcommittee
on the District that children were being placed in regulated homes.
She said children under age 6 have been placed in group homes, but
that the agency is relocating them within a month.
</P>
<P>
   She also told the subcommittee that administrative
technicalities have caused the licenses of some current foster
parents to expire.
</P>
<P>
   But the members of the congressional subcommittee that oversees
District government expressed their outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a miracle every time this city makes it 24 hours without
the death of a child,'' said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., who
is chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Members said that despite the receivership, the agency remained
plagued with problems, including poor record keeping, overburdened
social workers and low staffing levels that have led to inadequate
monitoring of foster children.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators began their study, after the January
death of a 23-month-old girl in the agency's care.
</P>
<P>
   Jones noted agency's improvements such as higher adoption rates
and plans to hire 22 more social workers.

<HEADLINE> Standards Urged in Covering Wars  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- On the eve of a memorial service for Associated
Press Television News cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora, killed
on assignment in Sierra Leone, top news executives and field
correspondents on Wednesday debated setting industry guidelines for
covering violent conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   War coverage can never be made into a safe enterprise, but
better training and equipment and steps such as pool coverage of
particularly dangerous events can help make the level of risk more
acceptable, said participants in the panel discussion in London,
sponsored by the U.S.-based Freedom Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The business we're in is inherently dangerous,'' said Chris
Cramer, president of CNN International Networks and the event's
keynote speaker. However, news organizations have a responsibility
to set standards aimed at lessening the chances of death or injury
to journalists working on the field, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The event was arranged at the request of the family of Gil
Moreno de Mora, 32, who died May 24 in a rebel ambush in Sierra
Leone, along with Kurt Schork, 53, a veteran war correspondent for
the Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter released prior to the panel discussion, Gil
Moreno de Mora's family expressed hope that the news industry would
adopt universal standards, including mandatory safety training for
those who take on hazardous assignments, appropriate insurance
coverage and psychological counseling as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Competitive pressure sometimes drives journalists to take
excessive chances in the field, participants acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition is at the heart of all the risks that are taken,''
said Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent,
who moderated the event. ''It's not a question of wanting to get
killed ... (Safety) is an onus on both of us -- on journalists, but
also on our companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''All journalists are competitive,'' said Nigel Baker, the head
of news for APTN. But no story, he said, is worth a life or serious
personal injury.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants lauded the value of specialized
hostile-environment training courses for those who accept dangerous
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   After Gil Moreno de Mora and Schork were killed in an initial
fusillade of rebel gunfire, their surviving companions, South
African cameraman Mark Chisolm and Greek photographer Yannis
Behrakis, both of Reuters, hid in the undergrowth by the roadside,
evading armed rebels who prowled only a few paces away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Training saved Mark Chisolm's life,'' asserted Reuters
Television editor Rodney Pinder, another panelist.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most seasoned and careful journalist faces the risk
of death or injury in the chaos of a war zone, said panelist Jeremy
Bowen, British Broadcasting Corp. Middle East correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Bowen and his crew came under fire in south Lebanon
as Israeli troops were withdrawing back across the border. A shell
fired by an Israeli tank struck their car, killing Abed Takkoush, a
driver and news aide for the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a nightmare. It was the worst day of my life,'' said
Bowen, who described seeing Takkoush lurch out of the car, on fire.
''Training didn't help us that day in Lebanon. ... You have to
remember you can get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial service for Gil Moreno de Mora was to take place
Thursday evening at London's St. James Church.

<HEADLINE> Study: Minimum wage insufficient to cover housing costs  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Employees earning the federal minimum wage
over a 40-hour week cannot afford what the federal government
considers a ''modest'' two-bedroom apartment in any county in the
nation, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said the report by the
National Low Income Housing Coalition, which favors raising the
minimum wage, demonstrates the flip side of the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Affordable housing is out of reach for many Americans,
especially the lowest-income workers because rents continue to
increase dramatically, while the minimum wage has not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York ranked fifth worst among the states when it came to
high rents. Residents in the Empire State need to earn $16.04 an
hour to pay rent. Not surprisingly, the highest rents are in the
New York City area, Westchester County and Long Island where ''fair
market rents'' ranged from $949 to $1,173.
</P>
<P>
   The study used the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
definition of ''fair market rent'' to determine the hourly wage
needed to pay for an average apartment in each state, county and
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   HUD says people should not spend more than 30 percent of their
gross income on housing. Using that standard, no one who works a
40-hour week and makes $5.15 per hour can afford an average rent in
any county, according to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   While rents in New York City and the surrounding suburbs were
high, California and Connecticut led the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties, all in California,
tied for the least-affordable county, with a worker needing to earn
$28.06 for an average apartment. Nantucket County, Mass., was next
($25.54), followed by Santa Clara County, Calif., ($25.15). Barbour
County, Ala., was ranked most affordable ($6.73).
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was ranked the least affordable state, with workers
having to earn $16.88 per hour to pay for an average apartment, the
study found. Washington, D.C., was next ($16.60), followed by
Hawaii ($16.52) and Massachusetts, ($16.43).
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the self-employed, the average U.S. worker earns
$16.17 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Although some states, including California ($5.75) and
Connecticut ($6.15), have higher state minimum wages, they still
fall far short of covering an average rent, said the report, titled
''Out of Reach.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said last month he
supports boosting the minimum wage by $1 over two years. Clinton
favors an increase in the minimum wage but is concerned about GOP
attempts to tie it to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and affordable housing advocates are using the report to
push for an increase in the minimum wage and more funding for
Section 8 rental assistance vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Clinton administration announced it was
providing $100 million a year to expand Section 8, which helps more
than 1.4 million low-income households.
</P>
<P>
   HUD also has increased fair market rents in certain high-income
areas, in effect, increasing the value of the rental voucher.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Sen. Christopher Bond, who chairs the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on HUD, wants to increase the value of
the vouchers beyond the level of HUD's new policy and provide the
$1 billion grant to build new homes for low-income families. Bond
says one in five vouchers currently go unused.
</P>
<P>
   The new housing report also showed wage-housing gap is growing
in most areas of the country. The wage needed to pay for housing
increased in 98 percent of the 3,646 local jurisdictions studied
from 1999 to 2000. The average increase was 3 percent. The study
examined every county in the U.S. except in New England states,
where data was examined on the town level.
</P>
<P>
   The report is being distributed to members of Congress and the
presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Man accused in Canada bomb plot struck 1995 deal to stay in country </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An Algerian accused of helping smuggle
explosives into the United States testified Wednesday that he
struck a deal with a U.S. Customs agent in Boston in 1995 to stay
in the country even though he was in America illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 32, had portrayed himself as a ''scammer,''
a liar and a credit card thief even before Assistant U.S. Attorney
David Kelley questioned him at a pretrial hearing about his
relationship with the agent.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini said he did not want to cooperate as a confidential
source with the Customs agent, Robert O'Connell, but believed that
he had to do so to remain in the country. He said the relationship
lasted no more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini said he did not tell O'Connell about criminal activity,
though a friend of his provided information about contraband
arriving on Algerian tankers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't give him nothing,'' Meskini testified.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan asked him if he was stringing
the Customs agent along.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Were you honest with O'Connor?''
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I wasn't honest,'' Meskini said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Browne, a senior U.S. Customs official, confirmed that
Meskini worked as an informant for the U.S. Customs between 1995
and 1996. He was paid a total of $100 to provide information on
hashish smuggling, said Browne, who declined to give further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini's testimony came in a bid to disqualify from his
upcoming trial statements he made after he was arrested for his
alleged part in a conspiracy to sneak explosives from Canada into
the country just before New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, who claimed he was a citizen of no land, said he
admitted smaller crimes to FBI agents and police detectives
questioning him when he was confronted with potential terrorism
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing to do with terrorism. The only thing I do is,
I'm a thief, I do credit card scams. That's all,'' he recalled
saying during a 10-hour interview after his Dec. 30 arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he conceded that he lived in Boston after arriving in the
country in 1995 but fled to Canada after the Bank of Boston pursued
him for bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked for asylum there and lied to get into Canada
but only wanted to be there long enough to sneak back into the
United States, which is what he did.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Roland Thau, has argued that Meskini's statements
should be disqualified because authorities violated his
constitutional rights. Thau said Meskini was brought to Manhattan
for the long interrogation even though he should have been
immediately brought to court in Brooklyn, where he would have
received legal advice to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini and Mokhtar Haouari, another Algerian arrested in Canada
and brought to the United States for trial, are charged with
conspiring since 1997 to support a terrorist group and conceal
support for Ahmed Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, another Algerian, was arrested last December as he
crossed the border from Canada into Port Angeles, Wash., with an
explosives-laden car.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini described his arrest during a pretrial hearing meant to
determine whether Meskini was arrested lawfully.
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked what he was being arrested for and was told,
''You're in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside a car headed to FBI headquarters in Manhattan, he was
asked his name by another agent. He recalled responding that he had
already told his name to the female agent seated beside him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't make it hard!'' he said a Treasury Department agent
shouted at him. ''You don't know how hard we can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he asked again why he was being arrested and was asked
if he had recently been in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had visited a friend there. At that moment, he
recalled, the agents agreed he should be read his rights.

Crow to be tested for West Nile virus
</P>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) - A dead crow found on the Canadian side
of the Detroit River will be tested after showing possible signs of
the for the West Nile virus, which killed seven people in New York
City last year.
</P>
<P>
   Coming cold weather means there's little threat to humans in
this southwestern Ontario border city, said Allen Heimann, medical
officer for the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. The crow was to
be tested by Canada's federal laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The crow, discovered in August, is the first possible case in
more than 1,100 birds tested across Ontario this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus appeared in New York City last year for the first time
in the United States, then resurfaced in the city again this
summer, causing eight people to fall ill.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities in Israel declared an outbreak of West Nile
virus infections there had reached epidemic proportions Wednesday,
with 13 dead and thousands more infected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is the first country to have declared an epidemic since
the virus spread to the United States. It is also found in Africa,
other Middle Eastern countries, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It can lead to encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, but most
people recover. The elderly and sick are most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing monitoring by Health Canada and Ontario's health
ministry has found no traces of the virus in mosquitoes, humans or
chickens in the Windsor area.
</P>
<P>
   Heimann urged residents to take precautions against mosquito
bites, such as installing or repairing window screens, using
repellent and wearing long sleeves.

<HEADLINE> Head of Kansas Lottery appointed to Connecticut post  </HEADLINE>
Eds: Will be led
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - The executive director of the Kansas
Lottery, who faces questions about its operations, has been named
the president and chief executive officer of the Connecticut
Lottery Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ziemak plans to leave the Kansas Lottery on Oct. 1. He
announced his resignation last week, four days before the state
attorney general's office filed criminal charges against a former
lottery employee.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak wasn't a subject of the criminal investigation that led
to the charges, and he has said he had decided to leave Kansas even
before the investigation began in March. No one answered a
telephone call at Ziemak's Lawrence home Wednesday night. Messages
seeking comment were left with the Connecticut Lottery Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports suggested Kansas Gov. Bill Graves had wanted
to fire Ziemak earlier this year. Graves has refused to discuss
Ziemak's departure in detail, but he has said discussions about
Ziemak leaving began as early as two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee who faces criminal charges has said he
discovered serious problems within the lottery, and his attorney
has suggested his prosecution is designed to keep those problems
from coming to light.
</P>
<P>
   When he announced his resignation, Ziemak said only that he was
pursuing other business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Ziemak, 52, will replace George Wandrak, who
resigned in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak is a Manchester, Conn., native and spent 18 years in the
Lottery Unit of the state Division of Special Revenue before being
replaced as unit chief by then-Gov. Lowell Weicker in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the head of the Kansas lottery in 1993 by then-Gov.
Joan Finney, a Democrat. Ziemak stayed when Republican Gov. Bill
Graves took office in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak has cited as one of his biggest accomplishments in Kansas
a 26 percent increase in lottery sales in seven years. Sales for
the 12 months ending June 30 were more than $192 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemak also serves as president of the North American
Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, the industry's trade
group. His term ends Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Lottery Corp. is a corporation established in
1996 to run the state lottery. Ziemak will report to the
corporation's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the attorney general's office filed 268 theft,
computer crime and official misconduct charges against Richard Lee
Knowlton. Knowlton was the Kansas lottery's information resource
manager from 1992 until he resigned in March.
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton, released from jail on a $70,000 bond Wednesday, is
accused of altering computer records and lottery tickets to claim
prizes he didn't deserve. The attorney general's office accuses him
of cashing 126 tickets over 18 months to steal almost $63,000.
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton acknowledges altering a dozen tickets but says he was
trying to show lottery officials how flawed the Kansas security
system was.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing Tuesday in Knowlton's case resulted in new
questions about the lottery's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy director Ed Van Petten, who will replace Ziemak,
confirmed a separate personnel investigation by the Kansas
Department of Administration. Though Van Petten wouldn't give
details, Knowlton's attorney said in court that it involved sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Van Petten has acknowledged that the Kansas Lottery
postponed a security audit planned for last year. He blamed the
delay - the lottery is hoping to hire a firm later this year - on
an inability to find an auditor.

<HEADLINE> Possible Explosion in London  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Two loud blasts near the MI6 intelligence service
headquarters Wednesday brought firefighters, police and ambulances
to the site on the south bank of the River Thames in central
London.
</P>
<P>
   There were no casualties, said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
whose department is responsible for MI6.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the suspected blasts, police had made no
comment nor confirmed that any explosion had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately closed off roads around the area. The
building looked intact from a distance of several hundred yards,
but witness James Trott, 42, said there was shattered glass on the
river side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The big modern structure near the Vauxhall Bridge across the
Thames was featured in the James Bond movie, ''The World is not
Enough'' and in one scene was shown being blown up by a terrorist
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just heard two God-almighty bangs, a loud one first, and
then another one,'' said Theresa Harding, 68, who lives nearby.
''We honestly thought it was fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Andrew Preece, told BBC News 24 he was driving home
when he saw a flash of light coming from the top of the MI6
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked as of it was internal from the center of the
building but the flash of light was from the top of the building,''
he said. ''It was followed by a large bang and the ground seemed to
shake and my car was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness Alex Frank said he was in his his bedroom across a
railway from the building when he heard two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard two distinct explosions and massive white clouds over
the railway tracks,'' he said. ''There were definitely two
explosions of the same strength. They were loud enough to shake the
building I'm living in.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said only that they were investigating two loud bangs.
</P>
<P>
   A London Fire Brigade spokesman said crews were called to the
Vauxhall Cross area on the south bank of the Thames at 9:25 p.m.,
and that the incident was believed to be an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dorrill, an expert on MI6, told BBC News 24 he would be
''extremely surprised'' if anyone had managed to get inside the
building and plant explosives. If that had happened, it would be
''an absolutely major security breach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Office said it was tightening
security procedures after reported lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a laptop computer that contained missing training
information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid and
recovered by police two weeks later. News reports suggested that an
M16 agent left the laptop in a taxi after spending a night drinking
at a bar near the agency's headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Summers: Accelerate Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The goal of doubling the number of poor
countries eligible for debt relief by the end of the year is still
achievable, but Congress must supply America's share of the effort,
the Clinton administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the United States would
push during economic meetings this weekend in Prague, Czech
Republic, for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to
adopt streamlined procedures for approving countries for debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other leaders of the world's seven
wealthiest nations set a goal in 1999 of providing debt relief to
20 countries by the end of this year. However, so far only 10
nations have been able to clear the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the United States still supported the goal and
believed it could be met with the approval of less cumbersome
procedures at the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must strengthen international agreement on clear and
achievable conditions for the provisions of debt relief to ensure
that funds are provided as rapidly as possible,'' Summers said in a
speech Wednesday previewing U.S. aims at the annual meetings of the
IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said Congress must do its part by providing America's
share of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delays in U.S. funding have already caused the program to
stall, denying finance today to countries like Bolivia and
Honduras,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration requested $435 million this year as the U.S.
portion of the debt relief, but House and Senate budget writers are
considering far less.
</P>
<P>
   The Prague meetings begin Saturday with discussions among
finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven
wealthiest countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- as a prelude to the annual IMF and
World Bank talks which get under way Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of anti-globalization protesters are expected in
Prague and authorities there are braced for the types of
demonstrations that disrupted the spring meetings of the IMF and
World Bank in Washington and the violent protests that occurred
during trade meetings in Seattle last December.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced
International Studies, Summers defended globalization but said
greater efforts were needed to make sure it worked for all nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''No country has lifted itself out of poverty in the past 50
years without substantial growth in exports, supported by
integration with the global economy,'' Summers said. ''There is no
alternative to the pursuit of policies and institutions that will
make globalization work and will make it work for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to debt relief, Summers said the United States would
push in Prague for further reforms of the IMF, which has been
heavily criticized for its handling of the 1997-98 Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Summers praised last week's decision by the IMF's executive
board to overhaul its lending practices in crisis situations. But
he said that more needs to be done in such areas as strengthening
the IMF's connections with global capital markets, which now supply
the bulk of financing for developing countries.

against a New Jersey company accused of illegally importing 294,000
Bic lighters that were meant to be sold outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Vaid Enterprises of Jersey City, N.J. was
filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
Bic said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vaid Enterprises recalled all of the lighters because
they lack federally required child-resistant mechanisms, the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the company nor the agency is aware of any injuries
involving the lighters, the product safety commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bic considers the importation, distribution and sale of
unauthorized Bic lighters a serious infringement of our valuable
patent rights and our trademark,'' said Thomas M. Kelleher Sr.,
vice president and general counsel at Milford-based Bic.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also names J &AMP; J Distributors of New York City. Bic
officials say the company distributed the gray market Bic lighters.
</P>
<P>
   Bic is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said Bic has brought other lawsuits in federal court
against importers of gray market Bic lighters. The recalled
lighters were produced in a Bic factory in France for sale in
markets outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The disposable lighters being recalled are oval-shaped ''Bic''
and mini-''Bic'' brand lighters. They have a green, red, blue,
black or yellow body; a metal top; and do not have a metal shield
over the sparkwheel.
</P>
<P>
   The standard size lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600020.
The mini-lighters have the UPC number 3 086120 600051.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, gas, grocery and thrift stores in the East sold the
lighters from January through April for about $1 each.

<HEADLINE> 2 Blasts Near Britain's MI6 HQ  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- At least one explosion went off at the
headquarters of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency headquarters in
central London late Wednesday, causing some damage but no
casualties, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast brought firefighters, police and ambulances to the
site on the south bank of the River Thames, and police closed the
area around the headquarters. Witnesses said they heard two
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   A police constable at the scene who refused to give his name
said an explosion had occurred and that the cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A Scotland Yard spokesman, referring to the incident only as ''a
possible explosion,'' said there was ''minor damage to the
building, believed to be on the eighth floor.'' He said explosives
officers were at the scene and that he had no information on the
likely cause of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose department is responsible
for MI6, said there were no casualties and expressed relief.
</P>
<P>
   The building looked intact from a distance of several hundred
yards, but witness James Trott, 42, said there was shattered glass
on the river side of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The big modern structure near the Vauxhall Bridge across the
Thames was featured in the James Bond movie, ''The World is not
Enough'' and in one scene was shown being blown up by a terrorist
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just heard two God-almighty bangs, a loud one first, and
then another one,'' said Theresa Harding, 68, who lives nearby.
''We honestly thought it was fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Andrew Preece, told BBC News 24 he was driving home
when he saw a flash of light coming from the top of the MI6
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked as of it was internal from the center of the
building but the flash of light was from the top of the building,''
he said. ''It was followed by a large bang and the ground seemed to
shake and my car was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness Alex Frank said he was in his his bedroom across a
railway from the building when he heard two explosions and saw
''massive white clouds.'' He said the blasts ''were loud enough to
shake the building I'm living in.''
</P>
<P>
   A London Fire Brigade spokesman said crews were called to the
area at 9:25 p.m. Train service was halted from nearby Waterloo
station.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dorrill, an expert on MI6, told BBC News 24 he would be
''extremely surprised'' if anyone had managed to get inside the
building and plant explosives. If that had happened, it would be
''an absolutely major security breach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Office said it was tightening
security procedures after reported lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a laptop computer that contained missing training
information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid and
recovered by police two weeks later. News reports suggested that an
M16 agent left the laptop in a taxi after spending a night drinking
at a bar near the agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   MI6, formed in 1921, is responsible for foreign intelligence. It
is thought to cooperate closely with the domestic security service
MI5 in keeping track of Irish terror groups.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech spy headquarters bristles with security features.
Much of the complex is below street level to protect the most
sensitive areas from terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Study: Good Medicare Reimbursement  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- HMOs will receive more in Medicare payments
this year than Congress intended, says a federal report that
disputes the claims of health care plans that the government isn't
reimbursing them enough.
</P>
<P>
   The health care industry has dropped nearly a million elderly
Americans from its plans, citing inadequate reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   But a report by the Inspector General of the Health and Human
Services Department said reimbursements to health plans this year
will be 0.5 percent higher than they should be because of
overestimates used to establish funding levels for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The study was prepared for the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The office examined changes in Medicare reimbursements since the
passage of two balanced budgets, one in 1997 and the other in 1998.
The 1997 act created a modified Medicare program intended to
provide beneficiaries with more health plan choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The net effect is that (managed care organizations) will be
paid more than the Congress originally intended,'' the report said.
It said the health plans ''receive more than an adequate amount of
funds to deliver the Medicare package of covered services.''
</P>
<P>
   While the study ascribed no dollar figure to the 0.5 percent
overpayment, it said health plans will see an extra $1.8 billion in
2000 reimbursements because their beneficiaries are ''healthier
than the Medicare population as a whole'' and therefore run smaller
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, disputed those figures, saying it does not include
''a major change'' enacted in 1999 legislation ''that would alter
the calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the figures don't reflect reality because ''the
government has never measured the health of the population in
HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pisano repeated industry claims that health plan costs are
rising 10 percent annually, compared to the 2 percent annual rise
in reimbursements mandated in the 1997 overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that ''excessive administrative costs''
make up 1.3 percent of payments this year, and that managed care
organizations ''have been able to avoid substantial expenditures''
because of beneficiaries disenrolling.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the HCFA said 934,000 elderly and disabled persons
would lose HMO coverage because their plans, citing inadequate
reimbursement, decided not to participate in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare said then that of its 39 million beneficiaries, 27
million have at least one HMO open to them, and 6.5 million are
enrolled in one.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Falls: Critics say Niagara Falls gets short shrift  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW Z. GALARNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - New York's only natural wonder of the
world - which draws millions of tourists from around the globe
every year - rakes in a small fortune for the state.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to improvements, Albany returns only a
pittance to the park that surrounds the American side of the falls.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar the Niagara Reservation State Park sent to
Albany over the past five years, the state invested about 8 cents
in improvements at Niagara Falls, the state's most popular park
that attracted more than 7.5 million visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Buffalo News investigation found:
</P>
<P>
   -The Office of State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation
has turned Niagara Falls park into a money-making center, using its
revenue to pay for projects across the state while New York's
world-famous park stagnates.
</P>
<P>
   -The parks system's hunger for revenue could clash with Albany's
vision of remaking Niagara Reservation State Park into a globally
renowned eco-tourism destination.
</P>
<P>
   -Gov. George E. Pataki's administration has touted private
investment in public parks as an answer to chronic underfunding,
but it has fallen far short.
</P>
<P>
   Getting only 8 percent of the money generated in Niagara Falls
returned for projects over the past five years is ''pretty
disgusting,'' said Niagara Falls parks activist Bob Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Prospect Point Observation Tower, where the state
plans to install four new elevators where two operate now. The $23
million project, announced in 1998, remains delayed by design
changes. At first the state said it would remove the unsightly
tower, but changed plans when that was deemed too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The new elevators could not come too soon for sightseers, who
line up for more than two hours at peak times for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Trash is strewn about, fence posts wobble in their sockets and a
lack of bathrooms add to the feeling of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Niagara Falls park sent $25.3 million to Albany
and had about $2 million spent on improvements - such as major
repairs and new landscape features - at Niagara Falls, according to
state data.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total, 49 percent went to an engineering study and repair
of a bus garage outside the park. The rest was used to fix up the
park at the falls, renovate restrooms, rehabilitate the Cave of the
Winds, protect fragile shorelines and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro defended the level of
state spending at Niagara Falls. Precise operating cost numbers are
unknown, parks officials said, as the state parks system - with 161
parks - does not keep track of operating expenses by individual
parks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know of a specific capital project that was made clear
to us by the region that we ignored, or that we did not fund,''
Castro said, calling the park a statewide priority.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara Reservation might be a priority today, but the
amount of capital spending in the park over the past five years
seems ''totally unfair,'' said State Sen. Alfred T. Coppola,
D-Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Castro announced plans for a sweeping overhaul aimed
at transforming America's first state park into an ''eco-tourism
destination'' that celebrates the vision of famed park designer
Frederick Law Olmsted. Castro has ruled out commercial development
but has said the state will not remove parking lots or the Top of
the Falls restaurant that are targets of critics who say the state
has marred the natural beauty of the falls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, plans are afoot to upgrade the restaurant, which
provides a share of revenues and whose operator, Delaware North
Cos., funded more than $400,000 in park improvements in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The state parks' acute hunger for cash began long before Castro
and Pataki came to power.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration recently has done better at providing
money to buy park-related land, said Richard White Smith, executive
director of the New York Parks and Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   The total budget for the Office of State Parks, Recreation and
Historic Preservation has grown under Pataki, to $211 million, 13
percent since 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, though, state parks estimated that $1.8 billion was
needed to restore the parks to good repair. The State Parks
Infrastructure Fund, supported by user fees and revenues such as
Niagara Falls profits, provided only $300 million over 10 years.
The current parks budget allocates $38 million to capital
improvements.

<HEADLINE> House seeks additional White House data on first lady's air travel  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON(AP) - Two leading House Republicans are seeking
additional information from the White House on Hillary Rodham
Clinton's travel, saying they are ''extremely concerned'' by
possible discrepancies in data already provided.
</P>
<P>
   The request was made in a letter on Wednesday to White House
lawyer Mark Lindsay. It was signed by Rep. Bill Young, chairman of
the appropriations committee, and Rep. Jim Kolbe, chairman of the
subcommittee that oversees White House funding.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said they were troubled by news reports that
Assemblyman Michael Bragman and his family traveled to Washington
with the first lady after campaign events in Syracuse on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   According to White House travel documents provided to Kolbe's
committee, the first lady was accompanied by one political
passenger on Dec. 21 and no political passengers Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers must be reimbursed for any political passengers
traveling with Clinton on government aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee is extremely concerned by the discrepancy
between these reports and documents submitted by the White House,''
the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe's committee had a hearing on the first lady's travel in
March and directed the White House to provide monthly expense
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports have contained detailed information, including
flight manifests, from March to the present. But before March the
information was less thorough. The lawmakers want the more detailed
data to ''to ensure that all reimbursements have been made that are
due the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not return a phone call Wednesday seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the committee reported that Clinton's 93
campaign trips to New York aboard government aircraft cost
taxpayers more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies on government aircraft on the request of the
Secret Service. She reimburses the government the same way
presidential candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial
ticket. That is well below the actual cost of her travel. A C-20,
on which she sometimes travels, costs an estimated $3,705 per hour
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is legal but has been criticized by Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Sayreville school cancels Corzine visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAYREVILLE, N.J. - School officials canceled Jon Corzine's
planned visit to a Sayreville school because of public concerns of
political partisanship, a district official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic U-S Senate candidate was to tour district's
Middle School on Wednesday. He intended to highlight overcrowding
in schools, a campaign spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent of Schools Dennis Fyffe said the visit was
canceled after residents raised concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The board has no interest in supporting either candidate,''
Fyffe told The Home News Tribune of East Brunswick for Wednesday's
editions. ''Despite the good intentions of the appearance, we are
responding to the public's concern. We do not want to place the
board in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shea, a spokesman for Corzine's campaign, said it would be
difficult to distance the candidate from the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a candidate for the Senate,'' he said. ''It's hard for
him to visit any place without being seen in a political context.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican state Senator Randy Corman, who served on the
school board in the 1980s, said the visit violates a board policy
that prohibits the circulation of political literature,
solicitation for campaign funds and other overt political activity
on school property.
</P>
<P>
   Corman said he did not object when three state legislators came
to War Memorial High School to explain the political process.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Kuwait Is Stealing Oil  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq on Wednesday renewed its accusation
that Kuwait has been stealing its oil, a charge that in the past
week has heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf region with its
echoes of the prelude to the 1990-1991 war.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Baath party newspaper, Al-Thawra, said in a
front-page editorial that Kuwaiti officials have ''implicitly''
acknowledged they are stealing Iraqi oil by drilling wells that may
stretch horizontally to reach Iraqi reservoirs close to the border,
''depleting (Iraqi) crude via this vicious method.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This (theft) cannot but be part of a series of provocations
Kuwaiti rulers have been practicing against Iraq,'' the paper said
in the editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait has rejected the charges as an attempt by Iraq to
destablilize in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's Oil Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, claimed Wednesday that about 300,000 barrels of oil per
day are illegally pumped by Kuwait from Iraqi reservoirs through
the practice of horizontal drilling. At current prices, the volume
should be worth more than $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah said in a
statement that Kuwait would welcome independent experts to inspect
its oil operations in the border area with Iraq ''so that the
falsity of the allegations by the Iraqi regime can be revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same statement, Information Minister Saad Bin Tafla
al-Ajmi said Kuwait did not have the equipment needed for
horizontal drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan,
denied any oil theft in letters sent to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the Security Council and circulated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abulhasan, responding to accuations Iraq made Sept. 14, accused
Baghdad of ''trying to provoke crises and create an atmosphere of
tension and instability in the region'' and urged to world body to
enforce resolutions promising to ''to prevent Iraq from resorting
to threats and intimidation of its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Theft of Iraqi oil was one of the reasons Iraq gave for invading
Kuwait in 1990; a U.S.-led coalition force drove Iraq out seven
months later in the Persian Gulf War. Iraq resurrected the
10-year-old complaint last week, along with a warning that it will
take proper measures to stop its neighbor's actions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the oil theft charges, Mehdi accused Kuwait of
allowing the United States to conduct military exercises close to
Iraqi borders and providing refuge and financial help to Baghdad
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi said Iraq cannot remain silent when faced with what he
described as Kuwait's ''flagrant aggressive actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United Nations, which monitors Iraqi oil sales
and controls the income under the oil-for-food plan, said Iraq has
collected $5.1 billion since June 9, the start of the current oil
phase, which ends Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.-monitored program, renewed at six months intervals,
permits Iraq unlimited oil sales, enabling it to earn billions of
dollars to rebuild an economy devastated by wars and U.N. trade
sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Fever Kills 78 People in Yemen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Yemen appealed for outside help Wednesday to
fight an outbreak of the Rift Valley Fever, a mosquito-borne virus
that has killed 78 people so far this week.
</P>
<P>
   A Yemeni official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 50
people died in Wadi Mour, a valley in northern Yemen that runs to
the Saudi border, while 28 others died in the northern province of
Hajjah.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted from livestock to humans by mosquitoes
and causes diarrhea, nausea, and internal bleeding that can result
in death.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Saudi Arabia said Sunday that 16 people in the south
of the country near the Yemeni border have died of Rift Valley
Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Yemeni Health Minister Abdullah Abdel-Wali Nasher said on
Wednesday that his government has appealed for help from the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization, U.N. Children's Fund, UNICEF,
and the Atlanta-based Center for Disease Control. Experts from the
three organizations were expected to arrive in Yemen within hours,
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yemen also was in contact with Saudi authorities to coordinate
efforts to contain the spread of the disease, Nasher said. Saudi
aircraft were due to spray the affected areas in Yemen with
insecticides to kill the mosquitoes thought to be spreading the
disease, he added.

<HEADLINE> Lazio says independent groups have agreed to stop anti-Clinton ads  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio said Wednesday he had
agreements from 14 independent groups to halt their soft-money
advertising on his behalf if Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign
agreed to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly said she was ready to have her campaign begin
serious discussions with Lazio's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had imposed the requirement on Lazio as a condition for
her agreement on a ban of unlimited soft money donations from the
race. She has already collected millions of dollars in such funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton should today put her soft money where her mouth
is and follow through on her commitment to eradicate the poison of
dirty money from this Senate race,'' the congressman from Long
Island told the New York State Associated Press Association meeting
at an Albany area hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Lazio insisted Clinton obtain agreements from at
least 13 groups friendly to her - such as the Sierra Club, Planned
Parenthood and the state Democratic Party - to refrain from similar
activity. Lazio said the deal would be on the table until Saturday,
after which he said he would fight ''fire with fire'' if he had to.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio aides said the move effectively forced Clinton's hand on
the issue. Lazio has maintained all along that Clinton does not
want to give up soft money. He cast his challenge Wednesday as a
test of Clinton's character.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to the offer in her address to the meeting of
reporters and editors from across the state later Wednesday, saying
she would have to ''figure out if what he's offering is compatible
with what my campaign has been offering for months, and we'll get
to work on that right away.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Lazio's campaign manager Bill Dal Col
appeared uninvited at Clinton's Manhattan campaign headquarters
with a half-dozen aides, telling reporters he wanted to get the
soft-money ban hammered out then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col was met by Clinton's campaign manager, Bill deBlasio,
who stood in front of the campaign office's closed door as if to
bar an invasion. Surrounded by a crush of reporters, photographers
and camera crews, the two men proceeded to speak simultaneously for
nearly 10 minutes, with Dal Col repeatedly saying, ''It's time to
step up. All ya gotta do is sign it,'' and deBlasio responding:
''We look forward to a serious discussion. Let's do the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to meet at 10 a.m. Thursday morning, but Dal Col
insisted that ''the media's gotta be there so we can see the light
of day'' while deBlasio opposed including the press at the meeting,
saying, ''We don't want to have a media circus.'' It was unclear
how the conflict would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the pair shook hands, with one saying, ''Thanks, Bill,''
while the other said, ''Take care, Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's latest move came on the same day Independent Counsel
Robert Ray announced in Washington that he had found
''insufficient'' or ''inconclusive'' evidence to charge either
President Clinton or his wife in the Whitewater land deal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad that this is finally over and I think that most
New Yorkers and Americans had made up their minds a long time ago
about this,'' the first lady told the AP meeting. Now everybody can
just move on and be focused on issues like the upstate economy and
what we can do to improve education and provide quality affordable
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-money issue was a focus of last week's first debate
between the two candidates in Buffalo when Lazio left his podium to
confront Clinton with his pledge to ban soft money. She refused to
sign it and later called it a ''stunt.''

<HEADLINE> Guggenheim Museum will open gallery at Venetian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) - The Guggenheim Museum has confirmed its intent
to open a gallery at the Venetian hotel-casino on the Las Vegas
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The center would be only the sixth Guggenheim branch in the
world, joining branches in New York, Berlin, Venice, and Bilbao,
Spain. Joining the venture will be the State Hermitage museum of
St. Petersburg, Russia, a museum with origins dating from the
1750s.
</P>
<P>
   The new gallery was confirmed in a Tuesday conference at the
Venetian by brokerage firm Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., attended by
Venetian President Bill Weidner and Guggenheim Director Thomas
Krens.
</P>
<P>
   ''The partnership between the prestigious Guggenheim and
Hermitage museums further solidifies our effort to create an
upscale positioning in the marketplace and enhances our business
strategy to build a distinctive resort within a destination city,''
Weidner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Venetian gallery is a continuation of an art trend started
on the Strip by Steve Wynn and Mirage Resorts Inc. in opening the
Bellagio with its art gallery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim and the Hermitage will join the Phillips
Collection of Washington, D.C., which now has a temporary display
at the Bellagio's Gallery of Fine Art.

<HEADLINE> George Dumped on 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Chicken Man'' George's goose was cooked
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The jovial roofer from Rockford, Ill., became the latest
houseguest ousted from CBS' reality series ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing 51 percent of viewer call-ins, George -- who weeks ago
dubbed himself ''Chicken Man'' -- was the clear choice for exclusion
from the ''Big Brother'' house.
</P>
<P>
   There, since the series began its six-per-week airings in early
July, the sequestered residents have submitted to constant video
surveillance -- and a shrinking population -- as they vie for a
$500,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   The three others nominated for banishment this week included
beauty-queen Jamie (32 percent); tough guy Eddie, a college student
(14 percent); and law clerk Curtis (3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   They and hunky Josh, another college student, stay on as the
only houseguests from the original 10 contestants who moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chicken Man's got the feeling that he's gonna fly the coop
tonight,'' George told ''Big Brother'' host Julie Chen at the top
of Wednesday's live hour. Seated in the living room with his
housemates, he displayed himself in Julius Caesar garb -- a
makeshift toga with a laurel wreath around his head.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's episode will reveal whom the houseguests will
nominate for eviction next. After another call-in poll, on
Wednesday, Sept. 27, houseguest No. 7 will be kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Then, viewers will phone in votes for who among the final three
should win the grand prize. The winner will be announced on the
series' conclusion Friday, Sept. 29.

<HEADLINE> Berezovsky Scoffs At Gore Report  </HEADLINE>
By GERALD NADLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky scoffed
Wednesday at a report by leading House Republicans that the Clinton
administration failed in its policy to build democracy in Russia
and allowed corruption to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky -- in the United States to seek support in a battle
with Russian President Vladimir Putin over control of the ORT, or
Channel One, television network -- defended President Clinton and
the U.S. pointman on Russian policy, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. and Clinton himself played a great role in moving
Russia to democracy,'' Berezovsky said at a speech at the Council
on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was defending itself against the 209-page report
released Wednesday that ''however well intentioned the policy'' to
Russia ''it didn't work'' -- turning a blind eye to corruption.
Democrats calls the report a political attack on Gore seven weeks
ahead of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's role, Berezovsky said corruption was endemic
in Czarist and Soviet Russia and that it multiplied as bureaucrats
privatized government property the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ''(But) that's no basis to say that Gore corrupted Russia or
participated in a program that corrupted Russia,'' said Berezovsky,
54.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, admitting he was under pressure from Putin to divest
himself of the ORT network, said he had come to the United States
to seek backing because of the power that American public opinion
has in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who supported Putin during the March elections but
has since broke with him, said that although Putin has
''concentrated all political power'' in his hands, the Russian
leader still has a vision of a democratic Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he has decided to follow an authoritarian way to push us
to democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who was trained as a mathematician, said Putin had
also destroyed the political structure set up by Putin's
predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. ''All political power today belongs to
the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia must have political stability to get Russian
business leaders to return capital into the economy. ''We need to
make sure that power is predictable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, who rose to influence under Yeltsin, said the former
president brought about a complete political and economic
revolution in eight years. He said all property was no longer owned
by the state and that Yeltsin had also diversified political power.
</P>
<P>
   But returning to his criticism of Putin, he said the current
chief of state ''has become a right-wing president with a
right-wing Duma (parliament).''

<HEADLINE> Nethercutt Survives Ballot Box Test  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Though he reneged on the term-limit pledge
that helped usher him into Congress, Rep. George Nethercutt
survived his first ballot box test since breaking his promise.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, whose campaign pledge to retire after three
terms helped him oust a 15-term congressman in 1994, overcame a
primary challenge Tuesday from a former radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maria Cantwell, a 41-year-old Internet executive who
spent $5 million of her money in her quest for the Democratic
Senate nomination, says she'll donate ''whatever it takes'' to
defeat GOP Sen. Slade Gorton in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Sen. Edward Kennedy won the Democratic
nomination without any opposition, and Democratic Rep. Marty Meehan
defeated two primary challengers though he, like Nethercutt, broke
a term limit pledge.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oklahoma runoff, attorney Brad Carson won the Democratic
nomination to face GOP car dealer Andy Ewing for an open House
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt's term-limit pledge helped him upset Democratic House
Speaker Tom Foley in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the wave of term-limit populism that put Nethercutt into
office in the eastern Washington district came back to haunt him
with criticism from primary opponent Richard Clear this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clear's low-budget campaign benefitted from TV ads and mailings
that criticized his broken pledge -- and even a costumed character,
the Weasel King -- that were produced by U.S. Term Limits, the group
that once backed Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt, 55, apologized for his flip-flop and said he decided
to run for a fourth term because he had unfinished business in
Congress. He wound up winning the primary with 45 percent of the
vote to Clear's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voters have expressed confidence in me,'' Nethercutt said.
</P>
<P>
   He will face former congressional aide Tom Keefe, who won the
Democratic primary race with 21 percent of the vote to 11 percent
for Tom Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Under Washington's 65-year-old blanket primary system, all four
candidates appeared together and voters could choose any one
regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's election was the last for the blanket primary. The
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the system -- also used in California
and Alaska -- violated the political parties' freedom of association
by letting voters cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's primary victory, Nethercutt indicated he would
try to capitalize on what could become Keefe's weak spot -- his
tenuous ties to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not from eastern Washington,'' said Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe, 52, moved to Spokane in April after living with his wife
and three children in Idaho, and spending much of his professional
life in Washington, D.C. He predicted Nethercutt would gain no
ground with voters if he presses the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will re-emphasize how out of touch he is with the
concerns of the people in this district,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Senate race promises to break state records, as
Cantwell, worth an estimated $40 million, tries to defeat Gorton, a
three-term incumbent targeted as one of the Senate's few vulnerable
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With about 94 percent of the vote counted Wednesday, Cantwell
was trouncing her main Democratic competitor, Deborah Senn, 36
percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton had 43 percent of the vote while three GOP challengers
each got 1 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unbelievable! This is just incredible. I am so proud,''
Cantwell told about 250 cheering supporters at a hotel ballroom in
suburban Lynnwood. ''I want to make the political system work for
real people of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Senn, the state's insurance commissioner, won endorsements from
labor, party stalwarts and Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate
for president. But Cantwell, a one-term former congresswoman,
blanketed the state with TV commercials and built name recognition
far beyond the Seattle suburbs she once represented.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said it's Cantwell's constitutional right to plow
millions into her campaign, but indicated he didn't like it. He
said he expects her campaign to be awash in money.
</P>
<P>
   ''She will come after us with $10 million. She simply writes
another check,'' he said. Gorton said his ''secret weapon'' is the
21,000 grass-roots supporters who have donated and will work for
him in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Washington, Gov. Gary Locke easily won the Democratic
nomination to seek a second term. Another former radio talk-show
host, John Carlson, won the GOP nod to challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   In the runoff in eastern Oklahoma, Carson, a 33-year-old
attorney and one-time congressional intern, won with 57 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope to take back the House seat left open by Rep. Tom
Coburn, a Republican who kept a pledge to retire after three terms.
Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by 5-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, Kennedy, seeking a seventh full term, will
face Jack E. Robinson, the Republican challenger who was abandoned
by his party and faced a long court fight just to get on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also went unchallenged in the primary, as did a
Libertarian candidate.

<HEADLINE> Union, district accept mediator's proposal to end teachers' strike  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Signaling an end to the on-again, off-again
Buffalo teachers strike, the Board of Education on Wednesday
unanimously accepted a state mediator's contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The board's long-awaited decision came a day after executives of
the Buffalo Teachers Federation voted to recommend approval of the
five-year proposal to the union's membership.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each side had to make sacrifices in some significant areas,''
said Board of Education President Paul Buchanan. ''But that is the
nature of negotiation. From our perspective, we also made important
strides in some areas that have been meaningful to us for some
time, and (in areas) that will allow us to have more control over
our costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on both sides effectively ends the labor dispute that
has canceled classes in the 47,000-student district three times
since the school year began Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,700 teachers will vote on the proposal at 4:30
p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mediator's offer would provide no raises in the first year
and a raise of up to 2 percent every six months after that for the
next four years. The district also would provide art, music and gym
in primary grades beginning next year, and be allowed to contract
with outside agencies to provide social services to students and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Also, beginning next year, teachers who retire with at least 15
years with the district would begin to pay for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This five-year agreement would provide an important period of
healing after what has been a contentious and sometimes acrimonious
collective bargaining process,'' mediators Adam Kaufman and Richard
Curreri wrote to Canedo and Buffalo Teachers Federation President
Philip Rumore in a letter accompanying the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were things in there we liked and things we didn't
like,'' Rumore said.
</P>
<P>
   While state mediators had hoped to have the board's decision by
Tuesday night, Superintendent Marion Canedo said school officials
needed more time to measure the proposal's financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   The district's financial team spent Wednesday crunching numbers
before meeting with the board for 90 minutes leading to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely pleased that this contract makes significant
acknowledgment of our goals with respect to preparing our students
to meet the new standards,'' Canedo said. ''Foremost among our
tasks is the preparation of our teachers, and this agreement gives
us much greater latitude in the area of staff development.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo teachers walked off the job Sept. 7 and Sept. 14 in
violation of the state's Taylor Law and a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore, the union and its three other officers are charged with
contempt for the latest walkout. They face trial in state Supreme
Court Thursday and could be fined and jailed if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps N.H. Governor  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton helped New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen collect $150,000 Wednesday for her re-election
campaign, but said he could never repay his political debt to her
and her state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lauded Shaheen's successes at starting public
kindergarten in the state, expanding health care for children in
low-income families and creating a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that these stands and continuing fights over
how to fund public education have upset some voters in a state
where taxes are an especially explosive subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admire her,'' Clinton said. ''There isn't anything more
important than figuring out how to fund education.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, the country's only woman Democratic governor, won her
primary for a third term a week ago. She faces former Sen. Gordon
Humphrey in the general election and the two have pounded each
other over how to pay for public schools.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 people paid $1,000 each to attend the fund-raiser at
Visions Cinema Bistro and Lounge. In addition, Maryland Gov. Parris
Glendening gave her a check from the Democratic Governors
Association for $75,000, which brought the group's total support to
her campaign to $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are her colleagues who know what she has done, how
valuable she is,'' Glendening said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen called the contributions ''real money'' in a state where
advertising costs are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recalled how grateful he was for her support in the
state crucial to presidential candidates at the start of his nearly
eight years in office. Clinton finished second among five
Democratic candidates in the 1992 primary, proclaiming himself
''the comeback kid'' after suffering weeks of controversy about
Gennifer Flowers and the Vietnam draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll never repay my debt,'' Clinton said of New Hampshire
voters. ''And I understand them, even when they're being ornery,''
he said to laughter.

<HEADLINE> Teacher's Strike Nears End in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A teachers strike that has canceled classes
three times since the start of school came a step closer to ending
Wednesday when the city's Board of Education agreed to a state
mediator's contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,700 teachers will vote on the proposed
five-year contract Friday. The Buffalo Teachers Federation has

working without a contract since June 1999.

   The mediator's proposal provides no raises in the first year and

<HEADLINE> Projectile Causes British Blast  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A projectile was fired at the headquarters of
Britain's MI6 intelligence agency headquarters in central London
late Wednesday, causing an explosion that damaged the building but
caused no casualties, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported hearing two explosions, large enough to send
up a plume of white smoke and to rattle buildings across a railway.
The blast brought firefighters, police and ambulances to the site
on the south bank of the River Thames, and police closed the area
around the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, in charge of the
Anti-Terrorist Branch, said that at 9:45 p.m. ''an object was fired
at Vauxhall Cross, which is the headquarters of the Secret
Intelligence Service.''
</P>
<P>
   ''An examination of the exterior of the building showed that
some form of small missile has hit the exterior at about the eighth
floor, he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the object was like a mortar shell, he said he doubted
it was that powerful. ''In all probability I would doubt it is a
mortar -- I would have expected more substantial damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fry said it was too early to say if Irish republican groups
might be involved. ''Clearly we have to keep in mind the
capabilities of dissident Irish groups, but at this stage we will
not be ruling out any group who might see the secret intelligence
service as a target,'' Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast caused minimal damage and the work of the intelligence
service was not disrupted, he said, adding that no claim of
responsibility for the attack has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose department is responsible
for MI6, said there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The large, cream and green modern-style structure was featured
in the James Bond movie, ''The World is not Enough'' and in one
scene was shown being blown up by a terrorist bomb.

   Police immediately closed off roads leading to the area, located
between Vauxhall and Lambeth bridges over the River Thames.
Officers in yellow slickers cordoned off the building, barring even
police cars from passing the barriers. The London Fire Brigade had
two fire engines and crews at the scene.

   ''We just heard two God-almighty bangs, a loud one first, and
then another one,'' said Theresa Harding, 68, who lives nearby.
''We honestly thought it was fireworks.''

   One witness, Andrew Preece, told BBC News 24 he was driving home

building.

   ''It looked as of it was internal from the center of the
building but the flash of light was from the top of the building,''
he said. ''It was followed by a large bang and the ground seemed to
shake and my car was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Office said it was tightening
security procedures after reported lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a laptop computer that contained missing training
information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid and
recovered by police two weeks later. News reports suggested that an
M16 agent left the laptop in a taxi after spending a night drinking
at a bar near the agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   MI6, formed in 1921, is responsible for foreign intelligence. It
is thought to cooperate closely with the domestic security service
MI5 in keeping track of Irish terror groups.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech spy headquarters bristles with security features.
Much of the complex is below street level to protect the most
sensitive areas from terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Indians Sweep Bosox in Doubleheader  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians are finding the best route
to the playoffs might be through tough enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   They beat Pedro Martinez, swept a day-night doubleheader over
the Boston Red Sox, 2-1 and 5-4, and jumped a half-game ahead of
Oakland in the AL wild-card race Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The road trip began with three wins in four games over AL East
leading New York at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the sight of Martinez (17-6) on the Fenway Park mound
stopped the Indians in the opener as Steve Woodard (2-3) pitched
six shutout innings. In the second game, they overcame a 3-0
deficit with the help of Omar Vizquel's steal of home.
</P>
<P>
   When the day began, Oakland led Cleveland by a half-game. But
the Athletics split a doubleheader in Baltimore to drop into second
place.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have another doubleheader Thursday against the
Indians, are reeling. They fell to fourth in the wild card race,
four games behind Cleveland with 11 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton had five hits and four runs in the doubleheader.
Manny Ramirez, shut down by Martinez, singled in the tying run in
the seventh inning of the second game and Jim Thome followed with
an RBI single that gave Cleveland the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay (5-8) got the win. Rheal Cormier (2-3) took the
loss after being caught napping by Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Boston led 3-0 on run-scoring doubles by Lou Merloni and an RBI
single by Brian Daubach before Roberto Alomar made it 3-2 with a
two-run single in the fifth. Vizquel, who had walked, and Alomar
pulled off a double steal before Ramirez walked. Cormier replaced
Paxton Crawford with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel took off from third, while Cormier took his time going
into his stretch, and stole home without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon gave Boston a 4-3 lead with his 10th homer in the
fifth before Cleveland went ahead in the seventh. Cormier allowed a
single to Lofton and a walk to Vizquel, and Rich Garces gave up the
decisive singles to Ramirez and Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which won the first game of the five-game series
Tuesday, had a good chance to make it two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was 9-0 against Cleveland. He was pitching against
Woodard, who was 2-10 with a 6.34 ERA overall this year, which he
began with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always told these guys one of these days we were going to
get him,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said. ''Pedro pitched
Pedro's way today. Our pitching stayed right there with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodard allowed three hits and no walks and struck out four. Bob
Wickman, who came over in the same trade July 28, saved both games,
giving him 12 with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Cleveland took a 1-0 lead as its first three
batters -- Lofton, Vizquel and Alomar -- singled in the first. Then
Martinez retired the next 16 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more he pitches, the more comfortable he gets,'' Alomar
said. ''We were being aggressive in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allowed one run, five hits and a walk and struck out
nine in eight innings as he lowered his major league-leading ERA to
1.78. In the ninth, Derek Lowe allowed Lofton's 14th homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a good feeling,'' Lowe said. ''You go into that game
thinking you have a really good chance. Pedro pitched extremely
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 2-1 in the bottom half on Troy O'Leary's RBI
single. But with runners at first and third and one out, Dante
Bichette grounded out and Daubach fanned.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Wickman retired Merloni on an inning-ending
double play with the bases loaded in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland second-game starter Dave Burba had nine
strikeouts, giving him a career-high 177 for the season. ...
Martinez allowed a first inning run for the first time in 12 starts
at home this season. ... Ramirez went 0-for-3 against Martinez,
then reached base six straight times on four singles and two walks
as he extended his streak of reaching base by a hit or a walk to 44
games. ... Boston manager Jimy Williams was ejected in the eighth
of the opener by plate umpire Richard Rieker. Russell Branyon swung
and missed with a 1-2 count, the ball got away, and catcher Jason
Varitek tagged Branyon for an apparent out. Rieker ruled the ball
was fouled off and Williams was thrown out for arguing.

<HEADLINE> Charge in Wilderness School Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEVIEW, Ore. (AP) -- A counselor at a wilderness school for
troubled youth has been charged in the death of a student who
apparently stopped breathing when the counselor sat on him to
restrain him, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Matthew Sharp, 22, was arrested Monday and charged with
criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a potential for more serious charges and potentially
more people may be charged,'' said Lake County District Attorney
David Schutt.
</P>
<P>
   William H. ''Eddie'' Lee, 15, died Monday. Autopsy results were
not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney gave this account of the evening's events:
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been camping in a remote area for 10 days with a small
group from Obsidian Trails Outdoor School. On Monday, Lee became
defiant and disruptive, though not violent, and Sharp and a female
counselor forced him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's face was in the dirt and Sharp was on top of him while the
female counselor held his arm. A second female counselor noticed
what was happening and ran over to hold a leg.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for 5 to 15 minutes, Lee went limp and the
counselors noticed he wasn't breathing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women attempted CPR and the other used a cell phone
to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''The account from the girl who started CPR was that she had to
get mud out of his nose and mouth,'' Schutt said. ''He was in soft,
pumicy dust. He was slobbering, which turned that stuff to mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Bodenhamer, the school's director, said he was confident
Sharp would be vindicated. He said Sharp and all field instructors
were trained in first-aid and restraining uncooperative youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened does not make sense to me. I don't know how
doing what they did would have caused Eddie's death,'' Bodenhamer
said. ''We are very upset with what happened. We are very concerned
with Eddie's family.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management revoked Obsidian
Trails' permit to operate in the district. It was one of four
wilderness schools for troubled youth operating there.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau had told Obsidian Trails to improve security after
two students ran away from camp last December and held a rancher
and his wife at knifepoint before stealing their car.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Woman Dies in Wildfire  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARADISE, Calif. (AP) -- A forest fire engulfed a woman's home on
Wednesday, killing her and injuring a firefighter who stayed until
the last minute trying to persuade her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, about three miles from Paradise in northern
California, started Tuesday and grew to more than 1,600 acres
during the night. Crews had expected to contain it by Wednesday
morning but shifting wind carried flames across containment lines,
California Department of Forestry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary evacuation order had been issued for the Paradise
area, affecting about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A captain from the forestry department tried to talk the woman
into leaving early Wednesday, but she refused, said Karen Terrill,
CDF public information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He stayed as long as he could, then he sustained injuries and
had to leave,'' Terrill said. She said the captain was treated for
burns on his hands and face.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Fire Chief Jim Broshears said firefighters can't force
people to leave. ''Once someone has left an area we can close it
and not let them in,'' he said. ''Otherwise we can strongly advise
that they leave and that there's an immediate threat.''
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other people were injured fighting the blaze,
which destroyed the woman's home and another structure. One person
was struck on the head by a falling tree, but was expected to
return to work within a few days, Terrill said. Six others were
injured when the fire overran two fire trucks. None of the injuries
was serious, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in the area, about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco,
were closed Wednesday because of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 11, Astros 6  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals became the first team
to clinch a playoff spot this season, winning the NL Central on
Wednesday night when Jim Edmonds' grand slam sent them to an 11-6
win over the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd at Busch Stadium saw the Cardinals win the
division title for the first time since 1996, manager Tony La
Russa's first year with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were on the feet when Tim Bogar lined to second baseman
Fernando Vina for the final out. As fireworks exploded overhead,
the Cardinals rushed to celebrate on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa won his seventh division crown, doing it four times in
Oakland and once with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' slam came in the third inning and Ray Lankford homered
on the next pitch from Chris Holt, giving the Cardinals an early
cushion. Lankford and Craig Paquette each homered twice as St.
Louis won for the eighth time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who had three straight NL Central championships, had
their five-game winning streak stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has a career-high 41 homers, eight more than his
previous best in 1995. His power has helped fill the void left by
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was on the disabled list for two months and limited
to 79 games by a severe case of tendinitis in his right knee, has
been reduced to pinch-hit duties since his return Sept. 8. He's
3-for-8 with two homers.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning. He has said
it's extremely doubtful he'll be able to play first base when the
playoffs begin in the first week of October.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo hit his 41st home run for Houston. Jeff Bagwell
scored his 147th run, breaking the Astros record set by Craig
Biggio in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 38,653, watching in 59-degree weather, was the 34th
sellout of the season for the Cardinals, breaking the team record
set in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The fans saw St. Louis set and tie several long-ball records.
The Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   -- Hit consecutive homers for the 15th time, matching the NL mark
set by the 1956 Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals missed a 16th time
when Paquette and Lankford connected in the seventh off Brian
Powell, with an Edmonds' strikeout in between.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hit their 11th grand slam, extending the team's single-season
record.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hit their 228th homer, breaking the team record of 223 set in
1998. That was the year McGwire hit a record 70.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Rick Ankiel (10-7) was also on his game, allowing three
runs -- two earned -- on four hits in seven innings with eight
strikeouts. He held the Astros, who had scored 47 runs during their
winning streak, hitless the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (7-15) lasted four innings, allowing eight runs on eight
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo hit his fifth homers in nine games at Busch Stadium this
season in the sixth. Houston scored twice in the fifth on Raul
Chavez's bloop single and a sacrifice fly by Keith Ginter in his
major league plate appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Mike Matheny, Vina and Paquette loaded the bases with
one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit a drive over the right-field wall for his second
career grand slam on a 3-2 pitch for the first runs of the game. On
the next pitch, Lankford hit his 25th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Vina added an RBI single in the fourth for the Cardinals and
Edgar Renteria had a run-scoring groundout in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals were a combined 23 games below .500 in the
last three years since winning the NL Central in 1996. ... Edmonds'
homer was his 40th by an outfielder, a team record. He has hit one
as a first baseman. ... Roger Cedeno had two hits for Houston. He's
6-for-6 in the first two games of the series. ... Ankiel has won
only four of his last 16 starts, during which he's 4-4. But the
Cardinals are 11-5 in that stretch. ... The Cardinals, who lost 8-6
in 10 innings Tuesday, haven't lost consecutive games since Aug.
8-9 against the Marlins.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Requests Halt  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- An American held hostage by Muslim
rebels appealed to the Philippine government Wednesday to halt a
military assault aiming to free him and other captives so that
negotiations can resume.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still alive,'' Jeffrey Schilling, a Muslim convert from
Oakland, Calif., said in a radio interview broadcast Thursday.
''I'm fine, I'm well.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, conducted by satellite telephone, was the first
confirmation that Schilling was alive since thousands of troops
launched an assault on Saturday on remote Jolo island to rescue him
and 18 other hostages held by Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Two French journalists escaped from the rebels on Tuesday,
leaving Schilling, three Malaysians, a Filipino abducted in April,
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, conducted Wednesday night with the Radio
Mindanao Network, Schilling asked that the military operation be
stopped so negotiations could continue. He said civilians were
being hurt by the assault, creating more support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his Filipino wife on
Aug. 28 and was reportedly abducted after he argued with the rebels
about religion. His wife was not seized.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf say they are seeking an independent Islamic state
in the predominantly Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya, who spoke in the same radio
interview, acknowledged that four of his men had been killed in the
assault and said the rebels were open to negotiations with the
Philippine and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   The military says seven rebels have been killed and 20 captured
in the six days of fighting, while six government soldiers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday he would order a halt to
the assault if all the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   The two French journalists' escape was portrayed as vindication
of the government's decision to use force against the rebels. The
two television journalists, taken captive July 9, credited their
nighttime escape to the army assault.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada beamed as he presented the journalists at a news
conference in Manila, an arm around each.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can see for yourself, these two gentlemen are in good
shape,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists -- Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura of
France-2 television -- were seized while visiting a rebel camp to
interview other hostages and escaped Tuesday evening amid confusion
as the guerrillas fled the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took the opportunity of the military pressure,'' Le Garrec
said. He said the two bolted as the rebels were crossing a road.
After hiding overnight in the jungle, they flagged down a military
truck at dawn and were taken to an army camp.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Abu Sayyaf have kidnapped scores of people since
March. Most have been released, with Libya and Malaysia reportedly
paying more than $15 million for 19 foreigners. Estrada's decision
to attack the rebels last weekend has been widely supported by
Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Lawyer in Court Over Movie  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After failing to stop a planned TV movie
about O.J. Simpson's criminal trial, his lawyer returned to court
Wednesday seeking damages for what he said was a conspiracy to
defraud Simpson out of privileged information.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Lawrence Schiller, whose book ''American
Tragedy'' is the basis of the movie, suggested outside court that
Simpson is trying an end run around the earlier ruling that the
movie could go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to cause as much trouble as possible so that
maybe it will not go forward,'' attorney Gary Bostwick said.
</P>
<P>
   In a legal brief, he said the lawsuit is ''a transparent attempt
by plaintiff O.J. Simpson to silence his critics and to stifle
public debate about his criminal trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe refused to
issue a preliminary injunction to stop the movie. The judge said he
was unconvinced the broadcast of ''American Tragedy'' would harm
Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996
best-selling book on which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson did not sue when the book was published.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Terry Gross, who represents Simpson, said his client is
now seeking millions in damages from Schiller and Robert
Kardashian, the lawyer who provided inside information on the
defense team for Schiller's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants these people brought to justice,'' Gross said. ''It's
about punishing these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who now lives in Florida, was not in court Wednesday.
His suit claims Schiller and Kardashian violated privacy contracts
and published confidential material covered by attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part miniseries is scheduled for broadcast Nov. 12 and
Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, it focuses on the tensions and strategies of the
legal ''dream team'' that won Simpson's acquittal in the 1994
slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend,
Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was found liable for the killings in a later civil trial
and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Fumiko H. Wasserman asked lawyers to file
further briefs on the issue and scheduled a hearing for Oct. 24.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Authorities Detain 38 Iraqis  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Agents held 38 Iraqis at the Mexican border
Wednesday after small groups of them tried to walk into the United
States without visas, INS officials said. Mexican police detained
about 150 others in a Tijuana hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from someone claiming to represent the group said the
Iraqis are Chaldeans, who are Christian, who were tired of waiting
in Tijuana for permission to enter the United States and decided to
present themselves en masse at the border, according to an INS
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Chaldeans have been requesting U.S. asylum in recent years
claiming religious persecution in Iraq, a Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
   They were awaiting interpreters Wednesday at the San Ysidro Port
of Entry, which links San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, so they could
explain their case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
said spokeswoman Lauren Mack.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are very well, very calm, very quiet,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least 150 others were being detained at a nearby
hotel in downtown Tijuana, guarded by Mexican police officers.
Police have not said why the group is being held.
</P>
<P>
   One person inside held up a white sheet painted with the words,
''We Want USA.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-based Iraqis who had come to Mexico to see relatives in the
group said the refugees had been there for two to four months
trying to get visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are tired of waiting,'' said Romil Gewarges, a Phoenix
resident visiting his sister-in-law and her family.
</P>
<P>
   Gewarges said he didn't know how the group got to Tijuana, but
he said living conditions in Iraq prompted them to leave. ''There's
no food, no medicine, basically they're starving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man standing outside the hotel said some had lived in
Greece for several years before traveling to Mexico City and then
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them want to be in the United States,'' said Faris
Mikha of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Agents who say Chaldeans don't normally enter through Mexico are
trying to determine how they arrived and whether they used
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for such a large group of foreign citizens to
attempt to enter together at San Ysidro, the world's busiest border
crossing, said Louis Semon, a spokesman for the Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Extra INS agents stood along San Ysidro's northbound walkway to
check the documents of each person headed for the United States,
delaying a usually quick passage.

<HEADLINE> Judge Clears U.S. in Waco Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge cleared the government of any
wrongdoing in the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians during the 1993
standoff with federal agents at the cult's compound.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith's ruling, issued late
Wednesday, mirrors the conclusions an advisory jury and Special
Counsel John Danforth reached in July. Both have said Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and others were not
responsible for the deaths on the final day of a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's ruling came in a $675 million wrongful-death lawsuit
filed by surviving Branch Davidians and relatives of those who were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Wednesday, Smith said ATF agents acted within the
limits of the law and, under the circumstances of the standoff,
could not be held liable.
</P>
<P>
   ''No ATF agent fired any shot nor used any force against
residents of the Compound and the Davidians that was unprovoked,''
Smith wrote in his order. ''Gunfire was directed at ATF agents by
both male and female adult Davidians. No ATF agent fired any shot
nor used any force against residents of the Compound and the
Davidians that was indiscriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead attorney for the plaintiffs, Michael Caddell, was not
immediately available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Erich Holder said the Justice Department
was pleased with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like the Special Counsel before it, the court reaffirmed the
fact that David Koresh, and certain Branch Davidians, were
responsible for the tragedy at Waco,'' Holder said. ''Today's
decision appropriately recognizes that many law enforcement
officers risked their lives to uphold our nation's laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-member advisory jury decided in July that the
government did not use excessive force in its attempt to serve
search and arrest warrants on Branch Davidian leader David Koresh
on Feb. 28, 1993. A gun battle broke out and four ATF agents and
six Davidians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also decided the government's actions on the final day of
the siege, April 19, 1993, were not negligent and did not
contribute to the deaths of about 80 sect members. The government
said suicidal sect members started fires in the building and were
responsible for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brought in the advisory panel to give its findings on
whether the ATF used excessive force in the raid by provoking a
gunfight and then firing indiscriminately on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was also asked to decide whether the FBI acted
negligently by using tanks on the final day of siege in a way that
deviated from an approved plan; contributed to or caused the fire
that brought the standoff to a fiery end; and acted negligently by
deciding against fighting a fire if one broke out.

<HEADLINE> 'Missile' Fired at Britain's MI6  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Unknown attackers fired a ''small missile'' at the
headquarters of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency in central London
late Wednesday, causing an explosion on the eighth floor, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast caused limited damage and no injuries at the 10-story
structure at the heart of Britain's intelligence abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported hearing two explosions, large enough to send
up a plume of white smoke and to rattle buildings across a railway.
The blast brought firefighters, police and ambulances to the site
on the south bank of the River Thames, and police closed the area
around the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, in charge of the
Anti-Terrorist Branch, said that at 9:45 p.m. ''an object was fired
at Vauxhall Cross, which is the headquarters of the Secret
Intelligence Service.''
</P>
<P>
   ''An examination of the exterior of the building showed that
some form of small missile has hit the exterior at about the eighth
floor,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the object was like a mortar shell, he said he doubted
it was that powerful. ''In all probability I would doubt it is a
mortar -- I would have expected more substantial damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fry said it was too early to say if Irish republican groups
might be involved. ''Clearly we have to keep in mind the
capabilities of dissident Irish groups, but at this stage we will
not be ruling out any group who might see the secret intelligence
service as a target,'' Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast caused minimal damage and the work of the intelligence
service was not disrupted, he said, adding that no claim of
responsibility for the attack has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose department is responsible
for MI6, said there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-story, cream and green modern-style structure was
featured in the James Bond movie, ''The World is not Enough'' and
in one scene was shown being blown up by a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately closed off roads leading to the area, located
between Vauxhall and Lambeth bridges over the River Thames.
Officers in yellow slickers cordoned off the building, barring even
police cars from passing the barriers. The London Fire Brigade had
two fire engines and crews at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just heard two God-almighty bangs, a loud one first, and
then another one,'' said Theresa Harding, 68, who lives nearby.
''We honestly thought it was fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Andrew Preece, told BBC News 24 he was driving home
when he saw a flash of light coming from the top of the MI6
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked as of it was internal from the center of the
building but the flash of light was from the top of the building,''
he said. ''It was followed by a large bang and the ground seemed to
shake and my car was shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Office said it was tightening
security procedures after reported lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a laptop computer that contained missing training
information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid and
recovered by police two weeks later. News reports suggested that an
M16 agent left the laptop in a taxi after spending a night drinking
at a bar near the agency's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   MI6, formed in 1921, is responsible for foreign intelligence. It
is thought to cooperate closely with the domestic security service
MI5 in keeping track of Irish terror groups.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech spy headquarters bristles with security features.
Much of the complex is below street level to protect the most
sensitive areas from terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Criticizes France  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- European Union transport ministers
criticized France on Wednesday for giving a tax break to truckers
protesting high fuel prices, a move that inspired similar anti-tax
blockades across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While EU ministers held an emergency meeting and failed to
coordinate their tax policies amid the protests, thousands of
fishermen and farmers shut down ports in Spain, surrounded
wholesale fish markets and blockaded fuel distribution centers for
a sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 farmers on tractors and in trucks shut off fuel
delivery to parts of southern and eastern Spain when they
temporarily surrounded three fuel distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   On the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, about 60 fishing
boats blockaded the ports of Palma de Mallorca and Alcudia, even
blocking passenger ferries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the edge of an economic abyss,'' said Pep Bonnin,
spokesman for the Mallorcan Fisherman's Guild. Diesel fuel in Spain
has gone up 55 percent in the past year to about $1.70 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which began in France on Sept. 4, might now spread
to Canada, as 1,800 independent truckers there threatened to strike
Friday unless something was done to reduce fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   European nations have taken sharply contrasting responses to the
wave of protests that over the past month has paralyzed highways,
ports and fuel depots across the continent. France bowed to some
trucker demands and granted tax rebates. Germany and Britain remain
holdouts against lower fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At their emergency meeting in Luxembourg, ministers from at
least seven nations, including Germany and Britain, took France to
task for their move, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   German Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt, referring to a
previous agreement by EU finance ministers not to lower fuel taxes
for short-term political gain, told reporters, ''I don't believe it
is right to ignore a decision that we took, with the agreement of
France.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15 European Union ministers gathered to try to find a way to
end the demonstrations against the high price of fuel in Europe --
where fuel taxes range from 51 percent in Greece to 73 percent in
Britain, where diesel averaged $4.33 a gallon last month.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no takers for a proposal to ''harmonize'' fuel
taxes across the EU. Britain, which has viewed efforts to equalize
taxes EU-wide as an unacceptable erosion of national powers, spoke
most strongly against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the ministers made a joint declaration appealing to the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce oil
more in line with consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, some 300 taxis brought traffic to a near-standstill
in the northern city of Kiel. The drivers threatened fare increases
of 15 percent if the government didn't come to their aid to defray
fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 30 trucks turned out for a go-slow protest in
Frankfurt, far fewer than police expected.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Germany pledged measures to help commuters pay for
gas and needy apartment dwellers pay for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Klimmt backed the idea of credits for hard-pressed transport
firms. Transport of goods by roads accounts for 85 percent of all
cargo traffic in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fund Raising Hits $200 Million  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee smashed
through the $200 million fund-raising mark and entered September
with $63 million in the bank, establishing a huge financial
advantage over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' balance at the beginning of the month was
almost as much as the $67.6 million in public funds that the
presidential nominees each received to run their fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a virtual doubling of a campaign's advertising budget,''
former Republican chairman Richard Bond said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they raised $29.3 million last month, $21.5
million of that within federal limits that mean the money can be
used to directly aid Republican candidates. Since Jan. 1, 1999, the
Republican National Committee has raised around $210 million in
all.
</P>
<P>
   While trailing the GOP in fund raising, the Democratic National
Committee did take in $26 million at big-ticket events in the four
weeks since its national convention, including $5.1 million at a
post-convention gala featuring Barbra Streisand and a concert at
Radio City Music Hall last week that brought in $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Vice President Al Gore has received $67.6 million for
his presidential campaign, but the Democrats will have less money
than the GOP to spend separately on his behalf. Party officials
declined to say how much less until they release their fund-raising
figures on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have enough to be competitive, but we, unlike
the Republicans, don't think the party that brings in the most
amount of money is the party that wins the race,'' spokeswoman
Jenny Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, the GOP had $53 million in the bank to $33
million for the Democrats. Of those totals, the Republicans had
$21.1 million in federally limited contributions to just $9.3
million for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion, said Gore will have enough money to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can target a few more places and send out a few more
messages,'' Miringoff said. ''It may allow for a few more flurries
in targeted areas, but it's all at the margins. I don't think
people in targeted states are going to notice a lack of Democratic
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic consultant Peter Fenn said the Republicans'
fund-raising edge could have an impact. ''If the Republicans are
going to spend this kind of money, it makes it tough in
battleground states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore reported spending $11.3 million of his $67.6
million general election account during the last two weeks of
August -- with $9 million going for media. During the last week of
August, for example, a Gore biographical ad ran on TV in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore reported spending an additional $3.6 million
from his primary election account, bringing his pre-nomination
spending total to almost $48 million. He spent $101,360 reimbursing
the government for travel aboard Air Force Two, $229,995 on
polling, and $446,570 on media.
</P>
<P>
   As he did throughout the primary campaign, Bush spent much more
than Gore for the general election. He spent $21.5 million,
including $12.1 million on media, and another $3.5 million on air
charters. The difference this time is Bush is limited to how much
he can spend through Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up his record-setting primary spending spree, Bush
spent more than $2 million last month, breaking the $100 million
mark. Having already raised more than $100 million, he took in
another $1.4 million in contributions, including $23,000 in
political action committee donations from the maritime industry and
its unions.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republican committee will spend some of its bank
account helping state parties and congressional candidates, the
bulk of its money is expected to be spent trying to elect Bush. GOP
officials hope to spend as much as $50 million on get-out-the-vote
efforts for the entire Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that big bank account already is being put to work; so
far this month, the RNC has spent around $8 million on television
commercials in support of Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bond suggested that in the end, the party may wind up spending
more money on ads designed to help elect Bush than will the
presidential campaign itself. As long as the party-sponsored ads do
not specifically urge voters to support Bush or oppose Gore, there
are few limits on what the GOP can spend.
</P>
<P>
   That the party would outspend the separate presidential campaign
on the candidate ''is just an unheard-of proposition,'' Bond said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Probing Alleged Ticket Scalping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The IOC is investigating allegations
that tickets provided to some national Olympic committees are being
resold to scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic
Committee, acknowledged Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) that such
sales might have happened without the direct knowledge of the
national panels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to investigate. We have to know the facts,'' Carrard
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its Thursday edition, the Sydney Morning Herald said some
Olympic committees from rich nations, including the United States,
Switzerland, Italy, Venezuela and Russia, were guilty of the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee said it was abiding by the rules but
could not control what happens with tickets once it distributes
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are probably 25,000 tickets that bear the name of the
USOC all over the city,'' committee spokesman Mike Moran said.
''The U.S. delegation is not in any way involved in the selling of
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the individual tickets that the guests of our sports
federations or our athletes or all of that, those are situations
over which we have no direct control.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said the tickets allocated to NOCs are then distributed
to sponsors, coaches, partners and friends, who in turn may resell
those tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not easy for a national Olympic committee to control the
whole chain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to identify any of the NOCs involved.
</P>
<P>
   IOC rules forbid any agency other than the local organizing
committee from selling tickets in the host country of the games,
and NOCs also have licensing agreements with the organizers to
prevent them from selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the local organizing committee SOCOG announced
one scalper had been deported and another would be later Thursday.
Both were from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Selling tickets from national federations or committees to
scalpers is a recurring issue at major events. It is especially
touchy at world and European soccer championships since the tickets
might end up in the hands of hooligans.

<HEADLINE> Swede Wins Gold in 50-Meter Rifle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Jonas Edman's near-perfect qualifying
round got him to the finals. A solid performance there won him the
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Edman of Sweden fell one point short of a perfect 600 score in
the opening round and went on Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) to win
the men's 50-meter rifle prone event with 701.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Olympics, so 600 would be great,'' Edman said. ''But
I'm still very happy with winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Torben Grimmel of Denmark won the silver with 700.4 and Sergei
Martynov of Belarus the bronze with 700.3. Martynov qualified just
behind Edman with 598 points. Grimmel shot a 597 to reach the final
round of eight.
</P>
<P>
   ''In qualification, I was quite nervous and I had a fast pulse,
but it didn't seem to bother me much,'' Edman said. ''I tried to
stay calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Alifirenko of Russia won the 25-meter rapid fire pistol
event, with a score of 687.6. Michel Ansermet of Switzerland
finished second with 686.1 and Iulian Raicea of Romania took the
bronze with 684.6.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Ralf Schumann, who won gold in 1992 and 1996, failed
in his attempt to win an unprecedented third straight rapid pistol
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Schumann scored 584 to place seventh in the eight-man final. He
added 99.3 points there to move into fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   John McNally of Heath, Texas, scored 578 points and finished in
a 15th-place tie.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Babb of Germany and Russia's Sergei Kovalenko, medal
favorites in the 50-meter rifle, failed to reach the final round.
World Cup champion Jozef Gonci of Slovakia, the bronze medalist at
the 1996 Atlanta Games, did not compete.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Dubis of Bethel Park, Pa., finished in a three-way tie for
10th after scoring 595 points in qualifying. Tom Tamas of Columbus,
Ga., tied for 13th, one point behind Dubis.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 3, Cubs 2, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- First baseman Mark Grace misplayed Geoff
Jenkins' grounder for an error in the bottom of the 10th inning
Wednesday night, giving the Milwaukee Brewers a 3-2 victory over
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Jon Lieber took a shutout into the ninth, but
Jenkins led off with a home run and Jeromy Burnitz homered with one
out to tie it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Ron Belliard singled to start the Brewers 10th. He
took third when Kyle Farnsworth (1-9) threw away Marquis Grissom's
bunt trying for a force at second.
</P>
<P>
   After Mark Loretta was intentionally walked to load the bases,
Will Ohman relieved. Jenkins hit a grounder that glanced off
Grace's glove, scoring Belliard.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, the Brewers beat the Cubs 9-8 when third baseman
Shane Andrews' error scored the winning run in the ninth.
Farnsworth also took the loss in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic (7-3) pitched two hitless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber allowed five hits through eight innings, walking none and
striking out six.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Criticize France  </HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- European Union transport ministers
criticized France on Wednesday for giving a tax break to truckers
protesting high fuel prices, a move that inspired similar anti-tax
blockades across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While EU ministers held an emergency meeting and failed to
coordinate their tax policies amid the protests, thousands of
fishermen and farmers shut down ports in Spain, surrounded
wholesale fish markets and blockaded fuel distribution centers for
a sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 farmers on tractors and in trucks shut off fuel
delivery to parts of southern and eastern Spain when they
temporarily surrounded three fuel distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   On the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, about 60 fishing
boats blockaded the ports of Palma de Mallorca and Alcudia, even
blocking passenger ferries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the edge of an economic abyss,'' said Pep Bonnin,
spokesman for the Mallorcan Fisherman's Guild. Diesel fuel in Spain
has gone up 55 percent in the past year to about $1.70 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, which began in France on Sept. 4, might now spread
to Canada, as 1,800 independent truckers there threatened to strike
Friday unless something was done to reduce fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   European nations have taken sharply contrasting responses to the
wave of protests that over the past month has paralyzed highways,
ports and fuel depots across the continent. France bowed to some
trucker demands and granted tax rebates. Germany and Britain remain
holdouts against lower fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   At their emergency meeting in Luxembourg, ministers from at
least seven nations, including Germany and Britain, took France to
task for their move, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   German Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt, referring to a
previous agreement by EU finance ministers not to lower fuel taxes
for short-term political gain, told reporters, ''I don't believe it
is right to ignore a decision that we took, with the agreement of
France.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15 European Union ministers gathered to try to find a way to
end the demonstrations against the high price of fuel in Europe --
where fuel taxes range from 51 percent in Greece to 73 percent in
Britain, where diesel averaged $4.33 a gallon last month.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no takers for a proposal to ''harmonize'' fuel
taxes across the EU. Britain, which has viewed efforts to equalize
taxes EU-wide as an unacceptable erosion of national powers, spoke
most strongly against the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the ministers made a joint declaration appealing to the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to produce oil
more in line with consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, some 300 taxis brought traffic to a near-standstill
in the northern city of Kiel. The drivers threatened fare increases
of 15 percent if the government didn't come to their aid to defray
fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 30 trucks turned out for a go-slow protest in
Frankfurt, far fewer than police expected.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Germany pledged measures to help commuters pay for
gas and needy apartment dwellers pay for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Klimmt backed the idea of credits for hard-pressed transport
firms. Transport of goods by roads accounts for 85 percent of all
cargo traffic in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bus Crashes Into Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Corkeron family is unlikely to
forget the Sydney Games, not for the swimming and cycling but for
an Olympic bus that hurtled into their yard, uprooting several
trees and smashing their car.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd decorated our house for the Olympic Games, but we didn't
expect them to get this close,'' Tony Corkeron said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver had just dropped spectators off at the nearby
velodrome on Wednesday when he lost control of the bus and drove
straight into the Corkerons' front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The bus pushed across the yard, hit a car that was parked
outside, and smashed into the garage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty well a write-off,'' Corkeron said, referring to
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Another car and refrigerator inside the garage were also
damaged, Corkeron said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Road Transport Authority, which has been plagued by
problems with the mass-transit system for the games, said in a
report that the bus driver had lost control after failing to make a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Corkeron said the driver had apparently pulled on the hand brake
after the foot brakes failed, but that ''it came away in his
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver suffered cuts and was taken to the hospital for
observation, a report in the Sydney Morning Herald said.
</P>
<P>
   Corkeron said Olympic officials had dropped in to apologize for
the accident.

<HEADLINE> Teen Charged in Beheading of Mother  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERCED, Calif. (AP) -- A teen who was found near his mother's
decapitated body, sitting in a pool of her blood and reading the
Bible, was charged Wednesday with killing her.
</P>
<P>
   David Lange, 18, had been sent home Friday from his
house-painting job after repeatedly rambling to his boss, ''I am
not evil,'' the boss, Hector Ramos, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said he told Aurelia Lange, 50, that her son needed help
and that she said she would consider getting counseling for him.
She died Friday from a severe beating and stabs to her lungs and
heart.
</P>
<P>
   No plea was entered during a brief court appearance Wednesday,
and the case was continued until Sept. 28 so Lange's public
defender has more time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Lange's father spoke briefly with the lanky youth in a hallway
before he was led into court, and later left the courtroom without
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelia Lange's body was discovered after her daughter Ronnie
Lange, who didn't live at the home, phoned 911 and asked deputies
to check on her mother, saying the woman had called her and said
she fell down a flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Merced County Assistant Sheriff Henry Strength said the daughter
also reported that the mother said her ''son was getting out of
hand and that she was having arguments with him.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical storm Norman formed in the Pacific
on Wednesday, dumping heavy rains on portions of Mexico's southwest
coast that left nine dead in flooding and mudslides as it headed
toward land.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings were in effect for a 186-mile stretch of
the southwest coast from Zihuatanejo north to Manzanillo, according
to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Zihuatanejo is located
about 110 miles north of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains already affecting the southwest coast were
expected to continue, with accumulations of 8-12 inches forecast
for the storm warning areas as well as farther north and south
along the coast, and well inland.
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas, four people were killed Tuesday night when they were
buried in a landslide in the coastal city of Tapachula, civil
protection officials said. A fifth drowned in the Chiapas
municipality of Concordia.
</P>
<P>
   In Acapulco, four others were killed Wednesday, the government
news agency Notimex reported. Two were swept away by river
currents. One man was knocked off his roof by the storm's 45 mph
winds. Another man was killed when a tree fell onto his car.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains flooded streets and homes, brought down trees, and
caused some dividing walls to collapse onto homes in southwestern
Mexico, authorities there said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities set up 200 shelters along the coast, Notimex
reported.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses $85M Viagra Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan judge dismissed an $85 million
lawsuit filed against Pfizer Inc. by a man who said he had a heart
attack after taking the impotence pill Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision released Wednesday, State Supreme Court Justice
Louis York said Robert Selig, 60, a New York antiques dealer,
failed to prove that the heart attack he suffered on July 8, 1998,
was caused by Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   York cited testimony by Selig's cardiologist, who said the heart
attack was caused by ''a severe blockage to one of his arteries.''
The judge also noted that Selig was overweight and had high
cholesterol, factors that can put a person at risk for heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   York refused to allow testimony from an expert Selig's lawyer
said would have said Viagra causes cardiac problems and that
Selig's heart attack was caused by the three Viagra pills he took
in April, May and early July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's expert, Dr. George I. Mallis, based his opinion on a
study he did and on similar studies by others.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's experts said Mallis' methods and theories are not
generally accepted in the scientific community, York wrote. He said
scientific technique does not allow scientists to choose results
that support their theories and ignore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   One Pfizer expert, Dr. Edmund H. Sonnenblick, said Selig took
his last Viagra pill four to six days before his heart attack and
the drug would have been out of his system by the time he had his
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's lawyer, Ronald Benjamin, called York's decision
''moronic'' and said he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Yarin, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said that since Viagra
went on sale in April 1998, ''extensive testing, reported in the
scientific literature, has proven Viagra's safety as well as its
efficacy.'' She said some 10 million men worldwide have used the
drug.

<HEADLINE> Bonds' Splash Homer Ties Gehrig  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds' 493rd career homer splashed
down in McCovey Cove on Wednesday night, tying him with Lou Gehrig
for 17th place on the majors' career homers list.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' homer, his 48th of the season, came in the fifth inning
against Steve Parris. Bonds hit a 1-1 pitch well over the brick
walkway on top of the right-field wall at Pacific Bell Park and
into the water beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After rounding the bases to a raucous ovation, Bonds handed his
bat to tennis great John McEnroe, who was watching the game from a
seat near the Giants' dugout. Bonds also took a curtain call and
was serenaded by chants of ''Barry! Barry!'' and ''M-V-P!'' when he
took the field in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds is responsible for six of the seven homers that have
landed in McCovey Cove this season, the Giants' first at Pac Bell.
Los Angeles' Todd Hundley is the only other hitter to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' 48 homers this season are the most by a Giants
left-fielder in the franchise's 110-year history. He broke a tie
with Kevin Mitchell, who hit 47 in 1989, and he is four homers shy
of Willie Mays' single-season franchise record of 52.

<HEADLINE> Twelve Colombia Hostages Freed  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Amid clashes with troops, leftist rebels
on Wednesday released twelve of the hostages they seized last
weekend along a highway in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers died in the fighting in western mountains above
Cali, Colombia's third largest city. The military claimed the
attack forced the guerrillas to free the hostages. The leftist
National Liberation Army, or ELN, still holds 43 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 80 people were kidnapped Sunday, most from roadside
restaurants along the Via Al Mar, or Highway to the Sea, which
meanders from Cali toward the Pacific Ocean, 45 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The freed men and women were evacuated by helicopter to a
military base in Cali, where their cheering family members embraced
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Liberation Army freed us in the morning and we
walked until we came upon the army, and they protected us,'' former
hostage Mario Herreno said in an interview with Colombia's RCN
television.
</P>
<P>
   Herreno said the rebels told the group Tuesday that they were
going to be freed. It was unclear how military pressure influenced
that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mass abduction, military officials said they would
maintain a cordon around the area, but would proceed cautiously
with any operations.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential peace envoy Camilo Gomez said he was making
diplomatic contacts with the guerrillas to seek a nonviolent
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's releases brought to 37 the number of people freed
since Sunday. Estimates of the number of remaining hostages ranged
widely, however.
</P>
<P>
   Herreno said he believed the ELN was still holding 23 prisoners,
though army estimates put the number at 43.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN, a 5,000-member rebel group and Colombia's
second-largest leftist insurgency, has not claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The group is believed to be seeking ransom and to force peace
concessions from the government. It has been trying to force its
way into a government peace process that has focused on talks with
a more powerful group, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Force of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN carried out a string of mass abductions last year,
including a raid on a Catholic Mass near Cali, to obtain ransoms
and pressure the government for concessions in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate, with nearly
3,000 abductions reported last year and at least 1,750 through July
of this year, according to the private Free Country monitoring
group.

<HEADLINE> US Hostage Asks for Halt in Assault  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- In the first confirmation that he was
still alive, an American held hostage by Muslim rebels appealed to
the Philippine government Wednesday to halt its military assault
aiming to free him and other captives and resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still alive,'' Jeffrey Schilling, a Muslim convert from
Oakland, Calif., said in a radio interview broadcast Thursday.
''I'm fine, I'm well.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, conducted by satellite telephone, was the first
word from Schilling since thousands of troops launched an assault
on Saturday on remote Jolo island to rescue him and 18 other
hostages held by Abu Sayyaf rebels. The attack sent rebels fleeing
with their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Two French journalists escaped from the rebels on Tuesday,
leaving Schilling, three Malaysians, a Filipino abducted in April,
and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, conducted Wednesday night with the Radio
Mindanao Network, Schilling asked that the military operation be
stopped. He said civilians were being hurt by the assault, creating
more support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am appealing to negotiators to talk to the U.S. government
and have the operations immediately ceased, the negotiations
continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling visited an Abu Sayyaf camp with his Filipino wife on
Aug. 28 and was reportedly abducted after he argued with the rebels
about religion. His wife was not seized.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf say they are seeking an independent Islamic state
in the predominantly Catholic Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya, who spoke in the same radio
interview, acknowledged that four of his men had been killed in the
assault and said the rebels were open to negotiations with the
Philippine and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   He threatened to kidnap more foreigners if Shilling were
rescued. ''The military operation is very intense. They said they
will conduct a commando type of rescue operation, but what we see
is World War III,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they believe Schilling was not
speaking freely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mr. Sabaya was telling him what to say and Mr. Sabaya
was using him for his own propaganda efforts,'' said presidential
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno.
</P>
<P>
   The military says seven rebels have been killed and 20 captured
in the six days of fighting, while six government soldiers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada said Wednesday he would order a halt to
the assault if all the hostages are freed.
</P>
<P>
   The two French journalists' escape was portrayed as vindication
of the government's decision to use force against the rebels. The
two television journalists, taken captive July 9, credited their
nighttime escape to the army assault.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada beamed as he presented the journalists at a news
conference in Manila, an arm around each.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you can see for yourself, these two gentlemen are in good
shape,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists -- Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and Roland Madura of
France-2 television -- were seized while visiting a rebel camp to
interview other hostages and escaped Tuesday evening amid confusion
as the guerrillas fled the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took the opportunity of the military pressure,'' Le Garrec
said. He said the two bolted as the rebels were crossing a road.
After hiding overnight in the jungle, they flagged down a military
truck at dawn and were taken to an army camp.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Abu Sayyaf have kidnapped scores of people since
March. Most have been released, with Libya and Malaysia reportedly
paying more than $15 million for 19 foreigners. Estrada's decision
to attack the rebels last weekend has been widely supported by
Filipinos.
