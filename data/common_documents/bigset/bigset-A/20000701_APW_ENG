<HEADLINE> Presbyterian Panel Faces Gay Issue  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Members of the chief policy-making
body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) argued Friday over whether
to bar ministers from officiating at commitment ceremonies for gay
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the issue has dominated the annual convention this
week of the 2.6 million-member denomination. On Tuesday, a church
committee recommended by a vote of 25-22 that the General Assembly
approve a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to be hindering the grace that is open to all of
us'' if such a ban is not instituted, General Assembly member Tim
Black, a church elder from San Fernando, told fellow members Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Dick Carlson, who said his youngest son is gay,
disagreed, saying: ''The people coming before us asking us to bless
their relationships are not aliens from outer space, they are our
friends and children.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote in favor of a ban still requires ratification by
ministers and elders nationwide before it could become part of the
Book of Order, the church constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The 560-member General Assembly approved a similar ban on gay
commitment ceremonies in 1995, but it failed to win ratification
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   No state has legalized gay marriage, although the state of
Vermont on Saturday began recognizing civil unions, which provide
many of the same rights as marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The church's highest court ruled a month ago that local
congregations may conduct religious such ceremonies celebrating
homosexual unions as long as the ceremonies stop short of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed amendment being debated Friday night states
that gay commitment ceremonies may not be performed by church
officers at all and cannot be conducted on church property or
involve the use of church resources.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has placed the denomination at a crossroads over
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) prohibits homosexuals from
serving as ministers but does not exclude them from practicing the
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists said that if Presbyterians allowed gay commitment
ceremonies, other Christian denominations would feel pressure to
include homosexuals in more aspects of their faith. The activists
also said predominantly homosexual Presbyterian congregations could
disappear if recognition of their relationships were prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the ban argued that the Presbyterian Church must
stop blessing same-sex unions because that implicitly condones
homosexual behavior, which the church views as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters of the ban said that recognizing gay couples
could cripple the church's missionary work in countries with
conservative values.

<HEADLINE> 8 Dead in Denmark Pearl Jam Concert  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Fans rushed the stage during a Pearl
Jam concert at a Danish rock festival late Friday, crushing to
death at least eight men and injuring three others, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the rock band appealed to the crowd to move back, but
were unable to prevent the massive surge forward, Danish radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds at the annual Roskilde festival were muddy from an
all-day rain. Victims slipped and fell in front of the stage, and
were trampled to death, police said. The crush occurred shortly
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the victims were being withheld until
relatives could be notified.
</P>
<P>
   After the stampede, the performance at the Roskilde festival's
main stage was halted, the radio said. The stage was one of seven
stages hosting performances during the four-day event, Europe's
largest. About 100,000 tickets were sold, but it was not
immediately clear how many people attended the concert.
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd was edging ever closer, the band called on fans
to move back, festival spokesman Leif Skov said. The message was
repeated by loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam broke off its performance and the next show by the
British band The Cure was canceled in ''respect for the dead,''
Skov said. The deaths were announced over loudspeakers and some
concertgoers began crying, Danish radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Performances at the six other stages continued Friday night, and
were scheduled to resume on the main stage Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   However, police and organizers were to decide Saturday whether
to cancel the rest of the festival, which had 170 performers
including Lou Reed, Willie Nelson, Iron Maiden and the Pet Shop
Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Roskilde festival, first held in 1971, was inspired by the
1969 Woodstock Festival in the United States. It is held annually
on a farm in Roskilde, 25 miles west of the capital, Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of Europe's worst concert tragedies. Last year, 52
people were killed and 150 injured at a concert at Minsk, Belarus,
when a hailstorm hit and hundreds of fans rushed for a nearby
subway station, an exodus that quickly became a deadly stampede.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, 11 people were trampled to death in Cincinnati as they
rushed for choice seats before the start of a concert by the
British rock band The Who.

<HEADLINE> First Amendment Said Valued in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Free speech is a great American principle that
should be protected -- except when it protects the airing of views
people find offensive, a majority in a new poll says.
</P>
<P>
   On press freedom, half said U.S. news media have too much
freedom, while the other half said the press has about the right
amount or not enough freedom, said the poll by the Freedom Forum's
First Amendment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears many Americans are having second thoughts about the
First Amendment,'' said Kenneth Paulson, executive director of the
center. ''They treasure it as part of this nation's heritage, but
they become uncomfortable when it allows others to speak out in
offensive ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Friday to coincide with the July 4 weekend,
explores America's commitment to the 45-word First Amendment:
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress
of grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson said the Founding Fathers never envisioned the
influences of today's popular culture but added: ''They recognized
that the right to express unpopular opinions is the cornerstone of
our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that just over half feel the government should be
able to restrict the posting of sexually explicit materials on the
Internet and posting information on how to make a bomb. And just
over half also said public libraries should block access to
potentially offensive sites on computers used by children.
</P>
<P>
   About half in the new poll said art should not be put in public
places if it may offend some members of the community, and public
speech that offends members of a religious group should not be
allowed. Two-thirds said public remarks that racial groups find
offensive should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment that the press has too much freedom tended to
fluctuate over the past year. Just over half thought the press had
too much freedom when the poll was taken last year in the aftermath
of President Clinton's impeachment fight. The ratio who thought the
media are too free dropped to four in 10 by last September.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public support for freedom of the press is mercurial,''
Paulson said. ''We also have a strong sense that the public's
support for freedom of the press is directly tied to what they see
on television (news programs).''
</P>
<P>
   While nine in 10 said people should be allowed to express
unpopular opinions, support for that view dropped sharply when the
question became more specific. Most (78 percent) disagreed that
people should be allowed to burn or deface the American flag in a
political statement, and four in 10 disagreed that musicians should
be allowed to sing songs with lyrics that might be considered
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Three in 10 in the poll said Americans have too little religious
freedom, possibly linked to the question of allowing more religion
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds said teachers or others should be allowed to lead
prayers in school and over public address systems at school
sporting events. Nearly that many (61 percent) said public
officials should be allowed to post the Ten Commandments on the
walls at a public school.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found about six in 10 thought the government
should be allowed to place restrictions on the amount of money an
individual can contribute to someone else's political campaign.
About the same number thought campaign contributions should be a
protected form of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 1,015 adults was taken April 13-26 and has
an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Russian Orphans Turned Artists Tour  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a well known clown-doctor in tow, four
17-year-old Russian orphans turned artists will start an American
tour Monday in a Senate office building.
</P>
<P>
   They are ''Maria's Children,'' a training group founded seven
years ago by Maria Yeliseyeva, 35, to give more meaning to the life
of children in Russian orphanages. She is an artist who lives in a
suburban Moscow apartment with her computer-programmer husband.
They have four children of their own and two orphans they have
adopted, and there are usually other orphans around.
</P>
<P>
   ''When everybody's gone to bed, there's no more floor space
left,'' Dr. Patch Evans told a news conference. He met Yeliseyeva
on a tour of hospitals in Russia, one of many he has made around
the world, treating patients free of charge and often appearing in
the clown suit he wore Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His unconventional life was the subject of a 1998 Hollywood
film, ''Patch Adams,'' starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Janna Novikova, Inna Agaltsova, Sveta Khokhlova and Sasha Demin
sat in a row at the National Press Club with a 6-by-8-foot tapestry
across their knees. They hope to sell it for as much as $4,000.
They also have 150 pictures priced at $150 to $2,000 -- highly
colored and tightly packed views of the Kremlin, onion-domed
churches and other Russian scenes.
</P>
<P>
   They want to raise money to train more of the 650,000 children
in Russian orphanages, many of them classified as weak-minded.
Their American sponsors call them systematically misdiagnosed --
essentially bright, eager children whose education has been
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings will be put on show first in the Russell Senate
Office Building on Monday through Friday, and then for another two
weeks at Washington's Russian Cultural Center, which will hold an
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Other auctions are due to be held in New York, where the
paintings will be seen at the National Arts Club July 23-Aug. 6; at
the Edina Southdale Court in Minneapolis, Aug. 11-19 and at the
Bumbershoot Festival in Seattle, Sept. 1-4.

<HEADLINE> FBI Steps Into E-Mail Case  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI computer technicians are stepping into the
case of the missing White House e-mails, trying to recover
thousands of lost messages that presidential aides say they are
unable to pull from computer backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest twist in the controversy over the e-mails played out
Friday in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who
is presiding over a civil case involving the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth authorized the White House to turn over some tapes to
the Justice Department campaign finance task force and Independent
Counsel Robert Ray to see if the FBI can carry out the task the
White House has failed at for the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to give a date certain'' on producing the
e-mails, but ''unfortunately we're not in a position to do so,''
Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Shapiro told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not waiting another year'' to get the e-mail, Lamberth
replied. ''They are talking'' in the White House ''about another
year to get to the end'' of copying the tapes and recovering the
e-mails, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Independent Counsel and the Justice Department
''came to us and said the FBI might have a faster way to do this,''
said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. ''The FBI is going to take
a look and see if they can recover some of the e-mail from the
tapes. We finalized an agreement earlier this week to do that.
They'll take a test batch and look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Siewert said the e-mail recovery process is complicated because
outside contractors hired by the White House are ''building the
software'' to recapture the messages and ''this is not software
that is commercially available. We're literally having to create
the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as May 3, presidential aides said they would be able
to search and produce e-mails as early as June and would be able to
continue to do so on a rolling basis throughout the summer and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed that the White House has not been
able to move forward with greater dispatch,'' said Jim Wilson,
chief investigator for the House Government Reform Committee.
''Given these new developments, at a very minimum, they should have
kept Congress informed of the fact that they were making no
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear the Clinton-Gore White House is attempting to
delay the e-mail production until after the election,'' said Larry
Klayman, head of the conservative legal group Judicial Watch that
brought the lawsuit against the Clinton administration that
prompted Friday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said computer contractors hired by the White House are
concerned that machines used to copy the backup tapes aren't up to
the task of round-the-clock use.
</P>
<P>
   If the machines broke while a backup tape was being copied, some
data would be lost and then ''people would be saying lots of
things, I'm sure,'' Shapiro told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The White House disclosed belatedly earlier this year that
thousands of e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's
office, were not properly archived because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine if they should have been turned over under
subpoena to investigations ranging from impeachment and Whitewater
to campaign fund raising.

<HEADLINE> Chile Military Blamed in U.S. Death  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly classified documents say the U.S.
Embassy in Chile received information in 1987 that an American
filmmaker who died in the aftermath of the country's bloody 1973
military coup was shot to death by Chilean military personnel, who
then tried to cover up the deed.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say a Chilean source, who was not identified, came
forward with his story, but the embassy was unable to determine
whether his information was credible.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was Charles Horman, whose slaying a week after the
Sept. 11, 1993, military coup was the subject of a 1982 feature
film, ''Missing.'' He was one of thousands killed following the
coup that installed Gen. Augusto Pinochet in power and deposed the
elected President Salvador Allende, who was killed the day of his
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The information about the Horman case was contained in a release
of 505 previously classified documents, most from State Department
files.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Horman, the documents contain information about
the killing of American journalist Frank Teruggi, also in September
1973, and Boris Weisfeiler, a Russian emigre and mathematics
professor who disappeared in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Attending a news conference at which the files were released,
Joyce Horman, Charles Horman's widow, said she was disappointed
that the mystery about her husband's death remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found the answer,'' she said. ''Our quest is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The source told the embassy that Horman was taken to the
National Stadium after interrogation the day after his arrest and
was shot the following evening.
</P>
<P>
   An April 27, 1987, memo from the embassy in Santiago to the
State Department reported that the home where Horman was staying
was reputed to be housing ''extremists,'' and documents found there
confirmed this suspicion, the informant said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy memo continues, ''According to (name blacked out),
the authorities at the stadium did not know that Horman was an
American since his paperwork arrived after his death, and his poor
knowledge of Spanish made it difficult for him to understand and
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They only know that he was a foreigner and an 'extremist.' The
body was taken from the stadium and left at a location to create
the idea that he had been killed in a firefight with the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy also was told that Brig. Pedro Espinoza, a top
commander in Pinochet's security service, approved Horman's
killing. A Chilean tribunal convicted Espinoza in 1994 in the death
of Orlando Letelier, a Pinochet opponent who was killed on a
Washington street in 1976 by a bomb placed by Chilean agents.
</P>
<P>
   Several pages of the documents address whether the embassy
source was providing legitimate information.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1987 memo to the embassy from then-Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost said: ''We have serious doubts about (name blacked
out) credibility. ... He could be a government of Chile plant
intended to entrap embassy personnel, a sophisticated visa-shopper
or absolutely legitimate.''

<HEADLINE> Perot Won't Run for President  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   With founder Ross Perot out of this year's presidential
politics, the Reform Party's presidential nomination is shaping up
as a fight between conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and
Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they've acquired proof of enough support to qualify
for the party's primary, which begins when ballots are mailed out
July 5 to party members and any other citizens who requests one.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is the front-runner by far, and his organization of
convention delegates and supporters would have made a formidable
obstacle even to a challenge by Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Perot, who announced Friday that he would not
participate in the primary, also are lobbying the nominations
committee to include ''No Endorsement'' on the primary ballot, as a
vehicle for voters to protest Buchanan's candidacy. It is unclear,
however, whether party rules would allow that.
</P>
<P>
   Perot rejected supporters' efforts to put his name on the Reform
primary ballot Friday, clearing away a big potential hurdle for
Buchanan's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, Perot's spokesman, said the Texas billionaire
decided against running in the primary because he had no intention
of actually competing for the White House in the fall against
Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A daylong series of meetings at Perot's office in Dallas
included ''intense pressure'' on Perot to put his name on the
ballot in an effort to stop Buchanan, Verney told The Associated
Press. Perot resisted such a ''negative reason'' for running and
also felt it would be unethical to seek the nomination but not
really run, Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Perot, who turned 70 on Tuesday, would be on only
about half the states' ballots in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're trying to create a new political party which sets
the highest ethical standard, you cannot try to further that goal
by unethical actions,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who had amassed a sizable organization, praised the
decision in a statement and said Perot had an ''open invitation''
to speak at the party's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have great respect for Ross Perot. He is the founder and
father of this party,'' Buchanan said. ''Without Ross Perot, there
would be no Reform Party, no third choice and there would be no
great third-party movement in the 1990s. I wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin said his own effort made a Perot run unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''His candidacy was designed to prevent Pat Buchanan from using
the Reform Party as a platform to promote his right-wing social
agenda,'' Hagelin said in a statement. ''I will vigorously uphold
Ross Perot's vision of the Reform Party as a mainstream alternative
that will appeal to the 115 million frustrated voters who did not
vote in the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Perot declined to make a statement, he is said to be
dissatisfied with Buchanan's candidacy. Verney said Perot might
make a public statement about his feelings before the convention
opens.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's decision came after longtime supporters collected what
they said were enough signatures in 18 states to meet the party's
rules for putting a candidate on the ballot. Perot had until
midnight Friday to accept a spot on the ballot in writing.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been his third presidential campaign on the ticket
of the party he founded, after finishing with 19 percent of the
national vote in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Perot burst onto the political scene in 1992, spending more than
$60 million of his own money. Four years later, he spent most of
the $29 million he received in federal funds on long-format
television time, made an abbreviated campaign swing and never held
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   His showing in 1996 earned the party's 2000 nominee $12.6
million in federal funding for the general election campaign. Had
Perot run and won the nomination, he would have used that money to
rebuild the party rather than make a vigorous try for the White
House.

<HEADLINE> Fire Frightening on West Coast  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Smoke turned the sun blood-red. Panicked
residents fled their homes. Nearly a thousand firefighters swarmed
across the parched brush.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Eckard, plant ecologist, took it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   He has studied the grass and brush lands around the Hanford
nuclear reservation for four decades, and he says wildfire -- though
fierce and frightening -- is a force that neither can nor should be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen Rattlesnake Mountain black like this four times in
40 years,'' said Eckard, retired after a career with government
contractors studying the Hanford site's ecology. ''Fire has always
been a natural part of things in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a long view is a stretch for many Westerners made nervous
by this dry, hot summer. Wildfires have charred 1.6 million acres
nationwide since January, the most burned in the first half of any
year since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those fires have been in the West, and two were
especially destructive: A blaze set in May near Los Alamos, N.M.,
to clear underbrush blasted out of control and destroyed more than
200 homes. This week's Hanford fire, sparked when a car wreck
ignited dry brush, destroyed 20 homes and 190,000 acres as it raced
across a nuclear reservation where lethal radioactive waste is
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say both blazes drive home the point that the arid
West is meant to burn, whether it's done on purpose or left to
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to prevent unpredictable blazes like the Hanford fire
is part of why federal officials started the fire that escaped
control near Los Alamos. It's also why a moratorium on prescribed
burns, imposed by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt amid outrage
over the Los Alamos fire, was lifted after 30 days for all Western
lands outside national parks.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much land waiting to burn for a complete moratorium
on intentional fires to last very long, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do prescribed burns on about 2 million acres a year,'' said
Mike Gauldin, an Interior Department spokesman. ''Over the last 50
years of keeping fire out of the forests, we have built up kindling
-- underbrush that makes fires much worse when they do occur. We
burn that brush to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic fires and
protect communities in the midst of those wildlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos fire was set with the best of intentions, said
Karl Wood, a professor of forestry at New Mexico State University.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just did it at the wrong time, in the wrong way, under
the wrong conditions,'' Wood said. ''There were a lot of wrongs.
The federal agencies think they know how to burn, but it's more
than lighting a match.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to burn at the right time of year, with the right
humidity and wind conditions to keep a fire burning unwanted
underbrush while sparing larger, desirable trees or shrubs, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Outside designated wilderness areas, where lightning-struck
fires often are left to run their course, most land managers
acknowledge that past meddling with nature requires more meddling
now.
</P>
<P>
   Even a ''natural'' fire is no longer all that natural, given the
changes wrought by decades of grazing, fire suppression, logging
and introduction of exotic weeds, said Joy Belsky, an ecologist for
the Oregon Natural Desert Association.
</P>
<P>
   Well-planned, intentionally set fires can be an effective tool
to maintain some semblance of ecological balance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The science is so clear that they need these fires,'' she
said, ''or they're going to have something much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Something, for example, like this week's fire at Hanford. The
temperature was hovering around 100 degrees and the wind was
blowing strong when the fire started, resulting in one of the
fastest-moving wildfires -- at 30 mph -- ever seen in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Intentional burns are not usually part of the management scheme
at Hanford, where site managers don't want to stir up radioactive
wastes lurking in the soil and vegetation. But even if fires were
set there, this would not have been the week to do it, said Don
Voros, a regional supervisor for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''You probably couldn't have asked for a worse time to start a
fire,'' Voros said.

<HEADLINE> Reds 5, Diamondbacks 4  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Pete Harnisch, just off the disabled list, got
his first victory of the season and drove in the go-ahead runs with
a bases-loaded single Friday night as the Cincinnati Reds beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, in his first outing since May 5, gave up a two-run
home run to Jay Bell, the second batter he faced, but then shut out
the Diamondbacks the next five innings as the Reds improved to 7-0
at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch (1-4) had been out nearly four weeks with weakness in
his rotator cuff, one of several problems plaguing Cincinnati's
starters. He entered with a 9.95 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves got five outs for his 12th save in 13
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack led off the game with a single, then Bell hit
Harnisch's 2-0 pitch into the left-field seats, his ninth homer of
the season but first since June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch allowed only two hits after the first inning. In six
innings, he gave up two runs on five hits, struck out five and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-2, Arizona scored twice in the eighth on wild pitches by
Dennys Reyes and Graves. Reyes walked Bell to lead off the inning,
then Luis Gonzalez singled to put runners on first and third with
no outs.
</P>
<P>
   With Finley up, Bell scored on Reyes' wild pitch. Finley struck
out, and the closer Graves came in. Graves struck out Cabrera, but
with Lee up, was called for a balk that allowed Gonzalez to go to
third. Gonzalez score on Graves' wild pitch before Dmitri Young's
diving catch in left field ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan (3-2), taking injured Todd Stottlemyre's spot in
Arizona's rotation, allowed four runs on eight hits in five
innings. He walked two and didn't strike out anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette, who was 3-for-4 and scored three times, led off
the second with a double, moved to third on Sean Casey's ground out
and scored on Aaron Boone's sacrifice fly to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds scored three runs in the fifth. Consecutive singles by
Bichette, Casey and Boone loaded the bases with one out. Bichette
scored the tying run on Eddie Taubensee's groundout to shortstop,
then Morgan walked Pokey Reese intentionally to load the bases for
Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch singled to left to drive in two runs and put the Reds
up 4-2. The inning ended when Womack threw out Reese trying to
score from second on Larkin's grounder after the force out throw to
second was late.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds added a run in the eighth on Boone's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Griffey was 0-for-4, only the second time he failed to get
a hit in 14 games. ... Cincinnati was 3-0 in Phoenix in 1998 and
3-0 in 1999. ... Larkin hit his 350th career double in the third
inning. ... Womack saved a run when he made a diving stab of Dmitri
Young's sharp grounder and threw him out to end the third. ...
Morgan, 40, has played for a major league-record 12 teams,
including Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Pulls Plug on Video Poker  </HEADLINE>
By DAN LEWERENZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Fourteen years after video gambling became
legal in South Carolina and began growing into a $3 billion
industry, the plug was pulled on the machines as a statewide ban
took effect Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last player had $100 that I was able to play him,'' said
Linda Browder, manager of Airport Bingo in Cayce, which closed
about 30 minutes before the midnight deadline. ''I gave him his
$100 and his ticket as a souvenir. He said he would keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came only after a late-night legal drama that reached
the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A man who owns five casinos in South Carolina won a temporary
injunction from a Circuit Court judge allowing him to keep his
video poker machines running, but the state's high court shot that
down late Friday night. The high court also denied other requests
for emergency injunctions before the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in dark, smoky rooms Friday, players' reaction on video
gambling's final day was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bored. That's what I'm going to be -- bored,'' said Wanda Rose,
playing at the Double Diamond in Columbia. ''I mean, it's my money.
I think that I should be able to spend it however I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Video poker became legal in South Carolina after a lawmaker
slipped a provision into a bill in 1986. Anti-gambling forces
fought hard to outlaw the machines, a battle that came to a head in
1998 when then-Gov. David Beasley, a Republican, called video
gambling ''a cancer on South Carolina'' and vowed to get rid of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling operators responded by pouring money into the
campaign of Democrat Jim Hodges, who won the governor's race with a
promise to call for a referendum on video gambling's future.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year approved the referendum as part of a
bill that also banned video gambling unless voters decided to keep
the machines. Last October, the state Supreme Court threw out the
referendum, but kept the part of the law banning video gambling on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   State officials planned to check machines early Saturday to make
sure they are turned off. Operators have one week to get the
machines out of the state or destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad it's out,'' Margaret Perry said Friday as she played
at D J's Video Games in Columbia. ''It's caused a lot of problems
in my life. It's been a detriment to my spiritual life. I hate
myself for this, for what I've done.''

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The chief policy-making body of the Presbyterian

<HEADLINE> Mexican Democracy Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Sunday's presidential race is considered the
fairest, most competitive in modern Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Mexico to be considered a true democracy, the opposition
says, governing party candidate Francisco Labastida has to do more
than run an honest race: He has to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes like this: If Labastida wins, he'll extend his
Institutional Revolutionary Party's hold on the presidency to 77
years. And 77 years of single-party rule is inherently
undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   It raises an intriguing question: Can a country be considered
democratic when the same party governs for 77 years?
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the governing party, known as the PRI, says the
answer is yes. If the election is fair and Labastida is the top
vote-getter, that's what democracy is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ''A democracy exists now in modern times where there are the
conditions and there is a real possibility'' for a change of
government, said Javier Trevino, a senior adviser to the Labastida
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility exists now. Labastida's main rival, Vicente
Fox, is so close to Labastida in opinion polls that the race is
considered a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   But to Fox, a possibility isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Mexico to be considered a democracy, there has to be a
change in power,'' Fox told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the issue perplexing is that the PRI's situation is
unique. No other party now in power anywhere in the world has
governed as long. The only real comparison for longevity are the 71
years the Communist Party ruled the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, the PRI dominated all aspects of
Mexican politics, keeping the ruling class in power and preserving
social stability. Its identity was synonymous with the nation's --
its colors are the national colors -- and it won most elections in
landslides, often relying on patronage and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But the country has become more democratic in the past 12 years
and opposition candidates have made major gains, capturing
governorships, important mayoral seats and ending the PRI's
majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has had to change to stay competitive. In November, it
held its first presidential primary. It was a race lauded by the
PRI as evidence that the party had become truly democratic -- and
disparaged by the opposition as rigged to ensure the victory of
Labastida, seen as the favorite of President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Perspectives about how democratic Mexico's political system is
depend on how the PRI is viewed: Is it now just another party --
albeit the biggest -- in Mexico's political process? Or does it
continue to hold an unfair advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Trevino, the Labastida adviser, said the greatest proof that
Mexico is already democratic is that half the population lives
under opposition state or local governments. And the presidential
race has been fair, he said. Media coverage and campaign financing
have been mostly balanced and the process is overseen by a
respected, independent electoral institute.
</P>
<P>
   To some scholars, there's something odd about insisting that a
party lose a race to prove it's democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't make a test of democratic governance whether one
particular party wins a given election,'' said Abraham Lowenthal,
president of the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He said the real test of Mexico's democratic credentials will be
issues such as whether the PRI continues to become more democratic,
how the new Congress works with the new president, and whether
Mexican news media becomes a more effective watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others argue that Mexico's case is exceptional -- that the
PRI has been such a dominant force that Mexicans won't believe the
country has changed until it loses the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have my doubts that in the minds of people that you can
convince them that this is a democracy if the same party keeps on
winning,'' said Yemile Mizrahi, a researcher at the Center of
Economic Investigation and Instruction in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   For congressman Carlos Heredia, foreign policy spokesman for the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party, even a Labastida loss wouldn't
prove that Mexico has evolved into a democracy. He said there are
too many flaws in the political process, including electoral crimes
that go unpunished and PRI officials using federal funds for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A PRI loss of the presidency, he said ''is a necessary but
insufficient condition.''

<HEADLINE> Zedillo Paves Way For Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By LISA J. ADAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- During his recent forays through the Mexican
republic, outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo has repeated it like a
mantra: Sunday's presidential elections will be fair and
fraud-free.
</P>
<P>
   For Zedillo, the statement is as much a personal wish as it is a
public reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   If he can persuade the public to accept what is likely to be a
narrow victory for either of the main candidates on July 2, he will
help seal an image as the leader who ushered in some of the most
dramatic economic and political reforms in Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still got one big bump in the road, and that is to manage
the outcome of this election,'' whether the winner is ruling-party
candidate Francisco Labastida or opposition challenger Vicente Fox,
said George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and
Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to be able to negotiate and bargain and compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, a Yale-educated technocrat with more of an interest in
economics than politics, was pulled reluctantly into his public
leadership role in 1994 when the ruling-party candidate, Luis
Donaldo Colosio, was assassinated months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   A president who never actually asked for the job, Zedillo was
perhaps less beholden than those before him to party ''dinosaurs''
opposed to significant changes in the political status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Other events also pushed Zedillo in the direction of reform,
according to Joseph L. Klesner, a Mexico expert with the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the months preceding the 1994 elections, the North American
Free Trade Agreement was implemented, Zapatista rebels rose up in
Chiapas, another high-profile politician was murdered and Mexico
spun into economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tumult of 1994 ... seems to have set Zedillo on a plan to
promote Mexican democracy,'' Klesner wrote in a pre-election
report.
</P>
<P>
   During his six-year term, Zedillo has overseen a series of
democratic reforms, the most important of which was his decision to
abandon the long-standing practice of having the outgoing president
handpick his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Zedillo promoted a primary for the ruling-party
candidates -- a process that for the first time in the party's 71
years of uninterrupted rule saw its members openly debating,
criticizing and challenging each other.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also oversaw reforms that allowed an opposition
candidate to win the Mexico City mayorship in 1997, as well as the
Federal Electoral Institute's transformation to complete autonomy
from the government. The institute is the agency responsible for
organizing and monitoring the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some of Zedillo's actions have been ''a la Mexicana,''
in Grayson's words: During the ruling-party primary, for example,
he actively promoted Labastida and went so far as to even forbid
other potential rivals from entering the contest.
</P>
<P>
   And he has used recent road trips not only to publicly champion
clean elections, but to carry out a morally debatable party
tradition: spending hundreds of millions of dollars on public
programs and projects to promote Labastida's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things change here slowly and gradually,'' Grayson said. ''And
they've certainly changed a lot more under Zedillo in both the
economic and the political spheres than they have under anyone else
in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The daily highway dedications and construction groundbreakings
over which Zedillo has presided in recent weeks have served not
only to boost Labastida's candidacy, but to reassure party leaders
that he did his part to keep the party in power. Having completed
that duty, he will be freer and more likely to recognize a Fox
victory on election day, Grayson says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Labastida wins, Zedillo will have the task
of calming Fox supporters who suspect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is a Fox victory that would cement Zedillo's
place in history as a democratic reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Labastida wins, then I think Zedillo still gets a good deal
of credit,'' Grayson says, ''but the chapter on him will be briefer
and perhaps further back in the history book.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Limit UC at Los Alamos Lab  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department, reacting to a series of
security lapses, says it will strip the University of California of
its security and some management responsibilities involving nuclear
weapons programs at two laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told the university its
contracts for managing the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and the
Lawrence Livermore facility in California ''must be restructured
... to make much-needed improvements to security and other facility
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The university ''will still be actively involved'' in scientific
aspects of the nuclear weapons programs, but some other management
responsibilities, especially security, would be transferred
elsewhere, Richardson said in an interview Friday. He called the
university's security management unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring is expected to be worked out by September as
part of a renegotiation of the government's contract with the
university, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The university welcomes the opportunity to work with DOE in
this effort and to create a path forward that meets all security
needs,'' university President Richard Atkinson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it was important to keep the university's
''strong science and academic expertise'' as part of the weapons
program ''so weapons scientists feel comfortable for their
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The university, which has managed the nuclear weapons program at
Los Alamos since 1943 and the Manhattan Project, which exploded
America's first nuclear device in the New Mexico desert, has come
under sharp criticism for security lapses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month disappearance of two computer hard drives from a
vault at Los Alamos caused a growing number of lawmakers in
Congress to question whether a university atmosphere can mix with
security needs of the nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still a culture of lax security,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The government contract with the University of California
expires in 2002. DOE officials said the contract is expected to be
re-negotiated this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department will immediately begin negotiations with the
university to bring into their operations specific security and
management expertise to implement (security) improvements,'' a DOE
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief of DOE's nuclear weapons agency, Undersecretary
John Gordon, was placed in charge of overseeing the contract
renegotiating and to address with the university ''the serious
shortcomings ... at our weapons laboratories,'' the department
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was angered by the disappearance of the hard drives,
but even more incensed by not having learned of the security breach
for nearly a month after it became known to some Los Alamos
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the secretary also was highly critical of the
university's handling of a sophisticated laser program at the
Lawrence Livermore lab. After repeatedly assuring the $1 billion
laser program was on schedule and within budget, Richardson was
told without warning there would be a $300 million cost overrun and
substantial delays.

hit a homer into McCovey's Cove, the body of water just outside
Pacific Bell Park. He also hit two doubles for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz (4-8) allowed six runs on seven hits
and five walks in 3 2-3 innings. While the Giants have the best
home ERA in the majors, Ortiz is 0-4 with a 6.69 ERA at the new
bayfront ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent drove in both of the Giants' runs to increase his
NL-leading total to 78 as San Francisco lost its third straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the first when Eric Karros hit a
sacrifice fly and Hundley doubled home a run.
</P>
<P>
   Kent drove in a run with a sacrifice fly in the first, then
later added a run-scoring single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield led off the third with his 26th homer of the season, a
shot that just cleared the left-field fence near the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora led off the fourth with a double, and Todd
Hollandsworth walked. With two outs, Sheffield hit the first pitch
from Ortiz into the left-field bleachers to make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had three consecutive hits in the third, but failed
to score as Shawn Green threw out Bill Mueller at third base trying
to take an extra base on a hit by Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek and Karros each drove in runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bullpen coach Rick Dempsey was the Dodgers' first-base
coach as John Shelby serves his three-game suspension, a result of
his involvement in the altercation at Wrigley Field on May 16. ...
Giants RHP Mark Gardner is scheduled to pitch one of the games of
the day-night doubleheader on July 4 against the Colorado Rockies.
... Dodgers SS Kevin Elster missed his third straight with a sore
left hamstring. ... Sheffield and Karros passed Bonds and Kent as
the NL's top RBI, 137-135.

<HEADLINE> Rural Mexico Wary of Elections  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MIGUEL ELOXOCHITLAN, Mexico (AP) -- A group of Nahua Indians
came trudging barefoot down a dirt road to meet a senator about
alleged campaign abuses in the run-up to Sunday's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator could not drive up to meet them -- the road ends
in a narrow mountain trail a short distance away, the result of a
project the Indians say was aborted when the villagers of Atexacapa
met and decided to abandon support for the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   National election officials say Sunday's presidential election
will be the fairest ever. That rings hollow, however, for many in
this underdeveloped corner of central Mexico, where challenging the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, can carry a
heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   Eloxochitlan, in the Sierra Negra of Puebla state, is among
Mexico's poorest regions. Neither roads nor electricity have
reached the 260 people of Atexacapa, whose men work for about $1.50
a day as laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fernando Herrero of the National Action Party has come to
hear the Nahua's complaints of electoral intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting on a T-shirt for Vicente Fox is a big challenge for
them,'' he said, referring to the opposition presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they feared meeting Herrero inside of
Eloxochitlan, a PRI stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion Hernandez, the Federal Electoral Institute's
representative for the region, said she feared that independent
poll workers might feel threatened into withdrawing in favor of
people picked by local bosses.
</P>
<P>
   She said Mexico's widely praised electoral system works well,
''but ... did not contemplate the influence of the bosses in Indian
zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Margarito Hernandez, himself Nahua, denied allegations of
pressure in favor of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is freedom here for the parties,'' a smiling Hernandez
told reporters in his office while surrounded by about 30
villagers. ''We do not incline toward any and the law is
respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Atexacapa, however, claim that soldiers carrying
lists they said were from the mayor have sought National Action
activists in the village on suspicion of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''They planted the (accusation of) crime,'' said Martin Barrios
of the independent Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in
Tehuacan, the nearest sizable city.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of soldiers have been in the region since the army
uncovered a training camp for Zapatista rebels nearby three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barrios says local bosses have also formed private, armed
''white guards'' -- once a common practice in rural Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   State spokesmen deny that claim, but local officials do seem
well-protected.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Salvador, who allegedly introduced National Action to
Atexacapa, said he was jailed for two days for ''disobedience'' in
1996. He said he has kept a low profile since April when he
appeared on the lists soldiers brought to the village.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral institute's Hernandez said she found that the
PRI-dominated town council in Coxcatlan has set a 200 peso fine for
failing to vote for the PRI. In neighboring Tlacotepec de Diaz, she
said, opposition voters run the risk of being jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of opposition political parties who seek any
excuse to say there are violations of the law,'' insisted Victor
Manuel Serrano, adviser to the mayor of Tlacotepec de Diaz, who
belongs to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Isidrio de Jesus Martinez, 19, who had supported an opposition
mayoral candidate, said a local police chief shot him in the leg
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was giving it to me because I did not help the
mayor in his campaign,'' Martinez, who no longer can walk, said
from another town where he is hiding from the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors have mounted a criminal investigation of the
police chief, however he remains on the job, according to
Martinez's attorney.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 7, Brewers 4, 15 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eric Young drew his club-record fifth walk with
the bases loaded, and Sammy Sosa had a two-run double as the
Chicago Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-4 in 15 innings Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' third victory in 11 games was made possible only
because nearly three hours earlier, Milwaukee blew a two-run lead
in the ninth when closer Bob Wickman imploded and Ron Belliard
missed a simple tag, allowing the tying run to score.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15th inning, rookie Allen Levrault (0-1) allowed one-out
singles to Damon Buford and Joe Girardi. Levrault then walked Cubs
pitcher Jon Lieber, who was making the first pinch-hit appearance
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Young walked to force Buford home, and Sosa added two insurance
runs with a double to right. Rick Aguilera got his 17th save, while
Daniel Garibay (2-3) was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' biggest crowd since opening day was alternately
thrilled and horrified by the show before them. Brewers starter
Jamey Wright had another strong outing, allowing four hits over 7
1-3 innings and striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 4-2 lead into the ninth, but Wright was denied
his fourth straight win when Wickman blew his second save of the
year -- both of them coming against the Cubs -- on a combination of
bloop singles, walks and one bad defensive decision by Belliard.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman allowed two singles and a walk to load the bases in the
ninth, then walked Young to force in a run. Ricky Gutierrez hit a
slow grounder to second base, but Belliard tried to tag Young
instead of touching the base.
</P>
<P>
   Young dodged Belliard's half-hearted tag and dove into second,
allowing pinch-runner Jeff Huson to score. Milwaukee manager Davey
Lopes was ejected while arguing Young had left the baseline while
ducking the tag.
</P>
<P>
   James Mouton went 4-for-5 with two doubles for the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Young tied the club record for walks held by Elrod Hendricks and
Andre Dawson. He also got a hit and was hit by a pitch to reach
base seven times, tying a Cubs franchise record set by Cliff
Heathcote in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   The trade rumors surrounding Sosa, who went 3-for-8 with two
doubles and three strikeouts, finally quieted on Thursday when the
New York Yankees, Sosa's most ardent suitor, acquired outfielder
David Justice from Cleveland. But Chicago manager Don Baylor said
the situation distracted his team.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez homered to lead off the second inning for
Chicago. It was Rodriguez's first homer and RBI since May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blanco hit a solo homer in the sixth and proved his worth
behind the plate when he stayed in the game in the eighth inning
after Sosa fouled a pitch off the catcher's collarbone.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Grace broke an 0-for-19 slump with a double off the wall in
the 11th inning. ... Home plate umpire Justin Klemm ejected Lopes
in the ninth inning and ejected bench coach Jerry Royster in the
15th inning. ... Milwaukee blew a scoring chance with one out in
the 13th when pinch-runner Santiago Perez forgot how many outs
there were and ran home when Blanco popped up to left. ... The
Brewers had 30,216 fans in County Stadium to see the first of three
games against their I-94 rivals. Attendance also was boosted by the
opening weekend of Summerfest, a gigantic lakeside festival that
attracts thousands of tourists to Milwaukee each year. The few
thousand who remained in the 14th inning stood for another
rendition of ''Roll Out the Barrel.''

<HEADLINE> Presbyterians Nix Gay Ceremonies  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The chief policy-making body of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) voted by a narrow margin Friday to
recommend barring its ministers from officiating commitment
ceremonies for gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   The measure still must be ratified by scores of ministers and
elders nationwide before it can become part of the Book of Order,
the constitution for the 2.6 million-member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   It passed the church's General Assembly by a vote of 268-251,
with four abstentions. If the ministers and elders in the church's
171 presbyteries approve, the ban would be put into effect at next
year's meeting of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ban on gay commitment ceremonies was approved the
church's General Assembly in 1995 but failed to win ratification.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, gay-rights advocates streamed out of the
meeting, many of them in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are crying out for justice and we are crying out for this
church,'' the Rev. Janie Spahr of San Rafael said as she led a
group of some 50 opponents of the ban in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they were still hopeful that the church's
presbyteries would not uphold the ban.
</P>
<P>
   No state has officially legalized gay marriage, but a new
Vermont law legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples took
effect Saturday, and other states have debated similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the church's highest court ruled that local
congregations may conduct such religious ceremonies celebrating
homosexual unions as long as those ceremonies stop short of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment approved Friday night, if ratified, would
overpower that ruling by prohibiting church officers from
performing gay commitment ceremonies and barring such ceremonies
from church property.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the issue has dominated the annual convention this
week, and it has placed the denomination at a crossroads over
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) prohibits homosexuals from
serving as ministers but does not exclude homosexuals from the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists said that if Presbyterians allowed gay commitment
ceremonies, other Christian denominations would feel pressure to
include homosexuals in more aspects of their faith. The activists
also said predominantly homosexual Presbyterian congregations could
disappear if recognition of their relationships were prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the ban argued that the Presbyterian Church must
stop blessing same-sex unions because that implicitly condones
homosexual behavior, which the church views as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters said recognizing gay couples could cripple the
church's missionary work in countries with conservative values.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Castles of San Joaquin, whose presbytery
proposed the amendment, said he considered Friday's vote a ''step
of the journey'' toward clarifying the church's stance on
homosexuality.

<HEADLINE> Three Israelis Acquitted of Spying  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- A senior judicial official said Saturday
that three of the 13 Jews tried on charges of spying for Israel had
been acquitted and 10 were sentenced to fines, lashes and
unspecified jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Ali Amiri, the provincial judiciary chief of Fars
province where the monthlong trial has been held, gave no other
details in comments aired on state-run Tehran television.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said two Muslim suspects also were acquitted, and two more
Muslims had received sentences similar to the other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He did not specify the length of the jail terms for any of the
accused.
</P>
<P>
   The case has cast a pall over Iran's Jewish community and drawn
concerned attention from the United States, Israel and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied the accused were its agents and has been
joined by international human rights groups and other countries in
questioning whether the accused could be fairly tried in a process
in which there was no jury, in which the judge also acted as
prosecutor, and from which observers were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about fairness increased when state television
broadcast confessions from two of the defendants. Defense lawyers
said they were not given a chance to consult with their clients
before their confessions, which came after months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the defendants had pleaded guilty, four had pleaded
innocent and one acknowledged passing information but maintained
his action did not constitute espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin prison on similar
spying charges. Iranian officials have differed on whether the
death penalty could be applied in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the
decades, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian
Jews are allowed to practice aspects of their religion but are
forbidden to teach Hebrew, the liturgical language.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, Iran's Jewish community numbered about 100,000
and was still around 80,000 just before Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution. Now there are about 25,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Shiraz, home to 6,000 of Iran's Jews, was once the capital of
the Persian empire and attracted people of all faiths because of
its wealth and tolerance.

First Amendment Said Valued in U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Free speech is a great American principle that should be
protected -- except when it protects the airing of views people find offensive,
a majority in a new poll says. On press freedom, half said U.S. news media have
too much freedom, while the other half said the press has about the right amount
or not enough freedom, said the poll by the Freedom Forum's First Amendment
Center. About half in the new poll said art should not be put in public places
if it may offend some members of the community, and public speech that offends
members of a religious group should not be allowed.

profession.'' The five-page lawsuit asks that Clinton be disbarred for
conducting ''himself in a manner that violates the model rules of professional

urged the crowd to move back because people were being pressed up against the

S.C. Pulls Plug on Video Poker

   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Fourteen years after video gambling became legal in
South Carolina and began growing into a $3 billion industry, the plug was pulled
on the machines as a statewide ban took effect Saturday. The end came only after
a late-night legal drama that reached the state Supreme Court. Video poker
became legal in South Carolina after a lawmaker slipped a provision into a bill
in 1986. Anti-gambling forces fought hard to outlaw the machines, a battle that
came to a head in 1998 when then-Gov. David Beasley, a Republican, called video
gambling ''a cancer on South Carolina'' and vowed to get rid of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Court Sues To Disbar Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A state Supreme Court committee has
taken the unprecedented step of suing a sitting president to strip
him of his law license, accusing President Clinton of dishonesty
and deceit in a scathing lawsuit that declares him unfit to
practice law.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed Committee on Professional Conduct, which
hears complaints against lawyers licensed in the state, said Friday
that Clinton was not fit to practice law because -- under oath -- he
gave deceptive answers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
about his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conduct of Mr. Clinton ... was motivated by a desire to
protect himself from the embarrassment of his own conduct,'' the
committee said in the five-page lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The president has 30 days to respond and it's unlikely the case
will be resolved before he leaves office in January. Clinton's
attorney said Friday that he would fight the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fundamentally disagree with the complaint,'' David Kendall
said in a statement released by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has said he would not get involved personally in
the case, claimed the committee was responding too harshly and that
there would be ''no way in the world'' that he could lose his
license. He arranged for an evening round of golf to begin the
Fourth of July holiday weekend shortly after receiving the news.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee used mild language in announcing the lawsuit
May 22, the document it filed with the Pulaski County Circuit Court
on Friday sharply denounced Clinton and said his actions had harmed
others in the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The panel accused the president of ''serious misconduct'' and
defined the term as ''involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud and
misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also said the president's conduct in the Jones case
''damages the legal profession and demonstrates a lack of overall
fitness to hold a license to practice law.''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the lawsuit were dozens of pages of exhibits,
including a partial transcript of Clinton's deposition in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge initially assigned to the case, John Ward, immediately
recused, and the court closed Friday before a replacement could be
named. Clinton had appointed Ward to a judgeship in 1989, and Ward
also was a Democratic state representative when Clinton was
Arkansas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Once a judge is named, the lawsuit will fall into the regular
mix of the court docket -- the state's busiest -- and any local
judge's decision would likely be appealed to the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The committee based its lawsuit on complaints filed by a federal
judge and by an Atlanta law firm, the Southeastern Legal
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was simply a misunderstanding or a misstatement by the
president, where the information was false and it wasn't done with
intent, that's one thing. That would probably lead to a letter of
reprimand,'' said Matt Glavin, president of the Atlanta group.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge, Susan Webber Wright, found Clinton in
contempt April 12, 1999, for statements he made in the Jones case.
She was out of her office Friday and has not publicly commented on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, sued Clinton in 1994,
claiming he made a crude pass at her in a Little Rock hotel room
three years earlier. Jones lawyers' drew Lewinsky into the case in
an attempt to show a pattern of sexual misconduct by Clinton. The
trail was later picked up by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and
it led to Clinton's impeachment by the House, though he was
acquitted at the subsequent Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Clinton said in his sworn deposition: ''I have
never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, he told a federal grand jury that he had had an
inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky. He said the conduct he
engaged in with Lewinsky did not meet the definition of sex that
was given at the start of the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Wright found Clinton in contempt and fined him $90,000. Jones
settled out of court for $850,000, and Clinton did not have to
admit any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said that because Clinton did not contest the
contempt citation -- he paid the fine -- it had to proceed with a
harsh sanction. ''Mr. Clinton neither requested a hearing, nor did
he appeal the (contempt) order,'' the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a licensed lawyer since Sept. 7, 1973, was attorney
general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979 and once taught at the
University of Arkansas law school. He has not practiced law since
the early 1980s, between his first and second terms as governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that an effort has been made to strip a

   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) - A senior judicial official said Saturday
that three of the 13 Jews tried on charges of spying for Israel had
been acquitted and 10 were sentenced to fines, lashes and
unspecified jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Ali Amiri, the provincial judiciary chief of Fars
province where the monthlong trial has been held, gave no other
details in comments aired on state-run Tehran television.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said two Muslim suspects also were acquitted, and two more
Muslims had received sentences similar to the other Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He did not specify the length of the jail terms for any of the
accused.
</P>
<P>
   The case has cast a pall over Iran's Jewish community and drawn
concerned attention from the United States, Israel and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied the accused were its agents and has been
joined by international human rights groups and other countries in
questioning whether the accused could be fairly tried in a process
in which there was no jury, in which the judge also acted as
prosecutor, and from which observers were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about fairness increased when state television
broadcast confessions from two of the defendants. Defense lawyers
said they were not given a chance to consult with their clients
before their confessions, which came after months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the defendants had pleaded guilty, four had pleaded
innocent and one acknowledged passing information but maintained
his action did not constitute espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin prison on similar
spying charges. Iranian officials have differed on whether the
death penalty could be applied in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the
decades, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian
Jews are allowed to practice aspects of their religion but are
forbidden to teach Hebrew, the liturgical language.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, Iran's Jewish community numbered about 100,000
and was still around 80,000 just before Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution. Now there are about 25,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Shiraz, home to 6,000 of Iran's Jews, was once the capital of
the Persian empire and attracted people of all faiths because of
its wealth and tolerance.

<HEADLINE> Bogota's Face-Lift Disturbs The Dead  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Bogota is getting a face lift, and that
means building new bike paths, repaving traffic-clogged avenues and
digging up a downtown cemetery -- a renovation some people say is
going too far.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of about 1,500 people are being transferred from a
section of the Central Cemetery of Bogota as part of Mayor Enrique
Penalosa's initiative to improve living conditions for the 7
million residents of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   His plan for the city, which is perched high in the Andes,
includes building a park and soccer field on the site of the
cemetery. The transfer of the remains is being completed this
weekend, and some relatives of those buried in the section think
Penalosa has overstepped his boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is sacred ground, who will want to play soccer here?''
fumed Amelia Cuervo as she watched workers transfer her husband's
remains to another section of the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Flower-sellers and the tradesmen who earn livings making
tombstones in shops near the cemetery also are upset.
</P>
<P>
   But Penalosa believes parks and other public spaces are needed
for Bogota's residents to decompress from the stresses of living in
a city that has some of the worst traffic jams in the world, an
annual rainfall greater than Seattle's and is notorious for its
pickpockets and muggers.
</P>
<P>
   Parks are ''a means under which the city focuses on people and
their needs of socializing, of rest, of recreation,'' said Elsa
Bohorquez, the mayor's director of urban renovation.
</P>
<P>
   One project that has earned high marks was the refurbishing of
Plaza San Victorino in downtown Bogota. For years it had been
blighted by stacks of merchandise for sale on the street and swarms
of unsavory characters.
</P>
<P>
   The street sellers were moved to another part of the city, the
plaza was cleaned up, and now many people come to the plaza to
relax, enjoy the wide-open space and view sculptures by Edgar
Negret, one of Colombia's best-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time, officials thought that what was important was
to create streets for cars and infrastructure, but we believe that
what's important is a city for the people, for their happiness,''
Bohorquez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates seeking to succeed Penalosa, whose term ends in
December, have gotten into the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Moreno de Caro, a former senator, campaigned on Friday by
riding a bike along a main Bogota thoroughfare during rush hour.
Moreno de Caro, who backs plans for extended bicycle paths, was
followed by two dozen supporters also on bikes and wearing his
campaign T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Penalosa's successor -- who will be chosen in Oct. 29 municipal
elections -- will be left to deal with the improvement of Bogota's
network of streets, which is woefully behind the huge increase in
car ownership among residents of the capital.

<HEADLINE> Still No Trace of Indonesia Ship  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANADO, Indonesia (AP) -- Since Senaen cried as she clutched her
2-year-old son, waiting with other distraught relatives Friday as
searchers turned up no trace of a ferryboat overloaded with
hundreds of refugees fleeing sectarian violence on the Maluku
islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband is missing. I can only pray that God will protect
him and the rest,'' Senaen said, standing with the others by a
ramshackle dock on Manado's waterfront. ''We left our home because
of the violence and the fighting. We came here to safety a few days
ago. He was to join us.''
</P>
<P>
   After two days of searching, an Indonesian patrol boat Saturday
sighted afloat what searchers believed was the ferry, said Cmdr.
Djoko Sudarman, head of the search and rescue operation. He
declined to give the exact location of the sighting or any details
about why searchers believed the boat was the wooden-hulled Cahaya
Bahari, which had been scheduled to reach Manado Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the 492 passengers and crew was not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to fly over the location and see for ourselves,''
said Sudarman. ''We hope that everyone on board is safe but I
cannot give you any further details until I see for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Contact with the ship was lost Thursday soon after its captain
radioed that it was taking on water in stormy seas about 1,440
miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no debris in the water, no bodies, no oil slick,
nothing,'' said navy Cmdr. Djoko Sumaryono, who is heading the
search effort. ''We hope there are survivors, but we have found no
one. So far it is a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The ferry disappeared while on a voyage of more than 200 miles
to Manado in Sulawesi from the Malukus, a corner of the Indonesian
archipelago where violence between Muslims and Christians has
killed almost 3,000 people of both faiths in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's agent in Manado, Theddy David, said the
130-foot-long, 420-ton vessel was licensed to carry only 290
passengers, but was packed with nearly 500 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   He said many aboard the ferry were refugees from Duma, a
Christian village in the Malukus where more than 100 people were
killed in an attack by Muslim fighters June 19. Muslims make up
about 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people, but Christians
are in the majority in many parts of the Malukus, known as the
Moluccas or Spice Islands during Dutch colonial days.
</P>
<P>
   The weather improved Friday and a navy reconnaissance plane and
an air force helicopter searched along with three navy ships and
dozens of fishing craft and larger vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Sumaryono said then there was a slim chance that the ship might
be drifting outside the search area with survivors aboard, but said
it was ''very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possible explanations are that the captain radioed in a
wrong position during his final distress call or perhaps debris
were washed out into the deep ocean by strong currents.
</P>
<P>
   On Manado's waterfront, hundreds waited anxiously for their
missing relatives, who embarked Wednesday on the ferry journey.
Some women sat in a crowded waiting room, fiddling with their
wedding rings. Other people sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no news. We know nothing about what has happened,''
said Merlin Tuwangena, who was waiting for a group of 30 relatives
from Duma, among them small children, old people and some wounded
in the religious violence.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, hundreds of other people climbed on or
off three ferries, similar to the missing Cahaya Bahari. The
ferries' interiors were crammed with cargo and people lying on rows
of double-decker bunks surrounded by possessions in boxes and bags.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping disasters with large losses of life are common in this
country of some 17,000 islands. Poorly maintained vessels are often
overloaded by captains eager to maximize profits.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, three people drowned when a wooden cargo boat
illegally carrying 52 passengers capsized off the southeast coast
of Sulawesi in rough seas, said officials in the port city of
Kendari. The six crew told authorities the passengers forced them
to set sail to a nearby island despite bad weather.

<HEADLINE> Lack Of Booze Hurts Mexico Tourism  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Damon Krytzer and five friends were planning to
spend the extended Fourth of July weekend in Ensenada, Mexico -- but
not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   They canceled their plans as soon as they learned alcohol would
not be sold in anywhere in the country because of Sunday's
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't going there just to get drunk, but it would have
been nice to sit around the pool and drink a margarita,'' said
Krytzer, a 29-year-old investment broker from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   From midnight Friday to 10 a.m. Monday, alcohol sales are banned
in Mexico under ''La Ley Seca,'' or the dry law, which is intended
to ensure public order and prevent rowdiness as people head to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Those Americans who head south of the border anyway will also
find popular nightspots such as Hussong's Cantina and the Papas &AMP;
Beer disco in Ensenada closed. The law is taken seriously in Mexico
and, if past elections are any gauge, it will be nearly impossible
to buy booze.
</P>
<P>
   The election Sunday is widely considered to be the most
competitive in Mexico's history with polls showing a statistical
dead heat between Francisco Labastida, the ruling party candidate
and Vicente Fox, the candidate of the right-of-center opposition
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans with plans to spend the weekend on Mexico's Baja
California peninsula weren't thinking too much of the election --
until hearing about the alcohol ban.
</P>
<P>
   Krytzer and his friends learned they could bring their own
alcohol but wouldn't be able to take it out of their hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just seemed like such a hassle, so we made other plans,''
he said. They canceled their reservations at Ensenada's Coral Hotel
and Marina and booked a room in Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The manager at the Coral, Norma Lopez, said she's received about
15 cancellations because of the alcohol ban but that's not many for
a hotel with nearly 150 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be plenty of other weekends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the hotel rooms in Ensenada are reserved for
the weekend, said Felizardo Palacios, the city's delegate to the
Baja California state tourism board.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend, Palacios said, provides Ensenada with an
opportunity to showcase itself as more of a family destination than
the rowdy party spots to the north, Rosarito and Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is extremely important to Mexico, so even if
some people don't come you have to balance that against the greater
good for the country,'' Palacios said.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the San Diego-based Institute for Health Advocacy
found more than 8,000 Americans cross from San Diego to Tijuana on
a typical Friday night. A test of those returning showed 64 percent
of men and 59 percent of women had consumed some alcohol, said
Richard McGaffigan a spokesman for the group.

<HEADLINE> City settles lawsuit with former deputy police commissioner for $1 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The city has agreed to pay $1 million to a
former deputy police commissioner who said she was fired after
refusing to revise a report critical of the handling of a sexual
harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The city's agreement to pay was contained in a judgment entered
Friday in federal court in Manhattan on behalf of Sandra M. Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, who headed the NYPD's Office of Equal Employment
Opportunity from 1988 until her dismissal last year, was awarded
the settlement less than two weeks before Police Commissioner
Howard Safir was scheduled for a court-ordered deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the report that led to her ouster, Marsh ultimately ruled
that the underlying sexual-harassment charges against a lieutenant
were unfound. But she found that Assistant Chief Eugene Devlin, the
Staten Island borough commander, had illegally retaliated against a
female officer by transferring her after she filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh also found that Devlin's deputy chief, Philip Erickson,
had lied to investigators, an offto the lawsuit, when Marsh presented the report
to
Safir and top police officials, she was asked by Deputy
Commissioner for Legal Affairs George A. Grasso whether she
''understood'' that the report implicated the conduct of men with
30-year careers.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, the suit alleged, First Deputy Commissioner
Patrick E. Kelleher informed her Safir was ''very unhappy'' with
her conclusions and ordered the case reinvestigated and her report
rewritten. When she refused, Marsh said, she was fired.

<HEADLINE> Ten Iranian Jews convicted of spying for Israel and get fines, lashes and jail terms </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) - Ten Iranian Jews were convicted of spying
for Israel on Saturday and sentenced to prison terms of four to 13
years, while three others were acquitted, the leading defense
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish groups were quick to condemn the verdicts and relatives
of the accused - who arrived at the courthouse in Shiraz on foot
because of the Jewish Sabbath - howled in anguish. One relative
fainted.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations, foreign governments and Jewish
groups had sharply questioned the fairness of the proceedings, and
Israel had denied that the accused were its spies.
</P>
<P>
   Dani Tefilin, a shoe salesman, and Asher Zadmehr, a university
language professor, received the 13-year sentences, said defense
lawyer Esmail Naseri. Ramin Nematizadeh, a shoe clerk, received the
shortest jail term, Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other seven, civil servant Nasser Levihaim was sentenced
to 11 years; store clerk Ramin Farzam 10; shopkeeper Javid
Bent-Yacoub nine; shopkeeper Farhad Seleh eight; religion teacher
Shahrokh Paknahad eight; religion teacher Farzad Kashi eight; and
Faramarz Kashi five.
</P>
<P>
   Three others - Tefilin's brother Omid, Navid Balazadeh and
Nejatollah Brukhimnejad - were acquitted, Naseri said. The three
have been out on bail since February.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of these verdicts and sentences are final and all can be
appealed,'' Naseri said. ''We are relieved that there were no death
sentences. ... I urge family members of the defendants to remain
calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Ali Amiri, the judiciary chief of Fars province where
the trial was held, said earlier that the sentences included fines
and lashings. Naseri made no mention of these punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said two Muslim suspects were acquitted in the case, and
another two Muslims received sentences similar to Jews. Little
information has ever been released about the Muslims involved.
</P>
<P>
   The charges on which the defendants were convicted included
''cooperating with a hostile government, membership in an illegal
(spy) ring and recruitment of new agents,'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin was the first of the defendants arrested more than a
year ago and was the first of two Jews involved in the case to be
shown on national television confessing to spying for Israel.
Zadmehr also confessed, though not on television.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight defendants had confessed and pleaded guilty, four
had pleaded innocent and one acknowledged passing information but
maintained his action did not constitute espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accused were from Shiraz, 550 miles south of Tehran.
As word spread of the verdicts and sentences, anxious relatives
waiting outside let out cries of despair.
</P>
<P>
   The case has cast a pall over Iran's Jewish community and drawn
concerned attention from the United States, Israel and elsewhere.
Critics have questioned whether the accused could be fairly tried
in a process in which there was no jury, in which the judge also
acted as prosecutor, and from which observers were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about fairness increased when state television
broadcast confessions from two of the defendants. Defense lawyers
said they were not given a chance to consult with their clients
before the confessions, which came after months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the result comes as little surprise in a show trial of
this kind. Sadly, guilty verdicts were expected,'' said David A.
Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee,
reached at his home in New York early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy for the 10 and our hearts go out to them and
their families, even as our resolve to rescue them remains
undiminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating prison terms for the defendants, Rabbi Marvin Hier,
dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said Friday
that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami would face protests on
foreign trips as a result of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish Congress,
said from his New York home that sentences might have included
death had people around the world not spoken out against the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God at least no one had to pay with his life because of
the political prejudices of the Iranian government,'' Baum said.
Still ''the moderation of the Khatami government is not reflected
in these trials. This is a matter of great distress.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin prison on similar
spying charges. Iranian officials had differed on whether the death
penalty could be applied if any of the 13 in the current case were
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the
decades, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian
Jews are generally allowed to freely practice their religion, but
like all Iranians are forbidden any contact with Israel.

<P>
   ''It's a tragedy for the 10 and our hearts go out to them and
their families, even as our resolve to rescue them remains
undiminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating prison terms for the defendants, Rabbi Marvin Hier,
dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said Friday
that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami would face protests on
foreign trips as a result of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish Congress,
said from his New York home that sentences might have included
death had people around the world not spoken out against the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God at least no one had to pay with his life because of
the political prejudices of the Iranian government,'' Baum said.
Still ''the moderation of the Khatami government is not reflected
in these trials. This is a matter of great distress.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two Jews were hanged at Tehran's Evin prison on similar
spying charges. Iranian officials had differed on whether the death
penalty could be applied if any of the 13 in the current case were
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's Jewish community, although it has dwindled over the
decades, remains the Middle East's largest outside Israel. Iranian
Jews are generally allowed to freely practice their religion, but
like all Iranians are forbidden any contact with Israel.

<HEADLINE> New Fighting Rages in Afganistan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- A blistering battle north of
Afghanistan's war-battered capital Saturday left as many as 30
civilians dead, scores of fighters injured and hundreds of people
forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition soldiers said 30 civilians were killed by Taliban
jetfighters that pounded enemy territory in Parwan and Kapisa
provinces, all north of Kabul. Because of the fighting and the
remoteness of the area, it was impossible to confirm the report
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bombardment was heavy. We just heard by radio that 30
civilians were killed by jets,'' said Bismillah Khan, an opposition
commander at Baghram Airforce Base, 30 miles north of Kabul. He
said the fighting that raged early Saturday had tapered off by late
afternoon, with troops on both sides of the front line engaging in
sporadic artillery duels.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim movement known for the
strict brand of Islamic law it imposes, rule roughly 90 percent of
the country. The opposition, which rules the remaining 10 percent,
says it is ready negotiate but not to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks both sides in Afghanistan's bitter conflict have
been reinforcing their front lines, sending in fresh manpower and
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides accused the other of launching the offensive that
began before dawn Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting forced hundreds of civilians to flee the area,
particularly in Parwan province, which neighbors Kabul, and Kapisa
province to the north, Khan said. They fled to the Panjshir Valley,
which is controlled by opposition leader Ahmed Shah Massood.
</P>
<P>
   Taliban soldiers were dug in along a defensive line just outside
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to negotiate but we will defend ourselves and now
we are in a defensive position,'' said Abdul Rehman Ottaq, the
Taliban's deputy information minister.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition says Pakistani Islamic religious students and
Arab militants are among the Taliban soldiers at the front line.
Two Pakistanis were arrested Saturday along with several Arab
nationals, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the front Saturday, Taliban fighters wrapped their bearded
faces against the dry gusting winds as they pounded enemy positions
with heavy weapons. A dirty carpet, some old pots and ratty
cushions are their only comforts.
</P>
<P>
   Daoud Mohammed, a 28-year-old soldier, was resting, surrounded
by dozens of Kalashnikov rifles, rocket launchers and boxes of
ammunition. His only shelter from incoming fire was an old railway
car buried beneath the sun-scorched earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have faith in God,'' Mohammed said. ''We will win.''

<HEADLINE> Rallies To Continue in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANZANILLO, Cuba (AP) -- Fidel Castro's government launched a new
series of demonstrations Saturday in the wake of Elian Gonzalez's
return, calling out more than 300,000 people from across eastern
Cuba to protest U.S. policies that it says harm this island's
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering in this southeastern coastal city was the first
large rally organized since Elian's low-key homecoming Wednesday.
Led by Gen. Raul Castro, head of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and
Fidel Castro's younger brother, a sea of people vigorously waved
small red, white and blue Cuban flags as the rally got under way.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised repeatedly in recent months that
once the boy returned, the marches, rallies and televised
round-table discussions would go on. This time, though, the mass
mobilizations will focus not on the 6-year-old, but on U.S.
immigration policies and trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our struggle, without truce or rest, will be resumed
vigorously to enter a new and prolonged phase,'' said a defiant
letter from Fidel Castro read at the event. ''We are not a people
who will stop to relish victories or boast of successes. We will
not stop until each and every one of our objectives ... has been
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro also wrote that Cubans don't care who wins the coming
presidential elections in the United States and said that
candidates are wasting their time trying to win the Cuban-American
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is useless to invest unnecessary time in the declarations
and promises made against Cuba to obtain the vote of just a few
people who have no country of their own, who even dare to step on
and burn the American flag,'' Castro added. He was referring to the
angry actions of some Cuban exiles in Miami after the federal raid
that reunited Elian with his father in April.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba organized more than 100 such rallies in the seven months
that Elian was in the United States, calling out hundreds of
thousands of Cubans from around the country to show popular support
for bringing the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family remained out of public view Saturday, as
they have since shortly after returning to Cuba. They are staying
at a specially prepared boarding school in Havana, where they will
live for two or three weeks along with Elian's classmates and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they are to take a week's holiday, then return to their
hometown, a small port city east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   All the billboards with Elian's face that had been erected along
main thoroughfares around the capital were pasted over Friday with
a new message: ''Unity is the fundamental strength of the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba blames the a U.S. law called the Cuban Adjustment Act in
particular for the international custody battle over Elian. After
he was hospitalized following his rescue from the Atlantic Ocean in
late November, Elian was allowed to stay in the United States under
the 1966 law, which allows Cubans who reach American soil to seek
permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the act as a ''killing machine,'' Cuba maintains
the policy encourages Cubans to take risky crossings across the
Florida Straits, such as the one that Elian embarked on with his
mother and 12 others.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of three survivors from the boatwreck that killed
his mother and thrust him into a custody dispute between his father
in Cuba and his relatives in Miami, who wanted him to remain in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Egypt May Restore Relations  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran and Egypt will soon restore full
diplomatic ties after more than 20 years of strain, an adviser to
Iran's culture minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normalization of diplomatic ties between Iran and Egypt is
being accomplished and we should expect an official announcement
soon,'' Mohammad Sadeq Hosseini told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate confirmation from Egypt, which has long
wanted Iran to change the name of a Tehran street named after the
assassin of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Hosseini, who is also the secretary of the non-governmental
Iran-Egypt Friendship Society, said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa ''settled the few
remaining misunderstandings'' during a meeting this week on the
sidelines of an Islamic conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Ties were severed after Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
Relations deteriorated further when Egypt gave refuge to the ousted
Iranian shah, who was buried in Cairo in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Relations began to improve after Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, a political moderate, took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran and Egypt have made a wise decision to restore ties and
any delay in normalization would be detrimental to both
countries,'' Hosseini said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke by telephone
last month -- the first direct contact between leaders of the two
states since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has urged Iran to rename a street that is named after
Khaled al-Islambouli, a Muslim militant army officer who
assassinated Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has objected to Egypt's dealings with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attacks GOP on Energy  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused the Republican-run
Congress on Saturday of ''drilling holes'' in progress being made
to improve energy efficiency and lower gasoline prices over the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must do more to free working families from the grip of
rising energy costs -- especially the price we pay at the pump,''
Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also linked the opening of a Federal Trade Commission
investigation into the possibility that oil companies are engaging
in illegal pricing practices to evidence that gasoline prices are
beginning to drop in the hard-hit Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since the investigation began, prices have
fallen 8 cents a gallon at the pump in the Midwest, and more than
12 cents in the Chicago area, the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said long-term energy security depends on long-term
policies. It is exactly those policies that have been consistently
ignored or resisted by Congress, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since 1993, the Congress has approved only 12 percent of the
increases I've proposed to develop clean, efficient sources of
energy,'' Clinton said. ''Now the Republican leadership wants to
gut the programs they've already approved.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he called GOP attacks against efforts to produce
''ultra-efficient cars,'' and what he termed unwise proposals to
increase drilling ''in our most precious natural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of drilling holes in our progress, I ask Congress
again to approve the steps we have proposed to increase our energy
supply, to protect the environment, to increase energy conservation
and keep our economy strong,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for tax incentives to support oil production inside
the United States and renewed his proposal for tax credits to help
families buy fuel-saving cars and energy-efficient homes, buildings
and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ''These measures won't just save energy; they'll also reduce
pollution and put money back in the pockets of consumers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that he has asked for more than $1 billion to
speed research and development of clean and efficient energy
technology, together with legislation to promote new competition in
the electricity industry and to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve as a hedge against emergencies caused by disruptions in
overseas oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   He asked again for Congress to create a home heating oil reserve
in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we take the right steps now, we can secure our
independence, protect our environment and continue to grow our
economy for generations to come,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> A Woman Guards Buckingham Palace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Tourists watching the changing of the guard at
Buckingham Palace on Saturday saw history being made by a sentry
named Cynthia.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Cynthia Anderson became the first woman to stand guard at
Buckingham Palace when she led a unit in the morning parade
Saturday, part of a company of Australian soldiers who have
temporarily taken over protection duties from the usual all-male
British guard.
</P>
<P>
   Four women are part of the contingent of 150 Australians, who
are taking a rare turn at the palace to mark Australia Week, the
centenary of the nation joining the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   The band of the Royal Military College of Australia played
''Waltzing Matilda'' and the theme tune of ''Skippy the Bush
Kangaroo'' as the guard changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians will be on duty every other day until July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Australians last stood guard in 1988, to mark Australia's
bicentennial. Australians also joined in guard duty in 1953 as part
of celebrations of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Secret Money Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday signed the first
legislation restricting campaign contributions in two decades and
said it will force special interest groups ''to come clean about
their donors.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the law closes a loophole that allowed some
tax-exempt, politically motivated groups to influence elections and
policy actions without disclosing where the money to pay for it
came from.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a brief statement on the South Lawn of the White
House, Clinton said the clearest and most serious recent example
was the attempt of groups allied to the pharmaceutical industry to
influence his administration's efforts to achieve ''a meaningful,
affordable Medicare prescription drug benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said groups, including Citizens for Better Medicare,
''flooded the airways with millions of dollars of ads'' against the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, he said, makes groups like this ''lift the
curtain'' on all future spending.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, they should voluntarily ''open their books and let
the American people judge'' them by their donors.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the bill is ''a step but not a substitute for
comprehensive campaign reform.'' He called on Congress to pass such
comprehensive reform this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''But let me say this is a good day and this is a good law,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The secret donations were made under Section 527 of the Internal
Revenue Code, reserved for groups created for political purposes,
including political action committees, or PACs. The White House
called the groups claiming Section 527 immunity from disclosure,
''stealth PACS.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation requires section 527 groups to notify the
Internal Revenue Service that they exist within 24 hours of
forming. And groups that raise at least $25,000 per year would have
to report contributions of $200 or more and spending of $500 or
more. Reports would be due four times a year, plus immediately
before an election, and the first should be available before voting
this November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial opposition from Republican leaders, the
legislation was approved by big majorities in each chamber of
Congress. It passed the Senate 92-6 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Backers argued the measure was crucial to preserving one of the
pillars of post-Watergate reforms: public disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   But it would leave many interest groups free to continue airing
commercials without naming their donors. And groups affected by the
legislation may reorganize themselves under the tax laws to avoid
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill only requires disclosure of donations made after it
becomes law. Some backers feared GOP leaders might drag their feet
in sending the bill to the White House, and supporters speculated
that affected groups were scrambling to raise money before the bill
was signed.

<HEADLINE> What 7-year-olds want: Game Boy, 'blades and Harry Potter  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - For weeks, a rumor went around my son's class
that a boy named Joey already had the fourth Harry Potter book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joey doesn't have the book,'' I insisted to my son, Danny.
''Nobody has the book. It hasn't been published yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If the book isn't published yet, how do you know about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. How do you explain the mysteries of publishing to
a 7-year-old? Even I don't quite understand how a book that won't
be in bookstores until July 8 has been on Amazon's bestseller list
for weeks, or why everyone is already talking about how long the
book is (over 700 pages).
</P>
<P>
   ''I just know,'' I finally answered. ''Anyway, how do you know
Joey has the book? Have you seen it?''
</P>
<P>
   ''No. He's not allowed to bring it to school.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ''It belongs to his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. But as silly as it is for a second-grader to pretend he
has a book that hasn't yet been published, it also shows just how
trendy Harry Potter is.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't enough for Danny to have a buzz cut, wear cargo pants
and Rollerblade around the neighborhood with his Color Game Boy in
hand. If he really wants to be cool, he's got to be able to speak
with authority about Quidditch (a team sport played with
broomsticks) and Hogwarts (the school where Harry Potter studies
magic).
</P>
<P>
   Yet Harry Potter is the type of fad a mother can love. I know a
lot of parents who worried their kids would never love books
because CD-ROMS, Game Boy, Nintendo, the Internet and videos -
never mind TV - just provided too many other, more compelling forms
of entertainment. Then they discovered Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   My nephew, never a bookish kid, read the first three books a
couple of times over. My son, who made me stop reading bedtime
stories to him some time in the middle of first grade, agreed to
try the books after he got them as birthday presents from an aunt
and a classmate. Many of his friends had already read them and were
talking about them, and Danny didn't want to be left out.
</P>
<P>
   But peer pressure only gets you to start the book. Good writing
and amazing plots are what keep you turning the pages. I knew my
son finally understood the joys of reading when he started begging
me to keep going after we were done with our allotted chapter each
night. Many a school night my 7-year-old ended up staying until
nearly 11 p.m. because we just had to find out what was in the
mysterious letters being delivered to Harry Potter, or how the
Quidditch match turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, I had to insist that it was time to turn
the light out, and then after Danny was asleep, I'd keep reading by
myself. When we resumed the next day, I'd say, ''Wait 'til you find
out what happened with the ghost,'' or ''You won't believe what
that potion did,'' and he'd be furious that I'd continued without
him.
</P>
<P>
   About three months after we started, we finally finished all
three books - 309 pages, 341 pages and 435 pages, respectively. And
on the morning of July 8, I fully expect to be in a bookstore with
Danny by my side clutching Harry Potter IV. No doubt he'll feel
like he's right on the cutting edge when he sees the long line at
the checkout counter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll even run into Joey.

<HEADLINE> Lott Touts GOP Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans pay too many taxes and Washington
has too much money, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Lott touted the party's
''First Things First'' plan, which aims to protect Medicare and
Social Security, pay down the national debt and reduce taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That plan is not a gimmick assembled by political
consultants,'' Lott said. ''It's just the way my own parents did
our family budget at the kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott used the Fourth of July holiday and talk of the Boston Tea
Party to cite how modern Americans are ''intolerably overtaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leader appealed to President Clinton not to veto bills
repealing the inheritance tax and the ''marriage penalty'' tax,
which the Senate is expected to take up in the next few weeks.
Versions of both initiatives have already passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining budget surplus should go mainly toward shrinking
the national debt, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we first balanced the budget three years ago,
congressional Republicans have paid back $150 billion on the
debt,'' he said. ''This year, we propose another $175 billion
paydown.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott chastised Clinton and congressional Democrats for
introducing new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, in most respects, we've come a long way from the
days of the Revolution,'' Lott said. ''But in some ways, we're
remarkably similar to those earlier Americans -- overtaxed by a
distant government headed by someone who seems not to care about
their burdens.''

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Threatens Nuclear Renewal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea on Saturday renewed its
threat to restart its nuclear program if Washington does not
compensate for the loss of electricity caused by delays in building
nuclear power plants in the reclusive communist state.
</P>
<P>
   The United States pledged to provide North Korea with two modern
nuclear power plants by 2003 in a 1994 accord meant to freeze the
North's nuclear program, suspected of being used to build atomic
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But construction has been delayed by funding problems and
tension over the North's long-range missiles. Now officials say a
delay of several years is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea says the delays mean a huge loss of electricity
badly needed to rebuild its devastated economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the issue of compensation ... fails to find a smooth
solution, the (North) will have no option but to turn out
electricity by graphite-moderated reactors depending on its rich
natural resources and its own technology,'' the North's official
Korean Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The North's outdated Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated
reactors can be used to extract weapons-grade uranium, a key
ingredient for making atomic bombs, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, a delegation of the U.S.-led Korean Peninsula
Energy Development Organization, which is building the modern
reactors in the North, arrived in the North to discuss the $4.6
billion project, KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton released a $20 million
installment in energy aid to North Korea, saying the regime appears
to be living up to a commitment to freeze its nuclear weapons
program.

<HEADLINE> Potter fans counting down to Harry's big day  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The countdown is more suspenseful than any
high-stakes Quidditch game. The anxiety can't even be cured by one
of Professor Severus Snape's magic potions.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of the young British wizard who's captured the
imaginations of millions of readers have just days to wait before
they can lose themselves in the fourth installment of Harry
Potter's magical adventures.
</P>
<P>
   They're poised to pounce on July 8, when a record-shattering 5.3
million copies of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' are to be
released in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a once-in-a-generation kind of thing,'' said Diane
Roback, children's books editor at Publishers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores around the country are planning Harry Potter parties
and staying open late so they can sell ''Goblet of Fire'' at 12:01
a.m. on publication day. In Britain, author J.K. Rowling will start
a promotional train tour at ''Platform 9&AMP;frac34;'' of London's Kings Cross
Station, where Harry and friends catch the train each fall to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Advance orders of the yet-to-be-released fourth book have pushed
it to No. 1 on Amazon.com's best-seller list for 16 of the past 21
weeks, and the first three volumes occupy three of the fifteen
spots on The New York Times list.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has already sold more than 265,000 copies of ''Goblet of
Fire,'' dwarfing its biggest previous advance sale, 43,000 copies
of John Grisham's ''The Brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   A wall of secrecy as impenetrable as that surrounding the
devious scheming of Harry's nemesis Voldemort has guarded the
book's plot, heightening fans' anticipation of the release.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing you could compare this to,'' said Linda
Wilkinson, manager of Adventures for Kids, a bookstore in Ventura,
Calif. ''We've been planning for months now, and we're getting
close to the countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Many booksellers credit the Potter series with boosting sales of
children's literature generally and bringing new popularity to
fantasy stories, which have been overshadowed in recent years by
more realistic children's books.
</P>
<P>
   How has a generation of kids raised on video games and the
Internet become so wrapped up in the twisting, turning, multivolume
tale of an orphaned young wizard?
</P>
<P>
   Most credit Rowling's storytelling skills. The first three books
chronicle Harry's miserable life with his aunt and uncle, Vernon
and Petunia Dursley, his initiation into a world of magic at
Hogwarts, and his plunge into a series of life-and-death adventures
with pals Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are packed with clever bits of imaginative fancy -
every-flavor jelly beans that taste like liver, tripe and sprouts,
a vicious three-headed dog named Fluffy and the Nimbus 2000, a
high-velocity flying broom used for playing Quidditch, wizardry's
favorite sport.
</P>
<P>
   Harry ''is a lonely boy who's rescued from a wretched
existence,'' Roback said. ''He goes to this boarding school where
he has these magical powers, and he's treated like a hero. He goes
from rags to riches, and that's really appealing to kids. ... He's
an every-kid that a lot of kids can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter fan Juliette Spirson, 11, of Woodland Hills, Calif.,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the magic,'' she said, explaining Harry's appeal. ''He
gets to do everything that we don't get to do. It's never boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy books have long been a staple of children's literature -
C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, Madeleine L'Engle's ''A Wrinkle in
Time'' and J.R.R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' are all classics.
But in recent years, more popular kids' books have focused on real
life, taking place in schools and dealing with issues like family
trouble and problems with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers say the runaway success of the Potter series is
helping revive children's interest in fantasy writing, as young
fans look for ways to relive the absorption many feel while reading
about Harry's magical adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost nothing in their lives is left up to imagination
anymore, because of television, because of video games that are so
violent,'' said Caron Chapman, executive director of the
Minneapolis-based Association of Booksellers for Children. ''The
balance tipped on the side of overload on facts and reality, and it
now needs to be balanced with a little more day-dreaming and a
little more imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   But will grade-schoolers really be willing to crack a 752-page
book (the British edition, with different design and illustrations,
is closer to 600 pages), even if it does star a character they
already know?
</P>
<P>
   Roback, of Publishers Weekly, said the length was unusual and
that the youngest readers might find it daunting. Older children,
though, are unlikely to be deterred, particularly if they're
already hooked on Harry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Piece of cake,'' declared the 11-year-old Spirson. ''I read
really fast, so the longer, the better. ... Everyone says, 'I'm
going to get through it, no matter what.'''

<HEADLINE> US Satellite Launched in Kazakstan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian Proton-K rocket carrying an American
digital radio satellite successfully blasted off Saturday from the
Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan, space officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, a CD-Radio-1 communicator, is designed to
transmit television, radio and vehicular communications in a
digital format over the United States, space officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's launch followed an agreement last week by Russian
President Vladimir Putin and Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev
to continue cooperation at the Baikonur cosmodrome, Russia's main
commercial rocket launching site.
</P>
<P>
   Russia agreed to lease Baikonur from Kazakstan after the breakup
of the Soviet Union in 1991, but has frequently fallen behind in
rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   Twice last year, Russian rockets exploded over Kazakstan after
lifting off from Baikonur, and Russian launches were banned for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of the strategic missile
troops who launched the satellite, said the liftoff showed that
Russian rockets were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The successful launch of the Proton-K rocket at a time when
preparations are underway for the launching of the Zvezda service
module to the International Space Station is convincing evidence of
the reliability of Russian rockets,'' he told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of delays, Russian space officials this week set
a July 12 launch date for the service module, which will serve as
initial living quarters and steer the massive craft.

<HEADLINE> Report: Giuliani begins hormone treatment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was diagnosed with
prostate cancer in late April, is receiving hormone therapy at a
Manhattan hospital while trying to decide on a final treatment, the
Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources familiar with Giuliani's medical
situation, the newspaper said the mayor was being treated with
Lupron - a medication that blocks the production of testosterone,
the male hormone that prostate cancer cells thrive on.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office refused to comment Saturday on the report.
Giuliani was scheduled to attend the Long Island funeral of NYPD
Inspector Anthony Falco, but his office stressed that the mayor
would not speak with reporters following the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   While Lupron and other hormone blockers are not a cure for
prostate cancer, they can buy time for patients who want to
evaluate different therapies. The blockers are sometimes used
before surgery or radiation to shrink the prostate and reduce
prostate specific antigen, or PSA, levels.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects of Lupron are hot flashes and
impotence. Injections of the drug, which are administered monthly
or quarterly, can hold the cancer at bay for years, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly refused to answer most questions about
his health since dropping out of the Senate race against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton on May 19. He has told reporters he will
inform the public of his decision on a cancer treatment only when
he feels comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men.

<HEADLINE> Miami Tries To Recover From Elian  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The daily demonstrations over Elian Gonzalez's
custody have ended with his return to Cuba, but it may take a long
time for the city to recover from the wounds the issue caused.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became a holy war,'' said Max Castro, a University of Miami
sociology professor. ''It was a very divisive issue. It wasn't the
most violent issue, but it was the most emotionally divisive issue
in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   The case further fractured Miami's ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians were upset that civic leaders fought so hard to keep
Elian in the United States while doing nothing to help Haitians
trying to flee poverty in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside the Cuban-American community were appalled when the
boy's Miami relatives defied U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. They
flew U.S. flags from their cars, countering the many Cuban flags
displayed by people who wanted Elian to stay.
</P>
<P>
   And many non-Cubans, afraid an attempt to take Elian from his
Miami relatives would cause massive civil disruption, were angered
when Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas boldly said his police
department would not assist federal agents if they came for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Latin reaction is so strong ... you can get into a fight
with someone,'' said John Kim, who is of Cuban-Korean descent.
''Instead of it being a civil difference of opinion it becomes an
all-out battle.''
</P>
<P>
   When federal agents did remove Elian from his Miami relatives'
home to take the boy to his father, Cuban-born Miami Mayor Joe
Carollo was furious that he wasn't told of the raid even though the
police chief did have advance word. He fired City Manager Donald
Warshaw and police Chief William O'Brien resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-Hispanics called Carollo ''Crazy Joe,'' and some tossed
bananas outside City Hall, protesting that the city was being run
like a banana republic.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrust that grew between some Cuban-Americans and
non-Hispanics may remain for quite a while, Castro said. ''At this
point we're in recovery. However, a lot of the things that were
exacerbated have not been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within South Florida's community of 780,000
Cuban-Americans, some were so revolted by the idea of Elian being
returned to Fidel Castro's Cuba that they wouldn't tolerate a
difference of opinion in their own families.
</P>
<P>
   Yesikka Vivancos said she believed Elian should return to Cuba
with his father, while her mother wanted him to stay because
''there's nothing for him in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gotten to a point where I've told her 'I refuse to talk
about this' because she refuses to see the other side of things,''
said Vivancos, a 26-year-old office manager at Florida
International University. ''She's dead set on her opinion and isn't
open to any others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say exposing the divisions can help the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''When things are out in the open you can confront
misunderstandings,'' said Philip Blumberg, chairman of the Greater
Miami Chamber of Commerce. ''It's good we're finally starting to
air these things. We have the opportunity now to talk to each other
about things we otherwise wouldn't have if it hadn't been brought
to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the mayor, Juan Mendieta, said the passions of
Miami Cubans over Elian may have been misinterpreted by people
unfamiliar with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a very diverse community and we're a very passionate
community,'' he said. ''It's a mistake to view that as a negative
thing.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Case May Sway Immigration  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After seven months of bitter emotions and
plenty of political heat, the case of Elian Gonzalez finally was
resolved under long-standing rules on parents' rights and
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately what the Elian Gonzalez case stands for is the
right of a parent to speak for and raise a child ... irrespective
of the parent's nationality, ideology or economic status,'' said
Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children
and Youth Law Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst that could be said about Juan Miguel Gonzalez was
that he was Cuban and an adherent of the communist ideology,'' but
that was not enough to take the 6-year-old Elian from his father
and give custody to relatives in Miami, Perlmutter added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, now that Gonzalez has taken his son back to Cuba, some
experts in family and immigration law hope the controversy will
lead to new ideas for handling the cases of children who arrive in
the United States without a parent or close adult relative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real question is going to be whether those standards need
changing,'' said Neal Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who chairs the
American Bar Association's standing committee on immigration law.
More than 5,000 such children arrive in the United States each
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said last week that she and
immigration officials will review whether the Gonzalez case
demonstrates a need for new procedures or regulations, such as a
minimum age for children seeking asylum on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be looking at it to see if there is any lesson
learned, anything that should be done,'' Reno told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled last month that the INS acted
within reason when it decided that only Elian's father -- not his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez in Miami -- could apply for asylum for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected the Miami relatives'
appeal. Hours later Elian and his father flew to Cuba, ending the
saga that began last Thanksgiving when Elian was found floating on
an inner tube after his mother died trying to reach this country.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said that ''in
general, at each stage we did what we had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I totally agree in general that parents have a right to run
their children's lives,'' Eig said, but added that the family
believed ''Juan Miguel's decisions even in this country were being
made under duress'' from the Fidel Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Maggio, an immigration lawyer in Washington D.C., said
that in legal terms, Elian's case was an ordinary immigration
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't mean that from an immigration law perspective
it's something to rejoice about,'' Maggio said, adding, ''The case
stands for the proposition that the immigration service has
extraordinary authority. ... The courts consistently rule in favor
of the immigration service, so what else is new?''
</P>
<P>
   Courts usually defer to decisions by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service because immigration policy is closely bound
to foreign policy, which is an executive branch responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnett said officials should consider whether legal
representatives should be routinely appointed to speak for the
interests of children who arrive in this country unaccompanied by
an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Jay Kutner, a Miami lawyer and former chairman of the
ABA's family law section, said the federal court in Elian's case
could have borrowed some ideas from family court, including
appointment of such a representative for the boy, as well as a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large part of the battle is the desire of the parties to be
heard,'' Kutner said. He added he did not necessarily disagree with
the outcome of the case, but the federal court at least could have
''softened the impact of the child returning'' to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't break any new legal ground in this case,'' said
Perlmutter. ''We just clarified existing law with respect to the
right of an admitted alien to seek asylum in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonnett said, ''I would have much preferred to have seen Elian
Gonzalez stay here, but as a matter of law I don't think that was a
realistic probability... I have to give credence to the rule of law
even though my gut and heart would have preferred that Elian
Gonzalez remain in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Moynihan's upstate estate for sale as couple tries to simplify life </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) - The rural homestead where U.S. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan and his family lived for 36 years, where he
wrote 18 books in an 1854 schoolhouse, where Hillary Rodham Clinton
symbolically began her run to replace him, is on sale for $1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat's giving up the Senate and I'm giving up the farm,'' the
retiring Democratic senator's wife, Elizabeth Moynihan, told the
Associated Press in a telephone interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 73, finishes his fourth and final six-year term at the
end of this year. He announced in 1998 that he would not run again.
''You're in your 70s and you don't want to press that too long, do
you?'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth also cited age in what she said was her quick decision
to sell the home known as Derrymore. ''Everyone I know who is over
70 like me is trying to simplify their life,'' she said. She is two
months away from 71. Her three children are in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have arthritis in the knees and I can't garden six hours a
day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was much more than gardening to care for the country
estate - comprised of two Greek Revival houses, two barns, the
schoolhouse, ponds, stream and 8,000 feet of road frontage on 500
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Moynihans purchased the farm in February 1964, three months
after John F. Kennedy's assassination. As the senator tells it, his
wife traveled to Oneonta, found a real estate agent and committed
on the spot to the home in the hamlet of Pindar's Corners, about 57
miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this was the quiet sanctuary where one of the
Senate's leading intellects and a former Harvard professor wrote
and edited works on poverty, government and ''Counting Our
Blessings: Reflections on the Future of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm remained largely out of the political spotlight, though
it served as backdrop last July to a key moment in Clinton's
campaign. A couple hundred reporters with dozens of cameras
recorded Moynihan walking Clinton down the road from schoolhouse to
hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   But to Elizabeth, an architectural historian, Derrymore has been
more home than historic site, and she did not understand why most
would care about its sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing to me that it's a news story,'' she said. ''It's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also has a condominium with what Elizabeth called ''a
wonderful view of Pennsylvania Avenue'' in Washington, D.C.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Reject Multiparty Politics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- In a referendum marked by low voter
turnout, Ugandans have overwhelmingly rejected multiparty politics
in favor of continuing with President Yoweri Museveni ''no-party''
system, according to provisional results announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With about 88 percent of the 16,500 polling stations in the East
African nation reporting, the Electoral Commission said 91 percent
of the votes cast in Thursday's referendum favored retaining the
National Resistance Movement as the country's political system as
opposed to returning to a multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout was 44.9 percent of the 9.6 million registered
voters. The final, official results will be announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Western donors, who contributed $4.5 million to the cost of
holding the referendum, expressed concern Saturday that the results
could lead to a drift to a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of donors emphasizes the importance of insuring that
the movement system does not evolve into a de facto one-party
state. Experience shows that such development would not be in the
interest of transparent and accountable government in Uganda,''
their statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy that there has been collaboration among all groups
and people during the elections,'' said commission chairman Aziz
Kasujja. ''The votes which have so far not been received are from
areas like the north where people voted late because of problems
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In one county in northern Uganda, where rebels are active, only
11 percent of registered voters participated. Advocates of
multiparty politics could claim that as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional political parties, allowed to exist in name only,
had called for a boycott of the vote. But it wasn't clear whether
the boycott, rainy weather or simply a lack of interest was
responsible for the low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties, which cannot campaign, raise funds or field
candidates on party colors, have argued that basic political rights
should never have been restricted when Museveni came to power in
1986 after a five-year guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni blames political parties for creating the religious and
ethnic divisions that plunged Uganda into chaos from the mid-1970s
until he assumed power. He was elected president in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Vote With Uncertainty  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAUCALPAN, Mexico (AP) -- When Leopoldo Becerril was young, he
rode his horse through this farm village of sweeping vistas, and
opposition political parties were as welcome as ''a dog in somebody
else's neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Becerril is 58 and Naucalpan is a chaotic suburb of
860,000 people governed by the opposition National Action Party --
an example of the dramatic changes that have given Mexico's
opposition a real shot at power in the presidential election
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   National Action's Vicente Fox is running roughly even in the
polls with Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, which hasn't lost a presidential race since it was
created as a party of power in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the first time in a century, and perhaps the first
time ever, Mexicans are voting with a great uncertainty about who
their next president will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even 10 or 15 years ago in Naucalpan, to go out campaigning in
some neighborhoods was to risk your hide,'' said Becerril, a
National Action activist. ''We left running as the stones flew.''
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, National Action's Luis H. Alvarez recalled
that when he ran for president in 1958, he was arrested and ''spent
several hours in jail as a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   When he asked what the charge was, the jailer replied: ''being a
candidate of the opposition,'' Alvarez recalled in an interview
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for access to (broadcasting on) the radio, I could not have
even a single minute in the whole campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, like other major candidates, has received more than $100
million in government campaign financing and has run an intensive
television and radio campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in places such as Naucalpan that started in the 1950s
helped produce those changes, even as the PRI remains dominant in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexicans increasingly moved to cities and grew more educated,
the PRI's influence weakened. People began to demand political
reforms. Today, only about a quarter of Mexicans live in small
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Naucalpan, a scattering of 16 farm towns with fewer than 100,000
people in 1960, exploded with suburbanites fleeing neighboring
Mexico City and farmers fleeing the impoverished, overcrowded
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril, whose family has raised rodeo horses for generations,
saw the wide-open countryside become covered with factories,
low-income apartment blocks, luxury homes and a helter-skelter
scattering of commercial developments.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril's great-grandfather, grandfather and an uncle were PRI
mayors of Naucalpan. He joined National Action about 15 years ago --
not long after the new city's wealthy neighborhoods produced one of
the country's first directly elected opposition congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the federal government for the first time recognized an
opposition party victory in a state. Baja California went to
National Action, known as the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of electoral reforms between 1989 and 1996,
opposition parties now govern about a dozen states and at least
eight of Mexico's 10 largest cities. Naucalpan, No. 11 on the list,
elected the PAN in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is now part of the ''blue corridor,'' a chain of suburban and
industrial cities west and north of Mexico City governed by the
PAN, whose colors are blue and white. Mexico City itself is
governed by the left-center Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which once won elections with 80 to 90 percent of the
claimed vote, is struggling to surpass 42 percent this year against
the five other candidates on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 years ago Mexicans awoke the day following an election
uncertain of whom they had elected, the ruling party's Carlos
Salinas or maverick leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was declared the winner after officials ''crashed'' the
vote-reporting computer when initial returns showed Cardenas ahead.
Millions of Mexicans -- including many analysts who studied the
election -- still believe Cardenas won.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas is a candidate again this year. But he finished third
in the generally clean 1994 election won by the PRI's Ernesto
Zedillo and is again in third place in the polls this year.
</P>
<P>
   While his party may take votes from Labastida in the
countryside, most analysts think he hurts Fox more by splitting the
vote of millions of Mexicans whose chief priority is to oust the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a sign of progress that Cardenas says some things are
more important than defeating the PRI. Electing Fox, he said
recently, ''would mean a step backwards'' because of the PAN's
conservative social ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dire threat to the PRI this year, the party actually
could stage a comeback. In 1997, amid an economic slump, the party
lost its majority in Congress for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show it running near the level it would need to regain
that majority in the 500-seat lower house. It is expected to hold a
reduced majority in the 128-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The party also has hopes in Naucalpan, where PRI activists blame
their 1996 mayoral defeat on the bad economy and over-confidence.
They accuse National Action of ignoring poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PAN did not beat us in 1996,'' said PRI city councilman
Federico Delhumeau. ''It was simply that our people did not vote
for us.''

<HEADLINE> UN: S. Leone Peacekeepers Attacked  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Gunmen fired on U.N. peacekeepers
at a checkpoint in Sierra Leone on Saturday, one day after a
Jordanian soldier was killed in a rebel ambush, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian peacekeepers were staffing a checkpoint at Rokel
town, 15 miles east of the capital, Freetown, when they were
attacked by unidentified assailants. U.N. spokeswoman Hirut
Befecadu said there were casualties, but could provide no further
details.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came the day after Sierra Leonean rebels ambushed
another unit of Jordanian peacekeepers on their way from the
western town of Masiaka to join a convoy of U.N. vehicles at the
nearby town of Mile 91. One Jordanian soldier was killed and four
others were injured in the assault, which occurred 80 miles east of
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers returned fire. When they later searched the
house from which the gunfire had come, they found 11 bodies which
were identified as rebel fighters, Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front rebels killed tens of thousands of
civilians and systematically maimed many more during the West
African country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents signed a peace accord last July, but reignited
the conflict in early May when they seized 500 U.N. hostages and
began advancing toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag alliance of
pro-government forces has been pushing the rebels away from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 peacekeepers and observers remain surrounded,
however, at a U.N. compound in the rebel stronghold of Kailahun,
200 miles east of Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Quake Rattles Japan Island Chain  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- An earthquake shook a string of volcanic islands
off Tokyo on Saturday, sending cascades of dirt and rock down
mountainsides, killing a man in a car, snapping water mains and
cutting power.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders heard a loud thud, then felt about 10 seconds of
shaking that made it difficult to stand, an official on Kozushima
told Kyodo News agency. Ikuro Sakurai, a local post office
supervisor, told Kyodo that his building, made of reinforced
concrete, creaked frighteningly when the earth moved.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the staff panicked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A huge, tree-covered slab of earth slid down one Kozushima
mountain, covering a stretch of coastal highway and muddying the
ocean, TV footage showed.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 6.4 quake struck the Izu islands at 4:02 p.m.,
causing the most damage on Niijima and Kozushima, the
Meteorological Agency said. It was centered about six miles below
the Pacific seabed, three miles east of Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Self-Defense Forces dispatched a 39-member relief team to
Kozushima and Niijima, spokesman Shoji Katsui said.
</P>
<P>
   The area is within the state of Tokyo, though the city is about
95 miles to the northeast. The quake was felt in the capital.
Aftershocks continued throughout the day, lessening in strength as
evening came.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio
Aoki were consulting with officials at the premier's crisis
management center.
</P>
<P>
   The quake shook the island of Miyakejima, just southeast of
Kozushima, where residents were allowed to return to their homes
Friday after fears of a volcanic eruption subsided.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Miyakejima's 4,000 residents were evacuated
earlier this week after intensifying quakes suggested the island's
2,686-foot Mount Oyama might be coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   On Kozushima, rescuers dug out a driver buried in a landslide,
but he died at a hospital, a National Police Agency official said
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cars were buried in landslides on Kozushima, but there
were no further reports of injuries. On Niijima Island, a taxi was
covered in one of four landslides, but the driver was able to
escape uninjured, Niijima official Torayoshi Kino said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake cracked and buckled roads on Kozushima, blocking
traffic around the 7&AMP;frac12;-square-mile island of about 2,300 people,
island spokeswoman Chizuru Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor cut power and snapped water lines around Kozushima,
but electricity and telephone service were restored by evening,
Ishida said.

<HEADLINE> Boxing promoters in IBF scandal could lose licenses  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Revelations in the racketeering trial of IBF
founder Robert W. Lee have boxing officials in key venues
considering whether to banish some of the sport's biggest
promoters.
</P>
<P>
   No action is contemplated before the end of the racketeering
trial, which began here in April and could last several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony of promoters such as Bob Arum and Cedric
Kushner, each involving $100,000 payoffs, is already under scrutiny
by officials in New Jersey and Nevada - the most lucrative states
for boxing because of their casinos - as well as California, which
has the most boxing matches of any state, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, the most powerful promoter, is not expected to
testify. He could face scrutiny by licensing authorities because
federal prosecutors identify him as an unindicted coconspirator,
supported by testimony that he was the prime beneficiary of Lee's
manipulations of the IBF rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The other big promoter in the case, Main Events Inc. of Totowa,
N.J., believes it will escape discipline because it jettisoned
president Dino Duva, who testified he funneled $25,000 to Lee so
the IBF would follow its rules and rank one of his fighters as the
junior middleweight top contender in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter, Fernando Vargas, became the IBF champion and still
holds the 154-pound title.
</P>
<P>
   No promoters are on trial. They are licensed on a state-by-state
basis, where regulations generally say unsavory activity linked to
boxing can be grounds for punishment, including revocation of a
license.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly monitoring,'' said Marc Ratner, executive
director of the Nevada Athletic Commission. ''We are getting our
transcripts, and observing from afar.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's chief legal counsel, Kirk Hendrick, said all
four of the big promoters hold Nevada licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are privileged licenses in the state of Nevada, and it
is certainly possible that disciplinary action could be taken,''
said Hendrick, a chief deputy state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada law allows discipline if a promoter ''conducted himself
at any time or place in a manner which is deemed by the commission
to reflect discredit to unarmed combat,'' Hendrick related.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal courtroom in Newark daily is an investigator with
the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the agency that
examines promoters and other businesses because they need licenses
to work at casinos. It serves as the investigative arm of the New
Jersey Athletic Commission, which also licenses promoters.
</P>
<P>
   DGE director John Peter Suarez, a former federal prosecutor, has
said that promoters who may be involved with commercial bribery
''are a significant concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The four big promoters hold licenses to do business with New
Jersey casinos, which are subject to revocation if they cannot meet
the standards of ''good character, honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Applying those standards, New Jersey in 1994 banned Don King
from doing business with Atlantic City casinos after he was
indicted on charges he bilked Lloyd's of London for training
expenses involving a 1991 fight that was canceled. The Casino
Control Commission vacated its order in 1998 after King was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Any action directly related to boxing that discredits the sport
could lead to revocation of a promoter's license in California,
said Rob Lynch, executive officer of the state's boxing commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're conducting our own investigation, and we're following
right along with what happens in New Jersey,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   While California has the most cards, the biggest money is made
from fights in casinos, said Nigel Collins, editor of The Ring
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''If both Nevada and New Jersey stop Kushner and Arum from
promoting in the casinos, it would be huge blow to those
promoters,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way boxing works today, the casinos in Atlantic City and
Nevada pay huge site fees to the promoters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos don't make money on ticket sales. Instead, ''They
bring in high-rollers from around the world for the fights, knowing
they are going to drop a lot of money,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties against a promoter could leave marquee fighters
looking for a new home. King's stable includes Evander Holyfield,
while Arum has Oscar De La Hoya, Kushner has Shane Mosley, and
Lennox Lewis fights for Main Events.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and other IBF officials are accused of taking $338,000 in a
span of more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters testifying against Lee, including Arum of Top Rank
Inc. of Las Vegas, and Kushner of Cedric Kushner Productions of New
York, have said payoffs were required to do business with the East
Orange, N.J.-based IBF.
</P>
<P>
   As one of three major sanctioning bodies for boxing in the
world, its rankings and decisions play a large role in the purses
earned by boxers, of which managers and promoters get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the alleged bribes stems from machinations in April
1995 regarding then-heavyweight champion George Foreman and Axel
Schulz, a German fighter. Foreman promoter Arum testified early
this month that he used a middleman to get $100,000 to the IBF to
sanction the Foreman-Schulz title fight. An exception was needed
because Schulz was unranked.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman won in a disputed split decision.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz promoter Kushner testified last week that he funneled
$100,000 to the IBF from his co-promoter, German businessman
Wilfrid Sauerland, for the organization to mandate a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF ordered the rematch, but Foreman relinquished its belt
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner also said he made cash payoffs to the IBF three to four
times a year from 1987 through 1994, in amounts ranging from $2,500
to $10,000, to ensure good treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures disturb Greg Sirb, executive director of the
Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission and president of the
Association of Boxing Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saddened,'' Sirb said. ''It hurts our sport. I think there
are a lot of young fighters who are looking at this and saying,
'This is why I didn't get ranked. This is why I didn't get a title
shot.' It hurts our image.''
</P>
<P>
   The four promoters are not licensed in Pennsylvania, but ''all
the states are looking at it, no question,'' Sirb said.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Mexico Elections  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at Mexico's national elections:
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT STAKE: The six-year presidential term. All seats in Congress:
500 three-year terms in the Chamber of Deputies and 128 six-year
terms in the Senate. The mayoralty and other posts in Mexico City,
the capital. The governorships in Morelos and Guanajuato states.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE PARTIES: Ten parties have proposed six candidates for
president. The top three: the Institutional Revolutionary Party,
which has governed Mexico since 1929; the center-right National
Action Party and the center-left Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES: Opposition parties say the ruling party must be
ousted to make Mexico fully democratic. The ruling party calls for
continuing the basic free-market economic course with more social
spending. It portrays opposition candidates as dangerous risks.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTERS: Eligible are 58.7 million Mexicans. Millions who
live in the United States are effectively disenfranchised: they can
vote only in Mexico and there are fewer than 45,000 absentee
ballots they might be able to use in border districts.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTE: Polls open Sunday at 8 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. local
time. Because of time zone differences, the first polls will open
at 9 a.m. EDT and the last will close at 9 p.m. EDT. Each party can
assign workers to monitor each polling place. Poll workers are
chosen at random from the general population.

<HEADLINE> Leading Mexican Political Parties  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Glance at the main political parties in Mexico
competing in
Sunday's election:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI: Formed by the
government in 1929 to maintain and transfer power peacefully, the
PRI has held the presidency ever since. It has gradually evolved
into a more traditional party as politics has opened to other
parties, but it maintains a massive grass-roots network of labor,
farm and social organizations. Once famed for fraudulent elections,
the party has repeatedly won clean votes in recent years, but
opposition parties have made steady gains and the PRI lost control
of Congress in 1997. This year, the party held its first
presidential primary, ending the practice of outgoing presidents
designating candidates. Its standard-bearer, Francisco Labastida,
says he is part of a ''New PRI'' that has abandoned the fraud of
the past. Its colors are the same as those of the Mexican flag --
green, white and red -- and for many, the party is almost synonymous
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   --National Action Party, or PAN: Its candidate, Vicente Fox, is
running in a coalition called the Alliance for Change. Founded in
1939, it is politically and socially conservative. Its power bases
are in northern Mexico and in the cities. Despite rampant fraud and
pressure against it, the party elected a few congressmen in the
1940s and mayors in the 1950s but was not allowed to win a
governorship until 1989. It now governs eight of Mexico's 11
largest cities, has five governorships and is part of a coalition
in another.
</P>
<P>
   --Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD: Its candidate, party
founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is running in a coalition called the
Alliance for Mexico. Many Mexicans believe he was cheated of the
presidency by fraud in 1988, but he finished third in the 1994
election. The party was founded in 1989 around Cardenas' 1988
coalition of breakaway PRI members and old socialist parties. With
a leftist platform, the party's power bases are in poor urban areas
and in the rural south. Its greatest victory was Cardenas' 1997
election as Mexico City mayor. It governs in three states and as
part of a coalition in another.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Writer Disappears in Jamaica  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEGRIL, Jamaica (AP) -- Stuck in Jamaica for longer than planned,
travel writer Claudia Kirschhoch decided to make the best of this
laid-back Caribbean resort. The 29-year-old American mixed with
locals, went to a reggae concert, sunbathed on the spectacular
white sands of Seven Mile Beach, read a book on Asian metaphysics.
</P>
<P>
   And then she disappeared -- leaving clothes, passport and wallet
behind.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, her anguished parents and authorities seem at a
loss to explain what happened. In a reflection of how the
investigation is going, police took the advice of a psychic this
week and searched caves along Negril's seaside cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate Kirschhoch is in hiding. Others guess she
drowned. And many fear foul play -- a prospect that could bode ill
for a poor Caribbean country that is desperately dependent on the
tourist dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Already the $1 billion industry, which accounts for a tenth of
Jamaica's gross national product, is flat. The country is fighting
a reputation for gangland violence and for exposing visitors to its
aggressive brand of street vendor, the notoriously irksome
''higgler.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials note that the 1.2 million visitors who come here each
year -- equal to almost half the population -- almost always leave
unharmed. But they fear the high-profile nature of this case.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she's been hurt it would certainly not be helpful,'' said
hotel magnate Gordon ''Butch'' Stewart, whose Sandals chain invited
Kirschhoch to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The missing woman's parents, Fred and Mary Ann Kirschhoch of
Morristown, N.J., have come here twice -- most recently this week,
with an ABC-TV crew in tow. They have offered a reward of $25,000,
held news conferences and walked around town, telling all who would
listen about their daughter and sometimes pulling out a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   This much is known: Kirschhoch arrived in Montego Bay on May 24
as part of a Sandals-sponsored tour for travel writers which was to
continue to Cuba. But when the Cuba leg was canceled because of
visa problems and all flights back to New York were booked, she
opted to stay at a Sandals resort in Negril, where she arrived May
25.
</P>
<P>
   That night she left the resort compound to see a reggae concert
''because she said she wanted to know Jamaica,'' said Tania
Grossinger, a New York City journalist who met Kirschhoch on the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast on May 27, Kirschhoch told Grossinger she might
go to Kingston to find reggae albums not sold in the United States.
She was last seen in the hotel lobby later that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sandals executives said that when she didn't check out on June
1, they extended her stay. The next day they searched her room. The
only items believed missing were a bathing suit, sunglasses and a
small radio. Her passport, wallet, camera and house keys were
there.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the FBI quietly arrived last week and is keeping
mum. Kirschhoch's parents, meanwhile, say they feel she is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something terrible has happened to her,'' said Mrs.
Kirschhoch, her voice brittle. ''I don't know what, but I know she
needs us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kirschhoch, a partner in an architectural firm, said his
daughter loved to travel, taking frequent trips to Italy and the
Canary Islands off West Africa -- ''her favorite spot on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Negril, it would seem, was an ideal venue for the curious young
woman to explore. For more than 30 years American and European
visitors have been drawn to the west coast town -- which, unlike the
crime-ridden capital, Kingston, was considered as safe as its
beaches were beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Police have received close to 400 calls from helpful citizens
claiming to have spotted Kirschhoch. And many police officers
thought they had done so as well: Stories of officers approaching
white women in towns around Jamaica abound.
</P>
<P>
   Peace Corps volunteer Angie Steely said she was apprehended by
officers near Kingston. As they stopped her, she said, they were
shouting: ''Look! Look! She the missing one!''

<HEADLINE> Researcher finds crows intriguing and perplexing  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ESCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Kevin McGowan knows crows aren't the most
popular of birds.
</P>
<P>
   They're noisy. They devour baby robins. They pluck corn
seedlings. You can't take a road trip without seeing one teasing
the intestines from a flattened rabbit. And they sometimes roost by
the tens of thousands, whitewashing cars as they rise in a
clamorous cloud at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, the somber black birds have been associated
with death -- both metaphorically, as dark omens, and literally, as
carrion eaters. Their macabre image was magnified last summer when
hundreds of crow corpses heralded the outbreak of mosquito-borne
West Nile virus in the New York City region.
</P>
<P>
   To McGowan, however, crows are intriguing, intelligent birds
with a complex social structure. And he ought to know. He has spent
the last 12 years tagging crows, following them around, and
recording every detail of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   He has found that crows are smarter and more complicated than we
had imagined. And there is still much to learn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't know an awful lot about these common birds,''
McGowan said in an interview. ''They're the least-studied game
animal in America. You start looking in the literature and you find
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, McGowan climbs pine trees to pull baby crows from
bushel basket-size nests of sticks, while furious parents swoop and
curse. He attaches numbered tags to their wings and color-coded
bands to their legs, so he can identify them and record their
behavior over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He has tagged more than 850 crows to date, and has kept close
track of about 75. Among his findings:
</P>
<P>
   -Crows mate for life and are cooperative breeders, with as many
as 15 birds from several generations staying with parents or
siblings to help raise young.
</P>
<P>
   -A crow doesn't breed until it's 2 to 6 years old, and should
live 17 to 21 years if it survives its first year (about half die
before they're a year old).
</P>
<P>
   -Breeders stay on their territory year-round, leaving only to
forage and roost, while non-breeders travel around more.
</P>
<P>
   -Crows have one brood a year and spend nearly four months
raising young, compared to songbirds such as robins which can have
four or five broods in a season.
</P>
<P>
   -The number of crows nesting and roosting in urban areas has
grown significantly in the past 30 years, although the overall crow
population has risen only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan got interested in crows while working on his doctoral
dissertation on the social behavior of Florida scrub jays in 1987.
He received a federal grant to study crows in 1988 after he came to
Ithaca, where his main job is curator of the Cornell University
Museum of Vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a green Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology baseball cap
over his sandy hair, McGowan kept up a commentary on the life and
times of various local crows as he cruised the residential
neighborhoods of Ithaca on a recent spring day.
</P>
<P>
   His words frequently trailed off as he braked his mauve Subaru
and raised binoculars to his wire-rimmed glasses to read a wing
tag.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's ZP93,'' he said, focusing on the wing tag of a crow in
a tree behind a mobile home. ''He fledged out of this pine seven
years ago. He's still hanging around helping his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   As he made the rounds of various nests, McGowan occasionally
reached into a sack of peanuts behind his car seat and tossed a
handful to a cluster of crows eyeing him from the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to get on their good side,'' McGowan said. Some follow
him in hopes of handouts, but others just shriek at him. ''They
hate me for climbing to their nests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the enduring mysteries about crows is, why do they hang
around for years to help parents or siblings raise young?
</P>
<P>
   This cooperative breeding behavior apparently did not evolve
through natural selection in crows, McGowan said, because it
doesn't seem to give them any competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some birds, it's obvious that there is a benefit to having
extra family members helping out,'' McGowan said. ''In some species
of tropical wrens, if you don't have at least four individuals in
your family you produce zero young because predation is so high.
But in crows, there doesn't seem to be any effect.''
</P>
<P>
   McGowan thought the benefit of having extra feeding help might
show up only in bad years. In 1995, he had the opportunity to test
that theory during a drought, which made earthworms scarce.
</P>
<P>
   He was excited to find that nests with helpers did produce more
young. But a closer look at the data showed the increased survival
rate was in the egg stage, having nothing to do with feeding help.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I still don't understand what's going on,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan knows a lot of people don't share his enthusiasm for
crows.
</P>
<P>
   ''A constant comment I hear is, crows eat baby birds, so we
should get rid of them,'' McGowan said. ''The fact is, the birds
they're eating are adapted to heavy depredation. When we see a crow
with a baby robin, we assume that's one less robin in the world.
But if the crow didn't eat it, it would have died in migration, or
a hawk would have gotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crows invoke perhaps the greatest human wrath when they
congregate in huge numbers to roost. Last summer, a National
Geographic television show featured a roost of 50,000 crows in
Auburn. The city has been perplexed about what to do about the
noisy, messy birds.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan's advice: Leave them alone. Efforts to oust them will
probably just make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn roost originally was near the state prison, McGowan
said. ''After the crows would settle down for the night, the guards
would flash their searchlights over them and they'd fly up and
defecate all over the cars in the prison parking lot,'' he said.
''Now, they're all over downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest smudge on the reputation of crows is their
association with West Nile Virus, which killed seven people and
sickened 62 others last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rare mosquito-borne disease was identified, wildlife
scientists were perplexed by the discovery of hundreds of dead
crows around the region. The deaths were later linked to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Are crows likely to spread this new disease?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, McGowan said. For one thing, crows generally don't
move far from their home territory. And the virus appears to be
more lethal to crows than other species. It's more likely to be
carried by other birds and animals that are infected but don't die,
McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crows are the biggest victim of this disease,'' McGowan said.
''Because so many are killed by it, they can act as sentinels if it
does spread.''

<HEADLINE> Jailed man says prosecutors botched rape investigation  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Sitting in a prison cell for a rape he
claims never happened, Jerome Sweezy is beyond bitter. He is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing left to lose,'' Sweezy says. ''The only thing
that drives me is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, prosecutors counter, is why the 45-year-old former
used car salesman was convicted of rape in 1994 and is now serving
a 3-to-9-year sentence at the Livingston Correctional Facility, a
medium-security prison 60 miles south of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters, however, say Sweezy has spent five years in
prison because of a lazy, bumbling investigation by Broome County
prosecutors, who failed to locate a number of witnesses who have
since cast more-than-reasonable doubt on the victim's story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prosecutors have an obligation to seek justice not just
convictions,'' said James Weeks, director of the Office of Clinical
Programs at the Syracuse University College of Law, which has filed
papers to reopen Sweezy's case and is awaiting a judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Sweezy says his ordinary life turned into a nightmare on June
15, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sweezy, a 20-year-old woman and an elderly man came
to Sweezy's dealership that day looking to sell the man's car.
After settling on a consignment deal, the pair left. Afterward,
Sweezy realized they had not left the car keys. Sweezy arranged to
meet the woman and ended up taking her for a ride. The woman began
flirting with Sweezy, who was married and had two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was kind of cute, I guess. Here I am, 36 at the
time, and here's this 20-year-old girl making a pass at me,'' said
Sweezy, who worked at IBM Corp. for 14 years before going into
business for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Sweezy said he realizes now he was asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reached the secluded road, the woman coaxed him to
pull over. She unzipped his pants and offered him oral sex in
gratitude for Sweezy's help in selling the car, Sweezy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said thanks, but no thanks. I took her back and dropped her
off, and that was it,'' said Sweezy, who refused to plea bargain
his case.
</P>
<P>
   That's his story. The woman had a different one.
</P>
<P>
   She told police she feared for her life. At trial in April 1994,
the woman added that Sweezy grabbed her neck during the encounter
and left red welts on her neck. The welts were not mentioned in her
initial statement to police, nor did any witnesses recall seeing
them.
</P>
<P>
   After Sweezy dropped her off, the woman said she fled to Robert
Mineah's house, the elderly man she said she cared for. Mineah
later told investigators that he had sex with the woman and often
let her use his credit card. Mineah was watching her two children.
She went to police the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told jurors she was met at the door by Mineah and her
children. She said she picked up her daughter and clutched her
closely, relieved to have escaped her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses who were later found by a private
investigator, the woman was anything but distraught.
</P>
<P>
   They said played cards and joked with her companions. Her only
reference to the man who had supposedly just assaulted her was to
tell them that he was ''a little weird'' but she thought she could
get a good deal from him on her car, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess anybody who doesn't want free sex is a little weird,''
Sweezy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sweezy lost an appeal. In 1996, he asked for a new trial based
on the witnesses found by the private investigator and was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   None of those witnesses, except Mineah, testified at his trial
because Assistant District Attorney Mary Ann Lehmann, now a city
judge, never bothered to locate them, even though she should have
known of their existence, Sweezy said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors never allowed defense attorney Thomas Saitta to
interview the victim despite repeated requests, according to
Saitta. The victim has since moved and prosecutors declined to
reveal her whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the motion to reopen his case, Sweezy alleged prosecutorial
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents show the woman told Lehmann several times during
a grand jury hearing Nov. 12, 1993 that other adults were present
when she returned to Mineah's house that day, Weeks said. Lehmann
failed to conduct a follow-up investigation or alert Sweezy's
defense attorney other potential witnesses existed, Weeks charged.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, court papers accused Lehmann of committing perjury
at the December 1996 appeals hearing when she testified that the
first time she ever heard of other adults at Mineah's house was in
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann and District Attorney Gerald Mollen refused to discuss
the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response opposing a new trial, Mollen said nothing
had changed since the 1996 hearing and there was ''still absolutely
no evidence'' to support the defense's allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial defense lawyer knew during trial exactly what the
trial prosecutor knew,'' he said, dismissing the idea that there
was any sinister plot to wrongly convict Sweezy.
</P>
<P>
   It was private investigator Phil Gallagher who tracked down the
auctioneer, several of his employees and another friend, Lisa Gage,
who were at Mineah's house that June day in 1993. Gallagher said he
did not do anything extraordinary in finding them.
</P>
<P>
   At the appeals hearing in December 1996, Broome County Judge
Martin Smith labeled as ''totally credible'' the evidence gathered
by Gallagher and the testimony of all the witnesses. Smith also
agreed that certain of the victim's statements ''were incredible
and unworthy of belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith concluded that the jury would not have
decided the case any differently if it had access to the evidence
uncovered by Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, six jurors thought otherwise and submitted signed
affidavits saying so.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also refused to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jay Dinga, a conservative Republican who has been
outspoken in his support of get-tough criminal laws, has been a
longtime supporter of Sweezy's, writing the governor, attorney
general and others over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about treating someone who's guilty softly. What
is at issue is that a person can be sent away to state prison ...
based on evidence that was circumstantial at best, and later proved
contrary to the facts,'' Dinga said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have rallied behind Sweezy, including attorney Jon Getz,
who represented Betty Tyson, a former prostitute who languished in
a New York prison for nearly 25 years before her 1973 murder
conviction was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are enough questions and issues of innocence that it
rates having a court review, and perhaps another trial,'' said
Getz. ''If he's really guilty, a trial will determine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sweezy is determined to hold fast. Although he has
been an exemplary inmate, he has been passed over twice for parole
because he refuses to complete a required sex rehabilitation
course. To participate in the required program, he says, would be
tantamount to confessing guilt.
</P>
<P>
   His once successful business career is gone. His wife has
divorced him. He has not seen his two children in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I could fight this better from the outside,'' Sweezy
said. ''But I refuse to be a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll only be a victim if I let them get away with this,'' he
said. ''Someday, somebody will see the truth ... I think we're
getting a lot closer.''

<HEADLINE> TA: Subway operator fails second cocaine test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A second cocaine test has come back with a
second positive result for the operator of a subway that derailed
in Brooklyn, injuring 66 people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The motorman behind the wheel when a B train went off the tracks
on June 20 had requested the second test after an earlier one found
traces of cocaine, said Deirdre Parker, a Transit Authority
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News identified the operator as David Murray, 51, but
Parker said the TA was not releasing his name.
</P>
<P>
   She said investigators were still trying to determine the cause
of the accident. Officials have said they are looking at problems
with a switching mechanism that failed as the train changed tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The southbound B train was leaving the DeKalb station when the
wheels of the third car skipped off the track, sending riders
flying as the brakes automatically engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The operator has been suspended and notified that the MTA will
seek his dismissal.

<HEADLINE> Nations Renew Anti-Poverty Push  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Five years after they pledged to improve the lot
of the world's poor, governments at a U.N. summit agreed Saturday
to throw their weight behind a renewed effort to combat global
poverty -- but offered few firm commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the U.N. General Assembly's special session
reaffirmed promises made at 1995's first poverty summit in
Copenhagen, which since then have largely been ignored. They said
they are ''determined to give new momentum to our collective
efforts to improve the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Their final statement stressed the importance of debt relief,
market access and more aid for developing countries. It said it
will cost $8 billion per year to achieve education for all, and
that new funding commitments are ''essential.'' But the statement
commits nations to nothing specific, and is not binding.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is hoping that it will nevertheless generate
the political will for prompt action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1995 session the number of people in absolute poverty
-- living on less than a dollar a day -- has climbed about 200
million to 1.2 billion, the United Nations estimates. It now aims
to halve that figure by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, pressure groups and activists at the
Geneva summit said they were ''gravely concerned'' by that
deadline, which they said ''sentences hundreds of millions of
people, especially women, to continue living in abject conditions
for another generation.''
</P>
<P>
   They also were angered that no specific mention was made of the
so-called ''Tobin Tax'' -- a plan to raise money for development by
taxing currency transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Rich and poor at the meeting divided over the same arguments
that have hindered trade negotiations and other major conferences
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries complained that their products do not have
fair access to world markets and that creditors are not moving
quickly enough to write off crippling debt. But industrialized
nations said the poorer countries must begin to help themselves by
eliminating corruption, putting poverty reduction plans into place
and ensuring basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Copenhagen agreement called for developed countries to
donate at least 0.7 percent of their gross national product in
official development assistance, but only four nations -- Denmark,
Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands -- meet that target.
</P>
<P>
   The new declaration stresses the need to provide technological
assistance to poor countries. It calls for ''consideration ... of a
temporary debt standstill'' when countries are faced with a sudden
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Countries at the conference set a target of a 50 percent
improvement in adult literacy levels by 2015. By that same date,
they want to ensure the enrollment of all children in primary
school. They also agreed to ''further recognize the critical
importance of access to essential medicines at affordable prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand especially in the face of the worst enemy in the
world, namely HIV/AIDS,'' said Theo Ben Gurirab, president of the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva meeting was attended by 19 heads of state and
government, far short of the 117 who took part in the original
poverty summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people think it's a loss of time,'' conceded Roberto
Bissio of Social Watch, one of the interest groups that attended.
''But if we don't have a high-level political process, how do we
make the countries accountable for the few targets and objectives
that they commit themselves to implement?''

<HEADLINE> Whaling Body Considers New Sanctuary  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At the bottom of the world, the whales
are on the move -- and the spotters are out.
</P>
<P>
   As pods of humpback, sperm, southern right and a half-dozen
other whale species begin their annual migration from subantarctic
feeding grounds to breed in warmer waters to the north, human eyes
are scouring the sea for telltale bursts of blowhole spray or the
flap of a huge black tail fin.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago the watchers would have been hunters looking to
harpoon their next kill. Today, they are scientists and sightseers
who want to study or simply marvel at the giant ocean mammals.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) next
week, Australia and New Zealand will be fighting pressure to lift
the 14-year global whaling moratorium, and pushing to extend the
amount of the world's oceans which offer sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake, we believe commercial whaling is not
necessary,'' said Howard Bamsey, Australia's representative to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be an economic return from whales, but whereas that
return used to come from killing whales we believe that now a much
more satisfying form of return, and one that has enormous
potential, is from whale watching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it meets in Adelaide next week, the IWC is expected to vote
for the first time on an Australia-New Zealand proposal to create a
huge new whale sanctuary stretching 4.7 million square miles across
the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is approved, around half the world's oceans
would be off-limits to whaling, although the commission's bans are
nonbinding and apply only to its 40 member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1986 moratorium, large-scale hunting drove many whale
species to near-extinction. Whales were killed for bone, blubber
for oil, and ambergris, a waxy substance found in the sperm whale's
intestine, which is used in some perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the moratorium, whale numbers have rebounded, helped by
the creation of sanctuaries in the Southern and Indian Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling countries Japan and Norway are pushing the IWC for a
program to monitor whale numbers and allow sustainable commercial
hunting. They say that under the plan, hunting would be allowed but
only at levels that would ensure no species is seriously depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials say the need for whale products no longer
exists because alternatives have become cheaper and easier to
produce. With whale-watching now a multimillion dollar industry,
whales are worth more alive than dead, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government estimates that each year 5.4 million
people from 65 countries participate in whale-watching activities,
spending $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, whales often swim so close to the coast some
residents can see them from their homes. Last year, a whale even
entered Sydney Harbor, where it frolicked for several days before
resuming its migration.
</P>
<P>
   Japan will officially oppose the South Pacific sanctuary
proposal, which would forestall whaling in an area where no whales
are hunted at the moment, but where a dozen or so species live.
Bounded in the north and south by the equator and the southern
sanctuary, the zone stretches east-to-west from below mid-Australia
to between Easter and Pitcairn islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain, Italy, Austria and Monaco will
co-sponsor the proposal and the 14 countries of the South Pacific
Forum have given in-principle support, Bamsey said.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-whaling nations are strong lobbyists. Getting the 75
percent support needed is unlikely on the first vote, Australian
Environment Minister Robert Hill concedes.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal is voted down next week, Australia will continue
to pursue it at future meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Norway say they are being misrepresented as
environmentally irresponsible for wanting to hunt whales.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that Australia and New Zealand cherish whales,
everybody feels that way,'' said Junichi Okamoto, a senior official
at Japan's Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But scientific evidence, he argued, does not support claims that
all whales still need protection from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been told nothing other than that we should protect
whales,'' Okamoto said. ''Admittedly, some species should be
protected, but that does not mean there should be an
across-the-board ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan kills about 400 whales a year under what the government
calls a scientific sampling program. The meat usually ends up in
markets in Japan, where it is considered a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway, around 600 whales are killed each year for meat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tradition that has nothing to do with the exploitation
of whales,'' said Lars Walloe, a Norwegian government spokesman who
will attend the commission meeting. ''When the resources are
plentiful, it's not a question of depletion, they're just
harvesting the surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Norway can evade the moratorium because the IWC has no
powers other than to deny countries membership. Negative world
opinion is the strongest factor against commercial whaling, aside
from the lack of a wider world market for whale products.

<HEADLINE> Five misdiagnosed patients may have cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A least five women who allegedly received shoddy
mammograms from a pair of since-suspended Bronx doctors showed
possible signs of cancer when retested, state health officials
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The women were among an estimated 9,000 patients of Steven Bier
and Mario DiBlasio, two doctors who participated in a state program
to provide free cancer screening for uninsured and underinsured
women.
</P>
<P>
   Retesting of patients screened by the doctors turned up
irregularities that will require biopsies to determine if the five
women actually do have cancer, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were also investigating the cases of some patients who
died after visiting the doctors - ''a handful,'' said state Health
Commissioner Dr. Antonia Novello. ''We are trying to obtain death
certificates.''
</P>
<P>
   In suspending the two doctors on May 31, Novello had said their
operation was ''a comedy of errors'' that left patients with poor
or inaccurate diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the doctors' work showed they were finding an
average of 1.25 breast cancer cases per 1,000 screenings, a
fraction of the 5.15 cases found by the rest of the doctors in the
Healthy Women Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have since set up 3,500 exams for patients of the
two doctors, with 2,100 already rescreened, Novello said. Novello
acknowledged that the five women with possible cancer could have
developed the illness after they were tested by the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Bier's attorney, Barry Berke, said his client was ''confident he
will be completely cleared.'' DiBlasio's lawyer, Scott Einiger,
said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative hearings on the doctors' licenses are expected
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   One of the doctor's patients, 41-year-old Alma Amill of the
Bronx, has already filed a lawsuit against the pair alleging that
their misdiagnosis of her breast cancer led to a spread of the
disease and her mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   She began undergoing chemotherapy two weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> GOP-Led Congress, Clinton Far Apart  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At first glance, the Republican-led Congress
appears to be moving forward on popular issues such as a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit and a big income tax cut for
most of America's married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is that while some seeds of compromise
have been sown, election-year politics in most cases are likely to
block final agreement between lawmakers and President Clinton. Much
of this year's debate -- especially in the House, where Democrats
are battling for control -- is more to score political points than
create law.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Medicare prescription drugs. With much
fanfare, the House passed legislation last week that relies on a
blend of private insurance and federal subsidies to spread coverage
across the country. That is completely at odds with Clinton's
proposal for a government-run program for the 39 million Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ''By legislative definition, an accomplishment isn't an
accomplishment until it becomes law,'' said House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ''Under that definition, the passage of
prescription drug coverage legislation can at best be considered a
press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, on the other hand, say they are doing what voters
want: cutting taxes, paying down the federal debt, controlling
government spending. They contend it serves the political interests
of Democrats to resist compromise, then blame the GOP when the
bills don't become law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a list of accomplishments we can point to that's
good for the American people,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   An example is the Senate GOP's bill to cut income taxes by $248
billion over 10 years for virtually all married couples, including
the 25 million who pay more than they would if single. Clinton and
congressional Democrats agree this is an unfair feature of the tax
code, but they have thrown up roadblock after roadblock. The most
recent obstacle was last week's offer by the president to sign the
bill only if an acceptable Medicare drug bill is also passed.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns from its Independence Day recess, Senate
GOP leaders say passage of the stand-alone ''marriage penalty''
bill will be their first order of business -- and it won't be linked
to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to go to the president,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''We're going to see whether he means
what he said in the State of the Union, that he wanted to get rid
of the marriage penalty tax.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some compromise is inevitable. Before the year is
out, Congress and Clinton almost certainly will agree on each of
the 13 spending bills needed to run government in the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1. They have agreed to lift the outside earnings
limit for Social Security recipients, force certain secretive
tax-exempt political organizations to report contributions and
expenditures and give electronic signatures the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate also is likely to send Clinton one of his
major priorities: a House-passed bill enacting permanent normal
trade relations with China. ''It's not a matter of if, but a matter
of when,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Many more major issues seem hopelessly deadlocked. The Senate
passed a patients' bill of rights last week that included a limited
right to sue HMOs, but Democrats say it is weak and are dead set
against it. Bills overhauling bankruptcy laws and repealing
inheritance taxes have drawn Clinton veto threats, and negotiations
on gun control and the minimum wage are bogged down. Nothing is
being done to brace Social Security and Medicare to pay for baby
boom retirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a session of Congress that's going to be
remembered for accomplishing a great deal if things don't pick
up,'' said Jack Lew, the White House budget director.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes both sides resort to a second-tier accomplishment to
substitute for something bigger. For instance, lawmakers and the
White House are rushing to embrace legislation ensuring that
surplus Medicare money isn't sidetracked for spending or tax cuts,
even though such legislation would do nothing to ensure the
program's future solvency and could easily be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite election-year difficulties, a chance of a breakthrough
always exists. In the 1996 election year, Clinton twice vetoed and
then signed a GOP welfare reform bill that gave both sides a major
accomplishment to bring to voters. That's something some
congressional candidates need this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need to do is what the voters expect us to do,'' said
Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., a 30-year
veteran who is in a tough re-election fight against Delaware Gov.
Thomas Carper. ''That is to work together to achieve consensus.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio campaign counterpunching  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The fledgling campaign of Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Republican rival for the Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio, is
relying heavily on a rapid response team whose mission is to
counterpunch until other weapons are in place.
</P>
<P>
   When Newsday reported Thursday that the first lady had attended
a fund-raiser for Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel on the night of June
15 in New Rochelle, the Lazio team swung into action.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Clinton and her supporters had been running
television advertisements attacking the Republican congressman from
Long Island for missing a House vote on that same night on a
measure to create a home heating oil reserve for the Northeast. The
measure failed by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had caught a late flight out of Washington so he could
keep to his campaign schedule the next day in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Engel and four other New York Democrats also
missed the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton had already raised hypocrisy to a fine art,''
said a statement from Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col sent to
reporters after the Newsday story appeared. ''This time she created
a masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again Mrs. Clinton says one thing, but does another,''
said state Republican Chairman William Powers in his own statement.
''She attacks Rick Lazio for missing a vote, but was raising money
for a Democrat that missed the same vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If hypocrisy was an Olympic event, Hillary would be a shoo-in
for the gold,'' chimed in Rep. Thomas Reynolds, a western New York
Republican, in his own news release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton thinks she can be elected by deceiving New
York voters, but New Yorkers are a sophisticated electorate and
will reject her hypocrisy,'' state Conservative Party Chairman
Michael Long's statement said. The party's leadership has endorsed
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The same cast of characters went on the attack after word came
out June 22 that Lazio's profitable stock option trading in a
company run by some of his major campaign contributors was under
investigation by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration has a long history of abusing
federal authority and using government bureaucracies to attack
their political opponents,'' Dal Col said in a quickly issued news
release.
</P>
<P>
   Similar themes were evident in June 22 news releases out within
minutes from Powers, Reynolds and Long.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid response team represents something of a holding action
as the Lazio campaign struggles to get up to speed on fund raising,
scheduling and the many other details needed to run a smooth
statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to look at it more as a battle and right now we are
freedom fighters, so we will carry on guerrilla activities in
numerous locations, going against the behemoth of the White House
and the Clinton spin machine,'' Dal Col said in a recent interview.
''I will put my sniper rifles in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col, a veteran of Long Island politics who ran millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes' two unsuccessful presidential campaigns,
said they will have to carry the battle until he can ''put my
Marines on the beach'' and ''start coming back in with the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been campaigning across New York for a year,
Lazio didn't formally join the race until May 20, the day after
Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the contest because of
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lazio has had stumbles, such as the missed House
vote, that the Clinton campaign has been quick to seize on. Over
the past two weeks, the first lady and her supporters have launched
six TV ads attacking the congressman for that and other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just gotten into it,'' Clinton said Wednesday when asked
to explain what appears to be a strategy of relentless attacks.
''We have some ground to cover to catch up, to make sure that
voters have a good base of information to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid response team strategy being utilized by Lazio to
counter the first lady's attacks was perfected in 1992 by her
husband, Bill Clinton, during his first presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> France Big Mac Vandal Trial Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLAU, France (AP) -- A public prosecutor on Saturday
recommended that a sheep farmer who has waged a high-profile battle
against globalization receive a 10-month suspended sentence for
vandalizing a McDonald's restaurant in this southern French town.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Bove was on trial with nine other defendants who attacked
the Millau fast food restaurant last August during a wave of
protests targeting the fast-food chain as a symbol of American
trade ''hegemony'' and economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Alain Durand also recommended that Bove spend 18
months on probation. Bove said he would appeal any sentence and
vowed to continue his battle internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The combat will not stop at France's borders,'' said Bove,
spokesman of the radical Farmers' Confederation union, who made
headlines in December when he brought his anti-globalization
message to the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Alain Durand requested that the nine other defendants
receive suspended sentences of no longer than three months, saying
they merely carried out Bove's plans.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, about 11,000 supporters gathered to greet the
10 defendants as they left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Millau court began hearing arguments on Friday as about
15,000 demonstrators gathered to support the defendants. Later that
night, a concert to mark the trial drew about 45,000
anti-globalization supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to deliver its decision Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bove's battle began last year when the United States slapped
sanctions on food products ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie
gras in retaliation for the European Union's decision to ban
imports of U.S. hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   The mustachioed sheep farmer has said his main targets are the
World Trade Organization, multinationals and governments that push
scientifically engineered food. He says the organizations crush the
small-time producers who insist on quality and taste.

<HEADLINE> Sikorsky slated for federal order of Black Hawks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON - Sikorsky Aircraft is poised to receive an order for
18 helicopters the federal government says are needed to fight
Colombia's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   The $234 million for 18 Black Hawks was included in emergency
legislation that got final approval from the U.S. Senate Friday.
President Clinton is expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House had approved the $11.2 billion measure Thursday,
providing $1.3 billion to help the Colombian police battle drug
trafficking and billions more for emergency aid for peacekeeping in
Kosovo, flood and fire disaster assistance, and some other Pentagon
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased the conference report moved quickly through both
chambers,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro D-New Haven. ''It is obvious
that the conferees recognized the importance of the Black Hawks
capabilities, which are uniquely qualified to aid the Colombian
military in their efforts to combat the drug war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hawks were requested by the Pentagon and Colombian
government to do drug surveillance and move police in and out of
the difficult terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colombia is a very good customer of ours and they obviously
recognize the value and the utility of the Black Hawks,'' said Ed
Steadham, a spokesman for the Stratford-based Sikorsky. ''We
believe that Colombia and our supporters in Congress were able to
make the case for using the Black Hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Connecticut officials were pleased with the helicopter
buy, it was substantially less than they originally had in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure included funding for 30 Black Hawks, and the
administration was in favor of the larger number. But Senate
leaders stripped the funding from their bill, and instead directed
Colombia to buy Huey Helicopters. The change forced Connecticut
lawmakers and lobbyists to struggle to restore the money during
negotiations between the House and Senate versions.

<HEADLINE> In Meriden, flap over trap rock development  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MERIDEN, Conn. (AP) - A plan to level a 100-foot-high hill of
trap rock to make way for a housing development is upsetting
environmentalists and pushing the city to sue its own planning
commission for approving the development.
</P>
<P>
   Meriden's planning commission has approved a proposal to build
36 townhouse units on the 12-acre site near Cathole Mountain, a
plan that requires leveling the hill to make way for a road.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, Community Village LLC, whose managing member is
Middletown businessman William Corvo, also wants to sell the
crushed, excavated trap rock.
</P>
<P>
   Meriden City Planner Dominic Caruso is appealing the
commission's vote, with the unanimous backing of the town council
and Mayor Joseph Marinan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those cases where a family is suing a family, so
to speak,'' Caruso said. ''I've never filed suit against a planning
commission before, but it's the only way to prevent what I think is
a total disregard of our regulations and a total disregard of the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is clouded by three city regulations. They include
an ordinance allowing earth excavation under certain circumstances,
and regulations allowing planned developments where the hill is
located. A third ordinance is designed to protect the ridge line.
</P>
<P>
   The developers argue that the hill is not technically part of
the ridge line, but opponents say the ridge-line protection law is
meant to protect the extended area, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three (sets of rules) are consistent in that they all
state that any development shall be done to accommodate the
existing natural features,'' Caruso said. ''If you're going to take
down the whole natural feature - I don't care if you call it a
knoll, a mountain or a hill - you're certainly not accommodating
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say property owners must also be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sooner or later somebody is going to be able to develop that
land,'' said Lois Demayo, a planning commissioner who supported the
project. ''As a planning commissioner it really isn't my concern
who makes the money. I am just tired of government wanting to
control everything. If the city government wanted to control this
property, they should have purchased it when it was on the auction
block.''
</P>
<P>
   Corvo's lawyer said opponents are unfairly projecting their
fears of creeping development on Cathole Mountain onto his client's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they're really worried about (Corvo's) knoll. I
think they're worried about the future of Cathole Mountain,''
William Shea said.

<HEADLINE> Also moved in advance for release Sunday, July 2, and thereafter  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The first round of staffing cuts at St. Mary's
Hospital were the kind a patient might not notice immediately. It
takes a little longer to get the phone answered than it did a year
ago. Paperwork piles up for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a round two, the cuts will be obvious and they will
be painful, promised Martin Morrissey, vice president of finance
for the Waterbury hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Staff cuts at St. Mary's and hospitals throughout Connecticut
can be traced to 1997's federal budget. The package dramatically
cut the amount hospitals receive for treatment of patients on
Medicare, the national insurance program for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been consensus on Capitol Hill that the
Medicare rate cuts went too deep. Last fall, Congress voted to
restore $16 billion to health care providers. But this year nothing
has been done.
</P>
<P>
   If that remains the case, there will be serious consequences for
Connecticut, promised Hartford Hospital Vice President Kevin
Kinsella.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question for a number of hospitals in Connecticut,
particularly some of the smaller ones, will be 'Can they survive?'
For hospitals that may be larger, the question is, 'What can we
afford to continue to offer in the way of services?'''
</P>
<P>
   Recent rumblings in Congress and from the White House indicate
help is on the way in the form of a cash infusion by the session's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Though desperately needed, the cash will do little to solve the
problem in the long run, said Joe Coatsworth, vice president for
government relations for the Connecticut Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   He fully expects the hospital association to come traipsing up
Capitol Hill several times next year, as it did this year, in
search of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the 1997 budget was to balance the country's
books for the first time in years. Medicare cuts, approximately $1
billion to Connecticut over five years, was one of the mechanisms
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, budget cutters believed hospitals would work with
private insurers and find other ways to supplement their budgets,
said Rep. Nancy Johnson, a New Britain Republican who serves on the
committee that funds Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also believed there was abundant waste in the system
that could be painlessly cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''As it turns out, we took a lot fat out of the system but we
also got a lot meat and bone,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn,
a member of the Senate's health committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's time for some reconstructive surgery,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Without a budget boost Hartford residents would face shortened
hours for outpatient, behavioral health and dermatology clinics,
Kinsella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We run a large service for people who can't afford to pay.
What happens if we can't is those individuals wind up in the
emergency room or the state has to provide the services
elsewhere?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's has already tried to eliminate psychiatric services
to save money, but the state wouldn't allow it because those
patients would have nowhere to turn, Morrissey said.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze on hospitals can't be attributed entirely to
Medicare cuts. Managed care has capped hospital fees at levels that
aren't always sustainable, Coatsworth said. Medicaid, the
state-federal insurance program for the poor, pays hospitals less
than the actual cost of care and assumes those dollars will be made
up elsewhere, Kinsella said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has helped out by repealing a tax on gross hospitals
earnings - a move that saved the hospitals $92.5 million,
Coatsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   But as of late June no reimbursement bills had moved in the U.S.
House or Senate. Johnson attributed this in large part to President
Clinton's silence on the matter until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year they used to say, 'There's a problem. We need to fix
it.' That helped things move along.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the month the White House did step in with a
proposal to boost Medicare payments by $21 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Johnson said she believes the change of heart
followed growing estimations of a federal budget surplus and
concluded there would be enough to both increase Medicare
reimbursements and pay for prescription drugs under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd believes the administration simply realized the need.
''This is not about relief for the providers. It's really about
relief for the people they serve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term he suggests creating a formula built into law
that would allow for flexibility in Medicare payments depending on
need.
</P>

   Johnson would tackle the problem by creating a board within the
Department of Health and Human Services. ''The board could set more
market-oriented rates by looking at what other people are
charging,'' she said.

   ''Somehow we either need to improve reimbursement or figure out

<HEADLINE> OpSail's packed harbor will offer glimpse of an earlier NYC  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The flotilla of ships that will jam New York
Harbor on Independence Day is meant as a nautical kickoff for the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with a little imagination, the celebration will
also offer a vivid reminder of an earlier era, when shipping was
the world's lifeblood and New York its favorite port.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 70,000 vessels are expected to join the weeklong
maritime festival, including more than 180 wind-powered ''tall
ships,'' modern warships and private yachts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you squint your eyes and look just so, it will be what it
(once) was,'' said Peter Neill, president of the South Street
Seaport Museum in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While New York is still the nation's commercial center, shipping
has long since ceded its place as the bridge connecting the city to
the world. Airplanes, highways and the Internet now play the role
that frigates and clippers once did.
</P>
<P>
   But a century and a half ago, access to the waterways made New
York's fortune. An advantageous location and perfect natural harbor
made it the place where America met the world to trade goods, ideas
and information.
</P>
<P>
   Ships, Neill said, ''literally lined the length of the East
River, and then the Hudson River as far as the eye could see. ...
Where the ships were, that's where the action took place.''
</P>
<P>
   With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, New York's role
as a mercantile center was cemented. It became a hub for the
exchange of textiles and other manufactured goods from newly
industrialized Europe, tea from China, grain from the Midwest, and
cotton and tobacco from the slave-holding South.
</P>
<P>
   On a single day in 1836, 921 vessels jammed the East River docks
and another 320 floated up the Hudson, according to ''New York: An
Illustrated History,'' by Ric Burns, James Sanders and Lisa Ades.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, shipping volume had tripled and the
vessels coming to New York from 150 foreign ports delivered half of
all American imports and departed with a third of the nation's
exports.
</P>
<P>
   The California Gold Rush fueled growth further, stuffing the
wallets of wealthy merchants and shipbuilders and forcing crews to
fight for dock space.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiersman Davy Crockett was shocked by the sheer volume of it
all when he visited in the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of ships beat me all hollow, and looked for all the
world like a big clearing in the West with the dead trees all
standing,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping made the city's fortune and shaped its character,
bringing culture, news, ideas, lucre and immigrants - both willing
and enslaved.
</P>
<P>
   On South Street, the heart of the port district, ships' booms
reached over the road and nearly touched buildings on the other
side. Sailmakers' shops sat next to sailors' brothels, bars and
boarding houses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the purveyors of rum, rope and sailcloth have been
replaced by modern-day merchants at the South Street Seaport, a
mall-by-the-water that draws throngs of tourists and lunching
workers from the nearby financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale chain shops like Godiva Chocolatier, Ann Taylor and
Coach leathers now sit where sea captains once took shelter from
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The Seaport will recapture a hint of its ocean-going heyday
during OpSail 2000, when it showcases some of the most impressive
of the parading tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes just a glance out at the water to show anyone who
cares to look what won New York its place in the world - a vast,
protected harbor that still draws ships and barges from every
continent.
</P>
<P>
   And Neill says that although the trappings of the Seaport have
changed over the decades, its essence isn't really so different
from what it was in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Commerce always took place here,'' he said. ''Fashion and
gifts and goods were always being sold.''
</P>
<P>
   And overhead, the sleek glass skyscrapers are a reminder that
business and bustle - different today than in the seagoing era, but
with the same bottom line - remain the city's lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   ''A place where trade and immigration come together is a
tremendous formula for invention,'' the historian said. ''That's
what the city did and that's what it's doing. And that's what it's
going to continue to do.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Court Sentences 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A Lebanese military court sentenced 14
people Saturday to prison terms ranging from three weeks to more
than seven years for collaborating with Israel during its 22-year
occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An official bulletin posted outside the court said Ziyad Fouad
Ghayyad received the severest sentence -- seven and a half years --
in the hearings that ended late Friday. Ghayyad was convicted of
not only collaborating but also of recruiting his brother, a
Lebanese army corporal, to work for Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The court postponed the sentencing of another 30 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The accused were the 10th batch of alleged collaborators that
the court has tried since Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon on
May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2,200 fighters or ex-members of the 2,500-strong
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were captured or surrendered to
the Lebanese authorities after Israel's withdrawal. Others -- many
of them high-ranking militia officials -- fled to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon regards itself as at war with Israel and former SLA
members are considered collaborators. Most of those sentenced so
far have received one-year prison terms, but some got 15-year
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lebanese joined the SLA voluntarily. Others served to earn
a living in the economically depressed border zone or were
recruited under threat of imprisonment or expulsion of their
families.

<HEADLINE> France Takes Over EU Presidency  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH SEWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Seaside summits in swank resorts are the main stage
for France's six-month presidency of the European Union, but its
hopes for a no-waves term are being swept away by a deepening
debate over the union's political future.
</P>
<P>
   The union of 15 European nations has a rotating presidency, and
France took over Saturday, replacing Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   French leaders have said they want to focus on institutional
reforms during the country's term -- hardly headline-grabbing
issues, but vital if the EU is to be able to function once it
expands to as many as 30 members within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's
daring proposal for EU nations to go beyond tinkering with current
institutions: He suggested the creation of a European federal
government with a constitution. The idea has unsettled Europe's
political elite and France's plan for a no-nonsense presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will probably have the busiest presidency in the last ten
years or so and ... the biggest stakes,'' Pierre Moscovici, the
French minister for European affairs, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's lengthy summer holidays kicked off Saturday, so serious
work will not begin until early September. That leaves French
leaders less than four months to complete a hefty agenda.
</P>
<P>
   One area of focus will be institutional reform. Without changes
to streamline operations, the EU runs the risk that its
decision-making process would be paralyzed when it nearly doubles
in size.
</P>
<P>
   One measure under consideration would scrap the current
arrangement under which EU decisions have to be unanimous and
instead use a majority vote on all but the most vital issues.
Another proposal would change the ways seats are allocated on the
influential 20-member EU commission, the union's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   France wants to make sure Europe's big countries continue to
have a major say in EU affairs. It wants to restrict the use of the
veto, where one country can block an issue favored by the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of French leaders is to have those primary
institutional reforms wrapped up by the EU summit in Nice in
December.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of other issues linger: Fischer's bold speech
in May, growing unhappiness among EU applicants over the way
enlargement is being handled, the debate about whether to keep EU
sanctions against Austria for allowing a right-wing party into
government. Such items threaten to saddle the French with just what
they wanted to avoid -- controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In what he called a ''personal vision'' of the future of Europe,
Fischer said he wanted to see the formation of a ''center of
gravity,'' a kind of core group of nations that would agree to give
the EU stronger political powers.
</P>
<P>
   The speech triggered powerful -- and contradictory -- reactions in
France. Some vehemently opposed it, but it found an ally in French
President Jacques Chirac, a conservative and one-time Euroskeptic
who only recently has endorsed stronger political ties for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Berlin this week, Chirac took up Fischer's themes
and proposed creating a ''pioneer group'' to forge closer political
ties among participating nations.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ''two-speed Europe,'' however, is viewed
skeptically by Britain, Ireland and Scandinavian nations. Other
smaller EU nations also worry they would be dominated by the larger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   France, meanwhile, just wants to make sure such questions don't
block more incremental progress.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio interview Friday, Moscovici warned other European
nations not ''to compromise'' the French presidency ''by
overloading the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not add debates ... that we can't deal with,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Liberal Professor Arrested in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A prosecutor has ordered a well-known
liberal sociologist who holds dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship
detained for 15 days, accusing him of working to harm Egypt's
image, the man's lawyer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, professor of sociology at the American
University in Cairo, will be questioned until authorities decide if
they have enough evidence to indict him, said his lawyer, Hafez abu
Saada. The charges authorities have mentioned carry long prison
sentences, abu Saada said.
</P>
<P>
   While Egyptian authorities often detain rights activists, it is
rare that an academic of Ibrahim's standing is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by mobile telephone from the state security
prosecutor's office in Cairo where he was being held, Ibrahim said
security police detained him and three assistants Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have charged him with preparing a documentary about
elections that harms Egypt's image, receiving foreign funds without
government permission and forging an election ballot, Ibrahim said.
He said the ballot was a dummy made expressly for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the price of freedom and working for the benefit of
the public that we have to pay,'' he said. ''May all of you pray
for me in this predicament.''
</P>
<P>
   The call was abruptly terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada said prosecutors claim that Ibrahim's documentary
accuses the government of rigging previous elections. He said
police have seized a computer and documents from Ibrahim's house
and office.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken champion of human rights, Ibrahim runs the Ibn
Khaldoun Center, a Cairo think tank, and is often interviewed and
quoted by foreign journalists. He has long criticized Arab
governments for their lack of democracy and discrimination against
minorities. In Egypt, he has spoken for greater opportunities for
Coptic Christians, who comprise about 10 percent of the population
of 64 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government denies any discrimination against the
Copts, saying all Egyptians are treated equally.
</P>
<P>
   Yussef Sidhom, the editor of the Coptic weekly Watani, said he
was amazed to hear of the detention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing the man closely, I do not expect anything he would
have done to have harmed national security,'' Sidhom said. He said
the Ibn Khaldoun Center had acknowledged receiving funds from
abroad, adding: ''They have their own auditors and everything is
published.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who received his doctorate from the University of
Washington, is the author of several books, including ''Sects,
Orders and Ethnicities in the Arab World.'' He is a member of the
board of directors of the Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, a government-funded think tank.

<HEADLINE> Former Brazil Congressman Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A judge has sentenced a former
congressman already convicted of murder and financial crimes to 14
years in prison for distributing drugs in exchange for votes, media
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hildebrando Pascoal, a former colonel in the Acre state police,
was sentenced Friday by Judge Regina Longuini in Rio Branco, 1,900
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro, Estado news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   While running for Congress in 1998, Pascoal distributed an
unspecified amount of illegal drugs to residents in the Acre state
who vowed to vote for him, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, another judge found Pascoal guilty in
the murders of a police officer and a firefighter killed in 1997.
It was unclear what his sentence was then. But in March, the same
judge sentenced Pascoal to more than six years in prison for tax
fraud and other financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pascoal, who has been in jail since September, was expelled from
Congress and stripped of his parliamentary immunity after witnesses
testified that he led death squads and a drug trafficking ring in
Acre, which shares a remote jungle border with Bolivia and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   He still faces additional charges that include kidnapping and
international drug trafficking, court officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 other active and former police officers, hired
gunmen and former subordinates of Pascoal were arrested last year
and await trial.

<HEADLINE> 8 Dead in Denmark Pearl Jam Concert  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSKILDE, Denmark (AP) -- The Pearl Jam concert was raging along
as 50,000 young fans danced and sang -- ''things were really
great,'' one concertgoer said.
</P>
<P>
   But then fans caught up in the enthusiasm began pushing forward,
leaving some up front screaming and climbing on top of each other
to get air. By the time Friday night's crush at the Roskilde
festival subsided, eight fans were trampled to death and 25 more
injured.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, only hours later, the main stage here was starkly
silent as knots of concertgoers gazed at flowers covering the muddy
ground where their fellow fans died.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is so painful. I think we are all waiting for someone to
wake us and say it was just a horrible nightmare,'' Pearl Jam said
in a statement. ''There are absolutely no words to express our
anguish in regard to the parents and loved ones of those precious
lives that were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular Seattle-based band canceled its July 2 and July 3
concerts, according to its official Web site. The shows had been
scheduled for Werchter, Belgium and Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy began at about midnight Friday in this town 25 miles
west of Copenhagen. As Pearl Jam played, fans began pushing forward
to get closer to the action.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were laughing while pushing each other around,'' said
Colleen Gould, 26, of Australia. ''I just wanted to try and get a
photo. Then I got caught in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of Pearl Jam shouted to the crowd of about 50,000 to
move back, and halted the performance when that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''People didn't understand,'' said Gould, who escaped the
tightening pack by swinging her elbows. ''They thought they were
cheering up the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The grounds at the annual festival, which this year attracted
about 100,000 fans, were muddy from an all-day rain. The victims,
all men, slipped or fell in front of the stage and were trampled to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Victims included a 23-year-old Dutch man; a 26-year-old German;
three Swedes aged 20, 21 and 22; and three Danes, two of whom were
17 and 22, respectively. Police withheld other identification
details pending notification of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you were down in the mud you couldn't get up. It was
impossible,'' said Thomas Daun, 18, of Sweden, who was up front
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Daun stood with his friends in the silent crowd
before the cordoned-off scene that was littered with plastic cups,
paper and bottles. As afternoon turned to evening under heavy
clouds and a gray sky, the Protestant bishop of Roskilde, Jan
Lindhardt, prayed and led a commemorative moment of silence at the
stage. The ceremony was broadcast live by Danish public radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a terrible and tragic accident,'' Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen said in an earlier televised interview. ''It is
very difficult to put words on the fact that so many young people
have lost their lives in such sinister circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   First held in 1971, Roskilde was inspired by the 1969 Woodstock
Festival in upstate New York. The event, which in recent years has
appeared on MTV, attracts visitors from most of northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Roskilde' performing stages are barriers intended to
prevent spectators up front from being pressed by those behind.
Dozens of security staff also were positioned to help squeezed
spectators escape, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Roskilde Festival (organizers) always have said that they
wanted it to be the safest festival, and that is very visible,''
said Carsten Iversen, who has supervised concert security in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 30th edition of the festival continued Saturday
on the festival's other stages. Event spokesman Leif Skov said it
went on because ''life is stronger than death.''
</P>
<P>
   But British bands Oasis and the Pet Shop Boys pulled out of
their scheduled Saturday night appearances. ''Oasis and Pet Shop
Boys felt that out of respect for those who have died and their
families, it is inappropriate to go ahead with tonight's
performances,'' the two groups said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The festival spirit has gone,'' said Edwin Walter, 16, of
Sweden. ''We'll stay because going home would mean turning our back
to what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's tragedy was the latest trampling at a concert. Last
year, 52 people were killed after a rock concert in Minsk, Belarus,
when a hailstorm hit and hundreds of fans rushed for a nearby
subway station. In 1979, 11 people were trampled to death in
Cincinnati, Ohio as they rushed for choice seats before the start
of a concert by the British rock band The Who.

<HEADLINE> Moynihan Puts Farm Up for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, N.Y. (AP) -- The rural homestead where U.S. Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan and his family lived for 36 years is on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat's giving up the Senate and I'm giving up the farm,'' his
wife, Elizabeth Moynihan, told The Associated Press on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The home, where Hillary Rodham Clinton symbolically began her
run to replace him, is being offered for $1.1 million. It is
comprised of two Greek Revival houses, two barns, the schoolhouse,
ponds, stream and 8,000 feet of road frontage on 500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth cited age in what she said was her quick decision to
sell the home located in the hamlet of Pindar's Corners, about 57
miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone I know who is over 70 like me is trying to simplify
their life,'' she said. She is two months away from 71. Her three
children are in their 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have arthritis in the knees and I can't garden six hours a
day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 73, finishes his fourth and final six-year term at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also has a condominium with what Elizabeth called ''a
wonderful view of Pennsylvania Avenue'' in Washington, D.C.

</P>
<P>
   And he gives it right back, just like his character in the new

<P>
   ''It was the right role for me to be doing because it shows

</P>
<P>
   ''With Flipmode Squad, we obligate ourselves to each other,''
the rapper said. ''We can't do shows if everybody don't show up; we

for the first time since 1997 -- for Prince William's birthday.

   ''Look, I'm doing pretty well, considering. You know, in the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Campaign Legislation  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation Saturday
to close a loophole that permitted unlimited secret contributions
to groups trying to exert anonymous influence over the nation's
political and policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The law ''will help clean up the system by forcing organizations
to come clean about their donors,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the White House's South Lawn, Clinton welcomed the
disclosure law as the first new restriction on political money in
20 years. Congress should move quickly to use it as a building
block for comprehensive campaign-finance reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Clinton said, private-interest organizations, such as
pharmaceutical companies out to influence the debate over a
prescription drug benefit for older Americans, could simply tap a
reservoir of anonymous donors to ''pour millions of dollars into
these efforts while keeping citizens in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The law addressed an increasingly popular provision of the U.S.
Tax Code known as Section 527, which permitted tax-exempt groups to
use hidden, undisclosed donors to pay for advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Giving an example, Clinton said an organization called Citizens
for Better Medicare ''has flooded the airwaves with negative ads''
against an administration effort to provide a Medicare prescription
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The group spent tens of millions of dollars in what he called
misleading advertising, ''all to the benefit of drug companies,''
Clinton asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people have no earthly idea who Citizens for
Better Medicare is, who is paying for the ads,'' he said. ''The
bill I just signed lifts the curtain. It makes groups like this
reveal the sources of all future funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers of Citizens for Better Medicare did not immediately
return a telephone call to their Washington office. The
organization has described itself as ''a broad-based, bipartisan
group'' that represents people and companies ''concerned with the
health of Americans and our Medicare system.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said in a separate statement that a
representative of the Citizens for Better Medicare has acknowledged
that a majority of their funding comes from the pharmaceutical
industry. The statement cited reports that the group used its
Section 527 status ''to dedicate $65 million for television, radio
and newspaper ads designed to lobby Congress and manipulate public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ''the damage may already have been done. ... The
attack ads are already on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking what he called the spirit of the new law, he asked
Citizens for Better Medicare ''to respect the legislation, open
their books and disclose the sources of the funds which have paid
for these ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the new law is a step forward, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me say, this is a good day, and this is a good law, and I
thank everyone for voting for it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House contended that some Political Action Committees,
or PACs, whose money normally is regulated, have claimed immunity
from disclosure under Section 527.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation requires Section 527 groups to notify the
Internal Revenue Service of their existence within 24 hours of
their formation. Groups raising at least $25,000 a year would
report contributions of $200 or more and spending of $500 or more.
Reports would be due four times a year, plus immediately before an
election. They should be available before voting this November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial opposition from Republican leaders, the
legislation was approved by huge majorities in each chamber of
Congress. It passed the Senate Thursday by a vote of 92-6.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign reform advocates say there are still ways to avoid
disclosure. For example, groups affected by the law may reorganize
themselves under the tax code.

<HEADLINE> Farmers report good growing season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A year after a crippling drought destroyed
corn crops across the Garden State, area farmers are reporting a
strong growing season.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 months from August 1998 through July 1999 were the
fifth-driest, one-year stretch of the century. As a result, last
summer farmers were stuck with shrunken rows of corn that never
matured.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, ample rain and stretches of hot weather
should help farmers rebound, the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill
reported for Saturday's editions. Many farmers began picking their
sweet corn last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just about right,'' John Hunter, 52, said as he surveyed his
family's corn crops in Cinnaminson Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of Hunters work the fields these days, many
picking the sweet corn by hand. While the family also has tractors
to help with picking, 80-year-old Russell Hunter said the machines
often damage the ears, reducing their appeal to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The family has been planting sweet corn since April - 20 to 40
rows at a time - so it will have plenty of fresh corn for its
roadside stand.
</P>
<P>
   Corn ranks third statewide among vegetable crops in terms of
farmers' revenues. New Jersey grows about 10,600 acres of sweet
corn, with Salem and Burlington counties producing the most.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey farmers usually grow a kind of sweet corn called
''sugar-extended,'' which is sweeter and lasts slightly longer
after picking than the once-dominant silver queen variety, said Ray
Samulis, a Burlington County agricultural agent.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers prefer the taste of ''sugar extended'' over ''super
sweet,'' which lasts four or five days after picking but has a
tougher skin and less ''corn'' flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be you pretty much had to eat sweet corn the day it
was picked for it to be really good,'' Samulis said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of the country, which favors yellow corn, most
of the sweet corn grown in New Jersey is white.
</P>
<P>
   Samulis said he can't explain the preference, but thinks a
warming effect from the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware River helps
produce great sweet corn.

<HEADLINE> Evacuation Set for Penguin Colony  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- The world's largest colony of
African penguins will be evacuated from an island off South
Africa's west coast to save the birds from an oil spill,
conservation officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Between 3,000 and 6,000 penguins are to be evacuated Sunday,
said Onkgopotse Thabane, spokesman for the environmental affairs
department. In the largest operation of its kind, the birds will be
rounded up from a nature reserve on Dassen Island, placed in
ventilated boxes, shipped to the mainland and trucked about 560
miles down the coast, where they will be released.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins are expected to swim home in about 11 days.
Authorities hope that will be enough time to clean up the spill
from the Panamanian-registered tanker Treasure, which sank near
Cape Town on June 23 while carrying 1,300 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation officials and volunteers are also struggling to
feed and clean some 11,000 oily penguins captured on Robben Island,
four miles off Cape Town's coast, which was badly hit by the slick.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had hoped that a change in wind direction Friday
would mean the evacuation of the Dassen Island birds could be
avoided: Oil spilled from the Treasure was moving away from island,
home to about 55,000 African penguins.
</P>
<P>
   But more oil appeared to have leaked from the wreck overnight.
And oil still covered the birds' feeding waters near the island,
located about 35 miles northwest of Cape Town, conservation
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evacuation is set to go ahead. The latest reports show a
36-square-kilometer (22-square-mile) patch of oil between the wreck
of the Treasure and Dassen Island,'' said Aletta Jordaan,
spokeswoman for Western Cape Nature Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation effort will take several days, and it's unclear
how many of the island's birds can be rescued. Most of the chicks
and unhatched eggs are likely to be lost, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for an evacuation have been underway since Friday,
with volunteers fencing off three bays to prevent the penguins from
going into the sea to fish.
</P>
<P>
   The International Fund for Animal Welfare has mobilized a team
of bird experts to help manage the disaster, and has paid more than
$50,000 for bird rehabilitation, said Sarah Scarth, director of the
fund's emergency relief program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a catastrophe -- it's like handling a refugee
situation,'' she said. ''This operation is going to go on for at
least two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a bird has been cleaned, it needs to be cared for in a
rehabilitation center for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   The oil slick has made its way onto three of Cape Town's most
popular beaches and several others were at risk, the South African
Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement Saturday. Cleaning of
the beaches was underway.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch experts were helping to salvage oil remaining in the
sunken ship's fuel tanks.

<HEADLINE> Man guilty of lesser in Montclair rape trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - A Newark man on Friday was acquitted of
serious sexual assault charges in a 1998 attack on a 15-year-old
girl at the Montclair State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   A jury instead convicted Antwain Curry of having sex with an
underage girl and of endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, 22, had been charged with aggravated sexual assault in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was among three men who followed the girl into the woods
the night of Sept. 19. The girl had been drinking alcohol and had
been smoking marijuana. Authorities said she bet the men she could
finish two bottles of alcohol and still walk around the campus
athletic track.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony during the trial indicated that in the woods, the girl
passed out, two of the men fondled her and Curry undressed her and
had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who is being held in Passaic County Jail, will be
sentenced Oct. 6. Each of the charges carry possible prison terms
of five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Had Curry been found guilty of the sexual assault charge, he
would have faced a possible 20-year-term.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Chief Assistant Prosecutor Joseph Del Russo
said jurors may have gotten the impression the girl was willing to
have sex with the men because of testimony that said she had been
flirting with them.
</P>
<P>
   Under plea deals, two people testified against Curry in the
trial. Joseph Koehler, 24, of Newark, a co-defendant, received a
four-year prison term in exchange for his testimony. The other man
in the woods that night, John Carmelo, who hosted the party,
received a no-jail term for serving alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Another man is awaiting trial in the assault. Sam Damato, 23, of
Lyndhurst, is charged with trying to force the girl to perform oral
sex that night. Damato also could face charges of rape after a
witness said he saw Damato have sex with the girl. Damato's
attorney has denied those charges.

<HEADLINE> Fla. MD Charged With Manslaughter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACE, Fla. (AP) -- A doctor has been charged with manslaughter
after he allegedly over-prescribed powerful narcotics to numerous
patients, including four who died.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James F. Graves, a family practitioner who specializes in
pain management, also was charged with racketeering and
drug-trafficking for allegedly providing thousands of pills to
known drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs he allegedly overprescribed included Oxycontin, a
synthetic morphine, Lortab, a painkiller, and Xanax, a
tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Graves surrendered Friday, hours after a grand jury issued its
indictment. He was being held Saturday at the Santa Rosa County
jail in lieu of $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentences he faces are 30 years for racketeering, 30
years each for three counts of trafficking and 15 years on each of
the four counts of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stewart, Graves' attorney, called the charges ''a bunch of
nonsense'' and said prosecutors are abusing their power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every doctor and every patient of every doctor needs to follow
this case,'' Stewart said. ''The State Attorney's Office does not
have the power to even discipline a doctor for giving out too much
aspirin. For them to proceed as they have is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves is charged with manslaughter for the 1999 deaths of Anne
Carroll, Jeffrey Daniels and Gwen Carpenter and the March death of
Howard Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they interviewed pharmacists and pharmacy
technicians who said they refused to fill Graves' prescriptions
because they were excessive in amount and frequency.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate 'Census Takers'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Police Chief William Finney has ordered
an investigation into the actions of two police officers who posed
as census takers during an undercover drug operations, a move that
angered officials at the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   A civilian review board will also look into the matter,
department spokesman Michael Jordan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police working undercover often pose as people other than law
enforcement officers to protect themselves, Jordan said, adding:
''If you're a drug dealer, and you know I am a police officer,
would you sell me any?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the officers, whose named have not been released, only
introduced themselves as census workers to protect a complainant in
an undercover investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Census Bureau officials said the officers' actions
jeopardized the credibility of census takers and possibly their
safety as well. Bureau officials said they are reviewing laws that
might address the deceptive portrayal of a census worker.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the International Federation of Journalists aired
similar concerns, criticizing police in Luxembourg for posing as a
television crew to lure a gunman into an ambush to end a hostage
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Midwesterners Unfazed by Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By TAMMY WEBBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for the
holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to
suspend their gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation
into possible price gouging -- continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Fourth of July weekend. What are you going to do --
stay home? Plans are all on,'' said Tom Woody of Madison, Wisc., as
he filled up his tank en route to a paddling trip in southern
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois pump prices took a big dip Saturday -- with Chicago
prices falling below $2 a gallon for the first time since Memorial
Day -- as station owners began passing along savings created by
lifting the state's 5 percent sales tax on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in one north-side Chicago neighborhood fell to $1.99 per
gallon Saturday, down 10 cents to 16 cents per gallon since
Thursday. Prices were even lower in the suburbs and downstate,
where the price of regular unleaded dropped 10 cents to $1.85 per
gallon at a Citgo station in Wheaton and fell 11 cents, to $1.66
per gallon, at the Meijer gas station in Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois legislators voted overwhelmingly last week to suspend
the sales tax for six months to appease voters angry over the rapid
rise in pump prices. Gov. George Ryan admonished station owners to
pass the savings on to customers. Indiana's governor also suspended
his state's gas tax for 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there was overwhelming support between major oil
companies and independent marketers to pass this break on to the
consumer,'' said Paul Torstrick, a member of the Illinois Petroleum
Marketers Association board of directors and vice president of Gas
City.
</P>
<P>
   AAA Chicago Motor Club spokeswoman Norma Cooper said Saturday
that, even without the sales tax rollback, the number of Illinois
residents traveling more than 100 miles over the July Fourth
holiday was expected to be up slightly over last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have probably already made plans and I don't think 8
cents difference would make a difference one way or another; we
expected near record travel anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin authorities said traffic volumes appeared normal for
the July Fourth weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts and campgrounds throughout Michigan reported brisk
business Saturday -- with scarce evidence that high gas prices
discouraged any would-be travelers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wandering Wheels Campground in Munising in Michigan's
Upper Peninsula, three reservations were scrapped by travelers who
said they couldn't afford gas prices. But the vacancies at the
campground near Lake Superior were quickly filled by other
travelers, owner Dennis Bragg said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oak Cove Resort in the southwest Michigan community of
Lawrence, owner Bob Wojcik has had no cancellations. His bookings
records show guests from Florida, Chicago, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never worried about gas prices a bit,'' said Wojcik, whose
resort's 13 cottages and seven-room lodge were booked well in
advance of the holiday. ''All of the people here this week are just
having a great time.''

<HEADLINE> Ten Iran Jews Convicted of Spying  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- Ending a months-long, closed trial, a judge
convicted 10 Iranian Jews of spying for Israel and sentenced them
to prison terms of four to 13 years, drawing condemnation from
Israel and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Jewish defendants were acquitted of the same
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Two Muslim accomplices -- identified for the first time as Ali
Akbar Safaie and Mehrab Yusefi -- were given more lenient jail terms
of only two years each, according to Hossein Ali Amiri, the
provincial judiciary chief. Two other Muslims were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the 13 Jews -- who arrived at the courthouse in
Shiraz on foot because of the Jewish Sabbath -- howled in anguish
when the sentences became known. One family member fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of these verdicts and sentences are final and all can be
appealed,'' said Esmail Naseri, the defense lawyer. ''We are
relieved that there were no death sentences. I urge family members
of the defendants to remain calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Motamed, the single Jewish representative in Iran's
290-seat parliament, said the verdicts and sentences ''have
seriously affected the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I talked with many of the Jews in Shiraz, I clearly could
see a wave of immigration coming. I'm sorry for this because we are
a religious people who love our country and would like to live
here,'' said Motamed as he met with members of the community at the
main synagogue in Shiraz, 550 miles south of the capital, Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, officials protested the verdicts and sentences and
denied the men ever worked for the Jewish state. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak urged the international community pressure Iran
to release the 10 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran cannot be accepted as a member of the international
community as long as Jewish prisoners are rotting away in prison,
when they have done no wrong,'' Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman
Aviv Shiron said. ''Israel will not rest until all the prisoners
are released.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton said he was deeply concerned by the
convictions and noted that the United States Human Rights
Commission has denounced the judicial process by which the 13
Iranian Jews were tried as ''seriously flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have raised our concerns time and again, when the Iranian
government has treated intellectuals, journalists, Muslim clerics
and members of the Baha'i community with the same fundamental
unfairness,'' Clinton said. ''We are deeply disappointed that the
Iranian government has again failed to act as a society based on
the rule of law, to which the Iranian people aspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the trial a disappointment, the French Foreign Ministry
said the European Union hoped the appeals court would reconsider
the sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The charges on which the defendants were convicted included
''cooperating with a hostile government, membership in an illegal
(spy) ring and recruitment of new agents,'' Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight defendants had confessed and pleaded guilty, four
had pleaded innocent, and one acknowledged passing information but
maintained his action did not constitute espionage. Most of the
accused were from Shiraz, home to 6,000 of Iran's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Dani Tefilin, a shoe salesman, and Asher Zadmehr, a university
language professor, both received 13-year sentences, Naseri said.
Ramin Nematizadeh, a shoe clerk, received the shortest jail term,
Naseri said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other seven, civil servant Nasser Levihaim was sentenced
to 11 years; store clerk Ramin Farzam, 10; shopkeeper Javid
Bent-Yacoub, nine; shopkeeper Farhad Seleh, eight; religion teacher
Shahrokh Paknahad, eight; religion teacher Farzad Kashi, eight; and
Faramarz Kashi, five.
</P>
<P>
   Three others -- Tefilin's brother Omid, Navid Balazadeh and
Nejatollah Brukhimnejad -- were acquitted, Naseri said. The three
had been out on bail since February.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted international scrutiny, with critics
questioning whether the accused could be fairly tried in a process
in which there was no jury, in which the judge also acted as
prosecutor, and from which observers were banned.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about fairness increased when state television
broadcast confessions from two of the defendants. Defense lawyers
said they were not given a chance to consult with their clients
before the confessions, which came after months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the result comes as little surprise in a show trial of
this kind. Sadly, guilty verdicts were expected,'' said David A.
Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee,
reached at his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating prison terms for the defendants, Rabbi Marvin Hier,
dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, said Friday
that the Iranian president would face protests on foreign trips as
a result of the trial.

   The trial of the Jews in courts controlled by his conservative
rivals could set back reform-minded Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami's attempts to refashion his country's image.

<P>
   Iranian Jews are generally allowed to practice their religion
freely, but like all Iranians are forbidden any contact with
Israel.

<P>
   At its height, Iran's Jewish community numbered about 100,000
and was still around 80,000 just before Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution. Now there are about 25,000 Jews, the largest community
in the Middle East outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> Walter Matthau, crotchety comic actor, dead at 79  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - Walter Matthau, the foghorn-voiced
movie villain who became a master of crotchety comedy with his
Oscar-winning ''The Fortune Cookie,'' followed by ''The Odd
Couple'' and ''Grumpy Old Men,'' died Saturday of a heart attack.
He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The native New Yorker was pronounced dead at 1:42 a.m. at St.
John's Health Center in Santa Monica, said hospital spokeswoman
Lindi Funston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost someone I loved as a brother, as a closest friend
and a remarkable human being,'' said frequent co-star Jack Lemmon.
''We have also lost one of the best damn actors we'll ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were placed on Matthau's star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Often cast as a would-be con man foiled by life's travails,
Matthau bellowed complaints against his tormentors and moved his
lean, 6-foot-3 frame in surprising ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''Walter walks like a child's windup toy,'' Lemmon once said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's performance as Lemmon's shyster brother-in-law in
''The Fortune Cookie,'' directed by Billy Wilder, won him the
Academy Award as best supporting actor of 1966. He was twice
nominated for best actor: as the cantankerous oldster in ''Kotch,''
1971 (directed by Lemmon); and as the feuding vaudeville partner of
George Burns in ''The Sunshine Boys,'' 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so natural. He was himself, with all the quirks that a
human being has,'' Wilder said Saturday. ''He was guy who made
great friends. Whether you played cards with him or whether you
talked football bets with him, he was a full-blown man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was good in everything he did. Sometimes I messed it up as
a director. But he was absolutely perfect, always,'' Wilder added.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Odd Couple'' provided the role that established Matthau's
stardom. In 1965 he appeared in New York as the slobby sportswriter
Oscar Madison in Neil Simon's play. Art Carney was the fastidious
photographer, Felix Unger, who shared an apartment with Madison
after both had been divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau repeated the role in the 1968 film, with Lemmon as
Felix. They reprised their roles 30 years later in the 1998 film
''Odd Couple II.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every actor looks all his life for a part that will combine
his talents with his personality,'' Matthau told Time magazine in
1971. '''The Odd Couple' was mine. That was the plutonium I needed.
It all started happening after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau had survived several serious health setbacks, including
an earlier heart attack, but he was growing increasingly sick and
his ability to bounce back was diminishing and longtime agent
Leonard Hirshan said his death was sobering but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have absolutely nothing to say but deep sadness about
leaving a friend (who was) more than a client,'' Hirshan said.
''It's a shame. He's just a terrific man.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor could be as whimsically eccentric in interviews as he
was on the screen. Reporters had to exercise caution in separating
fact from his flights of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to a form for Current Biography, he reported that
his father had been an Eastern Orthodox priest in czarist Russia
who ran afoul with church authorities by preaching the
infallibility of the pope. His father was actually a peddler from
Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my defense mechanism against pompous and ludicrous
questions,'' Matthau explained. When he filled out his Social
Security form in 1937, he listed his middle name as Foghorn. He
never corrected it.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Walter Matuchanskayasky on Oct. 1, 1920, in New York
City to impoverished Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father left
home when Walter was 3. Walter and his older brother, Henry, lived
with their mother, a garment worker, in a series of cold water
flats on the lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   He was already 6 feet tall at age 10 and weighed 90 pounds.
''When I drank cherry soda, I looked like a thermometer,'' he once
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, when he served in the Army Air Corps, he
returned home a sergeant with six battle stars and a fistful of
money from poker winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Legends of his gambling followed him throughout his life. While
making a TV series in Florida before his movie stardom, he lost
$183,000 betting on spring-training baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   In middle age he estimated his lifetime gambling losses at $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   After studying in the dramatic workshop at New York's New School
- where fellow students included Gene Saks, Rod Steiger, Harry
Guardino and Tony Curtis - his first Broadway role came at the age
of 28 when he was hired as understudy for the role of an
83-year-old English bishop in ''Anne of the Thousand Days,''
starring Rex Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   When the aged English actor playing the role became ill, Matthau
went onstage without a rehearsal. He liked to tell how the
surprised Harrison looked at him and uttered an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   His first film, ''The Kentuckian,'' starring and directed by
Burt Lancaster in 1955, cast him as a villain, and more heavy roles
followed, including ''Charade,'' starring Cary Grant and Audrey
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Odd Couple'' and ''The Fortune Cookie'' elevated Matthau
to stardom, and he enjoyed a wide variety of roles for more than 30
years. He appeared in action thrillers such as ''The Taking of
Pelham One Two Three.'' He even did a musical, ''Hello Dolly!''
costarring with Barbra Streisand, with whom he publicly feuded.
</P>
<P>
   He was always identified with comedy, something that rankled
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people come up to me and say, 'Aren't you that comedian
who's in the movies?' I want to throw up,'' he once complained. ''I
throw up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was often teamed with Lemmon, always as adversaries
though they were best friends off screen. Their films included:
''The Front Page,'' ''Buddy Buddy,'' ''Grumpier Old Men,'' ''Out to
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   He was most recently on screen with Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and
Lisa Kudrow in ''Hanging Up,'' released in February.
</P>
<P>
   The actor had survived several serious health setbacks. While
making ''The Fortune Cookie'' in 1966, he suffered a serious heart
attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and
constant worry about gambling and told him to give up both. Matthau
stopped smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in
freezing Minnesota weather for ''Grumpy Old Men'' in 1993, he was
hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995 he had a colon
tumor removed; it tested benign. He was hospitalized in May 1999
after another bout with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau attributed his various illnesses to his eating habits:
''If you eat only celery and lettuce, you won't get sick .... I
like celery and lettuce, but I like it with pickles, relish, corned
beef, potatoes, peas. And I like Eskimo Pies, vanilla ice cream
with chocolate covering.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was married to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 until
their divorce in 1958. They had two children, David and Jenny. He
married Carol Marcus in 1959, and they had one son, Charles, who
became a filmmaker and directed his father in ''The Grass Harp'' in
1995.

<HEADLINE> State to move 25 sex offenders to Trenton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - About 25 sex offenders from Greystone Park
Psychiatric Hospital will be transferred to a center here, a move
in response to years of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Space has been set aside for 50 beds in a new wing at the Anne
Klein Forensic Center, said Laurie Facciarossa, a spokeswoman for
the state Department of Human Services. Facciarossa said the move
is an attempt to reduce the population at the troubled Greystone
facility, where 600 patients are housed.
</P>
<P>
   State officials in the past have placed at Greystone sex
offenders who have maxed out their jail terms but are still
considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   That policy has long angered people who live near the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Morris County officials have said because the
hospital doesn't have security as would a prison, people can
escape, creating danger to public. One sex offender escaped from
Greystone in October and another was charged with raping a male
patient at the hospital in January.
</P>
<P>
   Human Services Commissioner Michele Guhl in March promised
Morris County freeholders that the sex offenders would be moved.
She also said she would uphold an administrative order barring sex
offenders registered under Megan's Law from being kept at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the transfers should begin July 17.
Patients from Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Camden and other
hospitals also may be sent to the center in the future, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Prison Guards To Be Armed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. (AP) -- Guards who stood by helplessly last month as
a helicopter plucked a sex offender from a state facility during a
daring escape will now be armed.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators released a report Friday that concluded the
removal of razor wire from an interior fence, inadequate staff
supervision and unarmed perimeter guards at the Martin Treatment
Center made possible the June 5 midday escape of sex offender
Steven Whitsett.
</P>
<P>
   One employee reportedly was supervising 40 sexual predators on
the recreation yard at the time of the escape, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsett, 28, scaled the fence and ran to the helicopter piloted
by his longtime friend, Clifford Burkhart, 23, he later told
officials. The helicopter crash landed about 100 yards from the
center and both men were captured the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Guns will not necessarily prevent future escapes, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guards will be given side arms to use only for
self-defense,'' said Greg Venz, director of the state's sexually
violent predator program, which confines sex offenders after their
prison terms expire. ''They will not be allowed to use lethal force
to stop an escape.''

<HEADLINE> DOE: Preparation Helped Battle Fire  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA ASHTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Preparation was crucial to the battle
against the fire that raced across the Hanford nuclear reservation,
storage site for some of the most lethal wastes on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation releases and the spread of hazardous contamination are
big risks, but the Department of Energy has been exhaustive in
getting ready for possible emergencies on the 560-square-mile site,
established during World War II to make plutonium for the atomic
bomb, said Larry Olguin, site emergency director.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not want to ever try to downplay the significance of
the danger of a range fire,'' he said. ''But the fact that it
burned over 190,000 acres and no known radiation releases occurred
didn't happen by chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The blaze, started Tuesday by a fatal highway accident,
destroyed 20 homes and scores of other buildings. At its peak late
Wednesday, about 7,000 people were evacuated. One man suffered
serious burns and more than a dozen people were treated for smoke
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire was essentially out Saturday. All firefighters
should be sent home by Sunday, said interagency fire manager Dale
Warriner.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said air samples had not indicated any radiation
releases caused by the blaze. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency was conducting additional tests during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Olguin said the emergency preparations allowed crews to move
safely into sensitive areas to provide spot fire protection where
needed. Many sites at the complex had previously been cleared of
vegetation, and roads provided firebreaks.
</P>
<P>
   Hanford's most lethal wastes are stored six feet underground in
177 giant tanks that were kept safe from the flames. Other
radioactive waste produced over more than four decades was poured
into the ground or stored in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   People around Hanford are keenly aware of the threat posed by
those tanks filled with 54 million gallons of highly radioactive
sludge.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of a scary thing,'' said Greg Alley of Richland,
who works at Siemens Power Corp., which fabricates commercial
nuclear fuel. ''The fire getting into those areas, that's a fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind-driven fire, moving as fast as 20 miles in 90 minutes,
pushed dangerously close to the tank farms in some areas, though
the DOE could not say Saturday just how close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very concerned, and we were at an extremely high
attention level for the fire, especially Wednesday night,'' Olguin
said. ''Had the wind shifted, it could have been worse.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Youth Call For Tolerance  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Hoping to heal the ethnic wounds that brought
on a government takeover six weeks ago, a group of indigenous
Fijian youths hugged and shook hands with ethnic Indians Saturday
and called for greater tolerance on the South Pacific island
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen Fijians, representing Christian youth groups,
staged a day of fasting and prayer Saturday in a park in the
capital, Suva. The city has watched during the past 43 days as
gunmen took over the nation's ethnic Indian-led government; they
continued Saturday to hold 27 lawmakers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's surround our Indian brothers and sisters with our
Christian love,'' group leader Mika Yasa Mudreilagi said as people
hugged and sobbed. ''Please forgive us for any hurt that we have
caused you.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, gunmen led by former insurance executive George
Speight stormed Parliament and took the government hostage,
including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the first
ethnic Indian to lead Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was accompanied by widespread attacks on Indian homes
and businesses across Fiji, a nation of 320 islands about 2,250
miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   About 44 percent of Fiji's 812,000 people are ethnic Indians
whose ancestors were brought here more than a century ago by
British colonialists seeking indentured laborers to work in the
country's rich sugarcane fields.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel raid and hostage standoff have raised concern in the
international community that Fiji has descended into racism and
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Speight and the military -- which imposed martial
law 10 days after the parliament raid -- broke down this week after
the gunmen refused to sign an accord that would pave the way for
the immediate release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The military then announced that they would appoint an interim
civilian government without input from the hostage-takers, who had
demanded a role in the administration before releasing the
captives.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels' demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indians
have been met, including the firing of Chaudhry and the elimination
of the country's 1997 multiracial constitution.

<HEADLINE> Party Pressure Mounts in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the eve of a tight presidential race,
observers and opposition activists Saturday stepped up accusations
against Mexico's ruling party -- charging it with using the power of
the state to illegally influence voting.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations involved scattered incidents, small amounts of
money or claims of pressure on government employees or aid
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, dismissed most of the reports as misunderstandings or the
result of newspapers' desperation for stories in the three-day
period before the election, when candidates are banned from
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma published what it
said were excerpts of a phone conversation showing Victor Tinoco,
PRI governor of the western state of Michoacan, discussing
''donations'' from the government to party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tinoco told The Associated Press that he hadn't passed on any
state money and said the tape was fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is totally false, and if the newspaper thinks it's real,
let's go to court and I'll defend myself,'' Tinoco said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern state of Sinaloa, opposition activists filmed
alleged government aid workers pressing aid recipients to support
PRI presidential candidate Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Development Secretariat, which runs the anti-poverty
program, said the people shown in the film had not worked for the
government in at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''In rural areas, the inhabitants see someone as a 'government
employee,' and that image sticks with them'' even after they leave
government service, secretariat spokesman Humberto Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, electoral officials in the border state of Sonora
said they requested a criminal investigation after finding one of
the ballots for Sunday's election already had been filled out in
favor of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The observer group Civic Alliance said a disturbingly high
number of volunteer poll officials have been changed in the last
few days before elections, a phenomenon that has been associated
with fraud in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In past elections, critics have accused local PRI workers of
paying poll officials not to show up on election day so they could
be replaced with loyalists who would tolerate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 19 percent of poll officials have been substituted so
far,'' said Hugo Almada of the alliance. ''That's a higher figure
than in past elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Almada also said his group has seen increased pressure on
government employees to vote for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper La Jornada on Saturday quoted employees of the
Foreign Relations Secretariat as saying a supervisor had told them
to press co-workers and family members to vote for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The secretariat had no immediate comment on the accusations.

<HEADLINE> State finds no violations in pool drowning at College of NJ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EWING, N.J. (AP) - State swimming pool regulations were not
violated the night a Princeton Township man was found dead in the
water at the College of New Jersey, according to a state report.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Morris, 48, was found dead in the school's Aquatic
Center on the night of June 7. A student scuba diver found the
corpse. Medical examiners said Morris' death was caused by a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the state Department of Health and Senior Services
said there were no violations of state regulations that may have
contributed to Morris' death, The Times of Trenton reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The report was filed June 9, but state officials later said they
were still investigating the death. Dennis McGowan, spokesman for
the Department of Health and Senior Services, told the newspaper
Friday that the agency was satisfied that no state codes were
violated.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report filed by the school, the lifeguard on duty
did not follow standard procedure, but that did ''not appear to
have contributed'' to Morris' death.
</P>
<P>
   The lone guard on duty when the body was found was not watching
the pool, but was cleaning up the pool area, the report said. Also,
earlier that night, guards did not sit in their stands, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   State regulations on waterfront safety require that lifeguards
''shall not be subject to duties that would distract or intrude
their attention from proper observation of person(s) in the pool
area, or that prevent immediate assistance to person(s) in distress
in the water,'' the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ''lifeguard platforms or stands should be elevated and
located at the water's edge so as to provide a clear unobstructed
view of the pool surface and bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   The state report said lifeguards would not have been able to see
Morris' body under a bulkhead in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' body was found about 9:30 p.m. He had been swimming
during an open session that ended at 9 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Bans Child Death Sentences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan introduced sweeping legal
reforms on Saturday, including changes to a law that allowed
children as young as 14 to be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty now may only be imposed against people 18 or
older, the military-led government decreed. Also, accused children
will not be physically punished, handcuffed, or placed in chains --
except when there is ''reasonable apprehension of the escape of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law also barred physical labor for children while in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children under 18 are in Pakistani prisons,
according to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
More than 2,500 juveniles are imprisoned in the eastern Punjab
province alone. Only 243 were convicted of crimes; the remainder
are awaiting trial, the commission said in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming Pakistan's justice system has been one of the key
pledges of the military government, which seized power in a
bloodless coup Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by human rights groups, the federal government empowered
the provinces to establish special juvenile courts. In the past,
children were tried in adult courts. All old cases involving
children will be transferred to the new juvenile courts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $3M in Botched Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A jury has awarded $3.3 million to a man
whose doctor fused the wrong vertebrae in his neck during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Sean E. O'Reilly had a herniated disk that was supposed to be
replaced by bone from his hip. Instead, a healthy disk below it was
removed, witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for neurosurgeon William O. DeWeese argued O'Reilly
had a congenital disk problem that resulted in his disks being
miscounted, according to O'Reilly's attorney, Steve Yerrid.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surgery was designed to put him right back to work,''
Yerrid said. ''He can never return to what he used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, a 42-year-old former lineman for Tampa Electric Co.,
hasn't worked since the first surgery, Yerrid said. The jury also
Friday awarded $500,000 to O'Reilly's wife for her losses.
</P>
<P>
   University Community Hospital, where the surgery was performed,
was a defendant in the original lawsuit and settled on confidential
terms, Yerrid said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to DeWeese's office were not returned.

Holiday Travel On, Despite Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. ''It's the Fourth of July weekend. What are you going to
do -- stay home? Plans are all on,'' said Tom Woody of Madison, Wisc., as he
filled up his tank en route to a paddling trip in southern Wisconsin. Illinois
pump prices took a big dip today -- with Chicago prices falling below $2 a
gallon for the first time since Memorial Day -- as station owners began passing
along savings created by the state's lifting of a 5 percent sales tax on
gasoline.

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Walter Matthau, an Oscar-winning actor who once
portrayed villains but moved on to become the epitome of a crotchety comedian,
died early today of a heart attack. He was 79. Matthau was pronounced dead at
1:42 a.m. at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, the hospital said. ''I
have lost someone I loved as a brother, as a closest friend and a remarkable

Vermont Gay Couples Joined Legally
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- Vermont's new civil union law took effect
today, and gay couples around the state were legally joined before justices of
the peace and clergy. ''I think it's about time after 27&AMP;frac12; years,'' said
Lois Farnham, her arm around partner Holly Puterbaugh after they got their civil
union license. ''It's nice after all this time to say Holly is my spouse.''
Puterbaugh, 54, and Farnham, 55, were one of three couples who sued in 1997 when
their town clerks refused to issue them marriage licenses. The Vermont Supreme
Court ruled in December they were being unconstitutionally denied the benefits
of marriage. The justices left it up to the Legislature to figure out how to
confer those benefits and lawmakers settled on civil unions, a new legal
structure parallel to marriage but separate.

Clinton's Defense: Just a Normal Guy

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton's privilege to practice law in
his home state may hinge on how well his lawyers make a case for treating the
country's chief executive like anyone else. A committee of the Arkansas Supreme
Court filed suit yesterday seeking Clinton's disbarment, saying he gave
misleading testimony under oath about his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. The lawsuit followed a May 19 vote by the state Supreme
Court Committee on Professional Conduct to strip Clinton of his law license for

   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Preparation was crucial to the battle against the

hazardous contamination are big risks, but the Energy Department has been
exhaustive in getting ready for possible emergencies on the 560-square-mile

Philippoussis Wins Five-Hour Marathon
</SUBHEAD>

   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- When Mark Philippoussis won the longest fifth set
at Wimbledon in the open era, he somehow summoned the strength to raise both
arms in jubilation. The exhausted Australian edged Sjeng Schalken 4-6, 6-3, 6-7
(7) 7-6 (4), 20-18 today. The third-round marathon took five hours, five
minutes. That was seven minutes shy of the open-era record at Wimbledon, set
when Pancho Gonzalez beat Charlie Pasarell 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9 in the
first round in 1969 over two days. The final set between Philippoussis and
Schalken lasted two hours, 15 minutes -- longer than many matches.

<HEADLINE> Police spot break-in while testing new video monitors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State Police testing out a new video
security system got proof that it works, they said, when the
cameras caught a man breaking into the system installer's car.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Covington, 36, of Trenton, was breaking into the car in
the Department of State parking lot Friday afternoon as police
tested the system, said State Police spokesman Sgt. Al Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Security company employees had finished installing the system
just minutes before the break-in and were showing security guards
how the cameras worked when they saw the burglar.
</P>
<P>
   Covington grabbed a laptop computer, a briefcase filled with
computer accessories and a wallet with cash and credit cards, Della
Fave said. He was caught minutes later in a nearby alley and
everything was recovered, he said. Covington faces charges of
burglary and receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   State Police have been asking the state for years for money to
put aerial cameras outside the buildings near the Statehouse.
Before the new system was installed Friday, police had to rely on
foot and vehicle patrols.

<HEADLINE> Glory Days for Mets' Leiter  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They were dancing in the aisles so much at Shea
Stadium on Saturday it seemed like a Springsteen concert -- which is
exactly where Al Leiter was heading.
</P>
<P>
   His 100th career win, a season-high 12 strikeouts and the final
concert of Bruce's tour, all in the same day. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had my Springsteen tickets for about a month,'' Leiter
said after the Mets beat the Braves 9-1. ''When I saw I was down to
pitch, I knew it was going to be a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter came out to the mound for the start of the game to ''10th
Avenue Freeze-out.''
</P>
<P>
   When he batted, the public address system played ''Born to
Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, he went 1-for-3 and did circle the bases to score a run,
allowing one run and six hits in seven innings. He raised his
record to 10-1 and lowered his ERA to 3.04, third in the NL behind
Randy Johnson (1.57) and Kevin Brown (2.31).
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has been to four or five Springsteen shows, starting with
the 1984-85 ''Born in the USA'' tour and attending one with a
couple of Yankees during the 1988 ''Tunnel of Love'' tour. Leiter
said the Boss -- Springsteen, not Steinbrenner -- didn't want to talk
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was more interested in Don Mattingly,'' Leiter recalled
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was all smiles after Saturday's win, which solidified his
chance to make the National League's All-Star pitching staff, which
will be announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't think back to last October, when he started Game 6 of
the NL championship series at Atlanta and gave up five runs without
getting anyone out. While the Mets rallied to take 8-7 and 9-8
leads, they lost 10-9 in 11 innings, ending their season.
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter walked into Shea Stadium on Saturday morning, he was
still on a high from Friday night's 11-8 win, when the Mets rallied
from an 8-1, eighth-inning deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be pretty tough to contain what happened last
night,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't even there to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter left Shea Stadium when the eighth inning began, drove
back to Manhattan and was about to pull into his garage when he
heard Edgardo Alfonzo's game-tying, two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Since Leiter didn't want to lose the radio signal by driving his
car into the underground garage, he waited in his car, on the
corner of 83rd Street and First Avenue and listened to Gary Cohen's
call of Mike Piazza's three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter quickly parked and went upstairs to his apartment to
watch the replays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty up today,'' he said.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Rich Aurilia went 3-for-4, including a
two-run homer, and Kirk Rueter pitched six shutout innings as the
San Francisco Giants defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-1 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez also hit a two-run homer for the Giants, who
snapped a three-game losing streak and beat their archrivals for
the first time at Pacific Bell Park in five tries.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter (6-4) allowed seven hits with two walks and two
strikeouts, and left after throwing 95 pitches. It was his fourth
consecutive victory in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen struck out the side in the ninth for his 13th save in
17 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez (4-4) gave up four runs on nine hits. He hasn't won
since May 20 at Florida, a span of nine starts that includes six
no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had runners on base in every inning. The Giants
turned double plays in each of the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the Giants third, Calvin Murray reached base on a forceout
and was balked to second. Martinez followed with a drive over the
left-field fence for his fifth home run of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia hit his seventh homer of the season in the fourth on a
3-2 delivery from Perez, scoring Ellis Burks, who had singled.
Burks scored his 1,000th career run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored in the seventh against reliever John
Johnstone. Kevin Elster led off with a double and eventually scored
on a sacrifice fly by F.P. Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers RHP Mike Fetters, who had his suspension for his
part in the Wrigley Field incident in May reduced from four games

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Michael ''Cub'' Koda, the singer and songwriter
behind the 1970s hit ''Smokin' in the Boys' Room'' and the
guitarist once described by author Stephen King as ''America's
greatest houserocker,'' died Saturday of complications from kidney
dialysis. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing his nickname from the character ''Cubby'' on
television's Mickey Mouse Club, Koda in 1969 formed Brownsville
Station and wrote ''Smokin' in the Boys Room,'' which in 1973 rose
to No. 3 on Billboard magazine's charts and sold more than 2
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville Station disbanded in 1979, six years before
''Smokin' in the Boys' Room'' was revived by heavy metal band
Motley Crue.
</P>
<P>
   Koda later played in groups called the Points and the Bone Gods,
as well as releasing solo works spotlighting rockabilly and blues.
In his dedications to his Bachman Book collection, King labeled
Koda ''America's greatest houserocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Koda co-authored ''Blues for Dummies'' in 1998 and has written a
monthly column called ''The Vinyl Junkie'' for trade magazines.
Walter Matthau:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Walter Matthau, the foghorn-voiced
master of crotchety comedy who won an Oscar for ''The Fortune
Cookie'' and cemented his stardom as the sloppy Oscar Madison in
''The Odd Couple,'' died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's performance as Jack Lemmon's shyster brother-in-law in
''The Fortune Cookie,'' directed by Billy Wilder, won him the
Academy Award as best supporting actor of 1966. He was twice
nominated for best actor for his roles in ''Kotch,'' 1971 and ''The
Sunshine Boys,'' 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Odd Couple'' provided the role that established Matthau's
stardom. In 1965 he appeared in New York as the slobby sportswriter
Oscar Madison opposite Art Carney as the fastidious photographer,
Felix Unger, in Neil Simon's play.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau repeated the role in the 1968 film, with Lemmon as
Felix.
</P>
<P>
   He was often teamed with Lemmon, always as adversaries though
they were best friends off screen. Their films included: ''The
Front Page,'' ''Buddy Buddy,'' ''Grumpier Old Men,'' ''Out to
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau enjoyed a wide variety of roles for more than 30 years.
He appeared in action thrillers such as ''The Taking of Pelham One
Two Three.'' He even did a musical, ''Hello Dolly!'' costarring
with Barbra Streisand, with whom he publicly feuded.
</P>
<P>
   He was most recently on screen with Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and
Lisa Kudrow in ''Hanging Up,'' released in February.
</P>
<P>
   The actor had survived several serious health setbacks. His
doctor attributed his first heart attack in 1966 to smoking three
packs a day and constant worry about gambling and told him to give
up both. Matthau stopped smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Legends of his gambling followed him throughout his life. In
middle age he estimated his lifetime gambling losses at $5 million.
Don Parker
</P>
<P>
   CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- Don Parker, who invented a learn-to-read
system used by generations of children worldwide, died June 21. He
was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of his death was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 127 million children in 64 countries have used
Parker's educational system, called SRA Reading Laboratories. The
method de-emphasizes grades and encourages students to learn at
their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   Parker created the system while working as a reading teacher in
rural Bradford County, Florida in 1950. He noticed that the slower
learners in his class fell further behind their classmates when he
taught them all from the same textbook.
</P>
<P>
   In his program, students were encouraged to individually master
beginning, intermediate and advanced lessons before graduating from
one color-coded set of workbooks to another. The color-coding,
Parker reasoned, would avoid embarrassing students who were at the
beginning levels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the popularity of SRA Reading Laboratories reached its
peak in the 1960s and 70s, the system has remained in use in some
public schools and is experiencing a resurgence in others as school
districts get back to basics to improve literacy.

Party Pressure Mounts in Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the eve of a tight presidential race, observers and
opposition activists today stepped up accusations against Mexico's ruling party
-- charging it with using the power of the state to illegally influence voting.
The allegations involved scattered incidents, small amounts of money or claims
of pressure on government employees or aid recipients. Officials of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party dismissed most of the reports as
misunderstandings or the result of newspapers' desperation for stories.

Lois Farnham, her arm around partner Holly Puterbaugh after they got their civil
union license. ''It's nice after all this time to say Holly is my spouse.''

Reese, who left after being hit in the left wrist by a pitch from Armando
Reynoso leading off the fifth. X-rays were negative. The Reds said both Griffey
and Reese would be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. Arizona rookie first baseman

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Return Home to Vote  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For the first time in 18 years, Juan Ramon
Alvarez is returning to his native Mexico to vote in a presidential
election. He wants to break the governing party's 71-year grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez is one of many Mexicans from California to New York who
have been captivated by the neck-and-neck race between Francisco
Labastida of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and
Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands were expected to cross the border in hopes of casting
one of a limited number of absentee ballots. Alvarez planned to
join a pre-dawn caravan from Los Angeles to Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' impact on politics back home has not been lost on
the politicians. Mexican presidential candidates campaigned in the
United States and took out ads in Spanish-language media here.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties even pledged to give three at-large seats in
Mexico's Congress to Mexican nationals in Los Angeles and Chicago.
Whether the Mexican nationals actually fill the seats depends on
how the opposition parties fare in Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The wooing by the parties is ''an unprecedented outreach into
the Mexican immigrant community,'' said Harry Pachon, president of
the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute near Los Angeles. ''This is a new
stage in Mexican political development.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez wants to vote the governing party, known as the PRI, out
of office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI has corrupted, up and down, left and right, the whole
society,'' he said. ''Finally we should decapitate the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   In East Los Angeles on Saturday, Ramon Barreto prepared to lead
a caravan of Mexicans who mostly support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto said he and his wife have been driving three hours to
the border to vote in presidential elections since 1982. But this
weekend, he expected to lead a caravan of 50 cars and 200 people.
He invited most of them to spend the night at a ranch he owns in
Tecate, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want change for all my people,'' Barreto said inside the
huge pinata and party supplies store he owns. ''Now is our big
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   About a tenth of Mexican adults -- 7 million to 10 million people
-- live in the United States. Los Angeles, with 2 million Mexicans,
has the world's largest concentration after Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.5 million Mexicans in the United States hold Mexican
voting cards, said Felipe Aguirre, head of the U.S. campaign for
presidential candidate Cuahtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   Absentee ballot voting abroad is not permitted, but Mexicans in
the United States hope that will change by the next congressional
elections in 2003. That would send the number of voters soaring,
Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans here also are wielding increasing economic clout. They
wire home at least $7 billion a year -- Mexico's third-largest
source of legal income after oil and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cardenas and Fox campaigned this year in California.
Labastida, who polls show in a statistical tie with Fox, met in
Tijuana with Mexican-American leaders. He also paid for an
eight-page insert in Spanish-language newspapers in Los Angeles,
San Antonio and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the caravans, opposition parties have established phone
banks so Mexicans can call home to urge relatives to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans traveling to the border to cast absentee ballots may
not get to vote. They are limited to 64 special booths set up along
the border with just 750 paper ballots per booth.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charge that the PRI has limited the number of
special polling places and ballots along the border to reduce the
number of Mexicans in the United States who vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are expected to vote against the PRI, which many
blame for Mexico's rampant corruption and widespread poverty.

<HEADLINE> Crowd Shows Support at Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Fans attending the U.S. Senior Open have
watched some excellent golf, and they've responded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was unbelievable out there,'' Tom Kite said after shooting
a 5-under-par 66 Saturday to pull within three shots of leader
Bruce Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Electricity was definitely in the air. Everybody watching
could sense some great things were happening. It was an exciting
day for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance in the third round was 29,000, which paled in
comparison to the 47,200 who turned out for Day 3 last year at Des
Moines Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans who have come here are showing their support.
Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus drew large galleries all week. Fans
lined up eight to 10 deep to watch Bruce Fleisher and Jim Thorpe as
well as Tom Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Total attendance for the week, including the practice rounds is
116,500.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STEADY CLIMB: Lee Trevino shot a 1-under-par 70 in the third
round to improve by two strokes for the third straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, if we can stay here about a month, I might be able to
win,'' Trevino joked.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Texan is coming off a victory last week in the
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic. It was his first tour win since 1998,
and he played just one practice round this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't play a lot of practice rounds,'' he said. ''I drove
the ball poorly the first two days.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH HOMECOMING: After finishing second to Dave Eichelberger
in the 1999 Senior Open, Ed Dougherty hasn't had nearly the same
success this year while playing in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, a native of Linwood, shot a 72 in the third round. He
was at 6-over 219 entering the final 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty held a one stroke lead over Eichelberger heading into
the final round at Des Moines Golf and Country Club last year, but
finished three strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   He's still looking for his first victory since winning the
Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic while on the regular tour in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Eichelberger has struggled in his title defense,
shooting 221 through three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL BEST: John Mahaffey's 66 in the third round was his
first time under 70 after 10 rounds in the Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last two days, I've hit 17 greens both days,'' he said.
''I putted atrociously yesterday. I worked and worked and worked on
putting yesterday afternoon and I changed how I grip the putter. It
seemed to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahaffey was at 213 entering the last round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   CHARISMATIC CHI CHI: Chi Rodriguez entertained the crowd,
joking between shots, gesturing after a birdie on hole No. 3 and
signing autographs in the walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who made the cut for the first time since 1997, shot
a 74 and was tied with Nicklaus at 215 after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON: While Dave Stockton Sr. is contending
in the Senior Open, his son, Dave Stockton Jr. is seeking his first
victory on the PGA Tour in the Canon Greater Hartford Open.
Stockton Sr. is eight behind Fleisher after the third round while
his son is nine back of Mark Calcavecchia with 18 holes left.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard confiscates 125 kilograms of cocaine from Liberian freighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Coast Guard boarding party inspecting a
Liberian freighter with a damaged propeller found 125 kilograms of
cocaine hidden on board, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The Timashevsk, a 593-foot hazardous material freighter, had
struck a navigation buoy Friday night as it was leaving New York
Harbor for Venezuela, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer
Angelo Patti. The ship returned to Stapleton anchorage, which is
next to the Staten Island ferry dock on Staten Island, where the
Coast Guard discovered the drugs during a routine inspection around
11 a.m. Saturday, Patti said.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine has a street value between $3.5 million and $5
million, Patti said. It was confiscated by U.S. Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ship's crew were charged because the drugs were
found in a compartment on the outer section of the ship's stern,
which is normally underwater. The compartment was above the water
line Saturday because the ship's freight had already been unloaded
and it was riding higher in the water. That made it unclear to
investigators whether the crew knew the drugs were there, Patti
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crew members are getting drug tested and the rudder is
being inspected, and if everything checks out, they'll be on their
way,'' Patti said. ''Normally all of these guys would have been
arrested.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Walter Matthau Dies at 79  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Walter Matthau, the foghorn-voiced
master of crotchety comedy who won an Oscar for ''The Fortune
Cookie'' and cemented his stardom as the sloppy Oscar Madison in
''The Odd Couple,'' died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was pronounced dead at 1:42 a.m. at St. John's Health
Center in Santa Monica, said hospital spokeswoman Lindi Funston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost someone I loved as a brother, as a closest friend
and a remarkable human being,'' said frequent co-star Jack Lemmon.
''We have also lost one of the best damn actors we'll ever see.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were placed on Matthau's star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Often cast as a would-be con man foiled by life's travails,
Matthau bellowed complaints against his tormentors and moved his
lean, 6-foot-3 frame in surprising ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''Walter walks like a child's windup toy,'' Lemmon once said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's performance as Lemmon's shyster brother-in-law in
''The Fortune Cookie,'' directed by Billy Wilder, won him the
Academy Award as best supporting actor of 1966. He was twice
nominated for best actor: as the cantankerous oldster in ''Kotch,''
1971 (directed by Lemmon); and as the feuding vaudeville partner of
George Burns in ''The Sunshine Boys,'' 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so natural. He was himself, with all the quirks that a
human being has,'' Wilder said Saturday. ''He was guy who made
great friends. Whether you played cards with him or whether you
talked football bets with him, he was a full-blown man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was good in everything he did. Sometimes I messed it up as
a director. But he was absolutely perfect, always,'' Wilder added.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Odd Couple'' provided the role that established Matthau's
stardom. In 1965 he appeared in New York as the slobby sportswriter
Oscar Madison in Neil Simon's play. Art Carney was the fastidious
photographer, Felix Unger, who shared an apartment with Madison
after both had been divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau repeated the role in the 1968 film, with Lemmon as
Felix. They reprised their roles 30 years later in the 1998 film
''Odd Couple II.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every actor looks all his life for a part that will combine
his talents with his personality,'' Matthau told Time magazine in
1971. '''The Odd Couple' was mine. That was the plutonium I needed.
It all started happening after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau's son Charlie, 34, became a filmmaker and directed his
father in ''The Grass Harp'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a personal standpoint, he was just the kindest, most
honest, most decent, funniest person I've every met,'' Charlie
Matthau said Saturday. ''I was lucky enough to direct him in 'The
Grass Harp' and hopefully not embarrass him. I think he was proud
of the film and I know I'll treasure it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau had survived several serious health setbacks, including
an earlier heart attack, but he was growing increasingly sick and
his ability to bounce back was diminishing and longtime agent
Leonard Hirshan said his death was sobering but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have absolutely nothing to say but deep sadness about
leaving a friend (who was) more than a client,'' Hirshan said.
''It's a shame. He's just a terrific man.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor could be as whimsically eccentric in interviews as he
was on the screen. Reporters had to exercise caution in separating
fact from his flights of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to a form for Current Biography, he reported that
his father had been an Eastern Orthodox priest in czarist Russia
who ran afoul with church authorities by preaching the
infallibility of the pope. His father was actually a peddler from
Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my defense mechanism against pompous and ludicrous
questions,'' Matthau explained. When he filled out his Social
Security form in 1937, he listed his middle name as Foghorn. He
never corrected it.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Walter Matuchanskayasky on Oct. 1, 1920, in New York
City to impoverished Russian-Jewish immigrants. His father left
home when Walter was 3. Walter and his older brother, Henry, lived
with their mother, a garment worker, in a series of cold water
flats on the lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   He was already 6 feet tall at age 10 and weighed 90 pounds.
''When I drank cherry soda, I looked like a thermometer,'' he once
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, when he served in the Army Air Corps, he
returned home a sergeant with six battle stars and a fistful of
money from poker winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Legends of his gambling followed him throughout his life. While
making a TV series in Florida before his movie stardom, he lost
$183,000 betting on spring-training baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   In middle age he estimated his lifetime gambling losses at $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   After studying in the dramatic workshop at New York's New School
-- where fellow students included Gene Saks, Rod Steiger, Harry
Guardino and Tony Curtis -- his first Broadway role came at the age
of 28 when he was hired as understudy for the role of an
83-year-old English bishop in ''Anne of the Thousand Days,''
starring Rex Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   When the aged English actor playing the role became ill, Matthau
went onstage without a rehearsal. He liked to tell how the
surprised Harrison looked at him and uttered an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   His first film, ''The Kentuckian,'' starring and directed by
Burt Lancaster in 1955, cast him as a villain, and more heavy roles
followed, including ''Charade,'' starring Cary Grant and Audrey
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Odd Couple'' and ''The Fortune Cookie'' elevated Matthau
to stardom, and he enjoyed a wide variety of roles for more than 30
years. He appeared in action thrillers such as ''The Taking of
Pelham One Two Three.'' He even did a musical, ''Hello Dolly!''
costarring with Barbra Streisand, with whom he publicly feuded.
</P>
<P>
   He was always identified with comedy, something that rankled
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people come up to me and say, 'Aren't you that comedian
who's in the movies?' I want to throw up,'' he once complained. ''I
throw up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was often teamed with Lemmon, always as adversaries
though they were best friends off screen. Their films included:
''The Front Page,'' ''Buddy Buddy,'' ''Grumpier Old Men,'' ''Out to
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   He was most recently on screen with Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and
Lisa Kudrow in ''Hanging Up,'' released in February.
</P>
<P>
   The actor had survived several serious health setbacks. While
making ''The Fortune Cookie'' in 1966, he suffered a serious heart
attack. His doctor attributed it to smoking three packs a day and
constant worry about gambling and told him to give up both. Matthau
stopped smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he underwent heart bypass surgery. After working in
freezing Minnesota weather for ''Grumpy Old Men'' in 1993, he was
hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995 he had a colon
tumor removed; it tested benign. He was hospitalized in May 1999
after another bout with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Matthau attributed his various illnesses to his eating habits:
''If you eat only celery and lettuce, you won't get sick .... I
like celery and lettuce, but I like it with pickles, relish, corned
beef, potatoes, peas. And I like Eskimo Pies, vanilla ice cream
with chocolate covering.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthau was married to Grace Geraldine Johnson from 1948 until
their divorce in 1958. They had two children, David and Jenny. He
married Carol Marcus in 1959, and they had one son, Charlie.

<HEADLINE> June deluges add to already hefty rainfall totals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - In a normal year, the western part of New
York gets a shade under seven inches of rain in May and June.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, 2000 has been anything but normal when it comes to
the wet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In June alone, Buffalo got 6.5 inches of rain, almost twice the
average of 3.55 inches and the fifth wettest June since 1900,
according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   And the region came into June wringing wet. In May and June
combined, 10.88 inches of rain fell, third wettest behind only
1989's dousing of 15.05 inches and the 11.53 inches that fell in
1984. For perspective, the average rainfall during those two months
is 6.69 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in April and Buffalo has soaked up 14.95 inches of rain in
the past three months, second most since 1900 behind only 1989's
16.93. The average for the trimester is 9.56 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo does not sing these rainy day blues alone. If New York
state was taking a bath, its fingers and toes would be prunes after
the spring its had.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Binghamton and its 27.76 inches of rain that has fallen
since January 1, a whopping 10.12 inches above the normal
year-to-date rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Or Albany with 25.94 inches of rain since the first New Year's
Day of the new millennium, 8.36 inches more than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse and Rochester have fared a little better, getting 20.86
inches and 20.55 inches since January 1. For Syracuse, that's 3.21
inches more than it's used to getting and for Rochester, 5.76
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not normal,'' said Bob Hudgins, hydrometeorological
technician with the National Weather Service in Binghamton. ''We're
normally warmer and drier than we are. Normally, the weather we're
getting is over Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   All the rain has jeopardized crops across the state as farmers
watch their livelihood drown in soggy, sometimes unworkable fields.
The state government has asked for federal assistance for farmers
hurt by the heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news with the heavy rain: Water tables
depleted by last year's drought have begun to recover. Hudgins of
the National Weather Service cautioned it could be years before
water tables are fully replenished.
</P>
<P>
   The wet weather comes to New York courtesy of La Nina, a
phenomenon in which the Pacific waters off South America cool and
throw a monkey wrench into global atmospherics.
</P>
<P>
   In a La Nina, westward-blowing trade winds pushing across the
Pacific stir cooler water from the depths. This produces
below-normal surface water temperatures, which create less
evaporation, resulting in drier air.
</P>
<P>
   The process creates a shift in the jet stream that ordinarily
carries rain across the U.S. Southwest into the Midwest, pushing it
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, La Nina is dead, right? Yes and no, say
meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not totally gone yet,'' said Hudgins of the weather
service. ''At least not the effect we're seeing from it. It takes
months for it to change over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Sage, a meteorologist with the weather service in Buffalo,
said the crystal ball looks, well, cloudy. The service uses a
30-day and 90-day outlook that, while it gets less accurate the
further out it looks, gives a pretty good idea of the weather New
York can expect through the end of September, Sage said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both (the 30-day and 90-day outlook) have better probabilities
of getting above normal precipitation,'' Sage said.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the eve of a tight presidential race, observers and
opposition activists today stepped up accusations against Mexico's ruling party
-- charging it with using the power of the state to illegally influence voting.
The allegations involved scattered incidents, small amounts of money or claims
of pressure on government employees or aid recipients. Officials of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party dismissed most of the reports as
misunderstandings or the result of newspapers' desperation for stories.

Reese, who left after being hit in the left wrist by a pitch from Armando
Reynoso leading off the fifth. X-rays were negative. The Reds said both Griffey
and Reese would be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. Arizona rookie first baseman

strain while running out an RBI double in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> US Soldiers Stop Escorting Serbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American peacekeepers imposed
punitive measures on a Serb community in Kosovo where riots erupted
last month, NATO-led peacekeepers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Until the local community improves cooperation with the
peacekeepers, U.S. soldiers will stop providing armed escorts for
Serbs traveling in convoys to buy food, a statement from U.S.
peacekeepers said. All community improvement projects will also be
halted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after violence last month that followed the
abduction and death of an elderly Serb farmer in Strpce, about 25
miles south of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have accused U.N. police and NATO peacekeepers of
failing to search in earnest for the missing man. The Serbs rioted
and demolished a U.N. office to press for greater action. His body
was found days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intent here is to say that we are not going to continue to
assist the community, pay for things, when they themselves are
causing us trouble and destroying what we are trying to fix,'' said
U.S. Maj. Scott Slaten, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Serb representatives of the enclave met Saturday with U.S.
military officials to protest the decision to withhold the armed
security needed for Serb convoys that connect Strpce with southern
Serbia twice a week, passing through ethnic-Albanian populated
areas, Beta said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have consistently argued that they have been at risk in
the year since NATO-led peacekeepers took over the province after a
78-day air war to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
stop his repression of ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 3, China 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Cidinha scored on a penalty kick at the
end of the first overtime Saturday as Brazil stunned China 3-2 to
reach the final of the women's soccer Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left no doubt as to Brazil's status as a gold-medal
threat at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will play the winner of Saturday's United States-Canda
semifinal in the Gold Cup championship game Monday at Foxboro,
Mass. China, which lost the United States in last year's World Cup
final, will play in the third-place game.
</P>
<P>
   Cidinha's sudden-death goal came after Wang Liping pushed down
Formiga just inside the penalty area in the final minute of the
first 15-minute extra period. Cidinha calmly put her penalty kick
inside the left post, and Brazil celebrated possibly its greatest
victory ever.
</P>
<P>
   Katia da Silva scored in the 11th minute -- her tournament-high
eighth goal -- and Roseli in the 60th for Brazil, while Shui Qingxia
tallied in the ninth and Qiu Haiyan in the 75th for China.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal came after Brazil went uncharacteristically
conservative, rarely forcing an attack, after taking a 2-1 lead.
Even after China tied the game, Brazil had few chances as playmaker
Sissi essentially became a spectator on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China put a third forward on the field with nine
minutes left in regulation and came close to winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Second-half substitute Qiu atoned for a missed penalty kick
earlier in the second half as she tied the game 2-2 with her first
goal of the tournament. Shui chipped a short cross from the right
side, and Qiu put the ball in from 8 yards with her left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve minutes earlier, Shui had won a penalty kick when she was
hooked by Simone Gomes. Qiu took the penalty and hit the left post.
The rebound went right back to her, but she shanked her follow shot
over the net.
</P>
<P>
   Roseli gave Brazil a 2-1 lead on a breakaway down the right
side. Goalkeeper Gao Hong went to the ground to make a leg save on
the first shot, but Roseli put in the easy rebound for her fifth
goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two early goals in two minutes, both off set plays, highlighted
a lively first half.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth minute, Shui tucked a left-footed, 20-yard free
kick just under the crossbar for her fourth goal of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, Brazil won a free kick to the left of the penalty
box. Sissi yielded the kick to Cidinha, who placed a perfect
left-footed cross for Katia's running header past Gao.
</P>
<P>
   Pu Wei wasted a breakaway in the 22nd minute by pushing her shot
right at goalkeeper Andreia, but otherwise China's attack continued
to lack its full creative flow without playmaker Sun Wen, who is
nursing a knee injury.

<HEADLINE> Moodie Leads ShopRite LPGA Classic  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. (AP) -- Janice Moodie birdied two of the last three
holes Saturday for a 3-under-par 68 and a two-stroke lead over
fast-closing Juli Inkster and four others after the second round of
the ShopRite LPGA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who won the LPGA Championship on Sunday, birdied five
of the final seven holes en route to a 66 that put here at 6-under
136 along with Maria Hjorth (63), Jackie Gallagher-Smith (70), Dina
Ammaccapane (66) and Vickie Odegard (67).
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who has two victories, three seconds and two
third-place finishes in 11 events this year, has to be considered
the favorite on Sunday, especially with Moodie looking for her
first career victory.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Scot had six birdies and three bogeys to finish
at 8-under 134 on the Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been out here three years and chopping on the door a long
time now, and having some really good finishes,'' said Moodie, who
tied for second this year in Los Angeles. ''So I just want to wait
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If Moodie wants to win, she will probably have to go low because
the course is giving up some great scores.
</P>
<P>
   Hjorth, who was seven shots behind the leaders after the first
round, tied the tournament record set by Se Ri Pak last year with
her 63 that featured six birdies and an eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Pak missed the cut at 2 over by shooting a 75 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster posted her 5-under round playing in the final group of
the day. She got her round going by hitting a pitching wedge to 2
feet on the 12th hole and added birdie putts of 12, 15, 5 and 4
feet down the stretch. She saved par on the 18th, making a
12-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can look at the scoreboard all you want but when you are
trying as hard as you can, sometimes it just doesn't do what you
want it to,'' Inkster said. ''I was just trying to keep grinding
and have some putts at a birdie, which I finally did on the back
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher Smith, who shared the first-round lead with Moodie and
Michelle Estill, had five birdies and four bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Odegard, who had missed 14 of 15 cuts coming into this event,
birdied the final three holes en route to a 67.
</P>
<P>
   Ammaccapane had a bogey and six birdies, the last three coming
on the final three holes.
</P>
<P>
   Moodie has led once before. She held a two-shot lead going into
the final round of the State Farm Rail Classic in September, but
shot a 73 and tied for second, a shot behind Mi Hyun Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Being in the lead didn't effect Moodie's dry sense of humor when
she was asked if she would be able to relax on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being blonde, I'll just go back and think about nothing,'' she
deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Hjorth's 63 was 10 shots better than her first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday I was really struggling,'' Hjorth said. ''My swing
was getting flat and I was hooking shots all day.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hjorth spent between 90 minutes and two hours at the range,
and it worked wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The Swede made a 7-foot eagle putt on the par-5 third hole. None
of her birdies putts was longer than 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Estill, who is looking for her first win since her rookie season
in 1991, held the lead at 7 under after 11 holes, but she played
the last five holes in 4 over.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Zedlitz, who has missed the cut in eight of 13 events and
finished no better than a tie for 57th in the other five, won a
Subaru Legacy Outback Wagon by making a hole-in-one on the 170-yard
seventh hole. She used a 7-iron.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 10, Astros 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his major league-leading 30th
home run and Fernando Tatis homered for the first time since coming
off the disabled list as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Houston
Astros 10-9 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit the first pitch he saw from Octavio Dotel for a
three-run shot in the first inning. He reached the 30-homer mark
for the 11th time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac became the first player ever to have 30 homers at the
All-Star break four times. Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr., who has 26
home runs this year, has done it three times.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has homered in five straight games at Busch Stadium.
Despite playing in only 66 of the team's 80 games, McGwire is on
pace for 61 home runs. He has 552 career home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, who missed 54 games with a groin injury before returning
to the lineup Friday night, hit a three-run homer in the sixth off
Doug Henry. The home run, Tatis' seventh and first since April 26,
gave the Cardinals a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell homered twice for Houston. Moises Alou and Richard
Hidalgo also homered for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Paquette homered for the Cardinals. J.D. Drew had three
hits and Jim Edmonds doubled twice before a sellout crowd of
47,675. It was the fifth straight sellout for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have won nine of 12. Houston has lost 10 of its
last 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thompson (1-1) pitched 2 1-3 innings of relief to get the
win, allowing one unearned run on one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his 16th save, giving up a solo
home run to Bagwell. Bagwell's first multihomer game of the season
gave him 20 home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Slusarski (1-5) gave up two runs on two hits in two innings
of relief.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire gave the Cardinals a 3-2 lead with his home run,
Houston took it right back in the second on a two-run single by
Craig Biggio and an RBI single by Mitch Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   Alou and Hidalgo hit consecutive home runs with one out in the
third to make it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals began their comeback in the fourth by scoring
three times on Paquette's homer, an RBI single by Drew and Edmonds'
RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds tied it at 7 in the sixth with a double over Hidalgo's
head in center.
</P>
<P>
   Houston made it 10-8 on an RBI double by Hidalgo in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bagwell's first-inning homer broke a four-game, homerless
streak for the Astros. ... The Cardinals have homered in 65 of
their 80 games and have multiple homers in 43 of those games. ...
Houston (27-53) will reach the halfway mark Sunday with the worst
record in the majors. The Astros were 46-34 after 80 games last
year. ... The Astros have hit back-to-back home runs five times and
Hidalgo has been involved all five times. ... Cardinals catcher Eli
Marrero left the game with a left thumb injury he suffered while
stealing second base in the fourth.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tino Martinez broke an 0-for-15
slump with a single and three-run double Saturday that helped
Orlando Hernandez and the struggling New York Yankees beat the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   With owner George Steinbrenner in attendance, the Yankees won
for only the third time in nine games. He also got to see a
bench-clearing brawl, started when Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith tangled
with catcher Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (7-6) returned to the rotation after missing two
scheduled starts because of a sprained right elbow. That problem
contributed to his shortest outing of the season against the
Chicago White Sox on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   The New York ace allowed four hits, including Smith's solo
homer, in 5 2-3 innings to snap a personal two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Posada were ejected in the seventh inning when they
exchanged blows after Smith struck out on a check swing.
</P>
<P>
   The two bumped as Posada moved forward with the ball and Smith
crossed the plate on his way back to the dugout. The catcher spun
and shoved Smith before the Devil Rays' third baseman retaliated by
throwing a punch and wrestling Posada to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both benches emptied, but order was restored quickly and no
other players entered the altercation as participants.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who was 2-for-5, is just 9-for-45 through the first 12
games of a season-long, 13-game road trip that ends Sunday. But his
bases-loaded double off Mark Guthrie broke the game open after the
Yankees wasted numerous opportunities to build on a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill doubled twice and drove in one run off Albie Lopez
(4-6). Shane Spencer and Derek Jeter added RBI singles for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams has hit safely in every game on the Yankees road
trip, going 23-for-51 (.451) with five homers and 15 RBIs. He
singled in the second to extend his streak to 12 games and scored
on Spencer's RBI hit, then singled and scored on Martinez's double
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez struck out the side in the third, but allowed doubles to
Jose Vizcaino and O'Neill that produced New York's second run.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays starter got out of a bases-loaded jam in the
fifth when Posada flied to deep center, however the Yankees finally
drove him out of the game when Martinez singled and Spencer double
to open the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White replaced Lopez and retired Scott Brosius on a
grounder to first before striking out Vizcaino escaping without
allowing a run when Bubba Trammell made a nice running catch on
Derek Jeter's drive to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Through six innings, the Yankees stranded nine runners and were
2-for-11 with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez improved to 5-1 against the Devil Rays, with the lone
loss coming on May 11 when he limited Tampa Bay to seven hits in a
1-0 complete-game loss to Steve Trachsel. He walked one and struck
out three after allowing nine runs in 2-3 of an inning in a 17-4
loss to the White Sox two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Choate replaced him, making his major league debut, with
one on and two outs in the sixth. The left-hander called up from
Triple-A Columbus on Thursday and retired the only batter he faced,
Fred McGriff, on a fly to center.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch was scratched from the starting
lineup because of a left ear infection. He was replaced by
Vizcaino, who batted leadoff and went 2-for-3 with a double and
triple ... Devil Rays 3B coach Billy Hatcher was ejected in the
third inning after reacting to 3B umpire C.B. Bucknor ruling a
check swing a strike against Randy Winn ... Jeter fouled off eight
straight pitches before taking a called third strike in the third
inning.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   After breezing through the Oakland Athletics'
powerful lineup
for eight innings, Brian Cooper saved his best pitches for last.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander defied his pitch count and silenced the
Athletics' big bats in the Anaheim Angels' 7-0 victory Friday
night, his first major league shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I threw a few too many pitches in the eighth, and they said,
'Look, you've only got a few more pitches,''' said Cooper, who
scattered three hits -- all singles -- against the team ranked fourth
in the AL with 117 homers. ''I knew if I put anybody else on base,
I was done. So I just tried to throw it right down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (3-2) already had thrown 113 pitches when he entered the
ninth. But he struck out Ramon Hernandez, retired Terrence Long on
a flyball and got Randy Velarde to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was certainly going to be his last hitter. We were close
to taking him out,'' said manager Mike Scioscia, who had Al Levine
warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper ended a string of three consecutive no-decisions and a
personal five-game winless streak in his first major league
complete game. He struck out four and walked one in his 13th career
start, giving the Angels their second shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In other AL games, Tampa Bay beat New York 6-4; Minnesota
defeated Cleveland 7-2; Chicago topped Boston 10-4; Baltimore beat
Toronto 8-3; Detroit edged Kansas City 3-1; and Texas routed
Seattle 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's shutout was preserved early by Garret Anderson, who
turned 28 on Friday. Anderson homered to trigger Anaheim's five-run
sixth inning and robbed Randy Velarde of a home run in the fourth
to keep the score at 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it would go that far,'' Anderson said. ''But I
knew when I got to the wall that I had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland managed just Jason Giambi's first-inning single, a
fifth-inning single by Matt Stairs off first baseman Mo Vaughn's
glove and John Jaha's eighth-inning infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just threw strikes with everything he had,'' Athletics
manager Art Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led off the sixth with his 22nd homer, one more than
his previous career best, and Bengie Molina homered one out later.
Adam Kennedy then doubled and scored on a single by Darin Erstad to
give the Angels a 5-0 lead and chase Mark Mulder (5-3), who allowed
six runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Benji Gil greeted T.J. Mathews with the Angels' third homer of
the inning and the Angels' 123rd of the season -- the most they've
had before the All-Star break in the team's 40-year history. It
also was their 75th at home, one more than they hit at Edison Field
all last year.
Devil Rays 6, Yankees 4:
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay finished the best month in franchise history at 15-11,
while struggling New York closed out its first losing month since
August 1996 at 10-15.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson, who hit a two-run single and walked four times,
got the game-winning RBI when Jeff Nelson (6-2) walked him on four
pitches with two outs and the bases loaded in the eighth. Todd
Erdos replaced Nelson and walked Felix Martinez to force in another
run. The visiting Yankees issued 11 walks.
Twins 7, Indians 2:
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton hit two home runs, and visiting Minnesota sent
Cleveland to its third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Midre Cummings, who also homered, Corey Koskie and Lawton each
had three of the Twins' 16 hits. Lawton hit a two-run homer in the
first inning off Jim Brower (2-2) and led off the sixth with a
homer off Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (5-3) won for the first time since May 30.
White Sox 10, Red Sox 4:
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas and Brook Fordyce each homered twice for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hit a solo homer in the fifth off Bryce Florie and added
another solo drive an inning later off Rheal Cormier. Fordyce hit a
solo shot in the fifth and a two-run shot in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (8-2) won his fifth straight decision. Hipolito
Pichardo (2-1) lasted only four innings for visiting Boston.
Orioles 8, Blue Jays 3:
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle and Harold Baines had two RBIs apiece in a six-run
third inning, and Pat Rapp (5-5) earned his first win in a month as
Baltimore ended a 13-game losing streak against visiting Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Carlos Delgado went 0-for-4, ending his 22-game
hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay (3-5) yielded seven runs, four hits and four walks
in 2 2-3 innings, his shortest stint as a starter this season.
Tigers 3, Royals 1:
</P>
<P>
   After allowing only four hits and no runs for eight innings,
Jeff Weaver (5-6) gave up consecutive singles to Johnny Damon and
pinch-hitter Mark Quinn in the ninth, but Detroit held on to win at
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones gave up an RBI single to Mike Sweeney, but got three
outs for his league-leading 21st save.
Rangers 13, Mariners 3:
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro had three hits and Royce Clayton had three RBIs
as both homered in Texas' fourth victory in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers (8-5) won his fifth consecutive decision. John
Halama (7-4) gave up five runs in three-plus innings for visiting
Seattle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Rocker could only watch as the Atlanta Braves' bullpen blew
it.
</P>
<P>
   While Rocker nursed a bleeding callus on his left thumb, the New
York Mets picked on relievers Don Wengert, Kerry Ligtenberg and
Terry Mulholland for a 10-run eighth inning and an improbable 11-8
win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really let the team down,'' Rocker said. ''Situations like
tonight are the times that I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker split open the callus on his first warmup toss in the
seventh. Fans at Shea Stadium who had been chanting ''We want
Rocker!'' were soon going crazy after Mike Piazza's three-run,
laser-like homer capped the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no news that we have trouble beating the Braves,'' Piazza
said. ''We come in tight, we press, we kick the ball around.
Hopefully, this will kind of relax us.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza recorded an RBI in his 13th straight game, four short of
the major league mark. The Mets tied a team record for their
biggest inning ever and posted the second-largest comeback in club
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen anything like that in my life,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   In other NL games, Chicago beat Milwaukee 7-4 in 15 innings, Los
Angeles downed San Francisco 9-2, St. Louis defeated Houston 5-4,
Cincinnati beat Arizona 5-4, Colorado topped San Diego 5-4, Florida
beat Montreal 5-4 and Pittsburgh defeated Philadelphia 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had its biggest collapse since May 9, 1992, when it blew
a nine-run lead at St. Louis and lost 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went 13-15 in June, their first losing month since
September 1996. Third baseman Chipper Jones missed the game to
return to Atlanta, where doctors planned to induce labor in his
wife, Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   The threatened ''Battery Night'' demonstration against Rocker
never took place. In fact, he signed autographs before the game for
the same fans he disparaged last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan hit a three-run homer off Eric Cammack in the
eighth, giving Atlanta an 8-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza singled in the bottom half and Robin Ventura's RBI
grounder drove in Derek Bell, who set a Mets record by scoring for
the 10th straight game.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, New York scored nine more runs, with Piazza's
shot to left field coming off Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst pitch I've ever thrown,'' Mulholland said.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare official scoring decision, the win was credited to
reliever Armando Benitez, who was still in the bullpen when the
Mets erupted in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez entered in the ninth and got the last three outs.
Cammack was in position to pick up his first major league victory,
but was denied when it was ruled his one-inning, three-run
performance did not warrant it.
</P>
<P>
Cubs 7, Brewers 4
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young drew his team record-tying fifth walk, forcing home
the go-ahead run in the 15th inning, and Sammy Sosa added a two-run
double as Chicago won at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee blew a two-run lead in the ninth. In the Cubs 15th,
pitcher Jon Lieber walked in his first career pinch-hitting
appearance, and Young followed by drawing a walk from rookie Allen
Levrault.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 5, Astros 4
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire set the record for career home runs at Busch
Stadium as St. Louis beat Houston.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's major league-leading 29th homer this season was the
551st of his career. It also was his 104th in only 215 games at
Busch, moving him ahead of the 103 hit by teammate Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lost its third in a row.
</P>
<P>
Dodgers 9, Giants 2
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield homered twice and drove in four runs, leading
Kevin Brown and Los Angeles over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brown improved to 8-1 in 10 career starts against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley became the first opponent to homer into McCovey's
Cove, the water just outside Pacific Bell Park. He also doubled
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent drove in two runs, giving him an NL-leading 78 RBIs,
as the Giants lost their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
Reds 5, Diamondbacks 4
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch, fresh off the disabled list, won for the first
time this season and helped himself with a two-run single.
Cincinnati improved to 7-0 all-time at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, out for nearly four weeks because of weakness in his
rotator cuff, began the night with an 0-4 record and a 9.95 ERA.
</P>
<P>
Marlins 5, Expos 4
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Vladimir Guerrero's error gave Florida the
go-ahead run in the ninth inning at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Mark Kotsay singled and the ball got past
Guerrero, allowing Luis Castillo to score from first base. It was
Guerrero's sixth error of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero raced home from second base on Chris Widger's infield
single in the eighth as Montreal tied it 4-all.
</P>
<P>
Pirates 8, Phillies 3
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero drove in four runs as Pittsburgh rallied late to win
at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero hit a two-run triple in a five-run eighth inning and a
two-run single in the ninth. He also doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia leadoff man Doug Glanville broke an 0-for-20 slump
with a single.
</P>
<P>
Rockies 5, Padres 4
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio earned his first victory in seven starts as
Colorado won at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bragg singled home the tiebreaking run in the seventh
innings. The Rockies won their third in a row.

<HEADLINE> Mobster Francesco ''Skyball'' Scibelli dies at 87  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) - Francesco Joseph ''Skyball'' Scibelli,
a western Massachusetts mobster with ties to New York's Genovese
crime family, died Thursday. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Scibelli was called ''The Little Guy'' when out of earshot, but
he had prominent stature in bookmaking and other organized crime in
western New England and throughout the east coast since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Springfield, Scibelli was a familiar figure in the
city. A restaurant owner, he lived in the city's Sixteen Acres
neighborhood for years, but also spent time in Old Saybrook, Conn.
and traveled frequently to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Federal organized crime investigators identified him as a
lieutenant in New York's Genovese crime family, and said he was
well-known in Hartford, where he oversaw gambling for the local
mafia.
</P>
<P>
   He and partner Andrew Pradella were dubbed ''The Scholar Group''
for their prowess at handicapping professional and college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Teresa's 1967 book ''My Life in the Mafia'' noted
Scibelli keen oddskeeping abilities and said he inspired fear in
those he perceived as his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Frank H. Freedman sent Scibelli to
prison in 1976 for 18 months, and again in 1988 for three years,
for his role in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Violence hit his immediate family in 1972, when the
bullet-riddled body of his son-in-law, Victor C. DeCaro, was pulled
from the Connecticut River, wrapped in a sleeping and bound with
rope.
</P>
<P>
   Scibelli was not related to the late Springfield State Rep.
Anthony Scibelli.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco Scibelli leaves his wife of 43 years, Alice, two sons,
two daughters, a brother and a sister.

Two Killed in Lake Erie Terrace Collapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- A terrace at an island winery in Lake Erie
collapsed this afternoon, killing two people and injuring at least 80,
authorities say. The terrace collapsed at the Lonz Winery on an island about 5
miles off the mainland. A dispatcher at the police department in nearby Port
Clinton said the collapse occurred about 5 p.m. He said about 60 firefighters
and emergency medical personnel were on their way to the island. Middle Bass is
about 50 miles east of Toledo.

S.C. Confederate Flag Comes Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After decades of debate and mounting pressure from an
NAACP boycott, South Carolina finally removed the Confederate flag from atop its
Statehouse today in a somber ceremony that paid tribute to its Civil War roots.
The flag, seen as a reminder of slavery for some and a tribute to Southern
heritage for others, flew atop the Statehouse dome for 38 years. But protests
over the flag continued even as it was being lowered: Civil War re-enactors
raised another Confederate flag on Statehouse grounds, in front of a Confederate
soldier's monument. The new location was part of the compromise reached by the
Legislature in May.

Clinton Signs Campaign Legislation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation today to close a
loophole that permitted unlimited secret contributions to groups trying to exert
anonymous influence over the nation's political and policy agenda. The law
''will help clean up the system by forcing organizations to come clean about
their donors,'' the president said. Speaking on the White House's South Lawn,
Clinton welcomed the disclosure law as the first new restriction on political
money in 20 years. Congress should move quickly to use it as a building block
for comprehensive campaign-finance reform, he said.

Elian's Case May Change Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After seven months of bitter emotions and plenty of
political heat, the case of Elian Gonzalez finally was resolved under
long-standing rules on parents' rights and immigration law -- rules that some
say need to change. Some experts in family and immigration law hope the
controversy will lead to new ideas for handling the cases of children who arrive
in the United States without a parent or close adult relative. ''The real
question is going to be whether those standards need changing,'' said Neal
Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who chairs the American Bar Association's standing
committee on immigration law. More than 5,000 such children arrive in the United
States each year, he said.

Latino Advocates: Unite for Clout
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to turn Hispanic America's swift population gains
into political power, Latino advocates are searching for rallying points that
can unite their diverse citizenry. ''It's great to be America's fastest growing
community, but that doesn't automatically translate to political clout,'' said
Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a national
Hispanic advocacy group holding its annual convention this week in San Diego.
Navarrete noted that while Latinos make up about 11 percent of the U.S.
population, they comprised only 5 percent of the electorate in the last national
election. Among reasons for the disparity: the relative youth of the nation's
Hispanics and citizenship and naturalization problems.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tino Martinez broke an 0-for-15 slump with a
single and three-run double today that helped Orlando Hernandez and the
struggling New York Yankees beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-1. With owner George
Steinbrenner in attendance, the Yankees won for only the third time in nine
games. He also got to see a bench-clearing brawl, started when Tampa Bay's Bobby
Smith tangled with catcher Jorge Posada.

<HEADLINE> Israel Complains to UN Over Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has complained to United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Lebanon has not fulfilled its
part of a U.N. resolution outlining an Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon, a spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli delegation to the United Nations sent a letter to
Annan complaining that the Lebanese army had not deployed in south
Lebanon since Israel's May 24 withdrawal, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aviv Shiron said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lebanese authorities are located on Israel's side
of the border in some places, Shiron added.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are parts where it appears that they haven't abided by
the border the United Nations set,'' Shiron said. ''We are
demanding they comply with resolution 425.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's pull out, Lebanon has also accused Israel of not
complying in full with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations approval of the withdrawal on June 16 was
held up over Lebanese complaints that Israeli troops were still
located in Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. peacekeeping force later cited minor Israeli violations
such as military patrols on roads in Lebanon and Israeli
machine-gun posts on Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, demonstrating Lebanese have frequently
thrown stones across the border at Israeli soldiers who have
occasionally responded with gunfire, injuring some.
</P>
<P>
   But the border area has been relatively quiet since the
pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had feared that the anti-Israeli guerrilla group,
Hezbollah, would resume attacks on Israeli targets after the
withdrawal, which created a political and security vacuum in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has sent some armed forces and police to
south Lebanon to keep order but has not deployed along the
temporary border set by the United Nations until any agreement in
future negotiations irons out a final border.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is slated to deploy 4,500 peacekeeping troops
in south Lebanon once the disagreement over the alleged violations
of both sides have been cleared up.

<HEADLINE> Man guilty of lesser charges in Montclair rape trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - A Newark man on Friday was acquitted of
serious sexual assault charges in a 1998 attack on a 15-year-old
girl at the Montclair State University campus.
</P>
<P>
   A jury instead convicted Antwain Curry of having sex with an
underage girl and of endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, 22, had been charged with aggravated sexual assault in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was among three men who followed the girl into the woods
the night of Sept. 19. The girl had been drinking alcohol and had
been smoking marijuana. Authorities said she bet the men she could
finish two bottles of alcohol and still walk around the campus
athletic track.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony during the trial indicated that in the woods, the girl
passed out, two of the men fondled her and Curry undressed her and
had sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who is being held in Passaic County Jail, will be
sentenced Oct. 6. Each of the charges carry possible prison terms
of five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Had Curry been found guilty of the sexual assault charge, he
would have faced a possible 20-year-term.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Chief Assistant Prosecutor Joseph Del Russo
said jurors may have gotten the impression the girl was willing to
have sex with the men because of testimony that said she had been
flirting with them.
</P>
<P>
   Under plea deals, two people testified against Curry in the
trial. Joseph Koehler, 24, of Newark, a co-defendant, received a
four-year prison term in exchange for his testimony. The other man
in the woods that night, John Carmelo, who hosted the party,
received a no-jail term for serving alcohol to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Another man is awaiting trial in the assault. Sam Damato, 23, of
Lyndhurst, is charged with trying to force the girl to perform oral
sex that night. Damato also could face charges of rape after a
witness said he saw Damato have sex with the girl. Damato's
attorney has denied those charges.

<HEADLINE> Royals Honor Wilson, Herzog  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Whitey Herzog, the winningest manager in
Kansas City Royals history, and former batting champion Willie
Wilson were inducted into the team's Hall of Fame Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, an outfielder drafted in 1974, hit over .300 for four
straight seasons starting in 1979 and stole more than 30 bases in
11 straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog managed the Royals to three straight AL West titles
starting in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't until 1976, Whitey Herzog's first full season as
manager, that the Royals became champions,'' Royals owner David
Glass said while making the introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1976, '77, '78 AL West champion Royals were a reflection
of Whitey's personality. They thrilled fans with their hard-nosed,
aggressive style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who managed the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series
title after getting fired in Kansas City, said his biggest thrill
in baseball was leading the Royals to the 1976 division
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be a successful manager,'' Herzog told the crowd, ''you
have to have a lot of help. A good organization, people who give
you 100 percent. You have to have a wife who's behind you. You have
to have your whole family behind you. But most of all, you have to
have fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson became only the second player in baseball history to get
100 hits from each side of the plate in 1980, and wound up with a
league-leading 230 hits. He was the AL batting champion in 1982
with a .332 average.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very wonderful for me,'' Wilson said. ''I'm so honored
and proud to be inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson completed his 19-year career in 1994 with a .285 career
average and 668 stolen bases. He was one of three outfielders
selected by fans to the Royals' 25th anniversary team in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time, I didn't think I belonged here as a major
league ballplayer. But with the support of the Royals and you fans,
you made a dream come true,'' he said. ''I've had some good times
here, some bad times. But all in all, I wouldn't change a thing.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Free-Agent Season Begins  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Igor Larionov began the NHL's free-agent season,
signing a
one-year contract with the Florida Panthers Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Russian, who spent five seasons with the Detroit
Red Wings and helped them win two Stanley Cups, chose the Panthers
over the Calgary Flames. He signed a one-year deal worth $1.8
million with a club option for 2001-2002 at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that his poise and character, along with what he
can add to our younger players in the organization, is well worth
bringing him on board,'' Panthers general manager Bryan Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Anaheim agreed to a multiyear deal with Russian
center German Titov. Titov, 34, played with Pittsburgh and Edmonton
last season, scoring 17 goals in 70 games.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL released its official free agent list Saturday, one of
the least impressive in years.
</P>
<P>
   That's unless a team is willing to give up five first-round
draft picks for a talented restricted free agent like Joe Sakic,
Jason Arnott or Saku Koivu.
</P>
<P>
   That's unlikely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, teams looking for an immediate upgrade will look at the
unrestricted free-agent crop, players 31 and over whose skills are
on the decline but whose salary demands remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unrestricted free agents are forwards Gary Roberts,
Shayne Corson, Claude Lemieux and Mark Messier, defensemen Vladimir
Malakhov, Paul Coffey, Sean Hill, Larry Murphy and Mathieu
Schneider, and goaltenders Ron Tugnutt and Tom Barasso.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a banner year in free agency, but that doesn't mean
we can't find somebody who can help us in the short term,'' Anaheim
Mighty Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier said. ''We're going to
look at free agency carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Big-spending teams like the Red Wings and New York Rangers will
find it difficult to sign more than one player.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a great crop of free agents,'' Red Wings GM Ken
Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, unrestricted free agents Theo Fleury and Valeri
Kamensky get big-money contracts from the Rangers. Both were major
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a lot of guys get contracts based on what they did
in the past, and then they never did anything else,'' Gauthier
said. ''You have to project in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It's inevitable that new Rangers GM Glen Sather will be phoning
Doug Messier, Mark Messier's father and agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that Doug Messier and I will be speaking,'' Sather
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt's short stint with the Pittsburgh Penguins appears over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect to test the market,'' Pat Morris, Tugnutt's agent,
said. ''It doesn't appear that Pittsburgh is interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt made $552,500 last season but hopes to earn more than
$1.5 million with his new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts could be the most sought-after player. The Carolina
Hurricanes have offered Roberts a three-year contract, something
other teams might not be willing to give a 13-year veteran with a
history of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made it clear that we will pay him the going rate for a
player at his position,'' GM Jim Rutherford said, ''and he has
chosen not to take the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakic, the Colorado Avalanche's all-time leading scorer, missed
becoming an unrestricted free agent by six days. Players who are 31
by Saturday are in that category, and Sakic's 31st birthday isn't
until July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic has spent all 12 of his NHL seasons with the
Quebec/Colorado franchise, and he would like to end his career with
the Avalanche. That still could happen, but he is seeking about $8
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic is eligible to file for binding salary arbitration and
accept a one-year contract. That way, he can become an unrestricted
free agent next summer.
</P>
<P>
   One player who isn't an unrestricted free agent his year is Eric
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers weren't about to take a chance of losing
Lindros for nothing, and on Friday they submitted an $8.5 million
qualifying offer to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, his career in jeopardy because of a series of
concussions, has until Aug. 1 to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric Lindros is one of the top players in the game and is an
integral part of the Flyers organization,'' Philadelphia president
and general manager Bob Clarke said. ''We are hopeful that he will
enjoy a complete recovery and return to play at the high level to
which we have become accustomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has had six concussions in his NHL career, the most
recent on a check by New Jersey's Scott Stevens in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals May 26.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Second in Tour Time Trial  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong got off to a good
start in defense of his Tour de France title with a second-place
finish Saturday in the opening time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's David Millar was the winner of the stage, a 10.3-mile
sprint. He was timed in 19 minutes, 3 seconds, just 2 second faster
than the American in a race against the clock around a futuristic
theme park in western France.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong temporarily relinquished his yellow jersey, but
finished well ahead of Germany's Jan Ullrich, Switzerland's Alex
Zulle and Italy's Marco Pantani, all considered possible threats to
his title.
</P>
<P>
   France's Laurent Jalabert finished third, 13 seconds behind the
leader, while Ullrich, the 1997 champion, was another second back.
</P>
<P>
   Zulle, second overall last year, finished sixth, 20 seconds
behind the leader. Pantani, the 1998 champion, was well back in
136th place, 2:36 behind.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning victory for Millar, the only Briton in the
race. He's a time-trial specialist, but was not expected to win in
such a star-studded field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never really thought about the possibility of getting
yellow,'' said Millar, who planned to sleep Saturday night in his
jersey. ''To beat someone like Lance surprised me greatly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to believe it until I saw him crossing the line.
Beating him in one of his specialties was very moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, as defending champion, was last to race and knew
exactly what he had to do. At the first time check, he had the best
time, but just failed to beat Millar in the end.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the same venue last year -- Futuroscope Park -- that
Armstrong, on the Tour's next-to-last stage, won a time trial to
virtually assure his overall victory, just three years after being
diagnosed with testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer had spread to his brain and lungs, and doctors gave
him only a 50-percent chance of survival. After surgery and
intensive chemotherapy, he returned to cycling.
</P>
<P>
   His victory by more than seven minutes last year in cycling's
showcase event, confounded doctors, rivals and teammates. On his
way to victory, he won all three time trials.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Armstrong knew another win would leave his rivals --
some of whom branded his 1999 victory a fluke -- psychologically
scarred before the real road racing begins.
</P>
<P>
   But competition is stiffer, with the return of Italian Marco
Pantani and Ullrich, both past Tour winners.
</P>
<P>
   Road racing begins on Sunday with a 120-mile trek from
Futuroscope to Loudun in northwest France. The Tour ends July 23 in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Tour officials were hoping that year's race would help repair
cycling's battered image following the 1998 doping debacle when
teams were kicked out after admitting to widespread drug abuse and
police raided hotels searching for banned substances.
</P>
<P>
   But three of the 180 riders were expelled on Saturday, just
hours before the first stage was to begin. Ousted were Russian
Sergei Ivanov, Italian Rossano Brasi and Slovenian Andrej Hauptman.
</P>
<P>
   All failed a mandatory blood test aimed at detecting the use of
erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the
production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Riders who are found to have a red blood cell count above 50
percent are given a compulsory 15-day ban on health grounds.

<HEADLINE> Bush Greets NASCAR Racers, Fans  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush's race for the
presidency made a brief pit stop in the world of car racing
Saturday night, as he came here to shake hands with NASCAR fans,
racing crews and drivers -- people he said ''work for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of stock car racing is made up of ''very good
Americans,'' the Texas governor said. As he walked around the
garage area, crews took short breaks from getting cars ready for
the Pepsi 400, a night race, to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   ''They not only talk about family values, they live it,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the stop wasn't a campaign event, but a diversion from
the campaign. Bush flew in from his Crawford, Texas, ranch near
Waco to serve as grand marshal, but he went into campaign mode
shortly after arriving in the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   He signed shirts already covered with race car sponsors' logos
and briefly talked fishing with a racing fan who urged him to
protect fresh water lakes for fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was hoping his stop at the race works out better for him
than for his father. The former president was grand marshal while
running unsuccessfully for re-election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is the third in his family to hold the
ceremonial post at the race. His brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush,
was the grand marshal while he was running for office in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he didn't want to talk about policy during the stop,
although he was scheduled to meet privately with some supporters
before watching the race in the private box of NASCAR president
Bill France.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not interested in any political speeches in the middle
of the race, and I'm not going to give any,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But he took the opportunity to use the NASCAR backdrop as a
symbol of middle-class American values on the Fourth of July
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the people that work for a living,'' he said over
the din of country music as he looked around the garage area.
''This is America.''
</P>
<P>
   After greeting fans, Bush sat in on the pre-race driver's
meeting, taking a seat in the front row next to driver Dale
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the drivers that they were important in a country
''starved for role models.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Missile Attack Kills One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Assailants launched crude missiles outside
police headquarters in Colombia's third-largest city Saturday,
killing one passer-by and wounding at least 11 others.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which
was similar to ones previously carried out by the country's main
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Four explosive devices were launched from the back of a pickup
truck parked next to the police headquarters in downtown Cali. One
landed on a car passing by on the street, exploded and killed the
driver, said Cali Mayor Ricardo Cobo. Another landed on the street
and blew up, injuring pedestrians. The other two missiles did not
detonate upon landing.
</P>
<P>
   Police Gen. Tobias Duran Quintanilla said the assailants were
''terrorists who attack everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobo blamed ''subversive elements'' for the attack but did not
specify whether he believed the FARC was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles were composed of explosives wrapped around a gas
cylinder. They are launched by a primary explosion and are
difficult to aim. The FARC has used such missiles in previous
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   None of the missiles landed inside the police compound, and no
police officers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the blast in the city in southwestern Colombia, TV
news broadcast live images of the dead man lying inside his
shredded car and paramedics attending to wounded people on the
sidewalk. Gun-toting policemen milled around.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist FARC has been fighting successive Colombian
governments for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes as the United States is sending $1.3 billion in
aid to beef up Colombian security forces who plan an offensive on
regions that produce cocaine and heroin. The FARC earns as much as
hundreds of millions of dollars a year providing protection for the
drug producers.

<HEADLINE> Old box of bones found in Odd Fellows hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITEHALL, N.Y. (AP) - How odd.
</P>
<P>
   Digging into a renovation project at the 133-year-old
Independent Order of Odd Fellows building, Nils Lommerin discovered
a 5-foot-long box, topped with a metal plaque that read ''Brother''
and containing a partial set of human bones.
</P>
<P>
   The bones - a skull, ribs, and various arm and leg bones - were
discovered by a carpet layer under a trap door in the order's
meeting room, in a spot where the floor had been framed to fit the
miniature casket.
</P>
<P>
   Work on that floor of the building was apparently last done in
1899, said Lommerin's fiancee, Marlo Jones, leading the pair to
speculate the bones had been there for more than a century. The
Whitehall Odd Fellows chapter stopped meeting in the 1960s in the
building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive organization - which dates to 18th century England
and early 19th century America - still has active chapters around
the country, particularly in the Midwest and New England.
</P>
<P>
   The state police Bureau of Criminal Investigation will perform a
forensic exam to see if foul play was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Lommerin and Jones told the Post-Star of Glens Falls they would
like the bones back after the investigation, arguing they are part
of the building's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to put them right back where they were,'' Jones said.
''This has always been his burial place. This is where he
belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehall is 65 miles north of Albany.

Mexican Ruling Party Faces Accusations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the eve of a tight presidential race, observers and
opposition activists today stepped up accusations against Mexico's ruling party
-- charging it with using the power of the state to illegally influence voting.
The allegations involved scattered incidents, small amounts of money or claims
of pressure on government employees or aid recipients. Officials of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dismissed most of the reports as
misunderstandings or the result of newspapers' desperation for stories in the
three-day period before the election, when candidates are banned from
campaigning.

   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Two people have been killed and at least
another 80 injured after a terrace at an island winery in Lake Erie collapsed
this afternoon. The terrace collapsed at the Lonz Winery on an island about 5
miles off the mainland. A dispatcher at the police department in nearby Port
Clinton said the collapse occurred about 5 p.m. Emergency personnel were called
in from as far away as Toledo, Cleveland and Bowling Green. The Coast Guard said
a 47-foot motor lifeboat was at the scene and two more rescue boats were

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has complained to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that Lebanon has not fulfilled its part of a U.N. resolution outlining an
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, a spokesman said Saturday. The Israeli
delegation to the United Nations sent a letter to Annan complaining that the
Lebanese army had not deployed in south Lebanon since Israel's May 24
withdrawal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said. In addition, Lebanese
authorities are located on Israel's side of the border in some places, Shiron

Confederate Flag Taken Down in S.C.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After decades of debate and mounting pressure from an
NAACP boycott, South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from atop its
Statehouse today in a somber ceremony that paid tribute to its Civil War roots.
The flag, seen as a reminder of slavery for some and a tribute to Southern
heritage for others, flew atop the dome for 38 years. But protests over the flag
continued even as it was being lowered: Civil War re-enactors raised another
Confederate flag on Statehouse grounds, in front of a Confederate soldier's
monument. The new location was part of the compromise reached by the Legislature
in May.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A jury has awarded $3.3 million to a man whose doctor

herniated disk that was supposed to be replaced by bone from his hip. Instead, a
healthy disk below it was removed, witnesses testified. Attorneys for

finished well ahead of Germany's Jan Ullrich, Switzerland's Alex Zulle and
Italy's Marco Pantani, all considered possible threats to his title.

<HEADLINE> Castro Warns Next U.S. President  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANZANILLO, Cuba (AP) -- Fidel Castro defiantly warned the next
U.S. president Saturday not to try to defeat his socialist
revolution, as the Cuban government launched a new series of mass
demonstrations after Elian Gonzalez's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever may be the new president of the United States should
know that Cuba is and will be here with its ideas, its example, and
the unbendable rebellion of its people,'' Castro wrote in a letter
read before hundreds of thousands of people gathered to protest
U.S. policies. ''All aggression and attempts to asphyxiate us and
reduce us to our knees will be conquered.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gen. Raul Castro, head of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
and Fidel Castro's younger brother, a sea of people vigorously
waved small red, white and blue Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who think we are ending should know that we are
beginning!'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told the Cubans
who massed in this southeastern coastal city for the first large
rally organized since Elian's low-key homecoming Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perez Roque congratulated Cuban citizens on their success in the
return of Elian and his father to the communist country, eliciting
a huge cheer from the crowd, which the government estimated at more
than 300,000. ''It is a victory of the people!'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised repeatedly in recent months that
once the boy returned, the marches, rallies and televised
round-table discussions would go on.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the events will focus not on the 6-year-old,
but on U.S. immigration policies and trade sanctions that the Cuban
government says harm its people.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also wrote that Cubans don't care who wins the coming
presidential elections in the United States and said that
candidates are wasting their time trying to win the Cuban-American
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is useless to invest unnecessary time in the declarations
and promises made against Cuba to obtain the vote of just a few
people who have no country of their own, who even dare to step on
and burn the American flag,'' Castro said. He was referring to the
angry actions of some Cuban exiles in Miami after the federal raid
that reunited Elian with his father in April.
</P>
<P>
   In rare comments to reporters afterward, Raul Castro said that
media coverage of the battle over Elian had helped Americans better
understand Cuba and its people. Because of that increased
understanding, ''the second chapter will also be a triumph,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more there are thousands of American tourists coming
to Cuba,'' said Raul Castro, first in the line of succession after
his brother. He also noted increased American interest in doing
business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba organized more than 100 such rallies in the seven months
that Elian was in the United States, calling out hundreds of
thousands of Cubans from around the country to show popular support
for bringing the boy home.
</P>
<P>
   The gatherings have been used occasionally as a showcase for
Americans sympathetic to Cuba. On Saturday, the son of death-row
inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, Mazi Jamal, thanked Cubans for supporting
his father's attempts to obtain a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal was convicted of murder in the 1981 shooting death of
a Philadelphia police officer, but maintains his innocence and the
case is under appeal. ''With that support I know my father will one
day be free as your child Elian is free,'' Jamal said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family remained out of public view Saturday. They
are staying at a specially prepared boarding school in Havana,
where they will live for two or three weeks along with Elian's
classmates and teachers. Later, they will return to their hometown,
a small port city east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba blames a U.S. law called the Cuban Adjustment Act for the
international custody battle over Elian. After he was hospitalized
following his rescue from the Atlantic Ocean in late November,
Elian was allowed to stay in the United States under the 1966 law,
which allows Cubans who reach American soil to seek permanent
residency.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba maintains the policy encourages Cubans to make risky
voyages across the Florida Straits, such as the one that Elian
embarked on with his mother and 12 others.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was one of three survivors from the boatwreck that killed
his mother and thrust him into a custody dispute between his father
in Cuba and his relatives in Miami, who wanted him to remain in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars 2, Mutiny 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The New York-New Jersey MetroStars got goals
from Mark Chung and Petter Villegas and took over sole possession
of first place in Major League Soccer's Eastern Division with a 2-0
win over the Tampa Bay Mutiny on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey, which has won seven of 10 games, holds a
three-point lead over second place New England. This is the latest
into a season that the MetroStars have been in first.
</P>
<P>
   Chung scored in the 38th minute, sending a left-footed shot from
25 yards just inside the post. Daniel Hernandez picked up his first
assist since Sept. 5, 1998 on Chung's second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Chung left in the 52nd minute when he bruised his right heel
taking a shot that hit the post.
</P>
<P>
   Villegas scored in the 86th minute for New York-New Jersey
(9-7-2), which is 8-1-1 when scoring the game's first goal. The
MetroStars have won three straight road games.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay nearly took the early lead, but Eric Quill's in-close
shot hit the post during the 14th minute. The Mutiny's Mamadou
Diallo (MLS-best 16 goals) and Carlos Valderrama (league-leading 18
assists) were held in check by the MetroStars defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny (10-9-0), tied for first place in the Central
Division with Chicago, have dropped three consecutive home games.
Tampa Bay started the season 6-0 at home.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars were without German National Team midfielder
Lothar Matthaus (lower back strain), starting goalkeeper Mike
Ammann (midback strain) and defender Thomas Dooley (left
hamstring).

<HEADLINE> Board Announces Start of Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TOOTHAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS,Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's National Election Council
announced Saturday the start of the official election campaign and
called on candidates to respect the nation's electoral law.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Pizani, a member of the Election Council, urged
candidates to conform to campaign rules because it is impossible to
sanction violators.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way in which the laws and the regulations are
observed is if the candidates behave like good citizens,'' Pizani
said.
</P>
<P>
   The election has ignited passions and pitted two former coup
leaders against each other in the race for president of this
oil-rich yet poverty-stricken nation of 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez, who leads recent polls, is competing
against Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former brother-in-arms who
helped him lead a failed 1992 coup attempt and later turned against
him for abandoning their revolutionary ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Arias held a rally Thursday in downtown Caracas to denounce a
decision to break up an election -- originally slated for May 28 --
that would have encompassed every public office in the country.
Computer problems in the balloting system delayed the election.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that a single vote might overwhelm ballot counters and
confuse voters led the nation's interim legislature last week to
split the postponed elections and rescheduled them for two separate
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential, gubernatorial, congressional, and regional
elections will be July 30; town council elections were rescheduled
for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are central to President Chavez's efforts to
remake the Venezuelan government and ''re-legitimize'' every public
office as required by a new constitution that the popular head of
state pushed through last year.

<HEADLINE> Calcavecchia Leads Greater Hartford  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) -- A three-week vacation -- and some timely
putting -- worked wonders for Mark Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 British Open champion shot his second straight
6-under-par 64 on Saturday to take a three-stroke lead after the
third round of the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I come back, I'm excited to play,'' said Calcavecchia,
who spent the break relaxing with his family, bowling and watching
movies. ''That's basically what happened here. Of course it doesn't
hurt when you make a lot of putts, either.''
</P>
<P>
   He rolled in birdie putts of between 12 and 40 feet. His
downhill 40-footer on the par-4 second hole even impressed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was beautiful. Perfect speed. It just looked good the whole
way,'' he said. ''I was like 'wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia has nine tour victories, but hasn't won in two
years. His 17-under 193 total broke the 54-hole tournament record
of 195 set last year by defending champ Brent Geiberger.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round co-leader Notah Begay, struggled early in the round
but finished with a 67 for sole possession of second place at 14
under. Kirk Triplett broke the course record with a 9-under 61 to
move into a third-place tie with Edward Fryatt at 13 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be lying to you if I told you I wasn't a little nervous
out there. And I'll be a little nervous tomorrow,'' said
Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've won tournaments before. Three shots is better than
two, better than one and better than being behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia birdied the first two holes, then ran off a string
birdies on Nos. 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   His only stumble was on the par-4 17th. He tried to hit an easy
7-iron on his approach but pushed it right of the green. The ball
landed on the back slope of the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have hit a hard 8-iron,'' Calcavecchia said. ''But
when you're trying to win a golf tournament, you've got a little
adrenaline going and I pushed it way right. But that pin was
staring me right there in the face. It was probably the worst iron
shot I hit all week.''
</P>
<P>
   He opted to putt it up and left the ball about 18 feet away, and
two-putted for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was tough. I was going to chip it but unless I caught it
perfect it would have gone all the way down to other side to the
far left edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, 40, has six top-10 finishes in the GHO since 1981.
Begay, in his second year on tour, missed the cut in his first
appearance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Begay, coming off a victory last week in the St. Jude Classic in
Memphis, Tenn., made his only two bogeys on the front nine and lost
ground early to Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark came out of the gates just overwhelmingly strong. If I
were a rookie, I probably would have gotten flustered and tried to
do something I didn't need to do,'' Begay said. ''Instead I just
stayed patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett's 61 broke the mark of 62 on the 6,820-yard TPC at
River Highlands shared by five players. He began the day 4 under
and seven strokes behind Calcavecchia and Begay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed to stay in contact with these guys and not let them
get that far ahead,'' Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett's round included a 60-foot birdie put on No. 9 and
birdies on Nos. 16 and 17, where he bogeyed and double-bogeyed a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring conditions have been near perfect all week, with little
wind and soft greens. Calcavecchia said he expects more of the same
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Kirk Triplett shoot 61, Notah's playing great. He's
going to keep making birdies out there,'' Calcavecchia said. ''I've
got to keep pace with him and just keep making birdies and I'll be
fine.''

   MINNESOTA: OF Matt Lawton, a career .264 hitter, entered
Saturday night's game 10th in the AL with a .340 average. ''Before
the season, the manager (Tom Kelly) told me he wanted me to hit
third and I took it as a big responsibility,'' Lawton said. ''I try
to work on my game every day and take a lot of batting practice.''
... SS Cristian Guzman leads the majors with 12 triples, four off
the club record by Hall of Famer Rod Carew in 1977. ... LHP Jason
Miller, the Twins' fourth-round draft pick, signed. Minnesota has
signed 23 of its 52 picks. ... Twins CEO Chris Clouser attended the
game.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: OF Kenny Lofton and SS Omar Vizquel were dropped from
the top two spots in the lineup to the bottom, with 2B Roberto
Alomar moved from the third spot to leadoff. ''We still have our
speed lined up,'' manager Charlie Manuel said. ''I talked to both
of them about it and they were very receptive. It was time for a
change.'' Lofton, in an 0-for-19 slump, said: ''This is something
that needed to be done. Hopefully it will take a little pressure
off myself and Omar and give our lineup a kick-start. As the top of
the lineup goes, we all go.'' ... Manuel said that RHP Charles
Nagy, who allowed one hit in six scoreless innings in a
rehabilitation start Friday night at Double-A Akron, will not be
activated until after the All-Star break.

   NEW YORK: David Justice is 0-for-6 since joining the Yankees
after Thursday's trade with Cleveland. ... Derek Jeter, 1-for-5
Saturday after going hitless the night before, has hit safely in 27

   TAMPA BAY: Switch-hitting CF Randy Winn is batting left-handed
this weekend for the first time since being recalled from Triple-A
Durham on May 28. He had been limited to batting right-handed since
spraining his left wrist in early May ... Reliever Rick White
entered the game with two on and no outs in the sixth and retired
three batters in a row. He has only allowed three of 24 inherited
runners to score this season.
Blue Jays-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Raul Mondesi hit his 19th homer in the first inning
Saturday, a 388-foot shot to left at Camden Yards. It was his
second home run since being sidelined Sunday and Tuesday with a
strained left wrist. ... Chris Carpenter had allowed a first-inning
run in eight of 10 starts before a 1-2-3 first Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: 3B Ryan Minor was a late scratch Saturday after
pulling a muscle in his side during early batting practice. He was
replaced by Jeff Conine. ... Rookie Luis Matos started in CF for

with the Gulf Coast League Tigers. The Tigers have signed 30 of
their 43 picks.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY: After breaking the team record for consecutive
errorless games by a shortstop, Rey Sanchez is aiming at the club
record for fewest errors by a shortstop in a season. Sanchez, who
has one error this year, will need to total fewer than nine to
overcome the record by Angel Salazar. ... Former OF Willie Wilson

Hall of Fame in pregame ceremonies.
Red Sox-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox, desperate for outfield help with Darren
Lewis joining Troy O'Leary and Trot Nixon on the DL, are going to
work out Bernard Gilkey, who was released by Arizona. Manager Jimy
Williams said Gilkey will work out Sunday and Monday before the Red
Sox decide whether to sign him. ... The Red Sox were busy Saturday,
recalling RHP Paxton Crawford from Triple-A Pawtucket and sending
LHP San Hoon-Lee to the same team. RHP Jason Sekany was designated
for assignment to open up a roster spot for newly acquired Ed
Sprague. ... Boston's team-record streak of giving up a homer was
stopped at 15 games Saturday.

   CHICAGO: RHP Kip Wells was sent back to the minors for a second
time. He'd lost four of his last five decisions and was 4-7 with a
6.03 ERA. ''He doesn't have a lot of experience against good teams.
He just needs to get his confidence back,'' Chicago starter and
winner Mike Sirotka said Saturday of Wells. ''We hope he can get it
turned around,'' Chicago manager Jerry Manuel said. ''The next time
we bring him back we want to keep him here the rest of his
career.'' The White Sox did not immediately announce a roster move
to fill Wells' roster spot. Manuel said the team could bring up a
position player since outfielders Magglio Ordonez and Jeff Abbott
have minor injuries. ... The White Sox are now 9-1-1 in their last
11 series after winning the first two games and clinching the
three-game set against Boston.
Mariners-Rangers:

mark in the majors for that month. The Chicago White Sox were 20-7
in June. ... Since the three division realignment prior to the 1994
season, Seattle has the best record in intra-division play among
the four AL West rivals. The Mariners entered Saturday night with a
123-104 mark in the division. Anaheim was second at 115-113.
</P>

   TEXAS: The Rangers' 13-3 victory over the Mariners on Friday
night was their largest margin of victory since a 10-0 victory over
Seattle on Sept. 28, 1999. The losing pitcher in that game was John
Halama, who was also tagged with the defeat on Friday night. ...
Even though they won the last three games in June, the Rangers
finished the month at 10-15 (.400), their fewest wins and lowest

Pirates-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates went 11-16 last July and lost catcher

started 42 of Atlanta's 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Biking for the cycle: Derek Bell travels to Shea
Stadium by bicycle these days. He's living on his boat, moored at
the marina beyond the Shea Stadium parking lot, and pedaled to
Saturday's game on a bike borrowed from the New York Police
Department. ... New York is 14-2 when Al Leiter starts. ... Mike
Piazza is batting .367 (29-for-79) during his 19-game hitting

second-longest in the NL this season. Arizona's Tony Womack had a
24-game hitting streak.
Cubs-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs' maligned bullpen made huge strides in June.
After posting a 6.96 ERA through the seasons first two months, the
unit had a 2.99 ERA in June. The arrivals of Todd Van Poppel on May
12 (2-2, 1.67 ERA), Tim Worrell on May 27 (0-1, 1.65 ERA) and Steve
Rain on June 16 (1-0, 1.50 ERA), all from the minors, have made
major impacts. ... Eric Young tied two single-game team records in
Friday's 5-hour, 31-minute, 15-inning game -- most times reaching
base (seven) and most walks drawn (five). ... The Cubs have played
extra-inning games on consecutive nights three times.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers purchased the contract of OF Chris Jones
from Triple-A Indianapolis and optioned OF Lyle Mouton back down.

the job in spot duty against left-handed pitching. ... The average
time of game between the Brewers and Cubs this year was 4:15
through their first five meetings.
Astros-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros have already used 16 pitchers this season
after using just 15 all last year. ... The NL's winningest pitcher,

for the second straight day.
Reds-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Manager Jack McKeon said injuries to Ken Griffey Jr.
and Pokey Reese on Saturday were not serious, and that Griffey
didn't want to come out of the game. .... In 14 games at Bank One
Ballpark, Dante Bichette is hitting .400 with five home runs and 14
RBIs. ... Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young had to be pulled away from home
plate umpire Paul Emmel when he was called for a third strike on
Byung-Hyun Kim's 3-2 pitch to end the game. ... Griffey is 0-for-5
so far in the Arizona series.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Alex Cabrera, who pulled a groin muscle running out
an RBI double, is to evaluated on Sunday to determine the
seriousness of the injury. The Diamondbacks already have 1B Erubiel
Durazo on the DL with a sore wrist. ... The Diamondbacks finally
beat the Reds in Bank One Ballpark after going 0-7 against
Cincinnati there since the franchise began play. ... RHP Vincente
Padilla joined Jason Conti and Cabrera as Arizona players who got
hits in their first major league at-bats in the past week. Cabrera
homered in his first at-bat Monday, Conti singled Tuesday and
Padilla singled Saturday.
Dodgers-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Former Dodger All-Stars Tommy Davis and Ron Cey
participated in a pregame home run hitting contest for charity, but
neither hit one out in 10 pitches each. Davis came the closest with
a one-hopper to the left-field fence. ... RHP Gregg Olson pitched
one scoreless inning for Class A San Bernardino on Friday in his
first rehab outing in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Former Giants Dave Kingman, Jeffrey Leonard, Mike
Ivie, Jack Clark, Bobby Bonds and Kevin Mitchell took part in a
pregame home run hitting contest for charity. They combined for 11
homers, with Mitchell, who plays for the independent Sonoma County
Crushers of the Western Baseball League, leading the way with four.
He also hit the longest. ''You can't stop those guys from hitting
home runs,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker, who declined to
participate. ... Baker made it official on Saturday that RHP Mark
Gardner would start the second game of the day-night doubleheader
against the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Gardner threw 56 pitches
in relief of RHP Russ Ortiz on Friday night, but Baker was assured
Gardner would be ready.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Seeks Quick Return from DL  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken expects to his latest trip to the
disabled list to be a short one. He's not nearly as sure about his
status for the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was placed on the 15-day disabled list Wednesday with
pain in his lower back. It was the third time in two seasons that
the Baltimore Orioles' third baseman was sidelined with a back
injury.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Ripken might be considering
retirement after his latest bout with back problems, but the future
Hall of Famer laid that rumor to rest Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''My big goal is to be ready when the 15 days are up,'' said
Ripken, who watched the Orioles play Toronto from the press box.
''Hopefully I'll heal up and be good as new after 15 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is scheduled to come off the disabled list on July 13,
but the All-Star game will be held two days earlier in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials have said Ripken could play in his 18th
straight All-Star game if he's elected by the fans and if he and
the Orioles want it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''First and foremost, my health and how I feel is the most
important thing,'' he said. ''Sitting here right now two days after
the (cortisone) shot and being in pretty good pain, I can't really
consider that as an option. But I would imagine that, knock on
wood, in a week's time if I start to feel good and the pain is gone
and I'm able to resume some sort of activities ... I don't think it
would be too far-fetched if I was totally fine. But it wouldn't be
worth the risk if I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken set a major league record by playing in 2,632 games
before voluntarily ending the streak in September 1998. Last season
was the most difficult of his career, as he twice went on the
disabled list with back problems before undergoing surgery Sept. 23
to decompress nerve root irritation in his back.
</P>
<P>
   He was given periodic rest this season, but hurt himself running
out a grounder Tuesday night in Boston and was placed on the
disabled list the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same problem I've been dealing with for a while, a
very agitated nerve that runs down my leg. The treatment is to let
the medicine from the shot decrease the inflammation, rest and
spend as little time on my feet as I can the next seven to 10
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching his teammates play never gets any easier for the man
who supplanted Lou Gehrig as baseball's Iron Man.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year I got a feel of what it's like to be away from the
playing field. To sit there and watch the game, it's frustrating,''
he said. ''It seems like you're left out, not doing what you want
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He entered this season on the brink of getting his 3,000th hit,
a feat that occurred on April 15 in Minnesota. But reaching that
milestone was merely a secondary objective for the 39-year-old
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going into the season, quietly my biggest goal was not going
on the disabled list again,'' he said. ''As luck would have it, I
didn't quite make it.''

<HEADLINE> Still No Sign of Indonesian Ferry  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANADO, Indonesia (AP) -- With no trace of their loved ones,
anxious relatives could only cling to rumors Saturday about the
fate of a ferry missing with almost 500 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   After three days, a customs boat mistakenly reported locating
the wooden-hulled vessel off an islet north of the port of Manado,
on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island, taking the families on an emotional
rollercoaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spotted a ship from the air, but it wasn't the missing
ferry,'' said Cmdr. Djoko Sudaryono, head of the search-and-rescue
operation, after returning from a reconnaissance flight.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers were checking other unconfirmed sightings and claims,
including one from Christian clergymen that Muslim extremists had
hijacked the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything is possible. We are still looking,'' Sudaryono said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping disasters with large losses of life are common in
Indonesia, a nation of some 17,000 islands. Captains often overload
their poorly maintained vessels to maximize profits.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes and hopes of finding survivors fade, the search
has assumed an increasingly tense and desperate tone.
</P>
<P>
   A final air and search effort got under way Sunday. If nothing
is found, the search will be called off, Sudaryono said.
</P>
<P>
   Contact with the Cahaya Bahari was lost Thursday soon after its
captain radioed that it was taking on water in stormy seas 1,440
miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry was on a 200-mile voyage to Manado from the Maluku
Islands, a corner of the Indonesian archipelago where violence
between Muslims and Christians has killed almost 3,000 people of
both faiths in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Local maritime officials reported that the ferry was overloaded
with almost twice the number of passengers it was licensed to
carry. They presumed it went down soon after the distress call.
</P>
<P>
   But rescuers were puzzled that they have found no debris or
other signs of a sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about what happened was rife among scores of tearful
relatives who waited for news at Manado's rundown docks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are rumors everywhere. Some say the ferry was hijacked
back to the Malukus and that the passengers taken hostage by
Muslims,'' said Yudi Harnoya, whose wife was aboard. ''Others say
it sank straight to the bottom of the ocean. Then there are those
who say survivors are floating in the sea. This makes our situation
very tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudaryono said Sunday's search would move farther east and
closer to the Malukus, including around the island of Doi, where
one unconfirmed sighting was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's cash-strapped navy until now has been able to
dedicate only one aircraft to the operation. However, Sudaryono
said a total of four navy planes would be used along with four
warships and a flotilla of volunteer civilian craft Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 12, Blue Jays 5  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Harold Baines homered twice, and Will Clark and
Charles Johnson also connected as the Baltimore Orioles once again
beat Toronto, 12-5 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Baines hit a solo shot in the third inning and put Baltimore up
10-1 with a three-run drive in the fifth. It was the 13th two-homer
game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson (5-4) pitched an eight-hitter and tied his career
high with nine strikeouts to help Baltimore to its fourth win in
five games. Before their 8-3 victory Friday, the Orioles had lost
13 straight to the Blue Jays since April 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi homered for Toronto but left the game in the fifth
inning after injuring his right ankle chasing down a ball in right
field. The severity of the injury was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista hit a two-run homer in the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson came in 0-3 with a 10.19 ERA in four career starts
against Toronto, but he quickly settled down after allowing his
16th homer of the season, a solo shot by Mondesi in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson walked a batter in the ninth. He won for the first time
in four starts since June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (6-7) surrendered nine runs and seven hits,
including three homers, in 4 2-3 innings. He has allowed 23 earned
runs and 21 hits in 10 innings over his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   With the Blue Jays up 1-0 in the third, Albert Belle robbed
Homer Bush of a two-run shot with a leaping grab at the right-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore took a 5-1 lead in the fourth. Clark led off with his
fourth home run of the season, the second in two games, and Johnson
hit his 18th after Jeff Conine singled and Baines walked with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles sent nine men to the plate in a five-run fifth.
Belle drove in a run with a grounder and B.J. Surhoff singled in a
run before Baines greeted Matthew Dewitt with his eighth homer, a
three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woodward hit an RBI double and Brad Fullmer singled in a
run in the Toronto sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick doubled in a run and Clark hit an RBI single in the
eighth. Clark went 3-for-4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Carpenter, who had given up first-inning runs in eight of
his 10 previous starts, retired the first six batters in order. ...
Six of Baines' eight homers have been solo shots. ... The Blue Jays
are 3-14 in games in which they yield at least 10 runs.

<HEADLINE> Officials Find Cocaine on Freighter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- U.S. and Dutch authorities seized
3,080 pounds of cocaine on a Panamanian freighter bound for Spain,
the U.S. Coast Guard said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine -- with a U.S. street value of more than $100 million
-- was the third major shipment bound for Spain seized in the last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine was found on the MV Tiger, a 318-foot freighter
stopped Thursday by a Dutch Navy vessel 200 miles north of
Venezuela, the Coast Guard said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch vessel was on a routine patrol near Dutch Caribbean
territories.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter was carrying fish meal from Balboa, Panama, to
Marin, a port town in Galicia, Spain. The Galician coastline has
become a common entry point for South American and North African
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said U.S. Coast Guard officials aboard the Dutch
vessel became suspicious when they spotted streaks and scratches on
the freighter's aft section. Such marks can be left when cargo is
pulled on board while at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities boarded the ship and found 50 bales full of cocaine,
the Coast Guard said. The Panamanian government gave permission to
seize the vessel and detain the crew of 10 Ukrainians, three
Peruvians and a Venezuelan.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, Spanish Civil Guards with help from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency stopped a freighter near Martinique and found
more than two tons of cocaine bound for Galicia. Twenty-one people
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Spanish authorities found 440 pounds of cocaine on a
Panamanian-registered ship in southern port of Algeciras.

<HEADLINE> Terrace Collapse Kills 2 in Ohio  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- A concrete terrace loaded with
tourists collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie Saturday
afternoon, killing two people and injuring about 80, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a crack and I just dropped. It was like sliding down a
hill,'' said Wade Weaver, 23, of Gibsonburg. ''I kept thinking it
was like an earthquake hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse left a gaping hole in the floor of the lakefront
terrace at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a fortresslike
mansion on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just came loose and gave way,'' said Steve Ernst, 31, who
watched the floor crumble and drop. ''People pulled doors off
hinges to create backboards'' to carry the injured out the door of
a wine cellar where the victims and rubble fell. The cellar was
unoccupied but contained casks.
</P>
<P>
   The floor apparently collapsed under the weight of the people on
it, said John Blatt, mayor of the nearby island resort village of
Put-In-Bay.
</P>
<P>
   One person died at the scene and another on the way to a
hospital, Put-In-Bay Police Chief Jim Lang said. Pat McCloskey,
spokesman for the Ottawa County Emergency Management Agency, said
paramedics estimated 30 people were seriously injured but that most
were in stable condition in hospitals by evening.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said about 100 people were on the 25-by-20-foot terrace
where the 4-inch-thick floor collapsed. He said it fell 16 to 18
feet down.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the most seriously injured were flown by helicopter to
St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo. Hospital spokeswoman
Catharine Harned said five were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel were called in from as far away as
Cleveland, 60 miles away, and closer cities such as Toledo and
Bowling Green. The Coast Guard said a 47-foot motor lifeboat was at
the scene. Lang said more than 40 people were flown off the island
and the rest left by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The winery was closed after a dog searched the rubble and found
no additional victims, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lonz Winery sits on about 120 acres of a Lake Erie island
about 6 miles from the mainland. Only about 40 people live on
Middle Bass Island but as many as 1,500 visitors stay during busy
summer weekends.
</P>
<P>
   George Prusock, 25, of Mayfield Heights, was one of at least 30
injured people taken to Magruder Memorial Hospital in Port Clinton.
He said he was attending a bachelor party at the winery when the
terrace collapsed, injuring both his legs and trapping a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our buddy's last hurrah before he got married,''
Prusock said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next thing you know, the floor collapsed and he's under
the pop machine. The floor just dropped. Nobody had any time to
react.''
</P>
<P>
   The young adults who party at the winery buy bottles of wine
there and carry them to picnic tables, where they socialize as a
band plays '80s and '90s hits.
</P>
<P>
   Famous as a winery in the 19th century, the site hasn't been
used for growing grapes for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Its owners, Paramount Distilleries Inc., decided to sell it last
year, but are keeping the winery open while negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   The state is buying the site for $6.75 million for a park that
will feature nature trails and eventually could have a campground,
swimming beach and resort lodge.

1 Dead, Several Injured in Terrace Collapse

<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- A cement terrace loaded with tourists
collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie today, killing one person and
injuring dozens, authorities said. Coast Guard officials had earlier said that
two people were killed in the accident. The collapse left a gaping hole in the
floor of the lakefront terrace at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a

Rochester Hills, Mich., told WBNS-TV in Columbus. Paramedics estimated 30 people

Holiday Travelers Brave Gas Prices

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. ''It's the Fourth of July weekend. What are you going to
do -- stay home? Plans are all on,'' said Tom Woody of Madison, Wisc., as he
filled up his tank en route to a paddling trip in southern Wisconsin. Illinois
pump prices took a big dip today -- with Chicago prices falling below $2 a
gallon for the first time since Memorial Day -- as station owners began passing
along savings created by the state's lifting of a 5 percent sales tax on
gasoline.

presidential race since it was created as a party of power in 1929. For perhaps
the first time in a century, and perhaps the first time ever, Mexicans are
voting with a great uncertainty about who their next president will be. The PRI,

Cuba is and will be here with its ideas, its example, and the unbendable

2 Dead, Several Injured in Terrace Collapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIDDLE BASS ISLAND, Ohio (AP) -- A cement terrace loaded with tourists
collapsed at an island winery in Lake Erie today, killing two people and
injuring dozens, authorities said. The collapse left a gaping hole in the floor
of the lakefront terrace at Lonz Winery's century-old main building, a
fortresslike mansion on the National Register of Historic Places. ''The whole
deck just disappeared, it just fell,'' Barbara Kraft, visiting the island from
Rochester Hills, Mich., told WBNS-TV in Columbus. Paramedics estimated 30 people
were critically injured.

Holiday Travelers Brave Gas Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. ''It's the Fourth of July weekend. What are you going to
do -- stay home? Plans are all on,'' said Tom Woody of Madison, Wisc., as he
filled up his tank en route to a paddling trip in southern Wisconsin. Illinois
pump prices took a big dip today -- with Chicago prices falling below $2 a
gallon for the first time since Memorial Day -- as station owners began passing
along savings created by the state's lifting of a 5 percent sales tax on
gasoline.

Outcome Uncertain in Mexico Elections
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NAUCALPAN, Mexico (AP) -- On the eve of elections, the National Action
Party's Vicente Fox is running roughly even in the polls with Francisco
Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which hasn't lost a
presidential race since it was created as a party of power in 1929. For perhaps
the first time in a century, and perhaps the first time ever, Mexicans are
voting with a great uncertainty about who their next president will be. The PRI,
which once won elections with 80 to 90 percent of the claimed vote, is
struggling to surpass 42 percent this year against the five other candidates on
the ballot.

Clinton's Defense: Just a Normal Guy

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton's privilege to practice law in
his home state may hinge on how well his lawyers make a case for treating the
country's chief executive like anyone else. A committee of the Arkansas Supreme
Court filed suit yesterday seeking Clinton's disbarment, saying he gave
misleading testimony under oath about his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. The lawsuit followed a May 19 vote by the state Supreme
Court Committee on Professional Conduct to strip Clinton of his law license for
violating procedures governing attorneys' ethical behavior.

Manado, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island, taking the families on an emotional

<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Taj McWilliams scored 12 of her 16 points
in the second half as the Orlando Miracle held off the New York
Liberty 69-57 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's Shannon Johnson had four of her game-high 23 points in
a 7-0 run to end the game after New York pulled to 62-57 on Tari
Phillips' basket. Johnson also had 11 rebounds for her fourth
double-double this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive victory and fifth in six games for
the Eastern Conference-leading Miracle (10-6). Orlando snapped New
York's two-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had 15 of her 21 points in the second half to lead New
York (7-8). Crystal Robinson added 12 points, including three
3-pointers, and Becky Hammon had 10 points for the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   New York went on a 12-2 run to open the second half and cut
Orlando's lead to 41-37. Robinson had two 3-pointers during the
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty got within two points, 44-42, on Phillips' basket.
But Orlando went on a 5-0 run to stay ahead. New York got within
three points on two other occasions, but Orlando was able to
counter each time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 17 points and eight rebounds in helping Orlando take
a 39-25 halftime lead. The Miracle led by as many as 22 points in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson keyed Orlando's opening 9-0 run with five points,
including a 3-pointer to start the scoring. Nykesha Sales added
four of her nine points in the run.
</P>
<P>
   After a basket by New York's Marina Ferragut, the Miracle went
on a 13-2 run to take a 22-4 lead. Johnson had five points,
including a 3-pointer, and Cintia Dos Santos added four points
during that stretch for Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   New York shot only 9-for-29 (31 percent) in the first half,
going just 1-for-15 to open the game. Orlando outrebounded the
Liberty 22-11 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   After Orlando went up 31-10 on Sales' 3-pointer, New York went
on a 15-8 run to cut the lead to 14 points, 39-25 at the half.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Indians 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Denny Hocking lined a two-run single in the
10th inning Saturday night and the Minnesota Twins rallied to beat
Cleveland 4-3, the Indians' fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored the tying run in the ninth on Cristian Guzman's
two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter Brad Radke gave up seven hits and struck out
seven in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Radke, eligible for free agency at the end of the season and the
subject of trade rumors, and the Twins are close to a four-year
contract extension that would be worth $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay (1-5) walked Midre Cummings to open the Twins 10th
and Matt Lawton followed with an infield single. After Ron Coomer
grounded into a double play, Corey Koskie was intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   Hocking foiled the strategy with a line single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardado (4-2) gave up a solo homer to Ricky Ledee with
one out in the 10th. Ledee hit his first home run since being
traded from the New York Yankees in the deal for David Justice this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells got the last out for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins trailed 2-1 in the ninth when Jacque Jones lined a
one-out triple off the wall in left-center. Jones held third as
pinch-hitter David Ortiz grounded out, then scored when Guzman
singled off Karsay.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota stranded runners at third three times off Indians
starter Dave Burba, who, along with outfielder Kenny Lofton, turned
boos to cheers in helping Cleveland to a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, dropped from the leadoff spot for the first time in
eight years, went 2-for-4, scored one run and drove in another. He
batted eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The six-time All-Star outfielder had been booed Friday in a 7-2
loss to the Twins when he struck out three times in an 0-for-5
night that lowered his average to .237 -- 73 points below his career
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Burba allowed one run on five hits over seven innings. The
right-hander struck out seven and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burba's first start since also being booed Monday night
when he yielded eight runs in 5 1-3 innings in a 13-2 loss to
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton and Omar Vizquel were dropped from the first two spots in
the order to the last two as manager Charlie Manuel shook up his
struggling lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off instantly as Lofton broke an 0-for-19 slide
with an RBI double in the second inning. The opposite-field liner
to the wall in left-center scored Russell Branyan, who had been hit
by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, whose .259 average to start the game was 74 points
under his career-best .333 mark of 1999, then lined an
opposite-field single to left, scoring Lofton for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer led off the Twins' second with his 11th homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lofton had batted leadoff in 1,067 games since hitting
ninth on May 8, 1992. He batted ninth six times that season -- the
only times he hit other than leadoff in his career before Saturday
night. ... Coomer has a .405 (17-for-42) average during a 10-game
hitting streak. ... Minnesota went 4-for-4 in stolen-base attempts,
including 3-for-3 off Burba. Fifteen of the last 16 runners
attempting to steal against the right-hander have succeeded.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 4, Pirates 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Paul Byrd pitched seven strong innings for
his first win in almost two months as the Philadelphia Phillies
beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd (2-6), an All-Star last season, allowed five hits -- all for
extra-bases -- and three runs, struck out five and walked one in his
first win since May 3. It was Byrd's third straight strong start
since being recalled from Triple-A Scranton on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save in as
many opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abreu and Scott Rolen had run-scoring hits in the first,
and Pat Burrell hit a two-run double off starter Bronson Arroyo
(0-2) in the sixth as the Phillies extended their lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd breezed through the first six innings, but allowed two runs
in the seventh as the Pirates got within 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles walked, Kevin Young hit a double and John Vander Wal
delivered a two-run double. But Byrd settled down to retire Aramis
Ramirez on a grounder, Pat Meares fouled out to Rolen, who made a
tough catch just in front of the Pirates dugout, and pinch-hitter
Luis Sojo struck out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Phillies leading 2-1 and the bases loaded in the sixth,
Burrell hit a ball to the warning track in right where Vander Wal
stumbled, and the ball tipped off his glove as two runs scored. The
hit was ruled a double. Center fielder Giles recovered the ball,
made a strong relay to second baseman Warren Morris, who cut down
Mike Lieberthal at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The hit knocked Arroyo out of the game. The rookie right-hander
allowed four runs, eight hits, struck out four and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies pushed across two runs in the first to take a 2-1
lead. Abreu's triple scored Doug Glanville with the tying run and
Rolen knocked in Abreu with a RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took a 1-0 lead in the first when Jason Kendall
tripled and scored on Wil Cordero's groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rolen extended his team-best hitting streak to 10. ... .
The Pirates have turned double plays in each of the last five games
(seven total during the span). ... Kendall threw out 2-of-3
baserunners, lifting his season average to .349 (22-of-63). ...
Kendall became the first Pirates player to hit two triples in a
game since Orlando Merced on Sept. 4, 1993, at Colorado. He has 15
career triples. ... Abreu is hitting a team-high .358 at Veterans
Stadium. ... Giles is the only Pirates player to play in all 79
games. He also recorded his ML-best 11th outfield assist ...
Burrell is 5-for-6 with 11 RBIs with the bases loaded. ... The
game, which featured fireworks afterward, drew 48,406 -- the largest
crowd for the Phillies this season. The previous best was 47,115 on
April 10 against the New York Mets. ... Phillies reliever Mark
Holzemer began the eighth and left after three pitches.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 6, Expos 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Ryan Dempster won a true Canada Day pitching
matchup and Mark Kotsay had three hits, including a home run, as
the Florida Marlins beat the Montreal Expos 6-5 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster (9-4), a native of Schelt, British Columbia, bested
Edmonton's Mike Johnson (3-3) in a rare matchup of Canadian
starters on the country's 133rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Just 8,529 fans were on hand at Olympic Stadium as the Expos
fell to 4-7 on their 12-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lost its third in a row. The Expos rallied for two runs
in the ninth on RBI singles by Michael Barrett and Mike Mordecai.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay singled in the first, homered leading off the fifth and
singled in the sixth. He is 22-for-42 (.523) with 10 RBIs over his
last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Jose Vidro went 3-for-5, including his 28th double in
the eighth, to extend his career-best hitting streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster allowed three runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings for
his third straight win in his last four starts. He walked five and
struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca hung on in the ninth for his 24th save in 27
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scored three times in the fourth off Johnson to take a
4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Preston Wilson hit a fly off the stadium's roof that was
caught by left fielder Rondell White for the first out, Mike Lowell
singled and Derek Lee walked.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Berg hit an RBI double and Mike Redmond followed with a
run-scoring single to make it 3-1. Dempster's RBI single gave the
Marlins a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay homered in the fifth, and Cliff Floyd doubled and Wilson
singled to chase Johnson. Lowell's sacrifice fly put Florida ahead
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's RBI single in the seventh drove in Montreal's third
run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Barrett entered the game in the seventh as part of a double
switch. ... Dempster also participated in the majors' last
all-Canadian matchup when he faced Montreal native Eric Gagne, who
was making his major league debut for Los Angeles last Sept. 7 at
Pro Player Stadium. ... Florida SS Alex Gonzalez, day-to-day with
an injured middle right, missed his fifth straight start. ...
Vidro, who had a 12-game streak from May 1-14, is hitting .362
(21-for-58) with four doubles, four homers and eight RBIs since
beginning his current streak on June 16. ... Montreal has gone 7-15
since June 5, when it beat the New York Yankees 6-4 to extend its
season-best winning streak to six games.

<HEADLINE> United States 4, Canada 1  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Shannon MacMillan's powerful right foot
left no doubt that the United States would beat Canada for the 21st
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan scored from 16 and 25 yards out, shots so powerful the
goalkeeper just stood and watched them fly past, as the U.S. team
won 4-1 Saturday night to advance to the final of the inaugural
women's soccer Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will play Brazil in Monday's title game in
Foxboro, Mass., a rematch of the teams that played to a 0-0 tie in
group play Wednesday. Brazil beat China 3-2 in Saturday's other
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, getting a rare start at forward, scored in the 12th
and 38th minutes. Tiffany Milbrett scored in first-half injury
time, and Mia Hamm added her 121st international goal in the 65th
minute for the Americans, who have won 22 of 23 games against their
North American neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Charmaine Hooper scored a penalty kick in the 58th minute for
the Canadians, whose only victory in the series came in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that record -- and despite 4-0 and 9-1 losses to the
United States this year -- Canada's players had thought themselves
ready to challenge the World Cup champions this time. The Canadians
split two games with China this year under new coach Even
Pellerud's rebuilding program.
</P>
<P>
   But, once again, Canada's defense couldn't stop the Americans'
powerful array of talent. The United States had three corner kicks
in the first three minutes, and Milbrett was given plenty of space
down the middle of the field for her goal, a 10-yard score on a
feed from Julie Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan's first goal, a rocket into the corner of the net,
came after a cross-field pass from Nikki Serlenga on a
counterattack. MacMillan's second found the left side, a solid
blast from directly in front of the net with three players around
her. Although both shots were long ones, goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc
was left flat-footed with no time to react.
</P>
<P>
   Canada avoided the shutout when Kate Sobrero elbowed Hooper to
the left of the goal in the second half. Hooper's successful
penalty kick broke a 486-minute shutout streak for the United
States and ended goalkeeper Siri Mullinix's personal streak at 512
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm made it 4-1 with an 18-yard shot off LeBlanc's outstretched
hands. In an unusual scene, Hamm ran immediately to the U.S. team
bench and hugged coach April Heinrichs rather than celebrate on the
field with her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 11,140 fans to Papa John's Cardinal Stadium.

Race Tight on Eve of Mexican Election

   NAUCALPAN, Mexico (AP) -- Only hours before the Mexican elections, the
National Action Party's Vicente Fox is running roughly even in the polls with
Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which hasn't lost
a presidential race since it was created as a party of power in 1929. For
perhaps the first time in a century, and perhaps the first time ever, Mexicans
are voting with a great uncertainty about who their next president will be. The
PRI, which once won elections with 80 to 90 percent of the claimed vote, is
struggling to surpass 42 percent this year against the five other candidates on

someone I loved as a brother, as a closest friend and a remarkable human
being,'' said frequent co-star Jack Lemmon. ''We have also lost one of the best

High Gas Prices Greet Holiday Travelers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Midwesterners gassed up their vehicles and hit the road for
the holiday weekend, as high gas prices -- which led two states to suspend their
gas sales tax and prompted a federal investigation into possible price gouging
-- continued to fall. ''It's the Fourth of July weekend. What are you going to
do -- stay home? Plans are all on,'' said Tom Woody of Madison, Wisc., as he
filled up his tank en route to a paddling trip in southern Wisconsin. Illinois
pump prices took a big dip today -- with Chicago prices falling below $2 a
gallon for the first time since Memorial Day -- as station owners began passing
along savings created by the state's lifting of a 5 percent sales tax on
gasoline.

Colombia Missile Attack Kills One

   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Assailants launched crude missiles outside police
headquarters in Colombia's third-largest city today, killing one passer-by and
wounding at least 11 others. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the
attack, which was similar to ones previously carried out by the country's main
rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Four explosive
devices were launched from the back of a pickup truck parked next to the police
headquarters in downtown Cali. One landed on a car passing by on the street,
exploded and killed the driver.

Cuba is and will be here with its ideas, its example, and the unbendable
rebellion of its people,'' Castro wrote in a letter read before hundreds of

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sheri Sam scored 22 points and the Miami Sol
weathered a second-half rally to defeat the Indiana Fever 54-52 on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sam hit two 3-pointers to open the second half as Miami (5-10)
went on a 14-4 run while holding Indiana (3-11) to one field goal
over the first eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana played without starting center Kara Wolters, serving a
one-game suspension for leaving the bench in the second half of
Friday's loss at New York, when teammate Rita Williams was
flagrantly fouled by Jessica Bibby of the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters, the Fever's leading scorer and rebounder, was also
fined $500.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana trailed 40-27 after the Sol's second-half burst, but
used full-court pressure to go on a 21-5 run over the next 6:26.
Danielle McCulley's short jumper gave the Fever a 48-45 lead with
5:11 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sam scored on a layup after a steal, then hit two free throws as
Miami regained the lead and snapped a four-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   McCulley's 17 points weren't enough to keep Indiana from losing
its sixth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Thompson added 11 points for the Fever, who are 1-7 at
home.

<HEADLINE> Crear Wins 110-Meter Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- As soon as he crossed the finish line,
Mark Crear felt the exhilaration of triumph -- and then quickly felt
the pain in his bloody right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Crear won the 110-meter hurdles Saturday in 13.20 seconds, the
fastest mark by an American this year. It was only one-hundredth of
a second off the world's fastest this year, a mark of 13.19 by
Cuba's Anier Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Crear held off Dawane Wallace (13.26) and Chris Phillips (13.27)
despite getting spiked during the race. He finished the event with
blood on the fourth finger and pinkie of his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long-distance runners get spiked in the legs, we get spiked in
the fingers. I may have even spiked myself,'' Crear said. ''But
when you win, it makes the pain go away a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The meet, formally called the GMC Envoy Track &AMP; Field Open and
held at Stanford University, was used by many competitors as a
warmup for the U.S. Olympic trials to be held at Sacramento in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Most top American track and field performers were not at the
meet, which was the third leg of USA Track &AMP; Field's three-meet
outdoor Golden Spike Tour. Instead, they were in Europe at meets
offering far more money and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Crear rushed off after his victory to his home in
Vallencia in southern California to pack for a trip Sunday to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going back home, kiss my daughter and then take off for
Switzerland,'' said Crear, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist and the
top-ranked 110 hurdler in the world in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other top performances at the meet were Adam Nelson's
winning mark of 71 feet, 2&AMP;frac12; inches on his final attempt in the shot
put, the third-longest toss in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Dragila won the women's pole vault by clearing 14-10&AMP;frac14;.
Kellie Suttle cleared the same height for her career best, but
Dragila won because she had fewer misses. Both women failed in
three attempts at 15-2&AMP;frac14;, which would have been a world record.
</P>
<P>
   John Capel won the men's 100 in 10.14 and Carlette Guidry won
the women's 100 in 11.06.

<HEADLINE> Amateur historians say Thomas Jefferson kin buried in Orange County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUXEDO, N.Y. (AP) - A pair of local historians claim to have
found the grave of an illegitimate son of founding father Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But at a press conference Saturday to discuss their findings,
one of the amateur sleuths disappeared on the way to the headstone
belonging to a man named Thomas Jefferson. Reporters were left to
speculate if they were indeed standing before the final resting
spot of the son of a president and his slave mistress, Sally
Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Roger King, has been restoring tombstones in
Orange County for three decades, according to the Times
Herald-Record of Middletown. He told the gathered media he had
found a broken stone lying near Thomas Jefferson's headstone that
read: ''Son of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Heming (sic).''
</P>
<P>
   King said he discovered the worn gravestone last summer near a
stone that read: ''In memory of Thomas Jefferson who died April 25,
1855 Ae 46 Yrs &AMP; 12 Ds.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the space of 1,000 feet between the gravesite and the
diner where Saturday's press conference was conducted, King
vanished. Reporters tried unsuccessfully to track him down.
</P>
<P>
   This illegitimate son is believed to have been born in 1809, the
result of a love affair between the third president of the United
States and his slave mistress, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   King's gravestone find supplemented research done by Robert
Brennan, a retired history and math teacher, who has been
conducting genealogical research into the Jeffersons of Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS documentary earlier this year revealed DNA evidence that
proved Jefferson had at least one child with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Tuxedo is 35 miles north of New York City.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ray Scherer, a former chief White House
correspondent for NBC News and RCA Corp., executive, died Saturday
of cancer at his home in Washington. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Scherer joined the network as a news writer in 1947 after
working as a newspaper feature writer in his native Fort Wayne,
Ind., and quickly became an on-air reporter. A pioneer television
journalist, he was among the first to report live from the White
House and from the floor of the presidential nominating
conventions, in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He served as NBC's London correspondent from 1969 to 1973 and
returned to Washington as a senior reporter until becoming vice
president of RCA's Washington office in 1975. He retired in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Report: Monuments Are Vulnerable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study commissioned by the National Park
Service concludes that Washington's monuments are vulnerable to
terrorist attack and that the service needs a budget boost to
counter the threat, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, saying it had obtained a copy of the report, said in
Sunday editions that the 200-page document makes a direct
correlation between the vulnerability of things like the Lincoln
Memorial and Washington Monument and funding for the U.S. Park
Police, the law enforcement arm of the park service.
</P>
<P>
   ''As symbols of America's heritage, they are high-profile
landmarks, not well protected, popular, attract many visitors daily
and require open and easy accessibility,'' says the report.
</P>
<P>
   It said an additional one-time expenditure of $3 million would
bring eight of the most popular monuments up to security standards.
</P>
<P>
   It also says many shortcomings involved a lack of manpower and
poor communication equipment assigned to Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langston, head of Park Police, told the Post that while
protection of other government buildings in the city has increased,
that has not happened with the monuments and memorials guarded by
the Park Police.
</P>
<P>
   However, Park Police Sgt. Rob MacLean told the paper there was
no reason for people to be concerned about gathering for things
like the Fourth of July fireworks celebration on the Mall because
virtually every officer on the force is on duty for events like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've taken steps to ensure safety measures are in place to
take care of any situation that may occur,'' said MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   The Post pointed out that, while neither agency would comment on
Park Police readiness, both the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service
share responsibility for protecting against terrorist acts that
might be directed against any government installation.
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Hoffman, a Washington-based counterterrorism expert
for Rand Corp., a nonprofit public policy institute, said it is a
given that government monuments are potential targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are by very definition national monuments, which means
they're there for the public,'' Hoffman told the Post. ''So no one
can look at them and say they're not vulnerable. Of course they're
vulnerable. But everything is vulnerable. It comes to a point where
you have to accept that we can't have a risk-free society.''

<HEADLINE> Stars' Carbonneau To Retire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Guy Carbonneau, a three-time
Selke Trophy winner who won three Stanley Cups, announced his
retirement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau was a gritty player who made his mark in 19 seasons
as a defensive center. He won the NHL's Selke Trophy, given to the
league's best defensive forward, in consecutive years from 1988-89
and again in 1992 with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau spent the last five seasons with Dallas, winning the
Stanley Cup with the Stars in 1999. He spent 13 seasons playing for
the Canadiens, who won the Cup in 1986 and 1993. He also played 42
games for St. Louis in the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau had 260 goals and 403 assists in 1,318 regular-season
games, and 38 goals and 55 assists in 231 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Carbonneau was the league's oldest player last season. He
wound up having one of his best seasons in recent years, helping
Dallas earn a return trip to the Stanley Cup finals. Carbonneau had
10 goals and six assists in 69 regular-season games, and two goals
and four assists in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A front-office or coaching position could be next for
Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Canadiens general manager Rejean Houle asked
Stars counterpart Bob Gainey for permission to have discussions
with Carbonneau. Jacques Lemaire, the Canadiens' senior consultant
to the general manager last season, left to coach the expansion
Minnesota Wild.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am in retirement,'' Carbonneau said. ''I will certainly meet
with the heads of the Canadiens and see what they have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked with Bob Gainey before leaving Dallas. They haven't
specified what job they'd like me to do. But I'll weigh the pros
and cons.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Army To Appoint New Government  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying rebels who took over Fiji's parliament
and demanded that ethnic Indians be stripped of political power,
the army said Sunday it would appoint a temporary government next
week that would include Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement appeared to raise the stakes in a political
standoff that began May 19, when the rebels stormed the Indian-led
parliament of this South Pacific island nation in what they called
a battle for the trampled rights of indigenous Fijians. They
continue to hold 27 members of parliament hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be ethnic Indo-Fijians in the interim government
lineup, although percentages I cannot say at this point in time,''
Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   The military -- which assumed power 10 days after the raid on
parliament -- said last week that it would appoint an interim
government without input from the hostage takers, who had been
demanding a role in the naming process.
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini said Thursday that the temporary government would
take office only once the hostages were released. But on Sunday he
said the army will not wait.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the military's latest statement, rebel spokesman
Jo Nata said ''we hope they are prepared for the implications of
their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate, but rebel leader George Speight has said
in recent days that any military action perceived as
anti-indigenous could result in violence by his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Talks to free the hostages broke down last week over what the
army said was an 11th hour demand by Speight's group that they be
allowed to name a new president.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Tarakinikini said the army was ''determined to
resolve the crisis in a peaceful manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to maintain that the door for negotiations is
still open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rebels' demands to disenfranchise Fiji's Indians
have already been met, including the firing of Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry -- a hostage -- and the elimination of the
country's 1997 multiracial constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Tarakinikini appeared to leave open the possibility that the
interim government, which he said would be named by Thursday, could
resurrect that constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The review of the constitution will be left to the interim
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's position is that there be no Indians in the interim
government.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were first brought to Fiji over a century ago by English
colonialists seeking indentured laborers in the country's rich
sugarcane fields. They make up about 44 percent of Fiji's
population, while indigenous Fijians account for about 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a group of indigenous Fijian youths staged a day of
fasting and prayer in the capital, Suva, in an effort to heal the
ethnic wounds that prompted the crisis. They hugged and shook hands
with ethnic Indians and called for greater tolerance on Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's surround our Indian brothers and sisters with our
Christian love,'' group leader Mika Yasa Mudreilagi said as people
hugged and sobbed. ''Please forgive us for any hurt that we have
caused you.''

Fiji Army To Appoint New Government
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Defying rebels who took over Fiji's parliament and
demanded that ethnic Indians be stripped of political power, the army said
Sunday it would appoint a temporary government next week that would include
Indians. The announcement appeared to raise the stakes in a political standoff
that began May 19, when the rebels stormed the Indian-led parliament of this
South Pacific island nation in what they called a battle for the trampled rights
of indigenous Fijians. They continue to hold 27 members of parliament hostage.

mansion on the National Register of Historic Places. ''The whole deck just
disappeared, it just fell,'' Barbara Kraft, visiting the island from Rochester
Hills, Mich., told WBNS-TV in Columbus. Paramedics estimated 30 people were

Report: Wash. Monuments Vulnerable
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study commissioned by the National Park Service
concludes that Washington's monuments are vulnerable to terrorist attack and
that the service needs a budget boost to counter the threat, The Washington Post
reported. The Post, saying it had obtained a copy of the report, said in Sunday
editions that the 200-page document makes a direct correlation between the
vulnerability of things like the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument and
funding for the U.S. Park Police, the law enforcement arm of the park service.

main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Four
explosive devices were launched from the back of a pickup truck parked next to
the police headquarters in downtown Cali. One landed on a car passing by on the
street, exploded and killed the driver.
