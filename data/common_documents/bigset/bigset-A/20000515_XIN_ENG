<HEADLINE> South Korea Play 3-2 Shock of Denmark to Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea produced the
biggest shock so far in the Thomas Cup Finals badminton tournament
when they edged Denmark 3-2 to advance to the semi-finals here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, 35, Olympic champion from the 1996
Atlanta Games, was surprised by the 15-year-old younger Lee Hyun
Li in the third game, which served as the turning point of the tie.
</P>
<P>
It seemed the Danes had the better of the game when world
number one Peter Gade Christensen put Denmark to a 1-0 lead after
winning 15-5, 15-10 over Shon Seung Mo, and Martin Lundgaard
Hansen and Lars Paaske stretched world doubles champions Kim Dong
Moon and Ha Tae Kwon to 16-17, 5-15 in the second game.
</P>
<P>
The tie was leveled at 1-1 when Lee stepped onto the scene to
steer his team with a 13-15, 15-12, 15-12 demolish of Hoyer-Larsen.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 20, shot his name first on the international stage in the
Sweden Open final, was also the winning factor when he ousted Ong
Ewe Hock to give South Korea a 3-2 win over Malaysia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, who were seen off by Indonesia 4-1 in the semi-finals
in 1998, made a temporary storm-back from Jesper Larsen/Jens
Eriksen's brilliant performance, dumping Lee Dong Soo/Yoo Yong
Sung, 15-10, 15-1 in the second doubles to draw a level again.
</P>
<P>
But South Koreans made the last word with Park Tae Sang going
out to beat Kenneth Jonassen 15-7, 15-7 to claim a semi-finals
berth.
</P>
<P>
Park held off two midway comeback of Johassen, who scored five
points to 11-6 in the first set and four points to 10-7 in the
second, to take the decisive game.
</P>
<P>
"I'd thought the second singles (Lee) and two doubles could
give us the win, but the things were not as we designed," said
South Korea's coach Kwon Seung Taik.
</P>
<P>
"I was almost in desperate when the second doubles (Lee/Yoo)
lost. I didn't expect Park to take the winning point in the final
game," Kwon said.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's manager Thomas Lund said, "We'd expected a tough
game, but we had never thought we could lose two singles matches."
</P>
<P>
South Korea were almost insure to top the group A when they
take on the winless India on Tuesday, while Malaysia, who thrashed
India 4-1, clash with Denmark for the other berth.
</P>
<P>
In the Uber Cup, China and South Korea advanced from Group B
into the semi-finals without losing a game, but China's first
singles Dai Yun lost the first set. Dai took the place of world
number one Gong Zhichao, winner of All-England and Japan Open, as
the first player stepping onto the court, dropping the second set
at 7-11 to Judith Meulendijks, before she struggled for a 11-3, 7-
11, 11-7 win in 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But her teammates carried the load with two-time world champion
Ye Zhaoying winning her debut third singles game 11-1, 11-0 over
Karina De Wit, and Gao Ling/Qin Yiyuan embarrassed Carolien
Glebbeek/Krab Betty 15-0, 15-0 in just 10 minutes at the first
doubles.
</P>
<P>
"We're not worried about Dai's performance," said Chinese head
coach Li Yongbo. "She's just not well prepared."
</P>
<P>
China will face South Korea in the final preliminary round tie
on Tuesday to decide the top two places of the group.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Votes For Transfer of Arab Towns Near Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
voted 56-48 on Monday for the transfer of three Palestinian towns
near Jerusalem to the full Palestinian control, following a heated
debate lasting more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
But before the voting, Barak told the Knesset that the execution
of the transfer will be delayed due to the violent clashes in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
There was only one abstention in the voting in the l20-member
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to present the proposal for confirmation but we will
delay the execution of the transfer itself until the reasons for
today's violence are clarified," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet voted earlier Monday 15-6 to transfer the
towns of Abu Dis, Azariya and Swahara to full Palestinian control
in a move Barak had said was necessary to avoid "stalemate and
deterioration" in peacemaking with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The three towns are currently in Area B of the West Bank, where
the Palestinians exercises civil administration while Israel
controls security.
</P>
<P>
Barak also described the vote as a vote of confidence in his
coalition, after the National Religious Party, the right-wing
partner, threatened to leave the coalition after the land transfer.
</P>
<P>
Barak opened the Knesset debate Monday afternoon over the
government's decision to hand over the towns to the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
He told the Knesset members that the transfer could strengthen
Israel's control of Jerusalem without changing anything on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The three towns have already been in the Palestinian hand and
the transfer could help Israel to strike a peace deal with the
Palestinians, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said that Jerusalem will remain a united capital of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli troops escalated
Monday throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving at least
four Palestinians dead and 268 wounded. Nine Israeli troops were
also hurt in the clashes.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Arrests 2 Iraqi Infiltrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqis agents were arrested
by Kuwaiti security forces after they infiltrated into Kuwait from
Iraq, the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry said in a statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the General Administration of State Security
obtained a tip that the Iraqi intelligence agency was to send its
agents into Kuwait after supplying them with drugs and leaflets the
intelligence issued under the name of the Rightful Owners and
Kuwait's Free Men League.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 4,014 drug pills that were buried by the two Iraqi
secret servicemen in the Kuwaiti desert were recovered," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not specify the time of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
After interrogation, the statement said, the two confessed to
working for the Iraqi intelligence in the southern Iraqi city of
Nasseriya.
</P>
<P>
There had been similar reports of cross-border infiltrations,
although a United Nations' peacekeeping force has been monitoring
the demilitarized zone along the 200-kilometer Kuwaiti-Iraqi border
since the end of the 1991 Gulf war, triggered by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Welcomes Israeli Parliament's Approval of Land Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in the
interim talks Saeb Erekat Monday evening welcomed the approval by
the Israeli Knesset (parliament) to hand over three Arab towns
close to Jerusalem to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Israel, Erekat said Israel should
also carry out the third redeployment from the West Bank by June
according to the previously-set plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged Israel to release another group of the
Palestinian detainees and implement other obligations of the
interim phases under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last
September.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Knesset (parliament) Monday afternoon approved the
government proposal to transfer Abu Dis, Azariya and Suwahara, now
under Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control (Area B),
to full Palestinian control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset before the voting
that the execution of the transfer will be delayed due to the
latest violent clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli security forces exchanged fires Monday
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving two Palestinian policemen
and two Palestinian demonstrators dead and over 300 demonstrators
injured so far.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Knesset to approve the handover, Barak said the move
was essential to push forward the peace process and would not
affect the status of Jerusalem, which Israel insists as its eternal
and indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
"The area of the three towns that are currently under
Palestinian civil administration does not exceed 0.25 percent of
the West Bank," he added.
</P>
<P>
The handover was approved by 56 parliamentarians and opposed by
48 others, with one abstention. A total of 15 Knesset members
including several ministers from coalition partners Shas and the
Israel B'Aliya parties were absent from the session.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over U.S., British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- In two letters to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and president of the U.N. Security Council,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf protested over the
continued U.S. and British attacks from April 29 to May 3.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency on Monday, Sahaf
said that during the period, U.S. and British warplanes made a
total of 200 armed sorties, 54 from Turkey and 146 from Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, over the two so-called no-fly zones in southern
and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On May 3, eight formations of U.S. and British jets made 16
armed sorties over the northern provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and
Erbil, bombing civilian and service installations and injuring
three people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that nearly 300 people have been killed and 860
others injured in U.S. and British air raids since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister stressed that it has become a "fixed
policy" for the U.S. and Britain to continue their "aggressions
aimed at infringing upon Iraq's sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Sahaf reiterated Iraq's "absolute rejection" of the no-fly zones
unilaterally imposed by the U.S.-led Western allies "under feeble
pretexts to justify their aggressions on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Sahaf urged Annan and president of the U.N. Security Council to
interfere to end their aggressive acts.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the two air
exclusion zones in Iraq to prevent what they called Baghdad
prosecution of the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad never recognizes the imposed zones for their lack of U.
N. authorization.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, PNA Vow to Remove Obstacle on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
al-Khatib on Monday met with Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath on promoting trade and
economic cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers pledged to take measures
to remove obstacles impeding smooth flow of goods to increase the
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is the obstacle," Sha'ath told reporters after the
meeting, urging for cooperation with Jordan to "remove
Israel's economic hegemony" over Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Khatib and Sha`ath also reviewed the implementation of various
trade and economic agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Jordan and Palestinian territories stood at a
meagre 44 million U.S. dollars in 1999, with Jordanian exports
worth 30 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian businessmen blamed the sluggish trade on strict
security checks imposed on Jordanian trucks. Goods should be
unloaded from Jordanian trucks at Israeli checkpoints and then
reloaded on other trucks for Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli has said it would address the concerns to facilitate
trade between Jordan and Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Also present at Monday's meeting were Jordanian Minister of
Trade, Industry and Supply Mohammed Halayka, Minister of Transport
Issa Ayub, Palestinian Minister of Economy and Trade Maher Masri,
Minister of Transport Ali Qawasmi.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan on Ideological Emancipation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They can not move forward, or rather become feeble and die if
they do everything proceeding from book worship with a rigid way
of thinking and with superstition rampant, as well as if they dare
not break through the traditional conventions and dogma, Li
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
There doesn't exist such kind of a matter in the world that
will never change, Li stressed. Thus ideological emancipation is
not once for all but endless, he added.
</P>
<P>
Something that is positive to development and thus be
recognized during a certain period of time could be one that
hinders development and be rejected at another period of time, Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on people to find demerits of themselves and be good
at surmounting themselves.
</P>
<P>
"People's thoughts are reflection of objective realities, and
correct thoughts are undoubtedly correct reflection of objective
realities. So the purpose of ideological emancipation is just to
make people's thoughts accord with objective realities rather than
lag behind them," said the CPPCC National Committee Chairman, who
is here for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
People who want to emancipate minds must base it on, proceed
from, respect and study hard the objective realities rather than
think at random with no idea of objective realities, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this is an important principle for people to
ponder over matters and then take actions.
</P>
<P>
Li owed all the achievements China has scored over the past 20
years of reforms and opening up to ideological emancipation and
respecting realities. " China should still insist on this
experience if it wants to solve difficulties and strive for new
achievements," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Chavez told Li that China's experience of insisting on
ideological emancipation and respecting realities has very
important enlightenment for his country.

<TEXT>
<P>
National Educators Union (NEU) convoked a week ago this strike,
which was heeded by 142,000 professors and will affect almost
three million students from primary and secondary public schools.
</P>
<P>
To this strike were added public employees of affiliates of
Peasant Social Service, petroleum employees and from the health
sector.
</P>
<P>
These professors are demanding their basic salary be increased
to 100 dollars and are protesting supposed plans to privatize
education in conformity with a government commitment with
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between NEU heads and Education Ministry fell
through in midst of full election campaigns for mayors, prefects,
municipal councellors and members of parish committees.
</P>
<P>
NEU leaders said teachers grew tired of the dialogue with
authorities in face of the lack of a solution to their salary
claims.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Roberto Hanze demanded an end to the strike
and ratified the government's intention of a salary increase in
June, when prices of fuels and gas will go up.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Health Ministry Stresses Rescue Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Health Ministry said
Monday that lack of training made it difficult to conduct rescue
operations during the February and March floods, which left about
700 people dead in the southern and central regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made at the end of a week-long seminar on
the management of natural disasters held in the tourist resort of
Bilene in southern Gaza Province.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by Australian Emergency Service
technicians, and attended by health staff from all regions of the
country and the administrator of Chokwe district hardest hit by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
The health director in the northern Niassa Province, Elias
Mangujo, said that although his province was not directly affected
by floods, he could understand that "if there had been early
training of all those involved in the rescue operations, they
would have been more successful".
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that Mozambique had never faced such a major
disaster before, and the country was caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Mangujo said that the course gave each participant "some basic
knowledge of the mechanisms to manage a disaster, and of
international practices on disaster management".

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The office of United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged its staff in the
Great Lakes region to get ready for refugees repatriation or
handling operations foreseen in a near future.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day UNHCR preparedness consultative meeting on
Burundi, Congolese and Rwandan refugees in Dar es Salaam on

Africa Region Wairimu Karago said UNHCR staff should get ready in
serving refugees depending on the latest development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, massive refugees repatriation or
handling operations are expected in the region, depending on the
success or failure of the Burundi peace talks going on in northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha and the implementation of the Lusaka
Peace Accord aimed at ending the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Karago also warned that the UNHCR staff in the region should be
ready to handle more refugees who are expected to flee the DRC,
Burundi and Rwanda if the peace initiatives get stuck or collapse.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is a series of UNHCR preparedness
consultative meetings in the region, involves over 20 senior UNHCR
officials from the region and UNHCR head office in Geneva and

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity held a joint seminar here Monday with the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), urging African countries to enhance
the awareness and respect of international humanitarian law (IHL)
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the OAU Said Djinnit said the
OAU has committed itself to the humanitarian agenda in Africa and
pledged to promote the awareness and respect of the fundamental
principles of IHL.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Forster, vice president of the ICRC, said that IHL
action targets the consequences and not the cause of the
conflicts, and is not aimed at resolving conflict. The only
objective of IHL is to protect life and human dignity, he said.
</P>
<P>
ICRC head of mission to the OAU Dominique Buff said in his
statement that dramatic situation of conflicts, the grave breaches
of the law of war and the difficulties caused in dealing with
humanitarian activities in African continent would be addressed by
the joint seminar.
</P>
<P>
Besides the current one, the OAU and ICRC have jointly
organized five seminars since 1994 on various major humanitarian
concerns in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The seminars, focusing on the implementation of IHL, were
designed to strengthen the relationship between the OAU and ICRC,
and to better address in a coordinated manner humanitarian
concerns through mobilizing political and diplomatic support for
humanitarian actions, OAU officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Build Floating Desalination Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Council of Ministers on
Monday approved a bill for the construction of a floating
desalination plant on southern coast, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Agriculture, Natural Resources and
Environment Minister Costas Themistocleous said this is a temporary
measure until two permanent desalination plants are constructed.
</P>
<P>
The floating plant is expected to operate for some two years,
producing 25 thousand cubic metres of water per day in the Moni
area, east of the southern coastal town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
According to Themistocleous, a permanent desalination plant is
expected to be built in Paralimni, southeast of the island, whereas
discussions are going over the site for the construction of another
plant in the Limassol region.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he expects the floating plant to be in
operation four months after the contract with the construction
company is signed.
</P>
<P>
Water supply in Cyprus is mainly dependent on rainfall. But the
average annual rainfall stands at only about 50 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
This, and the absence of permanent rivers, has made water a
scarce and valuable commodity in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus now has only one desalination plant, producing only 40,
000 cubic metres of water per day. Nicosia itself needs 45,000
cubic metres of water per day for its population.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that with only about 35 million cubic metres of
water behind the dams, Cyprus faces a tough summer this year.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Iranian Jews Confess to Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two more Iranian Jews in a closed-
door trial on charge of espionage on Monday confessed to spying for
Israeli intelligence service Mossad, despite the Israeli denial of
any links with the Iranian Jews.
</P>
<P>
Asher Zadmehr and Farhad Seleh admitted to links with Mossad
after the 6th court hearing in Shiraz, the southern Fars province,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Zadmehr said that he worked for Israel on the belief that the
preparation and transfer of news to Israel is a help towards the
formation of the promised land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Terming the behavior of the judicial interrogators and the head
of the court towards the Jewish suspects as "highly respectful and
humane", Zadmehr called on the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, President Mohammad Khatami, the Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi and the Iranian nation to pardon him.
</P>
<P>
Seleh said that his responsibility at the espionage network was
to gather news and information about Iran's industrial and military
centers and put them at the disposal of the Israeli intelligence
network.
</P>
<P>
The news and information collected were transferred to officials
of the espionage network, he said, adding that he worked for Mossad
on religious sentiments.
</P>
<P>
So far seven of the eight Iranian Jewish suspects brought to the
court have admitted the espionage charges while another rejected
the charges against him. Three more have yet to appear at court.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews arrested along with eight Muslims were
charged of espionage, acts endangering the national security,
cooperation with the Israeli intelligence service Mossad and
furnishing information to a foreign country resulting in damage to
the state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied that the Iranian Jews were spying for the
Jewish state and condemned the confession as "coerced."
</P>
<P>
Iranian judicial officials have promised a fair and impartial
trial for the 13 Jews arrested in March and April last year in
Shiraz, the center of Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The western countries, particularly the United States, have
expressed grave concern over the trial. But Tehran has rejected
any "foreign interference" in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus New Commander Pledges to Strengthen Defense Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Lieutenant General Evangelos
Florakis, the new commander of Cyprus' National Guard, on Monday
pledged to increase the country's defense capability.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Florakis, who arrived here
Friday from Greece to replace Lieutenant General Dimitris Demou,
had his first meeting with Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National Guard, the Cyprus Republic's armed forces, consists
of some 20,000 servicemen commanded by a Greek mainlander, plus a
reserve force of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
There is also a 2,000-strong Greek contingent in Cyprus, which
provides training for the army of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Hasikos, Florakis said that the least he
hopes to achieve is to maintain the current level of readiness in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to be economical with statements to the press on
defense matters, pointing out that such issues are not for public
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the new commander, Hasikos praised his credentials and
said Florakis is well acquainted with Cyprus and probably closer to
the country than any other commanders.
</P>
<P>
Florakis, a Greek national, served in the past with the Greek
contingent stationed on the island as part of the 1960 Treaties
that granted Cyprus independence. He married a Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
Florakis will formally assume his duties at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The number of the Turkish Cypriot security forces in northern
Cyprus stands at 4,500. The forces are commanded by a Turkish
mainlander and coordinate with 35,000 Turkish soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Unexploded Cluster Bombs Defused in Southern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Squads of Iraqi civil defense in the
southern Basra province have defused six unexploded cluster bombs
dropped by the U.S. and British warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Monday that the
unexploded cluster bombs were dropped by U.S. and British warplanes
during their almost-daily aggressions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi civil defense has notified the citizens of the Basra
province that they must not approach or touch unknown objects, let
alone take unexploded shells to their houses, INA said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the constant bombings of the U.S. and
British planes over the two no-fly zones in southern and northern
Iraq, declared by the U.S.-led Western allies following the 1991
Gulf War, have left many unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are also a large amount of unexploded bombs
left over in the wake of the Gulf War, imperiling the lives of the
Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, two women herding sheep were wounded near the Al-
Falluja city, 60 kilometers west of the capital Baghdad, when a
bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities said that over 56,000 bombs and a cruise
missile left over by the Gulf War and the regular bombardments of
U.S. and British planes have been defused.

JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament),
which opened its summer session Monday afternoon, approved the
cabinet decision to transfer three Arab towns near Jerusalem to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Opening the session, Prime Minister Ehud Barak delivered a
policy statement on cabinet decision made in the morning to
transfer Abu Dis, Azariya and Suwahara to full Palestinian self-
rule.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office initially announced in a statement that only the
first two towns would be transferred to the PNA, but added later
that the third town would also be included in the handover.
</P>
<P>
The villages, now under Israeli security and Palestinian
civilian control (Area B), will be transferred to full Palestinian
control (Area A).
</P>
<P>
Barak explained to the lawmakers the cabinet decision was
intended as a goodwill gesture aimed to revive the lagging Israeli-
Palestinian talks. He assured the lawmakers that the move will in
no way lead to the weakening of Israel's control of Jerusalem,
which Israel insists as its eternal and indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel will maintain the united Jerusalem as its capital while
the Palestinians can have its capital at Abu Dis, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
The government will not sign a final agreement at all costs, he
noted, adding that there is not yet any certainty that an agreement
could be reached.
</P>
<P>
Barak's speech, however, was frequently interrupted by lawmakers
voicing disagreement over the controversial handover plan, leaving
the session in a stormy state.
</P>
<P>
Besides the handover proposal, the Knesset will review a series
of motions during the summer session that lasts till the end of
July, which analysts here expect will be full of heated political
debates,
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers would address two non-confidence motions against
Barak's coalition, one submitted before the spring recess by the
Arab parties over plans for the construction of a trans-Israel
highway, the other by the opposition Likud party on what it
called "the year of Ehud Barak's failure as prime minister."
</P>
<P>
The Arab parties are angry at the road-construction plan as the
highway would be built at the expense of Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Likud whip Ruby Rivlin said on Sunday that Barak had not
registered "even one accomplishment" since taking office last July.
</P>
<P>
A sweeping tax reform package drafted by the Ben-Bassat
Committee under the Israeli Treasury and a referendum bill proposed
by Likud Knesset member Silvan Shalom will also be central topics
for debate during the session.
</P>
<P>
The referendum bill would require a special majority -- over
half of all registered voters regardless of the actual turn-out --
to approve ceding the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syrian
in 1967. The bill has passed the preliminary reading in the Knesset
winter session and will be brought to the Law Committee for further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Shalom has said he would also submit legislation this week that
would require a special majority for ratifying Israel's future
borders with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The various motions are expected to continue to put Barak's
government to the test, as some coalition partners such as ultra-
religious Shas, the National Religious Party (NRP) and Yisrael
Ba'aliya are likely to make troubles for him.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Barak also touched upon the victory over Nazi
Germany 55 years ago. Also speaking at the opening ceremony were
the opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon and Interior Minister
Natan Sharansky.

<HEADLINE> MKO Members Arrested in Iran Before Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran said two members of the military
opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) were arrested on
Monday before they could launch a mortar attack in the capital city
of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The MKO team was busted hours before it would carry out sabotage
operations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a
statement from the Intelligence Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not say where the MKO members were nabbed.
</P>
<P>
The report said arms and ammunition, including a 60mm mortar
launcher, eight mortar shells, four assault rifles, four grenades,
considerable amount of money and foreign exchange and a number of
forged identification cards were also confiscated from the MKO
team.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO on Saturday night launched a mortar attack on
an Iranian police headquarters in Kermanshah, the capital of
western border province Kermanshah, injuring several people.
</P>
<P>
The explosions took place hours after Iraq blamed "Iranian
agents" for an attack on Baghdad, in which a child was killed and
several other people injured. An Iran-backed Iraqi opposition
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday
denied that Tehran was behind the attack on Baghdad, which he said
was "an internal problem of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The MKO has launched three mortar attacks in the past three
months on government buildings and military headquarters in Tehran.
It has become more active in sending sabotaging groups into Iran as
the power struggle between the powerful conservatives and the
reformist allied with President Mohammad Khatami intensified. 
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a famous political-military group which fought
against the late shah's regime in the 1970s together with clerics.
But it split with them after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and was
outlawed in 1981 and forced to flee to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Accused by the ruling clergy as a terrorist group, the MKO
carried out a series of cross-border attacks and assassinations of
senior Iranian officials in recent years. Tehran responded with
several air raids on MKO bases inside Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Should Keep Active Role in Eurasia: Demirel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel said on Monday that Turkey should continue to be
one of the leading countries in the construction of the common
future of Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who will hand over presidency to the 10th President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer on Tuesday, said this in remarks at a farewell
news conference held at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Sezer, the former presiding judge of the Constitutional Court
who was elected as the next president on May 5, will make his
inauguration speech in parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, who won the presidency seven years ago, has been
dynamic and energetic in foreign affairs, attaching much importance
to the development of relations with Turkey's peripheral countries.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should maintain its active foreign policy and role in a
wide geography extending from the Balkans, Caucasia, Central Asia,
the Middle East, Caspian and the Black Sea Basin covering Russia
and Ukraine, to the Mediterranean Basin covering Greece and
Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
As his successor was inexperienced in foreign affairs, observers
said that they must wait and see post-Demirel foreign policy of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Evaluating his performance, Demirel said that "throughout my
public service, which is more than 50 years, I have been struggling
for Turkey's targets, and strengthening of democracy and
constitutional institutions."
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey managed to attain 5 percent growth rate in
the last seven years of his term in office, adding that the country
has ranked the 16th biggest economy among 189 countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite instabilities in the past 35 years, Demirel said, Turkey
has preserved a multi-party democracy. "Presidency will be handed
over tomorrow with a ceremony that the republic deserves. I wish
this to be turned into a lasting tradition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a country where, on three occasions since 1960,
military coups have overthrown elected civilian governments. The
most recent military government, which seized power in September
1980, governed the country for three years.
</P>
<P>
The veteran politician stressed that Turkey should preserve
democratic, secular, and unitary structure in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there were still many things Turkey has to
achieve, saying that Ankara's target is to catch up with the
standards of the European Union (EU) in every field following its
candidacy for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The country should speed up all basic structural reforms which
have been initiated in economic field, mainly agriculture and
banking, to reduce inflation and rate of interests, he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Takes Measures to Combat Rising Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday announced its action
plan to deal with the rising unemployment, which stands at more
than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the Greek government's national action plan for
employment, Labor Minister Tassos Yiannitsis said that Greece's
jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in 1998 to 11.7 percent in
1999, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, it was widely believed that the fight against
unemployment must be the first priority for the government, which
was re-elected in the April 9 elections.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the plan is to link education and employment,
subsidize employers creating new work positions, fight social
exclusion and promote equality of the sexes in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Greece will create 75,000 jobs a year
and a further 75,000 vocational training slots for the
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the measures is 880 billion drachmas (about
2.38 billion U.S. dollars), and the money will be provided by
national and community funds.

<HEADLINE> Fitch IBCA: Hongkong Rating Affirmed At 'A+'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international rating
agency, has affirmed its 'A+' Long-term foreign currency rating
for Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
This rating applies to senior unsecured sovereign debt issues
and sets a ceiling for all other Hongkong issuers, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA also affirmed its rating of 'F1+' for short-term
issues and of 'AA+' for sovereign issues in Hongkong dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Hongkong has recovered well from the
impact of the East Asia crisis. GDP grew by almost 9 percent at an
annual rate in the last quarter of 1999 and rapid growth is
expected for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is already falling and is now below 6 percent.
Reflecting this return to confidence, share prices have more than
doubled since the trough in mid-1998, according to Fitch IBCA.
</P>
<P>
Public finances are sound. The provisional accounts for 1999/
2000 show a surplus, thanks mainly to an unexpectedly high return
on the government's investments, which include the Hongkong shares
bought for 15 billion U.S. dollars in the anti-speculation
measures of August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said there is no government debt or imminent need
to borrow and the public sector is small by international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong remains a substantial net external creditor and has a
very high rate of domestic savings. Its banking system is well
capitalized and remains profitable, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that substantial reforms are in progress to
enhance Hongkong's reputation and capacities as an international
financial center.

<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's most senior
trade official, Pascal Lamy, has told the BBC of his optimism over
a possible trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU is the biggest of seven WTO members who have
yet to reach a bilateral trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
Lamy told the BBC's Today program that he was "more hopeful
than last time" that he will reach agreement with Chinese
officials on market-opening measures that would benefit European
companies.
</P>
<P>
"China has made it an important part of their policy to join
the WTO in order to restructure and reform their economy," Lamy
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that a deal with the EU would remove a
major barrier to China's accession to the WTO, opening key markets,
especially in the service sector.

formats for cooperation in line with the country's entry into the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for business concerns, at this critical

Monetary Union, and also the relations developing in the Balkans
and in the Black Sea countries, and establish strategic alliances,
" Papantoniou said at an Athens seminar on strategic alliances
between Greek and foreign firms.

<HEADLINE> France Hosts NATO Partnership for Peace Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- France began on Sunday to play host
to a 12-day long military exercise by NATO and its associate
countries in the ``Partnership for Peace'' program, announced the
French Army on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which is being joined by 600 soldiers from 22
countries and carried out in the southern province of Var, is
aimed at improving the capability by NATO and its associate
countries in cooperating in peacekeeping operations, said the
French Army.
</P>
<P>
Code-named ``Cooperative Lantern 2000,'' the exercise is also
for training the commanders and chiefs of staff at the level of
brigade in conducting such operations.
</P>
<P>
The French Army said that this is the first time for France,
which has pulled out of the integrated military commanding
structure of NATO since 1966, to play host to and organize a NATO
exercise in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
France is using for the first time its new military information
and communication system, called ``Shelters,'' in coordination
with the computer system of the NATO commanding center based in
Heidelberg,Germany.
</P>
<P>
Two multinational brigades, composed with soldiers from NATO
and its associate countries and led by the Netherlands and the
Czech Republic respectively, are under the command of German
general Klaud Reinhardt during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Reinhardt, who was chief of NATO forces in Kosovo, is aided by
German general Joachim Spiering, who is commander of NATO northern
region in Europe, and French general Marchel Valentin, former
commander of NATO extraction force in Macedonia, which was
deployed in 1999 for helping the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe supervise an abortive truce in Kosovo.

PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Scientific
Research Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg said on Monday that France
will be more supportive of a European venture on launching manned
outer space flights.
</P>
<P>
He told France's space and aeronautics experts that France
agrees to cooperate with other European countries in building an

</P>
<P>
``Without giving a definite view, I intend to consider that
manned flights should keep a certain place in all space policies,
'' he said when marking the 20th anniversary of the establishment
of the Arianespace company, which launches satellites from the
European space center in French Guiana.
</P>
<P>
``I know as well that a considrable part of the European space
budgets is dedicated to the development of this (space) station,
and I will make certain that this program remains inside the
packages (of budget),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzenberg's predecessor, former Minister Claude Allegre,
had always opposed to a venture on manned space flights, because
he considered such a program too costly for Europe.

<P>
ATHENS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The new Athens 2004 Olympic Games
Organizing Committee chief Yianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki expressed
her belief Monday that Greece would realize its goal of organizing
a perfect Olympic Games in 2004 through hard work.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined that with the assistance of responsible
ministers, the government and the organizing committee, we will
reach our goal," she said in her first statement after officially
assuming the post of Athens 2004 Olympics president.
</P>
<P>
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who spearheaded Athens' campaign to
host the 2004 Olympics, said after a high-level government meeting
focusing on all-important 2004 Olympics preparation that they must
work hard.
</P>
<P>
"During this phase, it is important that we work and not talk,
"she stressed.

areas of Olympic preparations, but the IOC has hailed the
replacement by Angelopoulos-Daskalaki of Panayiotis Thomopoulos as
Athens 2004 Games chief.

<HEADLINE> Lumumba Probe Still in Early Stages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian parliamentary
investigation into the assassination of Patrice Lumumba was still
in its early stages, sources close to the probe said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Though some claims were coming out including one recount by a
Belgian policeman on the death and disappearance of the body of
the Congolese prime minister, the parliamentary investigation
committee still thought it was early to announce anything to the
press.
</P>
<P>
A secretary to the committee president said that the committee
had nothing to say about an Agence de Presse Francaise report
about a Belgian policeman who claimed to have cut the body of
Lumumba and thrown it to a tub of sulfuric acid to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
The policeman, identified as Gerard Soete and 80 years of age
now, described the circumstances under which he had done all he
said and wrote in a book after he returned from the Congo in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The novel, To Alleviate, writes about what had happened the
night between January 22 and 23, 1961.
</P>
<P>
The policeman said that he was accompanied at the time by
another white man and several Congolese.
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that the
parliamentary committee has met twice on May 2 and 9 after it was
set up, prompted by Belgian sociologist Ludo de Witte who has
written a book entitled The Assassination of Lumumba to try to
shed some light on the incident.
</P>
<P>
De Witte believes that the then Belgian authorities were
largely responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian parliamentary investigation committee next meets on
May 22.
</P>
<P>
The Congo, a Belgian colony since 1885, declared independence
on June 30, 1960. Seven months later, Lumumba was assassinated on
January 17, 1961 allegedly at the order of the leaders of the
secessionist province of Katanga of the African country.
</P>
<P>
De Witte believes that Belgium has a hand in the events related
to the assassination, from the transfer of Lumumba to the province
of Katanga, the execution of the independent leader and the
disappearance of his body.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Surges in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial production
increased at the fastest rate in more than one and a half years in
April as businesses ran at their fastest operating rates since mid-
1998, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production at factories, mines and utilities climbed
0.9 percent in April after a sharply upward revised increase of 0.
7 percent in March, which was originally reported as a 0.3 percent
gain.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in April output was the strongest since a 1.8
percent jump in August 1998, and was accompanied by a much higher
rate of capacity use than in previous months as businesses ran at
a faster pace to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
The operating capacity rose to 82.1 percent in April from 81.7
percent in March, and was the highest in nearly two years since an
82.4 percent rate in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rate is still below the rate of 85 percent which many
economists consider a signal of potential production bottlenecks,
but implies that businesses were beginning to strain to meet
robust consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
With the Fed's policysetting Federal Open Market Committee set
to meet on Tuesday, analysts said the industrial production data
fit with other indications of economic momentum which could lead
to the Fed raising short-term interest rates by half a percentage
point to cool growth.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised interest rates five times since last June,
by quarter percentage point increments each time, but there are
relatively few signs that the pace of expansion is easing.

<HEADLINE> China Worried by Chemical Weapons Destruction Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday expressed its
concerns about the slow pace of destruction of chemical weapons,
abandoned chemical weapons in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Asian country expressed its "deep concern" about the fact
that "no major development has been registered in addressing the
numerous important issues which have a bearing on the
implementation" of the convention on the prohibition of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
One of China's concerns is the chemical weapons left by Japan
inside China.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 pieces of Japanese abandoned chemical weapons (ACW)
were newly discovered in Nanjing. The ACWs are posing serious
threats to both the safety of local people and to the ecological
environment, said Li Yongwu, chief of the Chinese delegation
attending the fifth session of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Li said: "We should not forget the irreparable damage brought
by wars and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The advent of
chemical weapons in the early 20th century once resulted in more
than 1 million casualties."
</P>
<P>
"Comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of these
weapons have become a common goal of humanity," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zilisteanu:Real Estate Market Redress Hinges on Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Real estate transactions in
Romania dropped below 100,000 last year from 230,000 in 1996, head
of the Intermedias real estate agency Corneliu Zilisteanu told a
press conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Zilisteanu, the real estate market can be
redressed on the background of a growing economy. "The general
dynamics of the market over the past 3-4 years has been sagging
along with the economy, to which real estates trading reacts very
quickly,"Zilisteanu said.
</P>
<P>
Prices for apartments at the city boundaries went down by
approximately 15 percent, while for the downtown apartments they
dropped much less.
</P>
<P>
That real estate customers belong to the middle class is the
cause for much of the problem. De-capitalisation of small- and
middle-sized enterprises, generally owned by this class, made the
middle-class people divert their financial resources from real
estates acquisition to making business on their own.
</P>
<P>
President of the Trade Registry, Cornelia Rotaru told the press
conference that there were 103,000 commercial companies dealing
with real estate transactions in Romania, of which 25 percent in
the capital city Bucharest alone.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 2,000 of these companies declared their annual
revenues from these kind of transactions.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Israel Set to Double Their Trade Volume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Free Trade Agreement to be
signed by Romania and Israel on July 4 will double, in nearly two
years,the trade volume between the two countries, chairman of the
Romania-Israel Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Jose Iacobescu,
was quoted by the Adevarul daily as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian-Israeli trade stands at 250 million U.S. dollars.
Romania imports from Israel advanced technology and exports mainly
raw material for constructions.
</P>
<P>
The Free Trade Agreement will enable Romania to sell furniture
and textiles on the Israeli market at lower customs duties or tax-
exempt.
</P>
<P>
The two countries decided to boost economic cooperation during
a visit to Israel by Romania's President Emil Constantinescu
earlier this year. Formal negotiations on the signature of a free
trade agreement began on January 31, 2000, aimed to lay the
groundwork for a normal competition between the Romanian and
Israeli products.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is due to be signed when Israeli Industry and
Trade Minister Ran Cohen visits Romania in early July.
</P>
<P>
Israel, with 1,600 companies set up in Romania, is the country'
s 24th biggest investor. Israeli official statistics show that in
1999 Romania was Israel's second-largest trading partner, after
Russia,among the Central and East European states.
</P>
<P>
As many as 18 Romanian economic missions to Israel had been
organized over 1990-99, in which 400 Romanian businessmen
participated.

PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday promised his Polish counterpart, Aleksander Kwasniewski,
that France will support without reservation Poland's entry into
the European Union (EU) during its EU presidency in the latter
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"I have confirmed to President Kwasniewski the determination of
France... to bring support without reservation to Poland in the

<P>
Chirac also appeared side by side with Kwasniewski at the
balcony of the Elysee palace in an unprecedented protocol ever
offered to a foreign head of state.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kwasniewski said that he was very moved to see
the Polish national flag flying along the Champs-Elysee grand
avenue.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Mozambique overmanned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Mozambique is having
difficulty in dealing with its surplus unqualified staff, a senior
staff member of the bank Jose Moiane said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moiane said that while the central bank has too many low level,
 relatively unskilled staff, it is short of qualified staff,
particularly with higher education, which is a setback for the
"ideal functioning" of the institution.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during an interval at the annual meeting of the
 directors of human resources of the central banks of the five
Portuguese Speaking African Countries (Angola, Cape Verde,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe).
</P>
<P>
Moiane noted that the problem of an excess of unqualified staff
is common to the central banks in other Portuguese Speaking
African Countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the only way out is to invest in
professional and academic training of the existing staff, and to
encourage them to stay with through attractive wages and other
incentives.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mozambique employs about 600 workers countrywide.
</P>
<P>
As for the two-day meeting, Moiane said that it is aimed at
defining common staff management policies since the problems of
the banks are similar.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, according to Moiane, Portugal, which has also
sent a delegation to the meeting, has better know-how and can thus
play an important role in assisting the central banks in
Mozambique.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 177 member states of the
 Convention on Biological Diversity gathered in Kenya's capital
Nairobi Monday to begin a two-week conference aimed at promoting a
more sustainable relationship between humanity and the dwindling
plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
"In the context of the Biodiversity Convention, we must be
aware of the interrelation between the biodiversity and poverty,"
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), said at the opening ceremony of the
fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.
</P>
<P>
The international community must be aware of the urgent need of
 equitable benefit sharing between the developing world and the
industrialized countries of a new partnership from debt relief to
the transfer of environment friendly technology, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
"The legal and policy instruments are mostly in place, but what
is now critically needed is the will to ensure these instruments
are implemented and enforced," Toepfer added.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 government officials and observers are expected to
review the progress in addressing the threats to biological
diversity with the aim of identifying practical solutions.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also examine the effectiveness of the
institutional framework of the convention, which was negotiated
under the auspices of the UNEP which is headquartered in Nairobi.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Angola Monday denied accusations by
the Zambian government that the Angolan troops had violated the
Zambian air space to attack Angolan rebels, according to the
official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Defense Ministry said earlier that eight planes of the
Angolan air force took off from the Kamina air base in the south
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and flew into the
Zambian air space and then returned to Kamina on April 17.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Zambian Ambassador to Angola Philip Bulayo,
Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda said that it was impossible
for such an invasion to occur since Angola has no aircraft at the
Kamina base.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister revealed that the Angolan government
forces had made an air raid on Gimbe close to the border with
Zambia after they were informed that rebel commanders were
gathering there.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Angola-Zambia joint military commission
hold a meeting soon to discuss the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> South Africa's Ruling Party Calls for Fair Elections in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) on Monday called for the creation of a
climate for a free and fair parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the ANC Nat Serache said here that the party had
sent a delegation to Zimbabwe to help the governing party and
opposition achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
He said ANC Secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe at the head of
the delegation, met the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party and the opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) separately in Harare at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Serache said Motlanthe "expressed the ANC's concerns over the
situation in Zimbabwe and appealed to the two parties to ensure
there will be free and fair elections," referring to escalating
political violence linked to the invasion of white-owned farms by
liberation war veterans and to upcoming parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe also discussed the land crisis in Zimbabwe with the
two parties, and expressed the necessity for the 1998 agreement
to be implemented, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, white farmers in Zimbabwe would transfer 5
million hectares of land to landless black families in a land
reform to be funded by foreign donors, who, however, have
demanded that the program be " consensual, transparent,
economically sustainable and orderly" and should " particularly be
focused on poverty alleviation."
</P>
<P>
Since February this year, around 1,200 white-owned farms have
been invaded by liberation war veterans, sparking a spiral of
violence.
</P>
<P>
General elections are due in Zimbabwe by August 11, but exact
date has not yet been set.

<HEADLINE> 50 Women Elected to Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Central Committee </HEADLINE>

HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's 10 provinces have elected
50 women to the Central Committee of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf), Zanu-pf National
Chairman John Nkomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that all the provinces had
submitted five names each to the Politburo and the 50 would join
the rest of the members at the next Central Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Zanu-pf national congress adopted a resolution in December
last year, co-opting 50 members of the Women's League into the
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It also endorsed another resolution that ensures that at least
one in every three party positions are held by a woman.
</P>
<P>
"Names have been submitted to the Politburo from all the
provinces," Nkomo said. "These are now new members of the Central
Committee. This is in accordance with a resolution of the
congress."
</P>
<P>
The 50 women should have been co-opted by February when a
special Central Committee conference was held, but there were
delays by some provinces.

<HEADLINE> S. African Health Agency Warns Against Drug Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Monday warned
against hikes in prices of other drugs by U.S. pharmaceutical
firms which had earlier dramatically reduced the prices of drugs
for the treatment of HIV/ AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Board of Healthcare Funders (BHF), the representative body for
medical aid companies, would not tolerate any unjustifiable
increases in the prices of other drugs as a result of the
reduction in prices for HIV/AIDS drugs, BHF chief executive Aslam
Dasoo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We believe they can more than adequately fund the reduction in
prices of HIV/AIDS drugs out of their already highly inflated
margins without passing any additional increases to hard-pressed
consumers," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Some major U.S. pharmaceutical companies agreed earlier this
month to reduce the prices of anti-AIDS drugs so as to make them
available to more families haunted by the disease.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs was a victory for
those who had campaigned vigorously for access to these drugs by
the millions of poor people in developing countries afflicted with
the virus, for whom this represented hope and a better life, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that the price of all medication in South
Africa was already well above what the market could afford and
said funders were straining to finance pharmaceutical expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that while HIV/AIDS drugs may become more
accessible, other critical medicines for afflictions which are
rife in our country may well become less accessible if the
pharmaceutical industry simply transfers the cost to other drugs,
as they have been known to do in the past," it added.

United Nations, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Monday that he was relieved to hear the release of
U.N. soldiers by rebels in Sierra Leone, and the United Nations is
working hard to get all other rebel-held peacekeepers back to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
"I am relieved that 157 of the detainees have been released,
we are working hard and get all the others to freedom," he told
reporters upon his arrival at the U.N. Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
have freed 157 U.N. hostages in the first sign of a breakthrough
in a two-week-long crisis that threatened the world body in its
effort to mount the world's biggest peacekeeping operation in the
West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping force is in good spirit, said
Annan, who said that he contacted the commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force, Major General V.K. Jetley of India, and the U.
N. special representative in Sierra Leone on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the release, "the (U.N. soldiers') morale is
good," and General Jetley "is carrying on with a strategy of
getting soldiers released, consolidated and stabilizing the force,
" Annan said. "Jetley and his men are in good spirit."
</P>
<P>
Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by the RUF at
the start of May, having a ripple effect on the U.N. peacekeeping
operations in other African countries, such as the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> War to Continue Unless Israel Withdraws From Shebba: Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah
warned publicly for the first time that its guerrilla war against
Israel would "continue without letup" if Israel fails to withdraw
from the controversial Shebba Farms, As Safir newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah also
threatened to "slaughter every remaining armed South Lebanon Army
(SLA) (militiaman) in south Lebanon after Israel's planned
withdrawal from the occupied zone by July," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He warned the Lebanese government against showing or seeking any
leniency for the pro-Israel SLA militia, saying "traitors should be
mercilessly punished, not soothingly pardoned."
</P>
<P>
However, Nasrallah's deputy, Naim Kassem, offered to pardon any
SLA militiaman "who kills an Israeli soldier or kill his SLA
officer and then surrenders to Lebanon's legitimate authorities,"
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has invited United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan to visit Beirut for talks about the
Shebba controversy before he submits recommendations to the
Security Council on the post-withdrawal role of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Al Mustaqbal newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The highly fertile Shebba Farms, seized by Israel from Lebanon
in the 1967 Middle East war, are located on the Lebanese side of
Mount Hermon, Syria's highest mountain, which is under Israeli
occupation. Israel argues that the Shebba Farms belong to
Syria, and that a withdrawal from the area will be considered in
peace talks with Damascus when they resume.   
</P>
<P>
According to the British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebba Farms are not included in
the Lebanese side. But Beirut retorted that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in a 1951 agreement between Lebanon and its major power
broker Syria.

back reliance on foreign workers by 50 percent by 2010 under the
legislation on buildable design to be effected next January.
</P>
<P>
Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan said so at the a
awards presentation ceremony where he highlighted the legislation
on buildable design and the use of information technology in the
construction sector.

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Nominated for New Chairman of Germany's Reform Communist PDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The former East German Communist
Party, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) will have its new
chairman. He is 45-year-old Gabriele Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
Zimmer was nominated on Monday unanimously by the executive
committee of the PDS to replace the incumbent party chairman
Lothar Bisky who had decided not to run for the position of the
party chairman at the beginning of April in the party convention.
</P>
<P>
Zimmer was a functionary in a state-run automotive and arms
factory during the East German era. Up to now he is the leader of
the PDS faction in the Thuringia state parliament.
</P>
<P>
The PDS is a follow-up party of the former East German
Communist Party after the reunification in 1990.Now it has become
the third biggest political force in eastern Germany. In the state
of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern it formed a coalition with the ruling
party - the German Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
But the PDS is now confronted with an uncertain future and its
two top leaders, the incumbent party chairman Lothar Bisky and the
party faction leader in the federal parliament Gregor Gysi had
decided not to run for the party chairman in April. There are big
differences within the party over the party policy and the basic
line in the future.

</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean rebels, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF),
have freed 157 U.N. hostages in the first sign of a breakthrough
in a two-week-long crisis that threatened the world body in its
effort to mount the world's biggest peacekeeping operations in the
West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeeping force is in good spirit, said
Annan, adding that he contacted the commander of the U.N.
peacekeeping force, Major General V.K. Jetley of India, and the U.
N. special representative in Sierra Leone on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the release, "the (U.N. soldiers') morale is
good," and General Jetley "is carrying on with a strategy of
getting soldiers released, consolidated and stabilizing the force,
" Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by the RUF at
the start of May, having a ripple effect on the U.N. peacekeeping
operations in other African countries, such as the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL,
has about 9,000 troops on the ground, and the United Nations is
working hard to get UNAMSIL to the full strength of 11,100.

LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Central Board of Health has
bemoaned the lack of adequate mental health staffing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Limbambala, acting director-general of the health
authority, said mental health was an essential and integral part
of the health care delivery system and required more staff, when
he officially opened a consensus workshop on mental health
staffing in Lusaka on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said a recent situation analysis revealed that out of 974
mental health staff positions on the establishment, there was only
341. This represented 35 percent positions filled.
</P>
<P>
Limbambala pointed out that the success of the health reforms
in the country depended largely on how well the human resource was
managed hence the need to improve in that sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the board was currently working on a 10-year plan that
would resolve the lack of staff in the sector that would ensure a
sustainable level of quality mental health care.
</P>
<P>
The workshop participants also called on the government to come
up with a bill that would address mental health care as the one in

<HEADLINE> Zambia Commended for Efforts Toward Sustainable Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is aware of the
challenges that Zambia is facing in its efforts toward achieving
peace, justice and sustainable human development.
</P>
<P>
UN acting resident coordinator Edward Maganu made the remarks
at the launch of the international day of the families in Lusaka
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Maganu said the occasion should help the country focus its
attention on priorities of empowering the families.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty eradication should be central to the
development efforts adding that poverty threatens the ability of
families to meet the needs of their members.
</P>
<P>
He added that the unsteady growth of the Zambian economy due to
different factors had resulted in high levels of deprivatization
and a large number of people being denied adequate access to basic
social services.
</P>
<P>
"These factors have increased migration from rural to urban
areas resulting in family disruption and undesirable phenomena
such as street children", Maganu said.
</P>
<P>
Maganu commended the Zambian government for its continued
efforts of introducing policies and programs aimed at poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
He further commended the government for reducing the plight of
refugees from Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) and the efforts made to resolve the conflict in Congo,
saying wars have a negative impact on families and in many cases
led to disintegration in families and loss of social security.
</P>
<P>
Maganu said the U.N. is committed to working with the Zambian
government in priority areas that would supplement the government
efforts of bringing about sustainable human development.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Issue Not Listed in World Health Assembly Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd World Health Assembly (WHA)
turned down here Monday a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate
in the assembly as an observer and decided by consensus not to
include the issue in the agenda of the week-long meetings of the
ruling body of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Council meeting and the opening plenary
session of the WHA, Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said
that China strongly opposed the proposal tabled by the Solomon
Islands and a few other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The same proposal was put forward during the past three
sessions of the WHA by a few countries, only to be defeated," he
said. "The fact itself demonstrates that the overwhelming majority
of the WHO member states are strongly against such a proposal."
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that Taiwan, as a province of China, is not
qualified to participate either in any activities of the WHO in
whatever form or name, or in any activities of the WHA in whatever
name.
</P>
<P>
"Instigated by the Taiwan authorities, a few countries are
proposing to invite Taiwan to participate in the WHA. Such a
proposal is legally groundless, not backed up by the minimum legal
common sense. What they are doing dose not have the slightest
degree of seriousness," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China," he stressed. "It
should therefore be left solely to the Chinese people to solve it.
No any other foreign country has the right to meddle or intervene.
Any proposal under whatever pretext or argument to invite Taiwan
to participate in the activities of the WHO in whatever form is
out of a political motivation, attempting to create 'two Chinas'
or 'one China, one Taiwan' in the international arena."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said, "Such an act constitutes an encroachment of China's
territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Chinese government and
its people will by no means tolerate such an intervention or
encroachment."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the health issue of people living in Taiwan,
Zhang told the meeting that the Chinese government has always
attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate
rights and interests of the compatriots in Taiwan and is concerned
with their health.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is ready to seek a mediated settlement
to the relevant issues in the field of health through proper
channels across the Taiwan Straits and to make appropriate
arrangements for the exchanges in the field of health between the
two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Taiwan authorities abandon the wrongdoing of
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the
international arena and safeguard the unification of the
motherland, relevant issues including the health one can be solved
through consultations, according to Zhang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Monday
urged both the Indonesian government and the separatist Free Aceh
Movement to abide by their truce agreement yet to be effective.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Portugal that holds the rotating EU
presidency, the 15-nation bloc said that it wants to "see a strong,
democratic, united and prosperous Indonesia" and it supports the
territorial integrity of the Southeast Asian archipelago country.
</P>
<P>
The EU described the truce accord as a first step toward
finding a just and lasting solution to the problems in Indonesia's
northern Aceh province.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union has welcomed the efforts of the present
Indonesian government to solve the country's internal conflicts
through dialogue rather than force of arms," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The three-month ceasefire accord was signed last Friday in
Geneva by the Indonesian government and the rebels with the aim to
end over two decades of violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The truce agreement, signed in a secret place in the Swiss city,
comes into effect on June 2 and will be reviewed regularly.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Palestinian Struggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday reaffirmed Tehran's support for the
Palestinian struggle against Israel "to liberate the occupied
Palestinian lands."
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that Palestine belongs to all Palestinians,
although the majority of them are now refugees, Asefi told
reporters on the occasion of May 15, the 52nd anniversary of the
establishment of the state of Israeli.
</P>
<P>
The only option available is that the fate of Palestine should
be determined by all Muslim, Christian and Jewish Palestinians
including those refugees, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran supports the Palestinian struggle based on the
bitter and painful experiences since the creation of the Israeli
regime in the region and in accordance with the internationally-
recognized laws and regulations entitling the Palestinian people to
determine their own fate.
</P>
<P>
He called on public opinions and international forums to more
effectively contribute to the restoration of the legitimate rights
of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian Shah regime had close relations with Israel,
but the Islamic republic established after the 1979 Islamic
revolution broke ties with Israel and refused to recognize the
Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
Labeling the Israeli regime as a "usurper" of Islamic and Arab
lands, Tehran supported Palestinians and Lebanese resistance
movement in their armed struggles to liberate "the occupied lands,"
including Jerusalem, the holy place for Muslims, Christians and
Jews.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Chief Negotiator Announces Resignation: Israeli Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Abed Rabbo announced his
resignation from his post as Palestinian chief negotiator in the
final-status talks with Israel, Radio Israel reported Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The report said Rabbo, who submitted his resignation to
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, took the
decision in protest over the holding of the secret Palestinian-
Israeli talks in Sweden, which Rabbo himself did not attend.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo, 54, has been engaged in undisclosed negotiations with
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami in Oslo, Norway, in
an effort to re-activate the sluggish peace process on the
Palestinian track after Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed
to reach an overdue framework agreement on the final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo was angered by the launch of the secret talks in Sweden
between Israeli officials and Palestinian legislative council
speaker Ahmed Qurei, said another report coming from Ramallah, West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Rabbo as complaining that the presence of more
than one channel was an Israeli game to weaken the Palestinian
negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Sunday that Qurei and Palestinian
Minister of State for Non-government Organization Hassan Asfour
were to meet Shlomo Ben-Ami and an official from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the leadership of the Palestine Liberation
Organization would meet later Monday to discuss Rabbo's resignation
and the entire peace process which had missed the May 13 deadline
for reaching a framework agreement on the final peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Summer Session of Israeli Parliament Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
launched its summer session on Monday afternoon, during which Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was trying to rally support for the cabinet
decision to transfer two Arab towns to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the opening speech, Barak delivered his policy
statement on the transfer of Abu Dis and Azariya, two Arab villages
on the outskirts of Jerusalem, to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet on Monday morning approved the handover of
the two towns to the Palestinian National Authority. The towns, now
under Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control, will be
transferred to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Barak explained the cabinet's approval of the plan, ensuring the
lawmakers that the move will in no way lead to the weakening of
Israel's control of Jerusalem, which Israel insists as its eternal
and indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
Barak's speech, however, was often interrupted by lawmakers
voicing disagreement over the controversial handover plan, leaving
the session in a stormy state.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Retail Sales Surge Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's retail sales surged
up in March 2000, growing markedly by 22 percent over the previous
month and rising substantially by 24.8 percent over a year ago,
according to data released Monday by the Singapore Department of
Statistics (SDS).
</P>
<P>
The data indicate that total retail sales in March 2000 hit an
estimated 2,377 million Singapore dollars (1,381.98 million U.S.
dollars), compared with 1,948 million Singapore dollars (1,132.56
U.S. million dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
SDS attributed the hike to the 60.1 percent jump in motor
vehicle sales, noting that excluding motor vehicles, the index
went up by a modest 5.8 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
SDS said that the retail activity of telecommunication &AMP;
computers enjoyed the biggest sales growth of 35.7 percent in
March compared to February.
</P>
<P>
It also said that after experiencing slack business in February,
retailers of medical goods &AMP; toiletries and furniture &AMP; household
equipment reported a surge of 25.2 percent and 23.7 percent,
respectively, in March.
</P>
<P>
Turnover of optical goods &AMP; books and that of recreational
goods improved by 14.9 percent and 14.6 percent separately in the
month, it added.
</P>
<P>
SDS also noted that retailers of food &AMP; beverages continued to
encounter slower sales of 21.3 percent and turnover of wearing
apparel &AMP; footwear and watches &AMP; jewelry was down by 9.7 and 7.1
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Supermarket and department stores also recorded respective
sales declines of 3.8 percent and 1.7 percent, it added.

dollars (158.13 million U.S. dollars) in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Adopts Rent-to-Own Housing Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it has adopted a rent-to-own scheme for shelter units
built by the government as part of its efforts to make housing
affordable to all Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
said the program covers mainly some 50,000 unoccupied housing
units.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, prospective beneficiaries can rent their
housing units, with a portion of their payments being converted
into equity and the rest as monthly amortization.
</P>
<P>
"They can pay 1,000 pesos (25 U.S. dollars) as rent monthly for
the first five years. After then, they have the option to convert
this into amortization," Leonora de Jesus, chairman of the Housing
and Urban Development Coordinating Council, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries who opt to convert their rent into equity on the
first year may get a corresponding discount, de Jesus pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Mass housing is one of the five centerpiece programs of the
current government, along with food security, peace and order, the
fight against graft and corruption, and electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has instructed the housing authorities
to make housing affordable to all Filipinos by lowering interest
rates from 16 to nine percent for socialized housing loans and
extending the amortization period to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
De Jesus earlier said her office had found out that some 50,000
government housing units were unoccupied, and many prospective
buyers refuse to move in despite discounts of as high as 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has targeted to build 350,000 homes each year
until 2004 to address half of the 3.2 million housing backlog.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Host International AIDS Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which has so far
killed 11.5 million people of sub-Saharan Africa, or 83 percent of
all AIDS deaths worldwide, is to be held in Lagos next month to
stem the tide of the HIV pandemic in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
A leading Nigerian newspaper, The Guardian, Monday reported
that the conference was organized by the Fund for International
AIDS Research and Education (FIARE).
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming conference will provide a forum for discussion
of TB and AIDS clinical trials in the African settings, and to
develop pilot STD programs targeting counseling for AIDS
prevention, behavioral assessments and treatment modalities,
according to FIARE'S symposium organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 2.8 million Nigerians, representing
5.4 percent of the country's population between the ages 14 and
49, are said to be infected with the virus, and more than 4.9
million will be infected with the HIV virus in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, HIV prevalence rate in Nigeria
has continued to increase at an alarming rate and the country now
ranks second within sub-Saharan Africa for the number of
HIV-infected adults, despite efforts to contain the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has entered a stage where the epidemic will increase at
an exponential rate unless adequate national and regional
responses are mounted to stem its spread, added the survey.

Mozambican tobacco leaf, Mozambique News Agency reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tete provincial governor Virgilio Ferrao said that there are
ongoing negotiations with the Zimbabwe authorities "for the export
of our tobacco through Zimbabwe", which should happen soon.
</P>
<P>
The problem of Mozambican tobacco growers is that Mozambique
has no tobacco processing industry. Normally Mozambican tobacco
leaf is processed in Malawi, but a panic over low prices on the
Malawi tobacco floors led to a sudden ban on the import of foreign
tobacco leaf.
</P>
<P>
Ferrao said that all formalities are nearly at a final stage,
and Zimbabwe is to process the Mozambican raw tobacco leaf and
export it to the international market, particularly to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Going against all the principles of the Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC), Malawi has banned Mozambican
tobacco", said Ferrao, adding that all contacts at government
level, and between the tobacco producers in Tete and the Malawian
Agriculture Minister, early this month, " proved fruitless".
</P>
<P>
He said that there are trucks loaded with about 7,500 tons of
tobacco leaf produced in Tete, Zambezia, Nampula and Niassa
provinces, that have been barred from crossing into Malawi, and
everything leads to the conclusion that this decision will be in
place for a long time.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican economist said he believes that the Malawian
decision arises from the fact that the Mozambican tobacco is of
higher quality than the Malawian product. As a result, Malawian
tobacco "loses market share to Mozambican tobacco".

<HEADLINE> Share of Global FDI Flows to Africa Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The percentage share of global
foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to African countries
declined while the external debt of the continent, as a proportion
of GDP, remains highest in the world, said a report by COMESA
chief.
</P>
<P>
Although (FDI) flows in Africa (excluding Egypt) quadrupled to
about four billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from one billion dollars
in 1990, the percentage share of global FDI flows to the continent
actually declined from 3.9 percent to 2.5 percent in the same
period, according to the report of the Secretary General of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Erastus Mwencha.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows to COMESA increased from about 0.8 billion dollars
1990 to 2.6 billion dollars in 1998, a small amount compared with
potential inflows, said the report, which was presented for
discussion and adoption by the ninth meeting of council of
ministers of COMESA which started here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Africa's external debt, as a proportion of
GDP, is the highest in the world. The total debt stock of the
COMESA region was 123 billion dollars in 1996, which represents a
staggering per capital debt of 480.86 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some COMESA member countries are spending more than half of
their export earnings on servicing their external debt and face
the impossible tasks of maintaining these levels of debt
servicing while at the same time trying to ensure that sufficient
resources are invested into he economy to allow net economic
growth to take place, said the report.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's debt crisis arose as a result of combination of
over-borrowing in the 1970s, the collapse of world commodity
prices, and the sharp increase in international interest rates,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> UN Confirms Releases of 139 Peacekeepers in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) rebels have freed 139 UN peacekeepers, David Wimhurst,
Spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone said
Monday in the war-torn west African country's capital Freetown,
according to a source reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst confirmed the releases of UN peacekeepers at a press
conference held in Freetown following earlier announcement by
Liberian President Charles Taylor in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a very positive development. It shows that
the crisis around our detained personnel is moving into a new
phase," the spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The freed UN peacekeepers had been sent to neighboring Liberia.
Fifteen were in Liberia's capital Monrovia and the rest were in
the Liberian border town of Foya, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who has reportedly maintained close relations with the
RUF leader Foday Sankoh, announced earlier in the day that the
released UN peacekeepers had been flown to Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> EU Deplores U.S. Quota on Wheat Gluten Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Monday
expressed its dissatisfaction with the United States as the latter
was planning to tighten EU export quota for wheat gluten.
</P>
<P>
Franz Fischler, EU commissioner for agriculture, said that the
U.S. move would further discriminate against the industry of the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The American tightening of wheat gluten quota is scheduled to
enter into force on June 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already started to challenge the U.S.
quota within the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Fischler described the quota as "most inopportune" and an "
unnecessary action".
</P>
<P>
"The lack of competitiveness of U.S. wheat processors on the
domestic U.S. market will not be resolved by altering the
operation of the wheat gluten quota," said the commissioner who
added that the U.S. move would only further "wreak havoc on trade
relations between EU suppliers and U.S. customers".
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States have time and again
burst into trade disputes over banana and genetically modified
organisms.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, 1998, the United States imposed a quota on imports
of wheat gluten of 24,513 tons from the European Union. This
quota was cut by over 5,000 tons on May 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU requested the establishment of a WTO panel on June 3
last year on the grounds that the U.S. move had violated the WTO
Safeguards Agreement. A WTO panel was set up on July 26.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Obuchi's Death at Aoyama Funeral Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people on Monday
mourned the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
in a wake at the Aoyama Funeral Hall in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Mourners, including Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori,
offered white carnations on the altar under a photograph of a
smiling Obuchi in the strains of some of Obuchi's favorite
classical piano music.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Emperor Akihito sent one of his chamberlains with a
monetary offering and flowers.
</P>
<P>
A family funeral for Obuchi will be held at the same hall on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said
the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will
hold a joint funeral for Obuchi on June 8.
</P>
<P>
The official funeral will be held at the Nippon Budokan hall in
Tokyo's Kudan district, the top government spokesman told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
LDP officials said Mori will chair the funeral committee.
</P>
<P>
Judging by previous funerals for Japanese leaders, 4,000 to 5,
000 people, including visitors from overseas are expected to
participate in the service for Obuchi, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
In deciding the date for the funeral, the Japanese government
and the LDP took into account Emperor Akihito's return from a
European tour on June 1, Mori's anticipated dissolution of the
House of Representatives on June 2, and the likely start June 13
of official campaigning for the lower house general election
expected on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, 62, died Sunday afternoon. He had been in a coma after
suffering a stroke in early April.

<HEADLINE> Uphill Struggle Without Susi and Mia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The medal-laden Olympic reign
of Indonesia's women badminton players is in jeopardy after a
series of setbacks and disappointing results at the Uber Cup.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's women suffered their first ever loss to Denmark 1-4
in the team tournament on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The result -- coupled with the fact that none of their players
have managed to gain automatic qualification in the singles at the
Sydney Olympics -- has highlighted the downturn in Indonesian
fortunes after a decade of success.
</P>
<P>
At the Barcelona Games in 1992, Susi Susanti sent Indonesia
into raptures by capturing the women's singles gold.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's place at the pinnacle of the women's game was
cemented by back-to-back Uber Cup victories in 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
A silver medal for teenage prodigy Mia Audina at the 1996
Atlanta Games was another notable effort. But the Indonesians were
unceremoniously ousted from their Uber Cup throne by China's women
in Hong Kong of China in 1998 and it has been downhill all the way
since.
</P>
<P>
Susi has retired from the sport and Mia ended a troubled period
in her personal life by migrating to Holland after marrying a
Dutch gospel singer. To add insult to injury, Mia, a naturalized
citizen of her new country, now hopes to represent the Netherlands
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a difficult time for us, we don't have the players
that we had two years ago," said Indonesian women's coach Emelda
Wigoeno. "It was the right time for Susi to retire but Mia was
still young and able to compete at top level. When she performed,
she could beat the best in the world ... too lose her was hard."

<HEADLINE> England Looking Ahead to 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The last time England made the
Thomas Cup semi-final was in 1984 when they finished third overall.
Since then, it has been a fight to avoid finishing last every time
they qualified and that will be the case against Sweden tomorrow
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
English coach Finn Traerup Hansen was confident England would
win but even more hopeful the seeds that have been and will be
planted will make the English a force to be reckoned with in world
badminton.
</P>
<P>
"We started a program in 1997, called World Class Performance,
involving children as young as nine and the target is the 2005
world championships," said Hansen, who hails from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
England, said Hansen, have big plans to develop the game and be
ranked among the big boys. "We will be launching two more programs
called World Class Start and World Class Performance after the
Olympics and hire three more coaches. "The first program will
involve players in the 9-15 age-group while the second will be for
the 15-22 age-group."
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle, finance aside, was to convince players that
badminton can indeed offer a career.
</P>
<P>
"I would say England have more professional players than
Denmark but their mindset has to change."
</P>
<P>
Until that happens, England can't hope to make an impact in the
Thomas Cup, let alone win it. "The ongoing Thomas Cup shows how
vital it is for teams to have good singles and doubles players."
</P>
<P>
Their financial problems are a thing of the past as BAE now
receive a yearly grant of one million pounds from the Lottery Fund,
which is used for sports development.

<HEADLINE> China Top Preliminary Group With Third 5-0 Rout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China showed why they were
favorites to reign the championships as they topped the
preliminary round Group B with a 5-0 rout of South Korea, the
third maximum mark in the as many matches, in the Uber Cup Finals
badminton tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
China, who dropped only one set in the three preliminary-round
matches, will meet runners-up Indonesia in Wednesday's semi-finals
match, while South Korea, second in Group B, meet Denmark in the
other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Denmark completed Group A with three wins when they ousted
Japan 3-2 for their third successive appearances in the semi-
finals, while Indonesia thrashed the hosts Malaysia 5-0.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's fourth tie, the Netherlands turned the table around
after trailing 2-0 to topple Sweden 3-2. Both were packed before
the final preliminary match.
</P>
<P>
With South Korea resting their top shuttlers, China were hardly
to be sweated in the demolish of their inexperienced opponents in
just more than two hours time.
</P>
<P>
China are on the roll to revitalize their most glorious record
in the Uber Cup championships during the span from 1984-1992, when
China won five time in row in the women's team event.
</P>
<P>
After losing to Indonesia twice in the following two versions
of the Finals in 1994 and 1996, China took the revenge with a 4-1
win over Indonesia in Hong Kong of China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhichao, world No. 1 player, started for China for the
second time and trounced Si Jin Sun, who replaced first-choice Kim
Ji-Hyun at the first singles, 11-3, 11-4 in 17 minutes, while Dai
Yun smashed away Jung Yeon Kyung 11-3, 11-2 in 18 minutes.
</P>

Gong Ruina wrapped up the singles games with the same 11-3, 11-

"China will win the Uber Cup again if they played with their
forms unless something uncommon happens, like injuries," said
China's coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
Li was completely not worried about the Uber Cup trophy, but
reflected his concerns of the men's Thomas Cup, which will call
off the preliminary round on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Thomas Cup here is the most unpredictable one in the past
decade, with so many contenders having the ability to win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think China are the favorites to win the trophy, but
it doesn't mean the better teams will win through because
everything could happen in competitions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia are the hottest to reign the
Thomas Cup championship, but they will deal with big challenges
from South Korea, China, Denmark or Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, spearheaded by world second-ranked player Camilla
Martin, have the best chance to enter the final of the Uber Cup
after 40 years. Last time they were in the final was in 1960,
when they lost for the second time in row to the United States to
finish runners-up. They lost in the semi-final to Indonesia 4-1 in
the last version of the Uber Cup in 1998, but this time it is the
overwhelming China who take on the depleted Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian coach Imelda Wigoeno said, "China are too good to
defeat. I tell my players to play their best tomorrow, otherwise
we will lose very badly."

<HEADLINE> Barak Works to Push Handover Plan Through at Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's office and his Labor Party ministers are working
intensively on Monday to ensure a parliamentary majority in support
of the handover of two Arab towns near Jerusalem when the Knesset
(Parliament) opened its summer session in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Barak is to deliver a policy statement to the Knesset on the
transfer of the two towns, Abu Dis and Azariya, which are currently
under Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control as Area B,
to full Palestinian control as Area A.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet endorsed Barak's transfer proposal at a
special session Monday morning with a vote of 15 to 6.
</P>
<P>
Those who voted against the plan included ministers from the
powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Interior Minister Natan
Sharansky of Yisrael Ba'aliya, and Construction and Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy of the National Religious Party (NRP)
</P>
<P>
The NRP has threatened to quit the coalition government over the
handover decision and its central committee is due to meet in the
coming days on leaving the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak has decided to turn the parliamentary voting on his policy
statement into a vote of confidence, sources said. Before the
Knesset voting takes place, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office
Haim Ramon and Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer are
expected to pay a visit to the home of Shas spiritual leader Ovadia
Yosef.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee in the morning, Barak attacked hardline Likud leader
Ariel Sharon and former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying
the previous government had agreed during the Wye Plantation talks
in 1998 on a Palestinian state with Abu Dis as its capital. He
maintained that Netanyahu and Sharon even allowed Palestinians to
build 100 meters within Jerusalem limits.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming summer session of the Knesset is to conclude by the
end of July.

"We will have obtained a great deal of information about the
seismological characteristics of the Marmara region by the year
2002," said Professor Naci Gorur, dean of the Istanbul Technical
University(ITU), at a research seminar which opened in Istanbul on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which will last until Wednesday, is being jointly
sponsored by the Scientific and Technical Research Council of
Turkey (TUBITAK) and ITU.
</P>
<P>
Gorur, who presided over the seminar, told reporters that a
total of 73 scientists, 55 of whom are from foreign countries, will
exchange views on facts and mysteries behind seismic activities at
the seminar.
</P>
<P>
He said that preliminary agreements and protocols would be
signed with Greek, French, U.S., British, Portuguese, Italian and
NATO experts under the coordinatorship of TUBITAK. Scientific
studies and research work will be launched soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
"An Italian research vessel will investigate and examine the
seismic mechanisms active in the Marmara Sea, and a French research
submarine will carry out a similar mission. Japanese and German
scientists will be based on the ground and carry out their research
on the risky region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will announce the results of the studies of the expert teams
on a regular basis, and provide people with reliable information."
</P>
<P>
The seminar is considered as the beginning of a series of
geological and seismological researches by scientists and experts.
</P>
<P>
TUBITAK was commissioned, in the wake of the devastating 7.4-
magnitude earthquake on August 17, 1999, by the Prime Minister's
Office with the task of quake coordination.
</P>
<P>
The council is in close contact with scientists not only from
around the country, but also from Greece, France and the United
States on quake research.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Forces Intensify Attacks on LTTE Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The army, which was under tremendous pressure for the past few
weeks to fight back and save the Jaffna peninsula from falling
into the hands of the LTTE, said that the intensity of the
fighting in Jaffna has "dropped drastically" during the last 72
hours with the LTTE appearing to be in a state of "disarray and
collapse in the face of mounting casualties."
</P>
<P>
A government statement said that 15 rebels, including a woman
guerrilla, and three soldiers were killed in six different
encounters in the peninsula Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of drop in the fighting comes just as the Sri
Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga met the leaders of all
political parties to brief them about the situation in Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Besides maintaining a confident posture, the government also
said that all essential supplies including arms, ammunition and
food items were transported by air and sea to the Peninsula
regularly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the PTI, amid reports of army pulling
out its troops in most of the Eastern Sri Lanka to strengthen its
forces in Jaffna, the LTTE appears to have stepped up its attacks
in the Eastern part of the country in a bid to advance into Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Manila Cautious on MILF's Pull-Out Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it wants the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) to clarify its offer to move out of the Narciso Ramos
Highway in Mindanao, in exchange for a stoppage of military
operations.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno told
reporters that while the government will always be ready to
explore all avenues to peace, it has to make sure the MILF
delivers on its offer.
</P>
<P>
"We're also interested in peace and we welcome this offer. But
there are certain details about it that have to be clarified. We'
re going to send a letter to them asking for clarification about
certain aspects of their offer," said Puno.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is to send the letter either Monday
night or Tuesday morning. In the meantime, he said, military
operations to clear the highway will continue.
</P>
<P>
The MILF offered earlier Monday to remove its troops from the
highway in Maguindanao province within 48 hours starting 6 p.m.
Monday in exchange for a ceasefire and a possible return to the
negotiating table with the government.
</P>
<P>
But Puno said the matter of whether or not the MILF will
deliver on its end of the deal has to be clarified first, lest a
stoppage of military operations endanger the lives of soldiers and
civilians in the area.
</P>
<P>
He added that while President Joseph Estrada wants an early
resolution to the conflict, he "has to be very cautious" as the
military's commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and MILF rebels have been locked in heavy
fighting since early this month for control of the highway,
resulting in heavy losses on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Backed by its 15,000 fighters, the MILF is the largest Muslim
separatist group in the Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Acquire More Land for Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
acquire five million hectares of land for redistribution to
landless Zimbabweans before the end of the year, a Cabinet
minister Sunday said in Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ruling Zanu-pf campaign rally, Minister of Home
Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said the exercise was meant to benefit
land-hungry Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the government's detractors who said it had failed
to acquire adequate land for resettlement in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said, "When we signed the Lancaster House Agreement for
independence, it was on the understanding that the land issue
would be put in abeyance for 10 years."
</P>
<P>
He said the government put in place mechanisms to acquire land
in the early 1990s through the enactment of the Land Acquisition
Act.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, we went a step further by acquiring 841 commercial
farms but the farmers took the government to court over the
issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 841 farms, totaling one million hectares, would be
acquired first.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the gazetting of an amendment of the Land
Acquisition Act next week would allow the government speedily
acquire and redistribute land.
</P>
<P>
"We will compulsorily acquire the other four million hectares
also before the end of the year. The Act is being amended in
line with the recent amendment of the constitution, which compels
former colonial power Britain to provide compensation for land
acquired for resettlement," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Industrial
 Development Organization (UNIDO) has pledged to support
Tanzania's efforts to attract foreign direct investment, Tanzanian
newspapers reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national workshop on investment regulations in Dar
es Salaam on the weekend, the UNIDO representative in Tanzania
Felix Ugbor said Tanzania can only eradicate poverty with
increased flow of foreign direct investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO's world investment network is ready to assist and
support Tanzania in its quest to attract green investments
provided that the necessary groundwork is done at home, the UN
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that UNIDO has for the past nine months been
providing technical help to Tanzania Investment Center within the
framework of its integrated industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The help was aimed at developing an investment strategy and
bringing to the attention of foreign investors the assets and
business of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there has been little success because local
institutions still have problems, such as conflicts of authorities
and jurisdictional gray areas.
</P>
<P>
Ugbor listed factors that could increase foreign direct
investment as policies conductive to productive investments, a
regulatory environment that keeps costs low, good infrastructure
and availability of educated workforce.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Integration Needs to Be Outward-Oriented: Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- In his statement at the opening
ceremony of the 9th Meeting of Council of Ministers of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa here on Monday, COMESA
Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha stressed the need for the COMESA
integration arrangement to be outward-oriented.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, while we seek to increase trade within the
region, trade with the rest of the world will continue to be
significant," he said, adding that "this means that COMESA should
be fully involved in the World Trade Organization multilateral
trade arrangements as a coherent grouping so that together we can
have an influence."
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-known fact that countries experiencing fast growth
in trade are those which are in fully functioning trade blocs,"
he said, adding that "not only have these countries increased
their levels of trade but they have also restructured the pattern
trade so that they now trade more with other members of the
regional group."
</P>
<P>
COMESA, a 21-member regional grouping, recorded a total
intra-region trade of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 with the
total trade reaching 62. 8 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Challenged to Solve Critical Trade Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Rajkeswur
Purryag challenged the member states of COMESA to solve a series
of trade related issues in order to reap benefits from the Free
Trade Area (FTA) to be in place on October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Monday at the opening ceremony of the 9th Meeting of
the Council of Ministers of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Market (COMESA), he said that "the benefits of the FTA
cannot be fully achieved without addressing certain critical trade
related issues."
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister made the remarks at the meeting under the
theme " COMESA FTA: Enhancing Investment and Competitiveness",
which was attended by nearly 200 delegates including those from
the Organization of Africa Unity, the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
These, in the first place, include reforming and strengthening
the financial systems, Purryag said, stressing that this is
essential not only to attract investment but also to enable us to
remain competitive in the global financial environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy prime minister, the political and
commercial risks which often deter foreign enterprises to explore
business opportunities are other major obstacles in the COMESA
region. He therefore appealed to COMESA member states to join the
Regional Trade Facilitation Project which will cover political
risk, and the COMESA Payment and Settlement System and the Africa
Commerce Exchange intended to create a regional network of banking
transfers.
</P>
<P>
"Another important constraint to investment and growth in our
region is the poor state of cross-border and multi-sectoral
infrastructures," he said, noting that "adequate and modern
infrastructures, both at national and regional levels as well as
our link with the outside world, will be critical in the
attainment of our final objective of full economic integration."
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also urged the member states to
increase cross-border activities, undertake private sector
structural transformation, develop the productive sectors as well
as improve the supply side capacities, and establish a stable and
predictable environment as a matter of urgency and in a concerted
manner.

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The 5th Summit of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is scheduled to open in
Port Louis, capital of Mauritius on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, with its headquarters in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, was
 established in 1994 to replace the Preferential Trade Area for
Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) which had been in existence
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The treaty establishing the sub-regional economic organization
was signed on November 5,1993 in Ugandan capital Kampala and was
ratified a year later in Lilongwe, Malawi on December 8, 1994 when
the first COMESA summit was convened.
</P>
<P>
The second COMESA summit was held on April 20, Lusaka, Zambia,
focusing on promoting regional trade, economic integration,
security and peace.
</P>
<P>
The 3rd summit was held in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo on June 29, 1998 under the theme "Information - A Tool
for Increased Trade and Investment in COMESA."
</P>
<P>
The 3rd summit set the target to establish a COMESA free trade
area by the year 2000, the establishment of Comtel, a private
company limited to provide a framework for regional
telecommunications interconnectivity, and the expanded membership
of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The 4th summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya on May 24 and 25
under the theme "Countdown to the COMESA Free Trade Area", with
the heads of state and government and representatives from the 21
member states voicing their determination and commitment to the
realization of the COMESA Free Trade Area by October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 5th summit is to be held in anticipation of the Free Trade
Area through which zero tariffs should be achieved among COMESA
members (free trade status). It is also expected to discuss, among
others, how to maintain peace and security in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda set by the COMESA Treaty, the
sub-regional organization will pass stage by stage on its way to
achieving its mission for an increased cooperation and integration
in all fields of development, particularly in trade, customs,
monetary affairs, transport and others.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, a common external tariff, or customs union, will be
established with less restricted movement of people (common market
status).
</P>
<P>
By 2025, a monetary union, free movement of people including
right of establishment (economic community status) will be
established.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the COMESA is to facilitate the removal
of all structural and institutional weaknesses of member states,
and the promotion of peace, security and stability so as to enable
them to attain sustained development individually and
collectively.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Troops Told to Leave Kisangani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. observer team in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has presented a provisional
plan for demilitarizing Kisangani, the third largest city in the
DRC, the New Vision reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They have asked the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) and
the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) to move 100 kilometers outside
the city," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan armies clashed on May 5 and 8 in Kisangani
where they had their troops stationed to support rival rebel
factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan to be studied and adopted by Uganda and
Rwanda, RPA will withdraw to Ubundu and Lubutu, and UPDF will
move to Banalya and Bafwasende.
</P>
<P>
Each army will be asked to leave two companies in the city, it
said, adding the withdrawal of troops will be done in phases.
</P>
<P>
The immediate plan is for RPA to withdraw to Simi Simi Airport
and UPDF to Bangoka and La Forestre, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The situation between the two armies in Kisangani remained
tense with the forces facing each other at Tchopo bridge and
Bangoka, the spots for recent clashes, the report said.

Paul Kagame held talks last Sunday, reaffirming their commitment

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Area Only Gateway to Global Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Rajkeswur
Purryag Monday described the Free Trade Area (FTA) to be launched
by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) on
October 1 this year as the only gateway leading to global
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The COMESA Free Trade Area is the only gateway for our small
economies to further integrate into the global economy by taking
advantage of economies of scale and the creation of a large
economic space," he told delegates attending the 9th Meeting of
the COMESA Council of Ministers here in Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
" We are convinced that the FTA will be beneficial to all of us
as it will provide us with an important instrument to integrate
our countries into a fast globalizing world economy," Purryag
said.
</P>
<P>
He said "with a combined Gross Domestic Product of 170 billion
U.S. dollars and a potential market of over 200 million people,
the COMESA FTA will be a strong attraction for both domestic and
foreign investment."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, by dismantling trade barriers, we shall reduce costs
of production, increase our productivity so as to be able to
compete in the local and foreign markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Purryag, "official development assistance to the
developing countries has declined consistently with the result
that we are now increasingly relying on the flow of Foreign
Direct Investment to finance our development."
</P>
<P>
"Access to a large market, therefore, enhances the prospects
for investment, and the transfer of technology and expertise that
it brings along," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister called on all member states to create
this large market through collective action and concerted
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Host International AIDS Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- An international conference on
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which has so far
killed 11.5 million people of sub-Saharan Africa, or 83 percent of
all AIDS deaths worldwide, is to be held in Lagos next month to
stem the tide of the HIV pandemic in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
A leading Nigerian newspaper, The Guardian, Monday reported
that the conference was organized by the Fund for International
AIDS Research and Education (FIARE).
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming conference will provide a forum for discussion
of TB and AIDS clinical trials in the African settings, and to
develop pilot STD programs targeting counseling for AIDS
prevention, behavioral assessments and treatment modalities,
according to FIARE'S symposium organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 2.8 million Nigerians, representing
5.4 percent of the country's population between the ages 14 and
49, are said to be infected with the virus, and more than 4.9
million will be infected with the HIV virus in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, HIV prevalence rate in Nigeria
has continued to increase at an alarming rate and the country now
ranks second within sub-Saharan Africa for the number of
HIV-infected adults, despite efforts to contain the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has entered a stage where the epidemic will increase at
an exponential rate unless adequate national and regional
responses are mounted to stem its spread, added the survey.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau Refutes "Alarmist" Speculation Over Internal Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Government of Guinea Bissau has
appealed to the international community to counter the "Alarmist"
speculation over the tensions existing in the western African
country, according to reports reaching here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a call to representatives of the international community in
Bissau, the Guinea Bissau government said that the situation in
the country is "a bit worrisome, but not as dramatic as it may
seem from the outside", said a diplomatic source.
</P>
<P>
The tensions were reported after the navy chief of staff Lamine
Sanha refused to step down from his post after being dismissed in
late April by the Guinea Bissau's President Kumba Iala.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Caetano Intchama echoed the concerns last
weekend, but called for an end to the speculation over "distorted
and exaggerated information".
</P>
<P>
Relations between the military junta led by General Asumane
Mane and the civil authorities are reported to be tense.
</P>
<P>
The Bissau government has meanwhile guaranteed that it will use
" dialogue" to resolve the question of Sanha's status and maintain
"respect for justice".
</P>
<P>
General Mane led an 11-month military rebellion that toppled
the former president Nino Vieira in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The post-conflict transition period ended last February, when
President Iala, Prime Minister Intchama and a new parliament took
office after the general elections.

<HEADLINE> Search for Survivors, Bodies Resumes at Enschede </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams resumed searches for
survivors and bodies at the fireworks explosion site at Enschede,
Netherlands, early on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The rescuers resumed their search at first light," said
Enschede Mayor Jan Mans at a press conference, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen bodies have so far been found, with only three of them
identified. Town officials feared that more bodies could be found
in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
A residential area of the town was devastated when an estimated
100 tons of fireworks exploded in a warehouse Saturday afternoon
in this Dutch town bordering Germany.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the warehouse have contacted the town officials
and said that they would be available for investigation into the
cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
A blaze inside the fireworks warehouse triggered multiple
explosions that destroyed the warehouse and the nearby residential
area accommodating some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local people described that there were two explosions that were
heard clearly. The first smaller blast set off a chain reaction
of the fireworks in the warehouse while the chain reaction in turn
triggered the second major explosion that did most of the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The initial explosion set off hundreds of fireworks that drew a
crowd of local residents who had mistaken the scene for part of a
show. As firefighters tried to contain the fire and local crowd
watching, the second major blast hit out to destroy the warehouse
and residential buildings as well as killing and injuring the on-
lookers.
</P>
<P>
The blasts injured 541 people with 40 remained in hospital for
overnight treatment on Sunday. Six of the injured were being
treated in intensive care units.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Wim Kok went to inspect
the disaster scene on Sunday. The Dutch prime minister pledged
government resources to help rebuild the shattered town.

percent growth in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Economist Calls for Cooperation Between Insurance, Securities Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese economist has
called for sound circulation of funds between the insurance and
securities sectors, saying that this is one of the prerequisites
for the healthy development of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, with the Chinese government think-tank -- the
Development Research Center of the State Council, said at an
international seminar that the Chinese insurance industry may face
major problems because of lack of access to the capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the insurance industry now has a total insured
risk of 1.5 trillion yuan (183 billion U.S. dollars). However,
aggregate capital of China's insurance company put together is
below 10 billions yuan, which will greatly affect the growth in
the companies' payment ability in the future.
</P>
<P>
Since most insurance companies put their capital into bank
deposits and treasury bonds, the continuous drop of interest rates
has already hurt the payment ability of these companies over the
past few years, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
For the past year, the Chinese government has allowed insurance
companies to invest in securities.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that permitting "mutual exchange" between the insurance
and securities sectors will safeguard the returns of insurance
funds.
</P>
<P>
China's fledging securities market also needs insurance
companies as ideal investors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu said there are three prerequisites for establishing sound
circulation of funds between the insurance and securities sectors.
</P>
<P>
First, the government should establish and strictly enforce a
legal and regulatory system over the insurance industry that
currently faces heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
Second, the country has to develop a stable, transparent and
fair capital market. And finally, insurance companies have to
create new products to meet the demand of the securities market.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rainfall Operation Bases to be Built in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Meteorological
Administration will build artificial rainfall and snow operation
bases and an ecological environment monitoring system in western
China.
</P>
<P>
Today's overseas edition of the People's Daily said the
measures will be taken to guarantee the smooth development of the
western region and protect the ecological environment there.
</P>
<P>
Experts here describe the move as a "blood transfusion" for
development of the west, as most of the northwestern areas are
arid or semi-arid, and agricultural development is an important
part of the development of the western region.
</P>
<P>
The China Meteorological Administration will also apply
satellite remote sensing technology in building monitoring systems
of the weather and ecological environment in west China.
</P>
<P>
These systems also will monitor the latest development of
forests, grasslands, and vegetable cover in the region.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of water has hindered the development of west
China, however the water resources in the air had been far from
fully used, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said, for instance, 80 percent of the water
resources in the air can be utilized in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, by making artificial rain or snow.

<HEADLINE> Official Forecasts Rapid Growth for China's Environmental Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's environmental industries
are expected to grow at more than 16 percent on average each year
during the next five years, a Chinese environmental official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
 Yu Dehui, director of the Science and Technological
Department of the State Environmental Protection Administration of
China (SEPA), said the annual output value of the environmental
industries in China is expected to total 140 billion yuan, or 16.8
billion U.S. dollars, by 2005.
</P>
<P>
 He told a seminar on China's environmental industries that
there are about 9,000 companies in China engaged in environment
protection-related business with an annual turnover totaling 52
billion yuan (6.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fast economic and population growth in the next five years
will translate into increasing pressures on both the natural
resources and the environment in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's economy, which has been growing at about 7 percent
annually on average during the past five years, is expected to
maintain this level for the next five years, while China's
population of 1.2 billion people will continue to grow, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the ever-growing investment in environmental
protection and pollution control in China and the growing
awareness of Chinese society, the environmental industries are
expected to be greatly improved in terms of product quality,
eventually becoming a new growth sector in the national economy,
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of measures should be taken to regulate the
market for environmental industries, calling for incentives and
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, the International Meeting on Government and
Business Strategies of Environmental Industries in China, opened
today sponsored by the SEPA with the support of environmental
departments of the European Union and the Norwegian and Japanese
governments.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong's Cheating Methods Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency released a
signed article today exposing the major deceptions used by the
notorious Falun Gong cult group to control its believers for evil
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The three methods are "xiaoye," "shangcengci," and "yuanman,"
the article says.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi, the cult leader, has forbidden his followers to go
to the hospital when they fall ill. They must practice Falun Gong
so as to "xiaoye," which means curing yourself by practicing Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
However, the article presents several examples to show that
many patients have died of "xiaoye." So far, over 1,500 people
have lost their lives practicing Falun Gong, it says.
</P>
<P>
It also exposes the fact that the cult leader and his daughter
went to the hospital when they were sick. "He did not dare risk
his own life with 'xiaoye,' the articles says.
</P>
<P>
"Shangcengci," the third method, asks people to move up to a
higher level of the cosmos by advocating and safeguarding Falun
Gong, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Mankind, who are now extremely evil, are living on the lowest
level of the cosmos, and they have to go up one level at a time,
according to the cult leader.
</P>
<P>
Li has fabricated many stories about those who have avoided
death by practicing Falun Gong, and asked his followers not to
spread anything against Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Believing in Li's words, a large number of Falun Gong followers
beleaguered the central and local governments. Li called these
illegal activities the best way for his believers to "shangcengci,
" or ascend to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
"Yuanman" is an expression the cult leader has stolen from
Buddhist scripts, which means accomplishment of religious training.
</P>
<P>
"If you reach 'yuanman,' you will become a giant god and can
easily hold the Earth in your hand," says the cult leader.
</P>
<P>
However, no Falun Gong follower has so far become god or made
space journeys with his body or his soul. To the contrary,
several Falun Gong practitioners have died in traffic accidents,
the article says.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Baghdad Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Monday denied the Iraqi claim that Tehran was
behind the recent explosions in Baghdad, Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Terming the claims by some Iraqi officials and newspapers as "
baseless," Asefi said the explosions in Baghdad were the internal
issues of Iraq and had no links with Iran.
</P>
<P>
A child was killed and several other people were injured on
Saturday in a missile attack in Baghdad. Iraqi officials and
newspapers blamed "Iranian agents" for the attack.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi opposition group backed by Iran claimed responsibility
for the attack and vowed to continue attacks on the Baghdad regime
until its collapse.
</P>
<P>
Hours after the attack on Baghdad, the Iraq-based Iranian
military opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) launched a
mortar attack on Kermanshah, the capital of Iran's western border
province Kermanshah.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
witnesses as saying that several people were injured in the
explosions in the central city.
</P>
<P>
The MKO claimed that its members had launched a mortar attack
against the headquarters of an Iranian anti-riot police in
Kermanshah.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the MKO has launched three
mortar attacks on residential units in the capital city of Tehran,
close to Iranian government building and military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The group, a famous political-military one which fought against
the former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into
Iraq following sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
series of cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including attempts to assassinate senior Iranian officials. In
retaliation, Iranian armed forces also launched several air raids
on the MKO bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year-long bloody war that ended in
1988 and relations between the two Muslim neighbors remain
strained. The two countries have always been trading accusations
against each other for harboring opposition groups.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP Grows by 3.21 Pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Within the first three month of the
year 2000, Indonesia's gross domestic products (GDP) grew by 3.21
percent, the National Bureau of Statistic (BPS) announced here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's GDP in the first three months of the year 2000
grew by 3.21 percent compared with the same period last year,"
Chairman of BPS Sugito Suwito told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, he said, the GDP
during January-March this year increased by 1.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
Suwito said that GDP per capita in the year 1999 reached 5.4
million rupiah (about 770 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"It means that nominally, GDP per capita in the year 1999
increased by 11.45 percent compared with the 1998 figure," Suwito
said.
</P>
<P>
Suwito also said that Indonesia's economic growth this year is
expected to grow by only 1.54 percent, much lower than the
previous estimate of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>

GENEVA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic executive Kevan
Gosper was cleared in Lausanne on Monday by the International
Olympic Committee's ethics commission of any wrongdoing in Salt
Lake City's bid for the 2002 winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Gosper, also an IOC vice-president, had been accused of
accepting lavish hospitality from the U.S. city during its
successful bid to secure the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
Gosper claimed that he had paid for the appartment he, his wife
and family stayed in but documents released from Salt Lake City
suggested Gosper had paid well under the market price for the
luxury suite.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday the ethics commission reported after a two month
inquiry into the allegations that the Gospers were innocent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no basis to conclude that Mr Gosper and Mrs Gosper
either knowingly or negligently violated IOC rules," said the
commission in a statement.

CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Emerging 14-year-old Leisel Jones
won the 100 meters breaststroke final at Australia's Olympic
swimming trials in Sydney Monday night to become the youngest
Australian on an Olympic swimming team since Michelle Ford and
Tracey Wickham.
</P>
<P>
Jones beat training partner Tarnee White to win the final in 1:

</P>
<P>
Ford and Wickham competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics as 13-

</P>
<P>
But as one star rose another set with former world record
holder and dual Olympic bronze medallist Samantha Riley missing
out on a place on what was to be her third Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old, who spent five days in hospital with a kidney
infection recently, could only manage seventh in 1:11.06.
</P>

Riley, who won bronze in the event at the 1992 Barcelona and

<HEADLINE> China Increases Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China exported 15.99 million tons
of coal in the first four months this year, representing an
increase of 4.9 million tons over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baoming, director of the State Administration of Coal
Industry, said the coal sector is exhibiting a favorable growth
trend and the excess supply of coal in some parts of the country
has been diminished. Moreover, coal prices rose moderately, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expects the country's coal export to top 38 million tons
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest coal producer, turning out 1.2
billion tons annually, or one third of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
However, China exports only 30 million tons of coal annually,
accounting for merely six percent of the world's total coal trade.
</P>
<P>
To expand coal export is of great significance for the
sustainable development of the country's coal industry, as it can
effectively reduce the coal stockpile and create a balance between
coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the increase of coal exports will open
the country's coal sector wider to the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Readjustment of Coal Industrial Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China has made headway in improving
operations of the coal industry, achieving noteworthy results in
cutting coal production and reducing the stockpile.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baoming, director of the State Administration of Coal
Industry, said the country's coal sector is launching a massive
drive to close illegal coal mines and reduce coal stockpiles. The
excess coal supply has been eased in some parts of the country
with coal prices rising moderately, he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country has closed down 33,000 small coal mines
and cut production by more than 300 million tons, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the construction of a large group of
small coal mines over the years caused the problem of supply
exceeding demand and led to serious losses in the coal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the mushrooming of small coal mines caused illegal
mining of coal resources, overall waste, accidents leading to
injuries and deaths, coal mines being damaged, and irregular
transportation and marketing of coal products.
</P>
<P>
The drive to close small coal mines and reduce stockpiles is a
major step to readjust the industrial structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is planning to close down another 18,900
small coal mines this year and cut coal production by 120 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
And the country's large state-owned coal enterprises will take
steps to produce according to market demand, adjust their product
mix, and lower production costs.

<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- In the fight against judicial
corruption, China will keep closer tabs on the after-hours
activities of its prosecutors as well as their on-the-job
performance, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Political workers of the procuratorial bodies should pay
attention to what prosecutors do in their spare time, what friends
they make and what entertainment they are engaged in," said Qiu
Xueqiang, head of the Political Department of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate (SPP), at a national conference.
</P>
<P>
Political education programs should be in place to ensure that
prosecutors behave appropriately even when they are off duty, Qiu
said.
</P>
<P>
As most cases of judicial corruption occur during the law
enforcement, a temporary team should be set up to oversee conducts
of prosecutors, Qiu said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Group Praises Jiangxi for Implementing Law on Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- After a week-long inspection of
east China's Jiangxi Province, a group of lawmakers from the
National People's Congress (NPC) concluded that the province has
played a positive role in implementing the law on township
enterprises over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The group was headed by Yang Zhenhuai, a member of the NPC
Standing Committee and vice-chairman of the NPC committee of
agriculture and rural affairs.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the NPC Standing Committee has made such
a review since the legislation took effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had about 20.71 million township
enterprises employing over 127 million people. The township
enterprises accounted for nearly one-third of the country's gross
domestic product for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers agreed that a series of policies issued by the
province over the past three years have accelerated the
development of its township enterprises and have benefited both
the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
However, the NPC group pointed out, the province still faces
some problems, such as inferior product quality and low
profitability, as well as township enterprises' difficulty in
obtaining bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The group suggested that the governments within the province
create a more favorable environment for the growth of township
enterprises.

should work hard to unite and educate entrepreneurs to advocate
various policies of the Party, run the businesses according to law,

<P>
Sudan offers vast opportunities to Malaysian businessmen and
hopes Malaysian businessmen would invest a lot of money in Sudan
in the oil industry in particular, he told reporters after meeting
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
here.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping for investments of about 1 billion U.S. dollars
in the oil industry in particular as well as other investments,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Minister said Malaysia could also join Sudan's
expertise in tapping the African market as Sudan, located in the
heart of Africa, offers big market potential in the access to the
300 million people living in the surrounding regions.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Sudan in 1999 grew to 113.5
million ringgit (29.868 million U.S. dollars), with Malaysia's

<HEADLINE> Philippine MILF Rebels to Pull out Embattled Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MILF military chief Al Haj Murad said in a statement that the "
MILF is voluntarily repositioning its combat troops now positioned
along the Narciso Ramos highway to the defense perimeter of Camp
Abubakar thereby completely clearing the highway of MILF
combatants."
</P>
<P>
The statement of the MILF came after the military bombarded
heavy Camp Abubakar along the highway that resulted to the
destruction of the rebels' communication center in the camp which
it the group's biggest enclave in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Murad declared that the repositioning of their troops was in
reaction to the appeal made by the Independent Fact-Finding
Committee of the Government-MILF peace panels dated May 13, 2000
for both parties to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Backed by its 15,000 fighters, the MILF is the largest Muslim
separatist group in the Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Camp
Abubakar has been under siege from government troops in the past
weeks, forcing them pull out from peace negotiations on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the battle has claimed hundreds of lives on both
sides and displaced more than 100,000 civilians.

<HEADLINE> Conference Against Child Soldiers Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The first ever regional
conference in Asia and the Pacific against the use of children as
soldiers kicked off here Monday, with the participation of about
200 delegates from over 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day Asia-Pacific Conference is co-organized by the
Nepali government and the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child
Soldiers, which is made up of six renowned international non-
governmental organizations (NGO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Jo Becker, Steering Committee
Chair of the Coalition, said the objectives of the conference are
"to build momentum for a global ban on the use of children as
soldiers and to build capacity of both governments and NGOs to
take forward practical programs for the prevention of child
recruitment as soldiers".
</P>
<P>
She said the conference is expected to adopt a strong
declaration outlining concrete steps towards ending the use of
child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition defines child soldiers as under the age of 18
years old. It is estimated that more than 300,000 child soldiers
are currently being used in wars and conflicts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
As one of the regions which are worst afflicted by the
widespread use of child soldiers, Asia has 75,000 child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The delegates come from 20 countries in the Asia-Pacific region
including Australia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Thailand,
Pakistan, Japan, the Philippines and over 10 countries outside the
region.
</P>
<P>
Three previous regional conferences on child soldiers were held
in 1999 in Africa, Latin America and Europe.

<HEADLINE> World Auto-Makers Expand Production in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- World major carmakers are expanding
their production in Thailand, as the auto industry has become one
of the fastest improving sector in the Thai economy, according to
local business researchers.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, one of the leading auto makers from Japan operating in
Thailand, has announced that it will increase its production
capacity in Thailand from 40 to 60 percent of total capacity in
2000.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, one of the "Big Three" car-makers of the United
States, has invested 750 million US dollars to establish a plant
in Thailand, aiming at penetrating the Thai market, of which Japan
currently holds 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ford, another U.S. "Big three", plans to export half of its
total production in Thailand to overseas markets. The company will
use 70 percent locally-made components in its production.
</P>
<P>
For European auto makers, BMW this year will increase its
production in Thailand to 10,000 cars after investing 35 million
dollars in establishing its production plant in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, Thai domestic auto sales
volume has increased 58 percent. And in April, a total of 20,728
vehicles were sold, up 48 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year a total of 260,000 cars are expected to
be sold, which will be a 19 percent increase over last year's
total sales of 218,330 units, local researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Logging Ban not Enough for Forest Conservation: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Forest conservation and protection
require much more than simply to eliminate or reduce timber
harvesting, said a report of the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared for the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission
meeting in Queensland of Australia between May 15 and 19, said
that logging bans are an important tool to avoid and minimize the
negative consequences of inappropriate forest use, but they seldom
correct underlying problems of misuses and conventional harvesting.
</P>
<P>
"Without an adequate conservation and protection policy and
appropriate management capacity, the closing of forests that have
been open for both traditional communities and commercial
harvesting imposes inequities and hardships," the report pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
To achieve successful natural forest conservation, the real
costs of forest conservation must be recognized and consensus must
be built for public sharing of the cost burdens of conservation
management, FAO suggests.
</P>
<P>
"Safety nets" should also be provided for individuals,
communities and institutions that are disadvantaged by policy
changes, accompanied by strategies for creating new self-
sustaining opportunities for the future.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, greater recognition and incentives should be given
to the private sector and market institutions through enhanced
land-use rights, more secure tenure, increased private decision-
making and participation in forest management, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimates that forest cover in the Asia-Pacific region
declined by an average of 2.9 million hectares annually between
1990 to 1995. The annual deforestation rate is 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Conversion of forests into agricultural or urban land, forest
fires and unmanaged industrial harvesting are the main causes for
the decline in forests, closely linked to poverty and
inappropriate or ineffective policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The lack of land tenures, alternative options for human
subsistence, inadequate markets for commercial products and
economic disincentives for the community and private sectors to
participate in conservation and protection all contribute to
continuing abuses and illegal forest activities, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Total logging bans, if effectively implemented, may buy time to
assess long-term goals and objectives, develop criteria and
implement sustainable forest management, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Temporary logging bans also allow degraded forests a respite
form further damage and a chance to recover.
</P>
<P>
The experience of Asian countries in applying bans and
harvesting restrictions has been mixed, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Removal of natural forests from timber production has had
significant impacts on the forest products sector and sometimes
disruptive effects on neighboring countries through both legal and
illegal trade, timber smuggling and market disruptions.

<HEADLINE> Thorpe Sets 3rd World Record in 3 Days (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Ian Thorpe set his
third world mark in three days to win the 200 meters freestyle
final at the Sydney Olympic trials Monday night to repeat his
world record feast at the Pan Pacific Championships last August.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old clocked one minute 45.51 seconds to slice
another 0.18 seconds off his previous world time of 1:45.69 set
just 24 hours ago in Sunday night's semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe also clocked a new world standard of 3:41.33 in Saturday
's 400m freestyle final at the Sydney International Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
The race Monday night gave him his 10th world record - just one
fewer than dual Olympic champion Kieren Perkins' tally - and
Thorpe is still months away from his 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
He was given a standing ovation from the 7000 strong crowd,
including swimming legend Dawn Fraser.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe beat world champion Michael Klim who grabbed the second
Olympic team spot in 1:46.89.
</P>
<P>
Klim, who won seven medals at the 1998 Perth world
championships, praised his younger rival after the race.
</P>
<P>
"He's just awesome," Klim said. "Every day he gets better."
</P>
<P>
Thorpe's feats are drawing interest from across the globe with
the trials' website having three million hits during the first two
days, 40 percent coming from the United States, according to meet
officials.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe's world mark Monday night was the fourth of the
Australian Olympic trials so far with five days left.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Huegill set a new 50m butterfly world time of 23.60
seconds Sunday night although he will have to wait until Friday's
100m event to gain Olympic selection.
</P>
<P>
The 50m butterfly is a non-Olympic event.

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Selection System for Prosecutors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- To build a more highly-trained team
of prosecutors, mid-level officials in all procuratorates will now
have to compete for their posts, and all new prosecutors must pass
national exams, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xueqiang, head of the Political Department of the SPP,
revealed the landmark changes to the current employee recruitment
and official promotion systems in the country's nearly 3,000
procuratorates in his speech at a national conference on reforms
of procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
The 11 department head positions and 86 division chief
positions of the SPP will be selected from among the SPP employees
instead of being appointed by the SPP leadership, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under Chinese law, high-level officials, or heads of
procuratorates, are elected by legislative bodies at their
corresponding levels.
</P>
<P>
Independent prosecutors across China will be selected through
competition, and other staff members must also take examinations
to qualify for their posts, thus losing their former life-time job
guarantee, according to the senior official.
</P>
<P>
Officials in higher positions should rotate periodically to
other posts or other areas, he said.

The SPP also announced that from now on, new employees of
prosecutors' offices must pass annual examinations organized by
the SPP, which will be held in April or May.
</P>
<P>
"There are currently 7,197 vacancies in procuratorates across
the country, and they must be filled with those who have passed
the next national examination," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates at all levels are being streamlined, and all
unqualified employees will be sacked, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu also revealed several other reform measures:
</P>
<P>
-- At least three top-level officials under age 45 will be
hired in each procuratorate in the country to help foster young
officials;
</P>
<P>
-- Heads of procuratorates are to move periodically to other
areas, and officials be exchanged in procuratorial bodies between
different levels;
</P>
<P>
-- A human resources databank will be set up for prosecutors;
</P>
<P>
-- The SPP will train 2,000 to 3,000 legal, economic and other
specialists for procuratorates in China's Western regions;
</P>
<P>
-- The selection system will avoid nepotism in regard to hiring
and favoritism in connection with law enforcement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A national forum for young people
to exchange experience in studying Deng Xiaoping Theory was held
here today.
</P>
<P>
Present were Vice-President Hu Jintao and Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing, who are members of the Standing Committee of the

Deng Xiaoping Theory guides the Party and the people to push
forward the socialist cause with China's own characteristics, and
bonds the Chinese people as they work to rejuvenate the nation, Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged that study of Deng Xiaoping Theory be combined with
the current reform in the country's educational sector.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Blast South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla bases in south Lebanon in two daybreak raids Monday
morning following a string of air assaults on other Hezbollah
strongholds on Sunday, the Oriental Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on damage or casualties caused by
several air-to-surface missiles fired by Israeli jets. But a
communique issued by Lebanese police said one Lebanese civilian was
wounded in Sunday's air raids.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, confirmed that its guerrillas
retaliated Sunday's raids by firing Katyusha rocket barrages on
Israeli border outposts of Sherika and Ramia at sunset.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced to withdraw from the border strip in south
Lebanon by July, ending its 22-year-long occupation there. It set
up the so-called security zone in 1985 with the claim to protect
its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah has been spearheading a
guerrilla war to oust Israeli forces and their allies South Lebanon
Army from the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Foreign Investments Decline in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in
Malaysia declined 6.1 percent in 1999, according to the Malaysia
International Trade and Industry Report 1999 released here Monday
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
</P>
<P>
However, MITI said in the report that foreign investments were
a major part of capital investments received during the year under
review.
</P>
<P>
The report says that 708 projects were approved in 1999, a 16.1
percent decline over 1998, and the approved investments mostly
into production were at 16.9 billion ringgit (4.447 billion U.S.
dollars), 35.9 percent lower from 26.4 billion ringgit (6.947
billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the approved projects, 364 were new projects and 344 were
expansion and diversification projects with investments of 9.3
billion ringgit (2.447 billion U.S. dollars) and 7.6 billion
ringgit(2 billion U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments accounted for 72.6 percent at 12.3 billion
ringgit (3.236 billion U.S. dollars), it said, adding the foreign
investors concentrated their investments mostly in electrical and
electronics products, petroleum and petrochemical products and
paper,printing and publishing.
</P>
<P>
MITI said that this reflected their continued confidence and
strong level of commitment in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investments received in 1999 were in contrast to
that of 1998 which were more focused on the higher technology and
capital intensive category, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore, Netherlands and
Switzerland were major investors in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office (AGO) on Monday questioned again former president Soeharto
at his residence for his alleged involvement in corruption
practices.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour investigation was carried out after prosecutors
of the AGO accepted a green light from the medical team observing
the state health of the former president.
</P>
<P>
Juan Felix Tampubolon, a Soeharto's lawyer, told reporters that
the questioning was carried out in a relaxed atmosphere, it was a
continuation of the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The previous session had failed to yield much information and
were halted due to Soeharto's poor health.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon also said that the health condition of the 78-years
old man has improved.
</P>
<P>
If Soeharto's health remains stable, the prosecutors could
question him every Monday, he added.
</P>
<P>
The former ruler is suspected of abusing his power and
authority in issuing decrees and government regulations to amass
funds through seven tax-free charity foundations, which he set up
and chaired during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been put under city arrest and was banned from
leaving the country.

PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Accusation Chamber of the Paris
Appeal Court will study the appeals against the decision by two

<P>
The appeals, which were made by the Egyptian billionaire,

of Princess Diana from the night of August 30 to the morning of
August 31, 1997, were innocent.

The judges also said that the driver of Diana, Henri Paul, was

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet approved the
handover of two Arab towns on the outskirts of Jerusalem to
Palestinian National Authority at a special cabinet meeting Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The two towns, Abu Dis and Azariya, which are currently under
Israeli security and Palestinian civilian control as Area B, will
be transferred to full Palestinian control as Area A, sources close
to the meeting revealed.
</P>
<P>
The transfer, which 15 ministers voted for and six against, will
be submitted later to the Knesset (Parliament) for approval, which
is scheduled to reconvene for its summer session Monday afternoon,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Religious Party, the major force in the
coalition strongly objecting to the handover of Abu Dis and other
Arab villages near Jerusalem, threatened before the cabinet vote
that it will leave the coalition over the Abu Dis issue.
</P>
<P>
Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, leader of the
party, told Israel Radio Monday morning that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak will cross a redline if he agrees to hand over these
Arab villages.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the transfer will endanger Israel's position in
the peace talks with the Palestinians over the status of Jerusalem,
which Israel regards as its "eternal and undivided capital."

had agreed with Pakistan and Iran on a joint operation to wipe out
the refining laboratories in the border area in the far south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are cracking down heavily on poppy farms and we will
continue to do so," said Akhundzada at Kandahar, Taliban's
headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan is a leading poppy producer in the world whose
opium harvest, a United Nations estimate shows, was about a record
4,600 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Akhundzada said the time it took to eradicate drug farms would
depend on the level of international funding, without specifying a
precise figure. He added an estimated 1.6 billion U.S.dollars is
needed for the work.
</P>
<P>
"The more the international effort, the quicker the crackdown,"
said the official, despite some reports saying that the Taliban
militia have been levying 10 percent tax on poppy harvest in the
area they control.
</P>
<P>
Akhundzada admitted that the southern desert in the province of
Helmand, which accounts for 45 percent of Afghan opium production,
contains several laboratories which transform opium into morphine.
</P>
<P>
"It's a fact that that exists," he said. "We want to dismantle
these laboratories but for that we need the cooperation of Iran
and Pakistan."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Apply Fixed Exchange Rate: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Monday said that the government will not apply a fixed
exchange rate to check the fluctuation of the rupiah against the U.
S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no plan at all to do so," the president
said, adding that this would violate its agreement with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin emphasized
that there will be no changes in the currency exchange system. He
said it would be futile to change the system.
</P>
<P>
Wahid and Sabirin made the statements in response to the
growing rumor that the government would change the currency
exchange system following the rupiah's plunged against the U.S.
dollar. The rupiah recorded its lowest level against the U.S.
dollar on Monday since Wahid's election in October last year. On
Monday, the rupiah nose-dived to the 8,700 level or a seven-month
low.
</P>
<P>
Rumors saying that the government would change the current free
floating exchange rate system to a fixed rate one had been growing
stronger following Wahid's comment that the government would take
action to boost the rupiah's value.
</P>
<P>
The president attributed the recent weakening of the rupiah to
massive U.S. dollar buying due to anxieties over the present
social situation.
</P>
<P>
Many people are worried that the riots that occurred on May 13-
14 two years ago would recur, the president was quoted by the
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, unrest broke out in the West Jakarta commercial
district. At least four shops in the Harco Glodok electronic goods
shopping center, several other stores and two car showrooms on
nearby streets were vandalized. Three police personnel were
injured and 11 people were arrested on suspicion of instigating
the riot. The Jakarta Post said the unrest brought back painful
memories of the looting and arson in Jakarta in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the government will take positive
measures to anticipate any riot in an effort to stabilize the
exchange rate of the rupiah.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus in
fiscal 1999 fell 16.8 percent from a year earlier to 12,620.8
billion yen (about 113.1 billion U.S. dollars),posting the first
decline in three years, the Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official attributed the shrinkage in the current
account surplus to increased imports stemming from Japan's
brightening economic outlook, a stronger yen and rising crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year which ended March 31, trade in goods and
services amounted to a surplus of 7,848.5 billion yen (about 70.4

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Symposium on Biology-Inspired Theoretical Physics Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Cross-Straits Symposium
on Biology-Inspired Theoretical Physics, which drew 16 scholars
from Taiwan Province and over 40 scholars from the Chinese
mainland, opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the Institute of Theoretical
Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the China
Center of Advanced Science and Technology (CCAST), will touch on
issues concerning protein folding, genome and biological
information science.
</P>
<P>
Also at the five-day meeting are three young U.S.-based Chinese
scientists who will speak on the newest developments in life
science.
</P>
<P>
The first such symposium was held in Taiwan in 1998, and it led
to other kinds of cross-straits exchanges in life science and
theoretical physics.
</P>
<P>
Trans-subject research is a general trend in the 21st Century,
said Hao Bolin, a research professor at the Institute of
Theoretical Sciences, who had the idea for the first symposium
along with some Taiwan scholars.
</P>
<P>
He said that this sort of exchange will help improve Chinese
scientists' research in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Hoong-Chien Lee, a professor of physics and life science from
Taiwan, said that swapping information has broadened his
understanding of the subject.
</P>
<P>
He said that cross-straits exchange in science and technology
should be expanded even further.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior officials of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) are to hold top-level talks with U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan at U.N. headquarters in New York Monday over
plans to deploy the international peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon after the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The meeting coincides with the expected presentation to Annan on
Tuesday of a report by special U.N. Mideast envoy Terje Larsen on
his findings from the series of consultations he held recently with
regional leaders, particularly in Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the U.N. Security Council is likely to
convene as early as the beginning of next week to hear from Larsen
and UNIFIL's top brass and decide on Annan's recommendations over
the future role of the international peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon after Israeli withdrawal this July.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will ask U.S. President
Bill Clinton during their meeting in Washington next week to give
the negotiation process with the Palestinians some more time before
presenting American mediation proposals.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders are expected to focus on ways
of making progress on the Palestinian track. Barak is concerned
that a hasty U.S. mediation proposal could place Israel in an
uncomfortable position.
</P>
<P>
Barak's concern over American intervention at this stage is
based on his realization that the basic positions of the U.S. are
close to those of the Palestinians on the issues of borders,
Jerusalem and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is convening his cabinet
Monday morning to approve the handover of three Jerusalem village
suburbs to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Mohammed Def, the top Hamas military strategist
by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) counter-terrorist services
Sunday, may have been the breakthrough Barak needed to call the
special meeting Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security services sources Sunday night praised PNA
security services for capturing Def, believed responsible for
bombings, kidnappings, and terror attacks against Israelis going
back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security forces had been increased in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip in preparation for expected clashes with the
Palestinians Monday, as the Palestinians plan protests demanding
the release of security prisoners and marking Nakba (Catastrophe)
Day, their term for the 52nd anniversary of Israel's declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive day Sunday, Palestinians clashed with
Israeli security forces in the West Bank and Gaza. One Israeli
officer and a border policeman suffered light wounds from stones
and Palestinians claimed 20 protesters were injured. Late Sunday
night Palestinian officials said one demonstrator had died of his
injuries.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Not Always Best: N. Zealand Nutrition Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the research result released by The New Zealand
Nutrition Foundation here Monday, frozen peas contain far higher
levels of vitamin C, after three months, than fresh peas after
three days.
</P>
<P>
Foundation spokesperson Cliff Tasman-Jones said frozen
vegetables are nutritionally as good as, if not better than most
fresh, most store-bought fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
"The research shows consumers how valuable frozen vegetables
are to a healthy diet. One of our goals is to increase people's
vegetable consumption," Prof. Tasman-Jones said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as vegetables are harvested their vitamin C content
begins to decline but the freezing process significantly slows
ongoing vitamin C loss. Busy lives mean we may only purchase fresh
vegetables once a week, for example, so it is not always the case
that fresh vegetable are the healthiest option. Freezing within
hours of harvesting means nutrients are locked into frozen
vegetables," Prof. Tasman-Jones said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the main reasons consumers gave for not eating enough
vegetables were lack of ready availability in the home.
</P>
<P>
Including frozen vegetables in the diet offers consumers an
easy way to increase their daily vegetable intake, Prof. Tasman-
Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Resume Negotiations With Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roberto Aventajado, who was designated by the president to help
in the negotiations for the release of the hostages, said Estrada
has instructed him to return to Sulu Tuesday and resume
negotiations as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, chairman of the Presidential Committee on Flagship
Programs, said the president also told him that he was on the
right track when he reported to him his actions on the matter
during a meeting in the Presidential Palace Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said in radio interview that he hopes Abu Sayyaf
extremists to get its act together in presenting its demands for
the release of 21 hostages it continues to hold hostages in Jolo
island of Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
According to Aventajado, emissaries of the hostage takers
relayed to their government counterparts their proposal for the
framework of negotiations last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Abu Sayyaf rebels have set several
conditions for the resumption of the negotiations, including the
complete withdrawal of military forces from the area on Jolo
island.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado noted that the government has insisted on a single
set of written demands, following reports of different demands
from up to six self-proclaimed leaders of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government will deal with only one written
set of demands and one set of rules in the negotiation to secure
the safe release of the hostages who were kidnapped on April 23
from a resort in Malaysia and later taken to Jolo by their
abductors.
</P>
<P>
"We want them to make collective decisions. Otherwise, how can
we hold negotiations at all?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Libya ambassador Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, in a private
capacity, has joined government negotiators Ghadzali Ibrahim and
Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
to help secure the hostages' release.

The president said he will not attend the burial as the

for Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, it would be unusual for a head of state to attend such
an unofficial ceremony," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the government will appoint one minister to attend
the burial of Obuchi.
</P>

"So far, we have not decided who will be assigned by the
government. Foreign Affairs Minister Alwi Shihab or Home Affairs
Minister Suryadi Sudirja might attend it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi died in hospital Sunday after suffering a stroke six
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also expressed his respect to the Japanese government,
which has been granting Indonesia large loans and has facilitated

MOSCOW, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Three crewmembers and 12 Interior
Ministry soldiers were injured Sunday when their Mi-8 helicopter
crashed in southwest Russia due to engine failure, the Interfax

<P>
The helicopter, which was bound for Grozny, capital of the
breakaway Chechen republic, went down in Nalchik, a city southwest
of Rostov.

Power lines were damaged in the crash, which triggered the
launch of two air-to-surface missiles that struck a five-story
building. A woman was injured but the building only sustained
slight damage, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Mi-8 crash Sunday. The other one happened
in the southern mountains of Chechnya. The captain was gravely
wounded while the 16 passengers suffered injuries of various
degrees.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects Higher Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Demand for Malaysia's exports
by Asian economies is expected to increase following the recovery
of the region's economies this year, according to an official
report issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The various measures taken by Malaysia, including selective
exchange control, have led to a more conducive business
environment and enabled higher utilization of production
capacities for exports,said the Malaysia International Trade and
Industry Report 1999 issued by the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade grew by 10.8 percent last year to 570 billion
ringgit (197.37 billion U.S. dollars) from 514.7 billion ringgit (
135.45 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, exports went up by 12.1 percent to 321.2 billion
ringgit (84.53 billion dollars) and imports 9.1 percent to 248.9
billion ringgit (65.5 billion dollars), resulting in a trade
surplus of 72.3 billion ringgit (19.03 billion dollars),an
increase of 23.8 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the increase in exports mainly to
sustained demand in the major export markets of the United States,
Singapore,Japan and Chinese Taipei, particularly for electrical
and electronics products including electrical machinery.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Singapore and the European Union (EU)
continued to be Malaysia's major trading partners in 1999,
collectively accounting for 65.8 percent of Malaysia's exports and
63.8 percent of imports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia earned the most from exports of electrical and
electronic products in 1999 which grew by 21.9 percent to 185.3
billion ringgit (48.76 billion dollars) and other major export
earners included palm oil, chemicals and chemical products, crude
petroleum and refined petroleum, wood products, machinery and
equipment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Foster SMIs Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
pledged to provide a cost-competitive business environment through
fine-tuning its policies and strategies to continue supporting and
fostering the growth of the small and medium-sized industries (
SMIs).
</P>
<P>
Internal adjustments and technological advancements made
possible through the widespread application of information,
communication and technology (ICT) would facilitate SMIs in moving
toward higher value-added products and services, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said in its Malaysia
International Trade and Industry Report 1999 issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The overall objective of the government SMI Development Plan
2000-2005 would be to create a conducive policy environment for
the establishment of new SMIs and the transformation of existing
ones into medium- and large-sized corporations, it said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is also aimed at achieving greater contribution from
SMIs toward a more balanced development of the Malaysian economy
and at developing knowledge-based SMIs to enhance their capacity
in doing business with the application of ICT and increasing the
output and value-added content of Malaysian industries.
</P>
<P>
SMIs, constituting more than 90 percent of the total
manufacturing establishments in the country, are expected to
strive continuously toward building and strengthening their
competitiveness to survive in the highly competitive business
environment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs contributed 18.9 percent to the total manufacturing
output, 20.9 percent to the value added and 29.7 percent to
employment in the manufacturing sector in 1999.

BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- While an expected increase in U.S.
interest rates could spur greater capital outflows, the central
bank of Thailand said its overall impact on the economy and market
stability is expected to be relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol Sonakul, Thai central bank governor, was quoted by
Monday's Bangkok Post as saying foreign outflows since last year
have averaged about 1 billion U.S. dollars per month, but with
little impact upon the stability of the baht or local interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Recent deficits in the balance of payments largely reflected
repayments of foreign debt by the private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign debt overall now stands at about 70 billion dollars,"
Chatumongol said. "Short-term debt and trade debt now stands at
around 11 billion-12 billion dollars, an appropriate level given
our export volume and reserve position."
</P>
<P>
Thai foreign reserves now amount to 32 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to
raise interest rates Tuesday by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts had expressed concern that the broadening gap
between U.S. and Thai interest rates would put pressure on the
baht in the future, potentially positive for exporters and the
economy as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone rebels release 139 U.N. peacekeepers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 139 of the 500 United
Nations personnel held hostage by rebels in Sierra Leone were
released into Liberian custody, according to an Associated Press
report.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the 139 freed captives flown by a government-
chartered helicopter to Monrovia, Liberia's capital on Sunday
evening and the remaining 124 were waiting to be evacuated from
the Liberian border town of Foya, some 200 kilometers to the north,
the AP reported in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor, who had been asked by
regional leaders to mediate with Sierra Leone's Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) as one of its closest ally, was quoted as
describing the release as a "successful mediation effort" by a
team of Liberian officials.
</P>
<P>
The released peacekeepers had trekked for nearly three days
through heavily forested eastern Sierra Leone to Liberia after
their trucks got stuck on bad roads, said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Up to 500 U.N. peacekeepers and military observers have been
taken hostage by the RUF rebels since May 2.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian president added that he will go on with the
mediation to get the remaining U.N. hostages released but he
warned that continued attacks by Sierra Leone's pro-government
forces against the rebel RUF might threaten the lives of the
captives.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, pro-government fighters have taken a strategic
town from rebels on the main road 65 kilometers northeast of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
In their decade-long bid for power, the RUF rebels have killed
tens of thousands of people in Sierra Leone. Rebel leader Foday
Sankoh was still out of sight since he disappeared last Monday
following a demonstration and shoot-out at his residence in the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks See Bright Future in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sanwa Bank Limited Shanghai
Branch, based in Pudong, has grown into one of the most successful
foreign banks in the municipality.
</P>
<P>
Toru Mitarai, general manager of the branch, attributed the
bank's success to the attractive investment environment in
Shanghai and also China's opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four foreign banks in Shanghai have already got the
permission to open the Renminbi business in China.
</P>
<P>
Mitarai disclosed that Sanwa now serves 600 clients in China,
provides some 900 million U.S. dollars of loans, and has drawn
deposits of 230 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vast vacant area and positive signs of growth in the Pudong New
Area in east Shanghai are expected to attract more overseas
enterprises, and the area will surely grow into another financial
center in the world, just like London, New York, and Singapore, if
it can develop sustainably, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai has 53 foreign financial institutions, 80
percent of which are located in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
In terms of employees, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited (HSBC) Shanghai Branch has been the largest
foreign financial institution in China.
</P>
<P>
Daniel S. Lam, HSBC Shanghai Branch manager, told Xinhua that
his bank now has 240 employees, compared with 110 at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
To expand business, the HSBC has decided to move its China
headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the World Trade Organization is certain to
lure more foreign enterprises to China, which means foreign banks
will have more potential clients, a manager with Citibank Shanghai
Branch said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the assets of foreign financial
institutions in Shanghai totaled 15.474 billion U.S. dollars,
drawing 2.431 billion U.S. dollars of deposits and granting 10.756
billion U.S. dollars of loans.

<HEADLINE> Violence Rocks Indonesia's Aceh Despite Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Although representatives of the
Indonesian government and Free Aceh Movement (GAM) signed an
agreement on a humanitarian pause in hostilities in Switzerland on
May 12, clashes erupted again between security forces and the
separatist group in Aceh Province.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Monday, the office of the
Pantau Labu police post near Lhokseumawe, North Aceh, was attacked
by unidentified men on Sunday. No casualties were reported in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident on Saturday, two security personnel and
five locals were wounded in an armed contact in Tanah Jambo Aye
District, east of Lhokseumawe.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted North Aceh Police chief Lt. Col. Syafei
Aksal as saying a Rajawali military unit was intercepted by rebels
at Gedeumbak Village around Sereuke settlement in Tanah Jambo Aye
District Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"They exchanged fire for 15 minutes," he said, adding that
there were no victims during the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, after they managed to flee from the incident and
walked for about 300 meters, the security officers were again
attacked by the GAM, injuring military men and local people.
</P>
<P>
The latest bout of tension came on the heels of the historic
signing of a peace accord in Switzerland Friday and many hope that
the accord may pave the way for peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
The three-month accord is not due to come into force until June
2. The newspaper the Indonesian Observer said the renewed violence
raised fears that the accord could be derailed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Troops Kill 250 Rebels in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Amidst fierce fighting in the
northern Jaffna peninsula, Sri Lankan government troops claimed
they had killed more than 250 Tamil Tiger rebels and wounded a
similar number since last Wednesday, the English daily The Island
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The security forces put up a gallant fight while preventing
the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) from developing a
front at Ariyalai," military spokesman Brigadier Palitha Fernando
told the paper.
</P>
<P>
He said troops also destroyed rebel targets in Tanankilappu and
Pooneryn areas near the strategic town of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting a 17-year war for a separate state
for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, recently
launched a fierce attack on the government forces in a bid to
recapture their former stronghold in the Jaffna peninsula which
they lost in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fernando said the rebels were desperate and were calling for
reinforcements from the east following the heavy losses they had
suffered during the past week.
</P>
<P>
He added that the LTTE, in an effort to bolster its forces, had
conscripted nearly 150 students last week despite protests from
their parents.
</P>
<P>
Being in a stronger position than they were a few months back,
the LTTE rebels had called for a cease-fire and resumption of
peace talks which the government flatly rejected.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Merchants Trace Cultural Roots in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- "These are examples of Yangshao
Culture and bone inscriptions from the Shang Dynasty. They were
only historical names to me before I came here," said many Taiwan
businesspeople during their recent visit to cultural relics and
museums in central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
They were surprised at tens of thousands of cultural relics on
display at the Henan Museum, the largest museum in central China.
</P>
<P>
"I have been to museums in the U.S, but they have left me no
deep impression. However, when I come here, I recalled memories of
my childhood," said Wang Yide, chief representative of the Taiwan
Delta Electronics Group to Beijing, who has lived in the US for
more than twenty years.
</P>
<P>
"It is so great that all of these are made by us Chinese," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The mission visited a couple of famous historic sites including
Luoyang and Kaifeng, capitals of ancient dynasties, and Shaolin
Temple, known as the birthplace of Chinese Kung Fu.
</P>
<P>
"I will bring my children here in the future to let them learn
more about Chinese people's lives and what the ancient Chinese
culture is like," said Cai Wenrong, acting manager of Taiwan Yulon
Motor Co. Ltd., before the statue of Bao Zhen, an outstanding
upright official in Chinese history, whose stories are widely
known in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang Renquan, a chief official with a Taiwan food business
company, found comparisons between soup-like dishes in Luoyang
city and similar dishes back home. "It is most likely that the
dishes in Taiwan come from Luoyang," said Wang, a veteran
specialist in food processing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanwen, Chairman of Taiwan-invested Enterprises
Association in Dongguan, south China's Guangdong province, said
that Taiwan businesspeople come to the mainland to make money.
Many have, however, neglected their cultural heritage in the
process. He expressed his wish to write an article introducing
this trip and encourage more Taiwanese to come to the mainland and
trace their roots.
</P>
<P>
During this trip, the merchants also met Wang Guangya, a famous
educationist from Taiwan. Wang has spent over 200 million yuan (
24 million US dollars) in setting up a college in Zhengzhou and
the college now enrolls more than 6,000 students.
</P>
<P>
"You do business and I run colleges, but both of us are working
for our motherland," said Wang Guangya.

<HEADLINE> China to Halt Production of Five Deadly Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China is phasing out the production
of five poisonous pesticides, vice Agriculture Minister Liu Jian
said.
</P>
<P>
The first step, which will be taken this year, will be
prohibiting additional companies from producing the pesticides,
and the Ministry of Agriculture will no longer grant certificates
of registration for new producers, Liu was quoted by Monday's
China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will also adopt measures to reduce and
eventually ban the production of the pesticides by existing
producers.
</P>
<P>
The five pesticides contain organophosphor, which is highly
toxic and will harm people's health if not washed off from food.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the ministry will encourage the research and
production of agricultural chemicals that do not pose any danger,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's second largest producer of agricultural
chemicals, with production of 422,000 tons last year. Pesticides
account for 75 percent of the country's current agricultural
chemicals production.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pledged to closely monitor the market access so
that health-threatening chemicals do not enter into production.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed Up Seed Authentication: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will
introduce experiments in 15 provinces to speed up seed
authentication work, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held on Saturday in Yantai of Shandong Province,
Chen Mengshan, an official with the Department for Popularizing
Agricultural Technology of the Ministry of Agriculture, said that
China must look for ways to trace the background of agriculture
seeds or be left out of this important market when it enters the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
China does not have a strict seed authentication, or
identification system and most seeds produced in the country lack
labels, serial numbers and test reports for identification.
</P>
<P>
"If seeds can not be traced back, we certainly can not exchange
seeds internationally," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"What's more, seed quality will be improved through
authentication so that farmers' interests are protected, which is
our ultimate goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Seed authentication has been practiced for more than 100 years,
with 45 countries using the system. In European countries seeds
can not be traded without authentication.
</P>
<P>
China began in 1996 to pilot seed authentication which now
covers 11 provinces.
</P>
<P>
To achieve better control over seed records, the government
will introduce experiments in 15 provinces and a special
organization will be set up this year to speed up the work.
</P>
<P>
"In order to pull up to the world formula, we are going to try
to standardize every step of authentication within a few years,"
Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Heart Bypass, Cardiac Valve Replacement Surgery On-line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Web surfers can watch the entire
heart bypass surgery operation and the cardiac valve replacement
surgery simultaneously performed at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital,
which is famous for its cardiovascular surgeries as of 9:00 (
Beijing time) this morning.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first live on-line telecast of two
simultaneous heart surgery operations in one Chinese hospital.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a heart bypass surgery performed by Beijing Fuwai
Hospital, China's top cardiovascular surgery hospital, was online
and quite a number of surfers watched the surgery procedure.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from Beijing Anzhen Hospital and medical college of the
Harvard University are performing the two surgeries.
</P>
<P>
By accessing the health channel of the wed station of the
People's Daily, Internet users can learn more details about the
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts will explain the two operations during the telecast.
</P>
<P>
A doctor from Beijing Fuwai Hospital said the coronary heart
disease has become the number one killer in the world, and it is
especially a threat to older people. However, prevention and early
treatment of the disease can help save lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that many people do not know much about cardiac surgery,
and are afraid of undergoing the operation because they believe it
is risky and very expensive.
</P>
<P>
He added that some patients miss the crucial time to undergo
cardiac surgery, sometimes with fatal consequences.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said coronary artery bypassing surgery is now a
routine procedure at his hospital, and the success rate has
reached 99 percent.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Incurs More Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's foreign debts have been
increasing drastically over the last few years, reaching 9.76
billion U.S. dollars in total at the end of 1999, the People's
Bank of Croatia, the country's central bank, announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debts went up by 1.79 percent, or 175 million U.S.
dollars, in 1999 over 1998, said the bank. Statistics provided by
the bank show that the 1996-98 period witnessed a sharp rise in
foreign debts, from 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 5.2
billion U.S. dollars in 1996, to 7.45 billion U.S. dollars in 1997
and to 9.588 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign debts have been borrowed by the state,
enterprises, banks and other financial organizations, said the
bank. In 1999, Croatia's GDP was about 20 billion U.S. dollars.
The sharp increase of foreign debts has now become a major
hindrance to the national economic development.

MADRID, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Deportivo Coruna squandered the
chance of grabbing the first Spanish first division league title
in their 94-year history after being held to a goalless draw at
Racing Santander on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But they still stayed three points clear of nearest challengers
Barcelona at the top of the standings with just one match to come.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona failed to take advantage of the Galicians' draw and
were themselves held 0-0 at Real Sociedad.
</P>
<P>
Deportivo lead the table with 66 points from 37 games, with
Barcelona second on 63.
</P>
<P>
Real Zaragoza moved level on points with Barcelona by beating
Malaga 3-2, coming from behind with two goals in the last four
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona retained second place because of a better record in
head-to-head encounters with Zaragoza.
</P>
<P>
Deportivo need at least a point next weekend at home to
Espanyol to be sure of the title because their matches with
Barcelona were evenly split.
</P>
<P>
Real Betis were relegated after losing 2-0 at home to Real
Madrid. The other two who have already been condemned to
relegation before weekend are Sevilla and Atletico Madrid.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
will turn the northern slope of Tianshan Mountain into the largest
quality cotton, wine, animal husbandry and red-color farm producer
in China.
</P>
<P>
According to an economic blueprint unveiled here recently, the
region will take effective measures to accelerate development of
the economic belt on the northern Tianshan slope, which starts
from Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, and goes through Jichang,
Shihezi, Shawan cities and ends at Usu.
</P>
<P>
Serving as an important part of the New Eurasia Continental
Bridge, the economic belt has built a number of state or regional
level economic and technological development zones and open cities.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show, the gross domestic product of the
economic belt at the northern slope of Tianshan Mountain makes up
42 percent of the region's total. Its industrial output value
accounts for 65 percent of Xinjiang's total.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has drawn up a series of regulations to
seek technical personnel and investment from abroad and other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken to build key enterprises, promote the
industrialization of agriculture, develop petro-chemical products
and accelerate service trade such as tourism, banking and
insurance.

XI'AN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Zhu Jintao in landlocked Zhen'
an County in Shaanxi Province, northwest China, sold out all his 6,
000 kg of stockpiled soybeans thanks to information he got from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The county now has 40 farmers like Zhu who are Internet users.
</P>
<P>
Information is playing an increasingly important role in
promoting the social and economic development of Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
A State Information Office Survey showed that Shaanxi ranks
first in the development of the information industry compared with
20 other provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in
central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is home to more than 1,000 scientific research
institutes and 40 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the information industry's added value to the province
exceeded 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion U.S. dollars), accounting
for 20 percent of Shaanxi's GDP. The information industry employs
100,000 people, with 800 websites and 170,400 internet users.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to further develop its
information industry which is expected to become a new economic
growth point for Shaanxi.

<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pascal Lamy, trade commissioner of
the European Commission, arrived here this morning for a new round
of talks with China concerning China's accession into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) on April 26, China and the
EU have agreed that at the invitation of MOFTEC Minister Shi
Guangsheng, Trade Commissioner of the European Commission Pascal
Lamy would arrive in Beijing in the week beginning May 15 for a
new round of talks concerning China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU held three rounds of talks earlier this year,
one in Brussels and two in Beijing. China described the talks as "
positive" and "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
On January 26, the EU and China ended a two-and-a-half-day
negotiating session in Brussels on China's WTO accession. Both
sides said in a joint statement that the negotiations were held in
"positive and constructive atmosphere" and substantive progress
was made through joint efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>
A month later between February 21-24, the Chinese team, led by
Chief Negotiator Long Yongtu, and the EU team, led by Hans-
Friedrich Beseler, EU Executive Commission's Director-General for
Trade, held the second round of talks in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China and the EU had "come very close" after the two rounds of
talks respectively in Brussels and Beijing, Long said.
</P>
<P>
The last round of talks between Shi Guangsheng and Pascal Lamy
held in Beijing at the end of March, were valued by the Chinese
side as "positive" and "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji On May 8 urged an early conclusion
of Sino-EU agreement on China's entry into the WTO, during his
talks with visiting Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Clinches Serie A Championship Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Lazio clinched their second Serie A
title in club's history after thrashing Reggina 3-0 here on Sunday
while arch rivals Juventus were upset 1-0 by Perugia.
</P>
<P>
The result left Lazio with 72 points, just two ahead of
Juventus, while Milan claimed third place with 61 points.
</P>
<P>
Lazio's only other championship win was back in 1974, while
Sunday's victory followed an amazing, totally unpredictable day of
play, which saw the Juventus-Perugia match suspended for more than
an hour because of torrential rain and the Lazio-Reggina game was
also briefly halted due to a pitch invasion by over-enthusiastic
fans.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, who entered Sunday's last round match one point behind
Juventus, scored winning goals through Simone Inzaghi and Juan
Veron in the first half and Diego Simeone in the second half.
Perugia's championship-deciding goal was scored by Alessandro
Calori, minutes after play resumed.
</P>
<P>
Even more satisfying for Lazio supporters was the fact it was
Juventus that last week benefitted from a dubious refereeing
decision which could have allowed the Rome-based club to walk away
with the title Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the Parma-Juventus match last Sunday, a goal by Parma,
which most observers have deemed perfectly legitimate, was
disallowed by the referee, enabling Juventus to close the game 1-0
and chalk up another three points.
</P>
<P>
If Parma's goal had been allowed, Juventus and Lazio would have
gone into the last day of play with equal points.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, hundreds of Lazio fans staged a protest in central
Rome against Parma-Juventus match decision which turned violent
and ended in clashes with police.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the Czech
Republic beat Slovakia 5-3 to retain their gold medal Sunday at
the 64th Ice Hockey World Championships at St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia took the silver, the first medal since the team's
debut in the worlds in 1996. The period scores were 3-0, 0-1, and
2-2.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs scored three goals in the first period but none in
the second. The Slovakians, bouyed by enthuastic fans, managed
three goals in the second and third periods, catching up to 3-4
against the rival team.
</P>
<P>
Just a little over one minute before the end, Robert Reichel of
the Czech Republic shattered the Slovakians' prospect of a tie and
sealed the defending champions' fresh victory with an equal
strength goal.
</P>
<P>
Before its peaceful breakup, Czechoslavkia had been one of the
world's ice hockey powerhouses, winning six golds, 12 silvers and
16 bronzes from 1920 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Czechs have won two golds (1996, 1999) and two bronzes (
1997, 1998) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's silver represented the first medal for Slovakia since
its debut in the world championships in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In another finals match Sunday afternoon, 1998-1999 silver
medalists Finland edged Canada 2-1 to take the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Finns' hope to advance to the first place was shattered
Friday in the aftermath of a 3-1 defeat by Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Adrian Aucion scored the team's only goal seven
minutes into the first period. The Finns, on the other hand,
netted one goal each in the second and third periods. All three
were equal strength goals.
</P>
<P>
The current championships, which started on April 29, featured
16 teams mostly from Europe and North America. Japan, the only
Asian team, suffered six straight losses in the preliminary and
consolatory rounds.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges Arafat to Prevent Further Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday, urging him to
take actions to prevent further military clashes between
palestinians and Israeli troops in the territories.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone conversation with Arafat, Barak said Israel
will only hand over the three towns near Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control after the Palestinian side has clarified
Monday's events.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the flareup of violence in the Palestinian
territories where the day of Nakba, or catastrophe, was marked on
Monday on the birth of Israel 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Palestinians were forced to leave their
homeland as a result of the creation of the Jewish state, which
heralded the beginning of a half-century turbulence in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
As the peace process remained stalled, the Israeli Knesset, or
parliament, approved on Monday to transfer the three controversial
towns on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the full Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
But Barak decided to delay the transfer and asked Arafat to take
measures to prevent further casualties. Clashes between
Palestinians and Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
have left five Palestinians dead and over 800 others wounded. Nine
Israeli troops were also injured in Monday's violence.
</P>
<P>
"Barak called the Chairman of the Palestinian (National)
Authority Yasser Arafat and told him he regards the events that
occurred today as serious," Barak's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"He added that such events must not be repeated and that the two
sides should examine what happened as soon as as possible and draw
conclusions from it," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Barak demanded that the Palestinian (National) Authority
should take all the necessary measures to ensure there were no
further casualties," it pointed out.

<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference in Washington with
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Ross would arrive in Israel Monday and
meet both sides.
</P>
<P>
Over the last week the Palestinians have staged protests in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip in solidarity with the hunger
strikers who demanded improvement of the living conditions inside
Israeli jails and for early release. The demonstrators clashed
with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,600 Palestinian detainees still held in the
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that violence is going to solve anything. We
think it's very important that the leaders themselves try to do
everything they can to control any violence," said Albright.
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that there be the right climate so peace
efforts will be able to go on. We've learned over and over again
that violence is not the way to resolve this, nor does it help in
moving the peace process forward," she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States was confident that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat were serious about
peace despite the violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The parties themselves are committed to a serious effort at
the negotiating table.... Prime Minister Barak has made clear that
there is a historic opportunity now and it's clear that he's
prepared to make the tough decisions," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
"Yasser Arafat has obviously faced some difficulties but it's
our view that he is also prepared to pursue peace and take the
historic decisions necessary," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Teachers Declare Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Educators Union (NEU) convoked a week ago this
strike, which was heeded by 142,000 teachers and will affect
almost three million students from primary and secondary public
schools.
</P>
<P>
To this strike were added public employees of affiliates of
Peasant Social Service, petroleum employees and those from the
health sector.
</P>
<P>
These teachers are demanding their basic salary be increased to
100 U.S. dollars and are protesting against supposed plans to
privatize education in conformity with a government commitment
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between NEU heads and the Education Ministry fell
through in the midst of full election campaigns for mayors,
prefects, municipal counselors and members of parish committees.
</P>
<P>
NEU leaders said teachers grew tired of the dialog with
authorities in face of the lack of a solution to their strict
salary claims.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Roberto Hanze demanded an end to the strike
and expressed the government's intention of a salary increase in
June, when prices of fuels and gas will go up.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Representative, Governor Urges Approval of PNTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci
Monday urged Congress to approve permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, speaking at the foreign press center here, said the
vote that Congress will take next week is not about whether China
will enter the World Trade Organization or continue to export to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The only issue before the Congress is whether the United States
will accept the benefit of China's accession and the country's
market opening, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that if the U.S. does not provide PNTR status to China,
the U.S. will have no legal right in the WTO to the benefits of
the trade agreement signed between the U.S. and China in November
last year.
</P>
<P>
"That would be, obviously, an economically irrational outcome,"
she said. "It would be damaging in the extreme."
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky said granting PNTR status to China will not only
promote economic reforms in China but also be in the strategic and
security interests of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
She said the U.S. is obliged to look for areas of common ground
though the two countries have differences in human rights and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci cautioned the U.
S. Congress against embracing isolationism and urged the expansion
of global free trade through adoption of PNTR with China.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that if Congress seizes this opportunity,
America stands to gain enormous benefits from open markets that
have enormous potential," Cellucci said in an address to the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
</P>
<P>
Cellucci led a 12-day trade mission to China in March with 20
Massachusetts companies to explore business opportunities for the
Bay State firms dealing mostly in high-tech, telecommunications
and engineering services.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and
the Wine Institute of the country formed the Agriculture-High
Technology Alliance to push bipartisan passage by Congress of
legislation that would grant PNTR status to China.
</P>
<P>
Representing nine broad-based industry associations, co-chairs
George Scalise, president of the SIA in San Jose, and John De Luca,
president and CEO of the San Francisco-based Wine Institute,
announced the formation of the Alliance at a press conference here.

<HEADLINE> Tons of Smuggled Cigarettes Caught in Italy's Venice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 tons of contraband
cigarettes were stopped at Italy's Venetian borders by Finance
Police over the past year, leading authorities to believe that the
city of gondoliers and canals is a major international smuggling
hub.
</P>
<P>
Over this weekend alone, police sequestered some 12 tons of
cigarettes, and recent arrests have led law enforcement
authorities to suspect there is only one main organization behind
the massive cigarette smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers are allegedly paid 5 to 6 million lire (about 2,
400 to 2,900 U.S. dollars) per shipment, and the cigarettes are
disguised under oranges and tomatoes or else inside of boxes used
for transporting bottled water, among other ruses.
</P>
<P>
The operation uses smugglers from various nationalities: the
four most recent arrested suspects were from Byelorussia, Greece,
Poland and Germany, who had reached Venice by first flying from
Germany to Greece, and then crossing the Adriatic via a Greek port.
</P>
<P>
At the time of arrest, the four smugglers were carrying
identity cards from either non-existent or non-related businesses,
as well as a detailed plan of an upcoming smuggling attempt.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest, they were immediately tried and received
suspended sentences.

<HEADLINE> IRA Arms Mission Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Political leaders in Northern
Ireland had their first meeting Monday with two international
statesman appointed to inspect the Irish Republican Army weapons
dumps.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary-General of South Africa's African National
Congress, Cyril Ramaphosa, and former president of Finland, Martti
Ahtisarri, have been given the job of checking that the IRA is
honoring its offer to put its arms "beyond use".
</P>
<P>
They pledged to regularly re-inspect the dumps to ensure the
weapons remained secure.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement after their arrival in Belfast, they spoke
of the "profound importance" of the task before them and called
for "patience" from those expecting a rapid decommissioning of
terrorist weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said the inspections would
be a confidence building measure but that there were still
questions that needed answering.
</P>
<P>
"If all that society is being offered is the inspection of arms
dumps, it will not be regarded as a satisfactory resolution of the
issue," he said after talks with Ramaphosa and Antisarri.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any clear indication of a timetable on putting
arms beyond use, and indeed, when it's likely to be done
completely and finally," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Ramaphosa and Ahtisaari had an hour of talks
in London with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson also announced plans for a government-funded
foundation for the development of police officers in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists have made retaining the name of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, which the government intends to change to the
Police Service of Northern Ireland, a pre-condition to re-entering
the suspended power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party's 860-member ruling council is due to
meet on Saturday to consider a return to power-sharing government
with republicans.
</P>
<P>
The unionist meeting will take place just two days before the
British and Irish Governments' target date for a restoration of
the Northern Irish assembly.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Young Unemployment Falls to 32.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment among young adults in
Italy may have fallen 2.2 percent to 32.3 percent during 1999, but
getting a job takes an average of about four years, according to
figures released here Monday by the national statistics institute,
Istat.
</P>
<P>
The study pointed out that the higher the degree of education,
the shorter the waiting period, since those completing only
obligatory schooling wait an average of eight years before getting
their first job, while a high school diploma cuts the time down to
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Those with a university degree in their hands wait a mere two
years before entering the workforce.
</P>
<P>
But having to wait so long for a job is not all that bad, says
Istat's director, Leo Tronti, who stressed that the unemployment
doldrums can be a formative period "useful" for the eventual debut
into the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Young adults waiting around in the employment antechamber spend
their time traveling the world, taking up short-term work offers,
exploring the work world and observing the happenings around them.
</P>
<P>
Another study, released today by government think-tank Cnel,
says that gender and geography play a major roll in the
unemployment rates among young adults: the employment waiting room
registers a 7.6 percent rate for males living in the economically
advantaged northeastern Italy, while 64.2 percent of young females
in the south are without work.
</P>
<P>
The Cnel study also mentioned that the information available
for young Italians on the job market is "unclear and fragmented"
in respect to other European countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Its Troops Not to Be Dragged Into War in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary insisted
again Monday that its troops will not be dragged into the civil
war in Britain's former west African colony of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Geoff Hoon said the work of British forces in the troubled
country had been an "outstanding success" but they would not take
on a combat role.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of the UK taking over the United Nations
mission or of being drawn into the civil war. This remains the
clear and unambiguous position on the deployment of British troops,
" he told the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
He said the presence of British forces in the area had helped
to stabilize the "volatile" situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure the House that UK forces will stay no longer than
is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
His statement was an attempt to end concerns surrounding the
United Kingdom's involvement in Sierra Leone amid fears of British
troops sliding into combat through "mission creep."
</P>
<P>
The comment came as rebels in Sierra Leone released some of the
500 U.N. peacekeepers they had been holding hostage.
</P>
<P>
About 140 were freed at the border with neighboring Liberia and
were all reported to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
It was the capture of the U.N. personnel two weeks ago that
triggered a series of violent incidents resulting in the
unraveling of the fragile peace deal signed between the rebels and
the government last July.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 well-equipped British paratroopers are now helping U.N.
peacekeepers to guard strategic positions in Freetown, the capital
city of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A six-ship British fleet with 800 Royal Marines, jets and
attack helicopters was anchored off the port city.

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks Liberian President to Press for Release All Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday acknowledged "the important role" by Liberian
President Charles Taylor in the release of some of the U.N.
soldiers in Sierra Leone, and asked Taylor to secure the release
all the other detainees, who number some 350, in the West African
nation.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued by the spokesman of Annan, said, "The
Secretary-General would like to acknowledge the important role
played by President Charles Taylor of Liberia in the release of
detained United Nations peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. One hundred
and thirty-nine peacekeepers are in Liberia today and will soon be
brought back into the mission area in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"He is gratified by the progress made thus far and will
encourage President Taylor to press on until the roughly 250
remaining detainees held by the Revolutionary Front (RUF) are
freed and their weapons and equipment recovered," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said Monday that the rebel RUF had freed
139 of its peacekeepers and sent them to Liberia, the first real
sign of a breakthrough in a crisis that had threatened to
overwhelm the U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
However, a further 347 U.N. peacekeepers remained in the hands
of the RUF insurgents, who seized or surrounded the U.N. soldiers
at the start of May in a row over disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who is close to RUF leader Foday Sankoh, has been
asked by Sierra Leone and its neighbors to negotiate the release
of the peacekeepers. He said that he was optimistic that further
releases would follow.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that fresh attacks on RUF positions could
endanger the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers, who now number 9,000, was deployed into
Sierra Leone to monitor a peace accord signed by the Sierra
Leonean Government and Sankoh to end the nation's eight-year civil
war. The United Nations is currently working hard to bring the
troops up to its full strength of 11,100. Sankoh, after signing of
the peace accord, joined the new united government in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan told reporters upon his arrival at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York that he was relieved at the release of
157 U.N. peacekeepers. His figures included 18 peacekeepers and U.
N. observers handed over to an Indian U.N. battalion in the rebel-
held territory in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the United Nations was working for further
releases but added it was also important to bring the whole
country, including its key diamond mines, under government control
and administration.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot have a state where a group of rebels arrogate to
themselves the right to exploit the riches of the country, either
for themselves or for a war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Sankoh has a place in the government, Annan said,
"I'm not sure if he has not excluded himself from the process by
his actions."

<HEADLINE> Mayor in Italy's Sicilia Arrested on Mafia Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A Sicilian mayor who recently railed
against the authorities for allowing his town to languish in the
grips of the Mafia, has been arrested on charges of Mafia
association, vote buying, drug trafficking and blackmail, Italian
news agency Ansa reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Intelisano, the mayor of Calatabiano near Catania on
the eastern Sicilian coast, was arrested Sunday night along with
49 others, including Catania provincial councilor Alfio Lizzio, as
part of an anti-Mafia swoop.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, both Intelisano and Lizzio granted
favors to a local Mafia clan in exchange for votes, the favors
ranging from money and public works contracts to cheap petrol and
even the promotion of football players.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Lizzio is charged with having paid 30 million
lire to the clan in return for its support during local elections
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The others arrested were accused of a range of crimes,
including murder, theft, extortion and blackmail.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that more local political officials could be
implicated in the inquiry.

<HEADLINE> West African Stock Exchange to Be Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has
been mandated by the executive committee of the African Stock
Exchanges Association (ASEA) to co-ordinate the establishment of a
west African regional bourse.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke, director-general of
the NSE, at a news briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Okereke-Onyiuke said that the eight Francophone countries in
the sub- region had already integrated their stock markets with
the Abidjan bourse as nerve-centre.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the Abidjan bourse and the NSE were
already using automatic trading systems to accommodate share
transactions in both English and French to take care of the
Anglophone and Francophone countries in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the integration of the stock markets in the
sub- region depended on the availability of funds for a regional
satellite to ensure simultaneous trading.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of an integrated west African bourse will place
the sub- region in a position to access the international capital
market for long- term development funds.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Forces Shoot Down Ethiopian Jet Fighter, Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea Monday shot down a SU-27
jet fighter and a MI-24 helicopter gun-ship and destroyed seven
tanks in its border war with Ethiopia, the Eritrean Foreign
Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the SU-27 warplane was the first of its kind
to be downed by Eritrea, adding Ethiopian forces Monday suffered
their heaviest casualties as they continued attacks on Eritrean
positions for the fourth day running.
</P>
<P>
"Detailed figures were not available immediately, but Eritrean
military commander on the Mereb-Setit front described the scene as
a 'massacre'. Thousands of Ethiopian troops were killed as they
were ordered into human wave attacks against Eritrean positions,"
said the release.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the status of the continued fighting, an
Eritrean military spokesman said, "the victory that Ethiopia has
been boasting about is proving illusory."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean forces Sunday claimed that more than 25,000
Ethiopian soldiers had been killed or wounded in three days of
fierce fighting which broke out last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia also said that its forces had inflicted heavy losses
on Eritrean side.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fighting in the two-year old border conflict followed
the collapse of recent bilateral peace talks in Algiers and the
shuttle diplomacy by a U.N. Security Council delegation which
visited both capitals last week.

ADDIS ABABA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- One Ethiopian fighter
helicopter was shot down Monday during its mission to attack
Eritrean positions, according to the Ethiopian government
Spokesperson's Office.
</P>
<P>
The downed helicopter landed in Ethiopian controlled area, the

It is the first time that Ethiopia has announced its loss since

</P>
<P>
Except for the downed gunship, the rest of Ethiopian warplanes
returned safely to base after completing their mission, said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
The release also claimed that following the coordinated efforts
of the Ethiopian air and ground forces, "the Eritrean troops have
sustained significant human and material losses".
</P>
<P>
"The Eritrean troops were forced to flee after the Ethiopian
defense forces overran their trenches during the course of the
past four days," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean troops were attempting to reorganize in the
vicinity of Das Barentu and Maidima, but they failed, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 15 (Xinhua)-- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Managing Director Horst Koehler said Monday Brazil's economic team
has performed a good job, which may be proved by the economy's
excellent recovery.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, on his first international mission through Latin
America, met Monday in Rio de Janeiro with President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and Finance Minister Pedro Malan, taking
advantage of the opportunity to send a message to the world that
countries in development, especially Brazil, are one of IMF's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, eighth director of the Fund and first German at head
of the institution, said he's convinced that Brazil, which must
follow the path of structural reforms, will increase international
reserves and wake up investors' interest in capital markets.
</P>
<P>
However, Koehler made no comment regarding the 41.5 billion
dollar financial accord revision between this entity and Brazil,
made last March.
</P>
<P>
Neither did he hide Brazil's government's interest to modify
the total calculation of the external debt according to expiry of
loans. After Brazil, Koheler, on his tour through Latin America,
will travel to Argentina, Mexico and Honduras.

<P>
HAVANA, May 15 (Xinhua)-- Candidate of opposition Dominican
Revolutionary Party (PPRD), Hipolito Mejia is expected to win the
presidential elections to take place Tuesday in Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, Mejia won't be able to accede to Presidential seat
until the second round of election fixed for coming June 30, as
all polls indicated he'll only get 46 percent of votes and won't
manage the 50 percent plus one required by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The other candidates, 90 year-old Joaquin Balaguer, of
Christian Social Reformist Party (PRSC) and ruling party candidate
Danilo Medina, of Party of Dominican Liberation will fight for
second place.
</P>
<P>
According to latest pollings, Balaguer comes through with 24
percent of voters' intentions, closely followed by Medina.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Balaguer and Medina is being attentively
followed by Mejia as from it will come forth his rival in the
second round, where things just are not too clear for anyone.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.3 million of the 8 million people in this former
Spanish Caribbean colony have registered to vote, and planes and
ferries have been packed with Dominicans coming from the United
States to vote as well. New York alone hosts at least 600,000
Dominicans, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The election will be monitored by 163 international observers
including members of the Atlanta-based Carter Center, the
Organization of American States and the National Democratic
Institute, an arm of the U.S. political party. In addition, the
local Citizen Participation group has 8,500 volunteers planning to
monitor the process.

<HEADLINE> Asian PC Market Bounces in First Quarter, Says IDC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Total PC shipments in Asia-
Pacific excluding Japan reached 4.24 million units in the first
quarter of this year, up 43 percent from a year ago, according to
preliminary results released Monday by a U.S. market research firm.
</P>
<P>
The overall regional market was boosted by South Korea's and
India's sequential shipments in particular, as well as support
from China and Singapore, said a report from International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
PC shipments were buoyed by the Internet PC program in South
Korea, an initiative led by the government to boost PC ownership
among lower-income groups. This government-advocated drive was
also prevalent in other Asian economies, IDC said, as governments
continue to look upon developing technology usage as a means of
sustained economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
China, South Korea, Australia and India were on top as far as
PC shipments in the first quarter were concerned. China led the
region with 1,374,000 units, up 34.6 percent from a year ago,
while South Korea shipped 1,043,000 units, up 146 percent.
</P>
<P>
PC vendors on top were South Korea's Samsung, China's Legend,
and IBM, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. Samsung, with shipments of
384,000 units, owed its success to a program targeting higher PC
ownership among students. Legend had two outstanding quarters of
phenomenal growth that earned it regional leadership in the fourth
quarter of 1999, but the vendor's momentum could not be sustained
in the first quarter this year. Although year-on-year growth was
122 percent, compared with the previous quarter, units shipments
dipped by two percent to 360,000 units, equating to 8.5 percent
market share of the region.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Ahead Rates Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose broadly
Monday only one day before the Federal Reserve is expected to
raise interest rates for the sixth time in 12 months in an effort
to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 198.41 at 10,807.78.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 78.59 at 3,607.65 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 31.40 at 1,452.36.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose as investors rushed in the market in a belief that
the Federal Reserve would be closer to the end of its tightening
monetary policy after one more hike in interest rates at the
policymaking meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch, a global securities research &AMP; economics group,
said in an economic survey that it expected the Federal Reserve to
announce 50 basis point increase in the funds rate to 6.5 percent
Tuesday and saw a base case of a 25 basis point move at the June
27-28 meeting. The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times
since last June to cool off the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Investors bought rate-sensitive stocks such as J.P. Morgan even
in defiance of a report of the extremely robust economy in April.
The Federal Reserve said today that the U.S. industrial production
rose 0.9 percent in the month, the biggest leap in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 12.92 at 655.78 and the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Zimbabwe to Have Free and Fair Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman reacted cautiously to reports that
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe had called parliamentary
elections for June.
</P>
<P>
"We are awaiting confirmation of these reports. We have long
been pressing for an election date within the period laid down in
the constitution and for elections to be free and fair," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All legitimate political parties must be able to campaign
freely and without fear, including fear of censorship," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was important that all parties could have
confidence in the electoral process in the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Britain has been locked in a war of words with Mugabe's
government since a violent land-grab campaign against white farms
erupted in the African state three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has said that neither
Britain nor any other donor would fund land reform in Zimbabwe
unless it was conducted within the rule of law and a free election
was held.
