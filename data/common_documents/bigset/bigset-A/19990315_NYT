GORDON TAMES AMS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ With every lap he makes at Atlanta Motor
Speedway, Jeff Gordon is coming to grips with what has become
NASCAR's fastest non-restricted racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won the 1998 season-ending NAPA 500 on the reconfigured
and repaved 1.54-mile quadoval last November, under conditions
similar to yesterday's dreary and winter-like weather. Gordon
bagged his second victory in four starts this season in the Cracker
Barrel 500 here, out-pitting and then out-running Bobby Labonte and
Mark Martin on a racetrack that finally has begun to develop a
two-groove personality.
</P>
<P>
   AMS earned its lightning-fast reputation during the first event
run after completion of its redesign and repaving in November 1997.
When Geoffrey Bodine ripped off a qualifying lap at 197.957 mph on
Nov. 15 of that year, AMS became the fastest NASCAR track run
without a carburetor restrictor plate.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a track where every brush with a concrete wall sticks
to your ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a track where you have to drive into the corner
without getting all the way out of the gas,'' said Gordon, the
reigning and three-time Cup champion. ``When you get out of the
gas, it unloads the car and makes it loose. That's a hard thing to
do _ your general reaction is to get out of the throttle. I had to
work on some combinations to make me feel more comfortable here.
Because \Rcrew chief\S Ray Evernham was doing everything he could
to make the entry into the corner more comfortable for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally kind of realized it's not the car, it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident his car would stick in the outside lane at race speeds
over 187 mph, Gordon rallied in the last third of the event to
overhaul pole-sitter Labonte and outlast him to the finish line by
2.537 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And in what has become an Evernham-inspired trademark, Gordon
set up his run to the checkered flag with an 8.2-second pit stop
for right side tires only and fuel on lap 297 under green flag
conditions. When that cycle of pit stops was completed, Gordon had
gotten around Labonte and reassumed the lead on lap 311 of the 325
scheduled en route to his 44th career Cup victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really committed to the bottom \Rof the track\S all day
long,'' said Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``But I was just wearing the right
front \Rtire\S out and getting loose and wearing the right rear
out. I saw some other guys that were using the outside lane, and
that was the only way you could make that car last on the long
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little hairy up there a couple of times, but it
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   So well that Gordon led four times for a race-high 109 laps, or
six more than Labonte, who was followed to the line by the Ford
Tauruses of Martin, Jeff Burton and Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Labonte drove a great race,'' said Gordon, one of 10
drivers involved in 25 lead changes before an estimated 85,000
chilled fans. ``He got up there in front of me that last time after
that pit stop \RGordon finally passed Labonte on Lap 304\S, and I
thought we were in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, the defending race champion, said he might have had
more for Gordon if he could have taken on four tires during his
last stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two tires didn't work for me,'' said Labonte, driver of the
No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix. ``I'm not very good
at that anyway. My car was too tight on two tires and I couldn't
get the right line that I needed. I can't ever make two tires work.
I just didn't run the right line for a few laps, and Jeff made up a
lot of time.''

CORNHUSKERS' CENTER HOPING TO STOP NAILON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A snippet on ``SportsCenter'', a couple of
seconds from a game; until four days ago, Venson Hamilton's
impression of Lee Nailon had been formed in such moments.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hamilton has seen Nailon performing many dastardly
deeds, like banging inside for a layup and seconds later banging
down a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is a great player,'' Hamilton said. ``He's going to
be a Top 15 pick in the draft. He's strong inside and physical and
yet he'll go outside on you, too. He just has that never-quit,
keep-fighting mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton gets an up-close-and-personal look at Nailon when TCU
(20-10) plays Nebraska (20-12) at 7 tonight in the second round of
the National Invitation Tournament at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   And Nailon gets his first look at Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him play before,'' Nailon said. ``My
impressions? He's the Big 12 player of the year. That's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The paint will be their stage. The battle will be between
styles.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is the banger, the in-your-face physical presence in
the lane. He says so himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard worker so I get a lot of rebounds,'' Hamilton said.
``That's how I make my points.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not embarrassed, either. The way he figures it garbage
points are still points.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton averages 15.6 of them a game and almost as many
rebounds (10.2).
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding is a key,'' Horned Frogs coach Billy Tubbs said.
``They are an excellent rebounding team. We have to stay on the
boards with Hamilton. We can't let him get going.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be Nailon's job. It is not his only role, though.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon is the riddle, the sometime-banger inside, the
sometime-finesse player. The question is on a given night which
version of Nailon the other team will see.
</P>
<P>
   On nights when he's both, like in TCU's first-round victory
against Kansas State, he's tough to handle. He had 22 points,
including 2 for 2 on 3-pointers, and eight rebounds against the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year I've been saying I can play outside,'' Nailon said.
``It's an advantage over a lot of guys who guard me because not a
lot of guys can go outside with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an advantage against Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my game,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   When Nailon takes his game outside, the Cornhuskers likely will
switch. The chances for mismatches increases with every switch.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton realizes, though, that sooner or later Nailon will
venture back in and the dance will begin again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a match both players look forward to. Nailon has a chance
to prove himself against the Big 12 Player of the Year. Hamilton
has chance to prove himself against a top 15 NBA draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs was quick to say that the game wouldn't be decided by
Hamilton and Nailon. ``It's TCU versus Nebraska last time I
checked,'' Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be pretty good,'' Cornhuskers coach Danny Nee
said. ``I mean, you are talking about two very, very good
players.''

PAC-10 WAS EARLY CASUALTY OF MARCH MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Tightens, adds new info) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four teams, five games, and they're ... gone! The
last time the Pacific-10 didn't place a team in the Sweet 16
(1987), Walt Hazzard was coaching UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected it, but perhaps we should have. After a
sparkling four-year tournament run that included two national
titles and 11 Sweet 16 appearances, the Pac-10 was due for some
early exits.
</P>
<P>
   If you're searching for an explanation, a trend, a theory _
don't. There isn't one. That's the beauty of March Madness, where
the only constant is chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discrepancy in seeds, No. 2 Stanford's loss to
Gonzaga was a mild upset, at best. Stanford was injury-riddled and
exhausted; Gonzaga was skilled, experienced and beautifully
coached.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs beat Washington and lost close games at Kansas,
Purdue, Detroit and Texas Christian. They were playing a few hours
from home, in Seattle, and their seed (10) wasn't commensurate with
their credentials. In a show of goodwill, the NCAA selection
committee dropped them to 10 so they could play close to home. (At
their true seed, No. 8 or 9, they would have been shipped to Denver
with No. 1 Connecticut.)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's exit is not as easily explained, except the Wildcats
hadn't had a first-round loss in four years, so Lute Olson was due.
They also faced one of the nation's most underachieving teams,
Oklahoma, whose seed masked its talent.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a battle of the present and future Arizona
coaches. Wildcats athletic director Jim Livengood hired Kelvin
Sampson at Washington State and could do it again in Tucson when
Olson retires. If Sampson does replace Olson, the league's coaches
will rejoice. Arizona could do a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   And for the third time in four years, UCLA drew a first-round
foe that loved to play slow _ first Princeton, then Miami, then
Detroit. Perhaps the selection committee is sending the Bruins a
message: Learn to play a complete game, or depart early.
</P>
<P>
   First weekend fodder: North Carolina freshmen Jeff Capel and Ron
Curry were a combined 0 of 3 from the field in a first-round loss
to Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona freshmen Richard Jefferson and Ruben Douglas were a
combined 3 of 12 from the field in a first-round loss to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA freshmen JaRon Rush and Jerome Moiso were a combined 4 of
16 from the field in a first-round loss to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet 16 seeds, by region: East _ 1, 6, 10, 12; Midwest _ 1, 3,
10, 13; West _ 1, 5, 6, 10; South _ 1, 2, 3, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Best coaching job: Weber State's Ron Abegglen beat North
Carolina and designed a defense that held UNC 7-footer Brendan
Haywood without a basket. Abegglen will not be retained next
season, according to a prior arrangement with the school.
</P>
<P>
   In his final game, Glendora native and Louisville guard Cameron
Murray was 1 of 5 and scored four points.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise that Wisconsin lost to Southwest Missouri State in
the first round. Coach Dick Bennett was 0-12 against the Bears
during his tenure at Wisconsin-Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In his dominance and all-around skill, Miami of Ohio's Wally
Szczerbiak evokes memories of another small-school Midwesterner,
Larry Bird, who carried Indiana State to the Final Four 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Kentucky-Kansas was the best game so far, but
Kentucky-Duke in the Final Four will be the game of the tournament.

UCONN BEATS XAVIER BY SCORING THE LAST 8 POINTS OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Trailing by 6 points with 2 minutes 17 seconds
remaining Sunday night, Connecticut rallied to score the last 8
points and outlast eighth-seeded Xavier, 86-84, to advance to the
Round of 16 of the Mideast Regional of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by the freshman forward Tamika Williams with 7.1
seconds left enabled the top-seeded Huskies to prevail after they
had trailed by as many as 10 points in the second half, keeping a
capacity crowd of 10,027 at sold-out Gampel Pavilion on the edge of
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Williams got her opportunity to win the game after Nikki Kremer,
the outstanding Xavier guard, who had made eight consecutive free
throws and scored a game-high 23 points, missed two foul shots with
38 seconds to go and the score tied at 84-84.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut will meet the winner of Sunday's game between Oregon
and Iowa State in Cincinnati next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier (24-9) pulled ahead by 10 less than four minutes into the
second half on a one-hander by Taru Tuukkanen, a 6-foot-3 sophomore
from Finland, after UConn had drawn within 2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies (29-4), led by Shea Ralph and Svetlana
Abrosimova, kept chipping away at Xavier and pulled within 3 points
on a drive by Abrosimova. But, as happened so often during this
fast-paced and well-played game, Nicole Levandusky, the Musketeers'
leading scorer, nailed her team's ninth 3-pointer and Katie Griggs
drove the lane to make it 68-60 with 11 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was UConn's turn to shine on defense, with a 12-2 spurt
that tied it at 72-72 on Williams' second straight power goal
underneath with 7:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Xavier would not go away, pulling ahead by 80-76 on a
Griggs' 3-pointer, before Jones scored her fifth basket of the half
on a power drive to the hoop to bring the Huskies within 80-78 with
4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper by Griggs as the shot clock was winding down increased
that lead to 82-78, after which Kim Hotz got free underneath for a
layup to widen the Musketeers' lead to 6 before Williams scored on
a drive to cut it to 84-80 with 2 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But then two crucial errors by Xavier _ a pass that went out of
bounds and a backcourt violation _ enabled Connecticut to tie it at
84-84 on another drive by Jones and a layup by Abrosimova.
</P>
<P>
   After Kremer missed her foul shots and Williams made hers,
Xavier had one final attempt. With time running out, Kremer got off
a desperate off-balance 20-footer just before the buzzer. It was
not even close and the Huskies formed a jubilant pile on the court.
</P>
<P>
   That Williams should score the points that lifted the Huskies to
a comeback triumph was only fitting, since she led UConn with 19
points and 9 rebounds and scored 4 of the Huskies' final 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies weren't able to pull away from the Musketeers during
a see-saw first half.
</P>
<P>
   After the senior captain Amy Duran had given Connecticut a 20-17
lead with her second 3-pointer of the first half, Kremer tied it
with her first of three from 3-point range. With UConn turning the
ball over repeatedly _ 14 times in the half _ the Musketeers went
on a 13-4 run to take a 33-24 lead with 6 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by Xavier's tenacious defensive play, particularly in
the lane, Connecticut went without a basket for six minutes until
the freshman Swin Cash sank a layup with 2:15 remaining after the
visitors had widened their lead to 38-28.

ZAGS NOT JUST PRIDE OF SPOKANE ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-VECSEY-COLUMN-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As day dawned Sunday, having slept the sweet sleep of
Big Dance victors, the Gonzaga Bulldogs woke in their Seattle hotel
rooms, getting ready for their flight over the Cascades, across the
desert-like plains of Eastern Washington and back home to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Spokane is totally cool.
</P>
<P>
   A river runs through it.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the heart of the city, someone had the smarts to
build a great park, complete with a carousel and a roller-blade
path and benches and grass that people are allowed to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the park, a giant waterfall crashes down,
giving you a glimpse of nature's power and the way people harnessed
it to make electricity and allow a little city like Spokane to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, there is even a hip little coffee bar where, unlike
Seattle, a double-tall Americano and a scone costs less than one
share of Microsoft or Amazon.com stock.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane is the kind of place where you can walk through town and
think, or ride your bike out into the countryside along gentle
rolling hills, out into the wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
   And right across one of the quaint walking bridges, about
half-mile from the middle of the city, sits the pleasant campus of
Gonzaga, with neat, brick buildings that are in complete keeping
with the image this highly reputable Jesuit college has earned over
the years _ even before John Stockton, who was smart enough to grow
up in Spokane and dream of playing for the Bulldogs, even when no
other kid's dreams tended to include Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   You know, all said, the Zags have had it pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The world may think of it as John Stockton U., but there is more
to it than that _ not that Gonzaga players mind that kind of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo said.
``We've created an identity, but he's the best there is.''
</P>
<P>
   With two NCAA wins, in one swift, dramatic, sweet weekend, it
probably just got a whole lot better for Gonzaga. Santangelo is
right. They have created their own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, or maybe appropriately, the greatest basketball victory
in Gonzaga history took place 300 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after beating Minnesota in a first-round game in the
1999 NCAA tournament, Gonzaga slapped mighty Stanford from the
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, or maybe appropriately, Gonzaga's big wins came in
Seattle, the kind of place that could give a place like Gonzaga and
Spokane a complex _ although that would be ridiculously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is the big city/little city contrast. There is
also the big conference/little conference juxtaposition. The
Bulldogs are the West Coast Conference champs. The Cardinal were
the brutes of the Pac-10. David and Goliath was the theme imposed
on the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   But that David/Goliath thing was wrong. It continues to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who saw the damage Gonzaga did to the University of
Washington and Washington State this season, you know this is no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars fell first, losing 70-61 in November. Then came the
Huskies, who started the season ranked No. 14 in the polls but who
were headed for a swift, steady fall just as the Zags lit up their
cross-state rivals. Gonzaga beat the Huskies 82-71 and then
proceeded to romp to a 25-6 record and the WCC championship.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Zags have been and continue to be too legit to
label ``Cinderella'' or ``underdog,'' even if the national sporting
media _ and even some of the more hoity-toity newspapers in the
``big city'' of Seattle _ can't help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Cinderella story. We didn't just spring up and
have a good season,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said again Saturday,
minutes after the Zags had beaten Stanford at its own game.
</P>
<P>
   Monson's sentiments were echoed by Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who expressed displeasure that Minnesota, hit with a
scandal of alleged academic fraud, did not beat Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said he knew Gonzaga was the tougher matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was he right.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, would it be wrong for anyone to continue to call these
Bulldogs underdogs any more. That became especially true after the
revered Pac-10 was left without a single Sweet 16 entry. That
became especially true in the big city of Seattle, where the
Huskies were all but embarrassed by a great player from Miami of
Ohio whose name they should be able to spell now.
</P>
<P>
   The boys from Gonzaga are headed to Phoenix for the next round,
where Florida might not be able to wear down these Bulldogs, who
are now the pride of not only Spokane, but beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Off we send them, to the Sweet 16, to fulfill our hoop dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are more fun than a barrel of Todd MacCullochs.
</P>
<P>
   The great state of Washington, the entire Pacific Northwest,
even all western states' fans who usually side with Pac-10 schools
from Seattle to Tucson, we have new 'Dogs to fawn over.
</P>
<P>
   No underdogs. No Cinderellas. No Pac-10 little brothers. No John
Stockton U.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Gonzaga Bulldogs out of Spokane. That will do just
fine.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ There is a cab driver in Seattle the Gonzaga Bulldogs
would like to thank _ and perhaps kiss, say, 16 times.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbie unknowingly put some lemon juice on the West Coast
Conference champions' Sweet 16 dream.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bulldogs needed added incentive going into their
second-round NCAA tournament game against nationally ranked
Stanford at KeyArena, but minutes into his cab ride from the Hilton
Hotel to a restaurant Friday night, coach Dan Monson had some ammo
for his pregame talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told us he asked the cab driver about the NCAA
tournament and how it was going,'' Gonzaga forward Casey Calvary
said, ``and (the cabbie) told him the only reason Gonzaga beat
Minnesota was because (the Gophers) had four players suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cab driver didn't know it was our coach in the back
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson said Sunday the cab driver also said Gonzaga ``will get
killed (Saturday) by Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the kids nobody believed they belonged, and this was
their chance to prove it,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga took a back seat to no one during its rewarding trek
across the Cascades, winding up with a date in the desert. Unsung
but not unheralded by those who have watched them play, the
Bulldogs advanced to the West Region semifinals in Phoenix with an
82-74 victory over the Pacific-10 champion Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is a Thursday night game at America West Arena against
Florida, which defeated Weber State, 82-74, in overtime Saturday,
capping a sub-regional that drew far more attention than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA didn't assign a No. 1 seed to the Seattle sub-regional,
but some of the best first- and second-round games in the
tournament were played at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The only tournament scandal _ so far _ was here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after arriving from Minneapolis, the Big Ten Gophers
were in big trouble. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Wednesday
that a former university employee had admitted taking tests and
doing course work for as many as 20 basketball players, including
four _ two starters _ on this Gopher team.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga sent the Gophers home with a season-ending 75-63 loss.
</P>
<P>
   But some, including a certain cab driver, weren't convinced the
Bulldogs could beat Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say Gonzaga won because the other team didn't have
all of its players. Gonzaga won because of depth and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to take anything away from Stanford because they
are a great group of guys,'' junior guard Matt Santangelo said,
``but we wanted it more. Desire is what got us this win.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that Santangelo scored a team-high 22 points and
received double-figure scoring help from three teammates _ Richie
Frahm (15), Quentin Hall (14) and Calvary (10).
</P>
<P>
   ``We go 10 deep,'' starting center Jeremy Eaton said. ``Our subs
come in and contribute as much as the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   When Eaton and Calvary got into early foul trouble against the
taller, bulkier Cardinal front line, backups Mark Spink and Axel
Dench came in and pulled down nine rebounds in 31 combined minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga had a surprising 45-33 rebounding edge, just two days
after Stanford hammered Alcorn State on the boards (45-23).
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just a very physical team,'' said Tim Young,
Stanford's 7-foot-2 center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a dream,'' said Spink, a sophomore from
Bellingham. ``You better pinch me because I don't want to wake
up.''
</P>
<P>
   This sub-regional opened eyes all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest March Madness upset ended Thursday night's
first-round marathon at KeyArena. Harold ``The Show'' Arceneaux
looked like the next coming of M.J. as he scored 36 points in Weber
State's shocking 76-74 win over North Carolina, which hadn't
experienced a one-game-and-out NCAA tournament in nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, the top seed (No. 2), returned all five of its
starters from last season's Final Four team and figured to last at
least until they played No. 1-seed Connecticut in Phoenix in the
West Region finals. But Alcorn State put some doubt in the Cardinal
minds during a closer-than-expected first-round game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   And so did Florida, though much more quietly, as the SEC Gators
made sure that there was only one glass slipper available for two
Cinderella teams _ Gonzaga and Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Saturday's crowd (15,187) was emotionally drained after
the Gonzaga-Stanford game and did more watching than cheering
during the other quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   Florida finally figured out a way to contain Arceneaux and
squeeked out a win that put it in the Sweet 16 for the first time
since 1994's Final Four Gator team.
</P>
<P>
   Arceneaux, who scored 36 points against North Carolina, had 21
at halftime against Florida and finished with 32 on 12-of-27
shooting in 43 minutes. But he, like the other Wildcats, looked
tired in the OT session.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying and he got tired,'' said Ron Abegglen, coaching
his final game at Weber State. ``But a tired Harold is still a
pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   The best in this sub-regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever nicknamed him `The Show' did him a great disservice
because he's a lot more than that,'' said Gator guard Teddy Dupay,
whose 3-pointer with two minutes remaining in overtime gave Florida
a six-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Show'' and the rest have departed and the NCAA tournament
won't be back for at least five more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have it back,'' said Brian Trent, the tourmanent
manager. ``The little schools played great, the last game went into
overtime and the sun even peeked out a few times. I thought it went
great.''
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever find out who that cab driver is, let us now,''
Calvary said. ``We'll invite him to Spokane.''

LEFT-HANDER ZIMMERMAN HAS A SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Jordan Zimmerman isn't sure how he came to love
baseball. Some years, he said, his hometown is covered in snow
until June.
</P>
<P>
   All he knows is his passion for the game was so deep he uprooted
himself at age 16 and moved to another country. Otherwise, there's
no way Zimmerman would be where he is now, with an outside chance
of becoming the latest left-handed Mariner reliever from Kelowna,
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The last one, Paul Spoljaric, was traded this winter, leaving
the M's without an established lefty in the bullpen. The
23-year-old Zimmerman is making his case for the job, and the
Mariners like what they've seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimmerman has made us sit up and take notice,'' said pitching
coach Stan Williams. ``His slider needs a little work, but
everything else looks good. Good velocity, no fear and he locates
the ball well. Those are all indications he's going to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman pitched a scoreless seventh inning in the Mariners'
8-7 win over the Chicago Cubs Sunday. The M's ideally would like a
more experienced lefty for the bullpen, but Zimmerman will survive
the next round of cuts on Wednesday and manager Lou Piniella said
Zimmerman has an ``outside chance'' of making the club.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Zimmerman in a similar situation as his brother, Jeff,
a 26-year-old right-hander bidding to make the Texas Rangers'
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Jeff have talked frequently this spring, and always
have been close. They spent three years together on the Canadian
junior national team, and when Jeff went to college at Texas
Christian, Jordan moved to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, a 32nd-round junior-college draft pick by the
Mariners in 1995, saw his career nearly end before it began. He
missed his first two professional seasons recovering from back
surgery, and has pitched in just 842/3 innings the past two years
with shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   But participating in the instructional league and Arizona Fall
League (where he played on Jeff's team) has Zimmerman ``feeling
like a brand-new person.'' He throws 90 mph with good life at the
end of his pitches, and the health problems have imparted him a
degree of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm a lot more mentally strong than I should be for my
age, just because of everything I went through,'' Zimmerman said.
``When you have two pretty serious injuries at a young age, you
learn to deal with things and gain a lot of perspective compared to
other people. You realize there's no point in being scared.''
</P>
<P>
   That perspective is evident when Zimmerman speaks of his goals
for 1999. He's pitching in major league exhibition games, but
Zimmerman doesn't have Seattle on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make the team, great, but I've never even pitched
double-A before and I'm not going to be upset if they send me there
or even lower,'' he said. ``I just want to have a full season,
health-wise. That's all I'm looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Right-hander Bill Swift will pitch two innings Wednesday
against Oakland after a successful bullpen session Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Back stiffness has kept Swift from pitching since a two-inning
outing March 7, and Sunday was an important test for the non-roster
veteran, who is vying for a spot in the Mariners' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was hurt, I'd probably be done,'' said Swift, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Swift wore a brace for his back and might need it during games,
but he said it didn't affect him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Jay Buhner started in left field again Sunday, but he's
headed for his preferred pasture. Buhner will debut in right field
Monday, four days earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   But an unconvinced Buhner said, ``I'll believe it when I see it.
I was supposed to play there (Friday), and that got banged. I know
I'll be there Opening Day, put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Left-hander Butch Henry, who had been scheduled to follow Ken
Cloude Sunday, started instead for the first time this spring.
Henry, who can release himself from his contract if he does not
make the starting rotation, made it clear last week he will not
pitch in relief for the M's and was upset he had yet to make a
spring start.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he was upset mainly with himself. After allowing a
mammoth three-run homer to Henry Rodriguez in the second inning,
Henry got into another jam by throwing seven straight balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know better than that,'' said Henry, who pitched in only two
games last year before season-ending knee surgery.
``(Concentration) is a very, very big part of my game, because I'm
not overpowering and I do give up hits. It's going to take time for
me to get back in that swing of things to where I'm mentally
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry escaped the second without further damage and pitched a
1-2-3 third.
</P>
<P>
   -- Williams worked in the bullpen Sunday with right-hander Mac
Suzuki, who has allowed six runs on five walks in three innings.
Williams squatted behind the pitcher and extended his arm so it was
even with the back of Suzuki's knee. When Suzuki brought his arm
back, he would try to graze the ball against Williams' open palm in
an effort to make his mechanics more consistent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have little time to spare with Suzuki, who is out
of options and must clear waivers if the team tries to send him to
the minors. The 23-year-old has the confidence of his pitching
coach. ``I don't worry about Mac,'' Williams said. ``He's going to
be fine.''

ZAGS NOT JUST PRIDE OF SPOKANE ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ As day dawned Sunday, having slept the sweet sleep of
Big Dance victors, the Gonzaga Bulldogs woke in their Seattle hotel
rooms, getting ready for their flight over the Cascades, across the
desert-like plains of Eastern Washington and back home to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Spokane is totally cool.
</P>
<P>
   A river runs through it.
</P>
<P>
   And right in the heart of the city, someone had the smarts to
build a great park, complete with a carousel and a roller-blade
path and benches and grass that people are allowed to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the park, a giant waterfall crashes down,
giving you a glimpse of nature's power and the way people harnessed
it to make electricity and allow a little city like Spokane to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   In Spokane, there is even a hip little coffee bar where, unlike
Seattle, a double-tall Americano and a scone costs less than one
share of Microsoft or Amazon.com stock.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane is the kind of place where you can walk through town and
think, or ride your bike out into the countryside along gentle
rolling hills, out into the wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
   And right across one of the quaint walking bridges, about
half-mile from the middle of the city, sits the pleasant campus of
Gonzaga, with neat, brick buildings that are in complete keeping
with the image this highly reputable Jesuit college has earned over
the years _ even before John Stockton, who was smart enough to grow
up in Spokane and dream of playing for the Bulldogs, even when no
other kid's dreams tended to include Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   You know, all said, the Zags have had it pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   The world may think of it as John Stockton U., but there is more
to it than that _ not that Gonzaga players mind that kind of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo said.
``We've created an identity, but he's the best there is.''
</P>
<P>
   With two NCAA wins, in one swift, dramatic, sweet weekend, it
probably just got a whole lot better for Gonzaga. Santangelo is
right. They have created their own identity.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, or maybe appropriately, the greatest basketball victory
in Gonzaga history took place 300 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after beating Minnesota in a first-round game in the
1999 NCAA tournament, Gonzaga slapped mighty Stanford from the
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, or maybe appropriately, Gonzaga's big wins came in
Seattle, the kind of place that could give a place like Gonzaga and
Spokane a complex _ although that would be ridiculously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there is the big city/little city contrast. There is
also the big conference/little conference juxtaposition. The
Bulldogs are the West Coast Conference champs. The Cardinal were
the brutes of the Pac-10. David and Goliath was the theme imposed
on the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   But that David/Goliath thing was wrong. It continues to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who saw the damage Gonzaga did to the University of
Washington and Washington State this season, you know this is no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars fell first, losing 70-61 in November. Then came the
Huskies, who started the season ranked No. 14 in the polls but who
were headed for a swift, steady fall just as the Zags lit up their
cross-state rivals. Gonzaga beat the Huskies 82-71 and then
proceeded to romp to a 25-6 record and the WCC championship.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the Zags have been and continue to be too legit to
label ``Cinderella'' or ``underdog,'' even if the national sporting
media _ and even some of the more hoity-toity newspapers in the
``big city'' of Seattle _ can't help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Cinderella story. We didn't just spring up and
have a good season,'' Gonzaga coach Dan Monson said again Saturday,
minutes after the Zags had beaten Stanford at its own game.
</P>
<P>
   Monson's sentiments were echoed by Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery, who expressed displeasure that Minnesota, hit with a
scandal of alleged academic fraud, did not beat Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said he knew Gonzaga was the tougher matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was he right.
</P>
<P>
   And, boy, would it be wrong for anyone to continue to call these
Bulldogs underdogs any more. That became especially true after the
revered Pac-10 was left without a single Sweet 16 entry. That
became especially true in the big city of Seattle, where the
Huskies were all but embarrassed by a great player from Miami of
Ohio whose name they should be able to spell now.
</P>
<P>
   The boys from Gonzaga are headed to Phoenix for the next round,
where Florida might not be able to wear down these Bulldogs, who
are now the pride of not only Spokane, but beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Off we send them, to the Sweet 16, to fulfill our hoop dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are more fun than a barrel of Todd MacCullochs.
</P>
<P>
   The great state of Washington, the entire Pacific Northwest,
even all western states' fans who usually side with Pac-10 schools
from Seattle to Tucson, we have new 'Dogs to fawn over.
</P>
<P>
   No underdogs. No Cinderellas. No Pac-10 little brothers. No John
Stockton U.
</P>
<P>
   Just the Gonzaga Bulldogs out of Spokane. That will do just
fine.

MAN INGESTED 92 BAGS OF HEROIN, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 44-year-old man who fainted and went into
convulsions at La Guardia Airport early Sunday had 92 thumb-size
packets of heroin in his digestive tract, the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Arcadio Yepes of Jackson Heights, Queens, was in
critical condition Sunday night at Elmhurst Hospital Center and has
been charged with possession of more than four ounces of the drug,
the police said. He was stricken shortly after arriving on a flight
from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Edward Silhan of the Port Authority police said that in his
22 years on the force dealing with drug couriers who swallow
packets, he had never heard of a smuggler who had ingested so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see two dozen, three dozen sometimes, but I was totally
amazed at what this guy had,'' Silhan said. ``He must have been
filled from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Yepes had paid cash for a one-way ticket from Medellin,
Colombia, to Miami, where he cleared customs, then caught a
connecting flight to New York, Silhan said. The packets were sealed
with wax, but one of them burst inside his stomach, poisoning him,
the lieutenant said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that drug-swallowers are an important link
in the Colombia-New York heroin trade and that they are typically
paid about $1,000 per flight.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ Joe Kleine turned to find Charles Barkley. Barkley
doubled back to Kleine. And when the friends met at midcourt,
falling into a tight embrace, Kleine offered a large body to hold
the exhausted Barkley up, an approximation of the defense with
which he had shut him down.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All that was missing from this fitting postgame scene was
Rockets forward Scottie Pippen, perhaps as dejected and frustrated
as he has been in his career. By then, he needed a hug most.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets hit a wall _ Kleine served as a fitting symbol
of that, too _ the Suns flew past them for a 104-90 win Sunday
night at America West Arena, breaking the Rockets' three-game
winning streak and Phoenix's four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley credited his friend for his physical and exhausting
defensive effort, and Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich cited the
realities of back-to-back games. But Pippen said the problem runs
deeper _ so much deeper that he said he doesn't know why the
Rockets signed him as a celebrated, cover-boy free agent less than
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes
I'm playing (40.6 per game, fourth in the NBA), I'm not involved in
the offense. It makes the game not any fun anymore. My next step is
to find why this organization wanted me. I want to sit down and
ask, `What's my position on this ballclub?' If it's just from the
defensive standpoint, if that's the point, then I can feel much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said he does not regret his decision to sign with the
Rockets, only that it has come time to adjust the offense to
include him and other perimeter players to a greater extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to
make the game for everybody. There's nights when things are not
going right. It's time to go to somebody else or try to get
somebody else involved. There needs to be some kind of system where
we all make the defense stay honest. Everybody is looking up and
figuring out how to play us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Games like tonight make the game very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen took just five shots Sunday, making two. He finished with
four points, four assists and four rebounds in 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple games, I'm not involved in the offensive
system,'' Pippen said. ``We have to try to get other guys in the
offense. Teams are starting to play what we're doing and having
success with it. We have to go away from that, and (the
adjustments) are not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating right now. I haven't found my comfort zone in
the system here. It's frustrating to be playing the kind of minutes
I'm playing and not be involved in the offense. To go out and lose,
I realize I could have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets on Sunday went inside to Barkley and Hakeem
Olajuwon, largely because with Suns center Luc Longley out with a
hip pointer, Olajuwon seemed to have the advantage against Cliff
Robinson and Danny Manning, and because Barkley went up against
Kleine for much of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Olajuwon never found the shooting touch he had
enjoyed in the Rockets' winning streak, the system worked for much
of the game. Despite a horrid start in which the Rockets made but
three of their first 20 shots, they rallied in the second quarter
on the strength of their bench.
</P>
<P>
   Using a nine-man rotation, Tomjanovich believed his starters
would be strong enough to finish the game before the wear of
another back-to-back weekend left their shots short and slowed
their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that would help us big-time,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich said the Suns ``out-energied us'' and was
particularly impressed with Jason Kidd, whose 26 points, 14 assists
and 11 rebounds gave him his 24th career triple double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is such a winner, such a gamer,'' Tomjanovich said.
``He's amazing. He's one of the best competitors I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd took over in the second half. He hit a baseline jumper five
minutes into the half to complete the Suns' comeback from a deficit
that had reached 12 in the second quarter. And though the Rockets
held off the Suns for much of the third quarter, points became
increasingly difficult to come by as Phoenix, and especially Kidd,
began to roll.
</P>
<P>
   With Kleine bumping and pushing him out of the lane, Barkley
made one of six shots during the Suns' run _ each miss coming up
short _ until Phoenix had built a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore me down,'' Barkley said of Kleine. ``I had nothing
left when the game was on the line. He played great defense, and he
made big shots. I was worn down, and he wore me down even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of gas in the second half. There was nothing we
could do about it. It's frustrating, because we're better than that
team. It's disappointing to lose to that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, meanwhile, either scored or set up 12 consecutive Suns
points in the fourth quarter, turning the game into a ``scramble''
that Tomjanovich said the Rockets had to avoid. And when Kidd
posted up, his only time with his back to the basket all game, he
passed to George McLeod for an open 3 and an 84-77 lead with 5:13
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns scored on 15 of their last 16 trips down the court,
Kleine completing the win with a jumper that gave him 10 surprising
points off the bench and left the Rockets wondering what had hit
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game you can't really explain,'' Olajuwon said. ``We
had the game under control, and all of a sudden it slips away. It's
the kind of game you look back on and say, `Wow, we should have
won.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had some theories, but he couldn't explain it entirely
himself. He did plan, however, to get some answers, and for more
than just Sunday's loss.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried deep in the mountains 150 miles east of Xian, where the
Chinese built a terra cotta army to protect the remains of the
Emperors, lies a far smaller but lethal force: a half dozen or so
intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles near the town of Luoning are hardly sophisticated
by modern standards. The Pentagon believes each is equipped with a
single warhead, large but not very accurate, intended for busting
cities. They are mounted atop liquid-fuel rockets that take a full
hour of preparation to launch.
</P>
<P>
   In total, China is believed to possess roughly 20 missiles that
can reach American shores, and perhaps 300 nuclear weapons that,
aboard medium-range missiles or bombers, could hit Japan, India or
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bare-bones arsenal compared with the thousands of
warheads still maintained by the United States and Russia. But the
question in Washington this week is whether China's nuclear fleet
will stay that way 10 or 20 years into the future or become a far
more potent arsenal that could rekindle the kind of fears that
shaped the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that China stole the design of America's most
advanced miniaturized warhead _ the W-88 _ from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory more than 10 years ago has prompted anger in
Washington, especially in Congress. On Sunday President Clinton's
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, defended the
administration's investigation into the loss, but added, ``There's
no question that they've benefited from this.'' The Chinese again
vehemently denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continuing evidence of Chinese espionage abroad, most
experts doubt that China intends to fundamentally change its
largely defensive nuclear strategy or that it will try to alter the
imbalance of weapons with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts outside the U.S. government _ including some
who have talked at length with Chinese leaders and military
officials _ say Beijing is clearly seeking to modernize its nuclear
forces, with a 10-year plan to make them more accurate, easier to
launch and far less vulnerable to attack than they are today. And
it is hoping to use high technology to offset its outmoded
conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   What China seeks, they say, is an arsenal large enough to give
them global status and deter the potential for nuclear blackmail,
but small enough to avoid the Soviet Union's mistake _ a military
force so expensive that it sped the bankruptcy of the nation. But
China's modernization certainly could accelerate its ability to
threaten its neighbors, and it could be sped up if China feels
increasingly insecure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without the W-88 warheads, China today is able to
threaten the United States,'' William J. Perry, the former defense
secretary, said last week in Washington, just after returning from
a visit to China where he spent time with military leaders and
China's president, Jiang Zemin. ``You have to anticipate that
ability will improve in coming years. They will evolve into a more
global force. The challenge is how do we manage that?''
</P>
<P>
   Western experts are not certain whether China, as part of its
force improvements, intends to place multiple warheads atop its new
missiles, as the United States and the Soviet Union did long ago.
The W-88 technology could speed that transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they eventually put six or ten warheads on their
ICBM's, we will still have an overwhelming advantage,'' said Bates
Gill, a specialist on the Chinese military at the Brookings
Institution. ``But if it is achieved, it could complicate our
calculations in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the public statements of Chinese officials, what is
most likely to provoke an expansion of their nuclear forces is a
decision by the United States to deploy antimissile defenses around
the American mainland and around Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.
China's objections to the proposed missile shields have become more
vociferous in recent months, including during Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to Beijing a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a January speech in Washington, China's senior arms control
official, Sha Zukang, warned in so many words that if it erects a
missile defense, the United States would force China to further
upgrade its intercontinental nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a country, in addition to its offensive power, seeks to
develop advanced theater missile defense or even national missile
defense,'' Sha said, then ``other countries will be forced to
develop more advanced offensive missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give rise to a new arms race,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As early as 1946, a year after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima
and in the midst of the civil war between the Communists and the
Nationalists, Mao professed to be unimpressed by America's new
nuclear arsenal. He reportedly called the United States a ``paper
tiger'' that could not stand up to China in a ``people's war.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, after America threatened to use nuclear weapons
during the Korean War and after several confrontations over Taiwan
that revealed the magnitude of China's disadvantage, Mao's tone
changed. ``In today's world,'' he said in 1956, ``if we don't want
to be bullied by others, we should have the atomic bomb by all
means.''
</P>
<P>
   China's progress in developing nuclear weapons was rapid. In the
1950s the Soviets helped the Chinese establish nuclear production
installations. In 1964, after Beijing's split with Moscow, China
exploded its first atomic bomb. In 1966 it first tested a
nuclear-tipped missile, and in 1967 it tested its first
thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But from the beginning, China insisted that its strategy was far
different from that of the two superpowers. China pledged that it
would never be the first in a fight to go nuclear, and said it
supported total global nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   It was good propaganda, but it also fit China's limited
capabilities. At the same time Beijing was slowly continuing to
invest in its nuclear fleet, and in 1983 Deng Xiaoping, then
China's paramount leader, said, ``We must have what others have,
and anyone who wants to destroy us will be subject to
retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   A variety of missiles _ named the Dong Feng, or East Wind _ were
developed and deployed over the 1970s and 1980s. Many of those were
later sold to other nations, starting a decade of tensions with
Washington over proliferation. Bomb tests, initially above ground
and then below, accelerated into the 1990s, including tests on
smaller-size warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence gathered from one of these last tests, conducted
just before China signed the treaty that bans underground testing
in 1996, led the American agencies to suspect that China had
obtained the W-88, and started the search for a spy at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, with the introduction of a new generation
of long-range ballistic missiles, China's nuclear weapons have been
capable of reaching the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   China has deployed five to seven of its longest-range missiles,
called the DF-5, that can hit virtually any part of the United
States. An additional dozen or so missiles, the DF-4, can reach the
West Coast. Neither is a precision weapon, but precision is not the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the strategy used by the Soviet Union and the
United States, the key to China's nuclear doctrine has been what
Western experts call a minimum deterrent _ the ability, after a
major attack by a nuclear adversary, to launch at least one or two
missiles that could destroy a major city. China's hope was that it
had enough nuclear weapons so that in a confrontation with either
the old Soviet Union or with the United States, neither country
could rattle the nuclear saber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese realized that the whole approach taken by the
Soviets and the United States was an extraordinary waste of
money,'' said Joseph Nye, the dean of the Kennedy School of
government at Harvard and a former senior Defense Department and
intelligence official. ``Their view is that as long as they have a
few invulnerable weapons, they have all they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Godwin, a leading expert on Chinese nuclear forces who
recently left the National War College, puts it simply: ``This is
not an offensive force.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese clearly worry that their force is increasingly
vulnerable. The missiles are still in fixed sites, and because they
use liquid fuel that must be stored outside the rocket, it takes an
hour or more to fire a missile. Moreover, China has only one
nuclear-equipped submarine, with 12 missiles that have a range of
1,100 miles. But the sub's seaworthiness has long been doubted by
intelligence experts, and it does not threaten the American
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of China's nuclear arsenal is composed of medium-range
and short-range missiles, deployed in fixed silos in sites around
the Chinese countryside, that could reach most corners of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the United States now has about 7,000 nuclear
warheads deployed atop land- and submarine-based missiles, as well
as weapons carried by bombers.
</P>
<P>
   China has been developing a new generation of long-range
missiles, called the DF-41, which will be mobile and powered by
solid fuel _ eliminating the two major vulnerabilities of the older
models. Western experts expect the conversion to take place by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether China also plans to multiply its
power by placing multiple warheads atop its missiles _ something
made easier with small warheads like the miniaturized W-88 design,
although most experts believe that the Chinese were also developing
and testing their own small warheads in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that they have been pursuing this for some
time,'' said Jonathan Pollack, a military expert at the Rand
Corporation in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't believe that American intelligence services
believe they have an operational capability,'' he added, referring
to the ability to field weapons bearing multiple warheads.
</P>
<P>
   That is at the heart of Washington's concerns about China's
search for Western technology. The primary reason the Clinton
administration blocked the sale of a Hughes Electronics
communications satellite to a Chinese-run consortium last month was
the fear that China, as it learned how to place the satellite in
precise orbit, would also learn techniques that could aid it in the
tricky business of accurately releasing warheads from a missile.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese military journals, some theorists have discussed
expanding China's nuclear capabilities to deter their rivals' more
powerful conventional weapons, giving China the option to launch
``warning strikes'' in a severe crisis or to overwhelm new,
Western-designed missile defenses.

   ``All this suggests that China's decision makers may be
increasingly uncertain about the credibility and reliability of
their past minimum deterrence and believe a more well-rounded and
reliable nuclear war-fighting capability has military value,''
Michael D. Swaine and Alastair Iain Johnston, two leading China
scholars, wrote in a study published this month by the Council on
Foreign Relations. Other experts warn that there is no evidence
that China's leaders have decided to follow this new route.
</P>
<P>
   Whether China decides on a major expansion of forces could
depend on the growing push in the United States, Japan and perhaps
Taiwan to develop a ``theater missile defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is ostensibly designed to protect American bases in
Asia from North Korea. But China views the system as a threat to
its own forces. It particularly condemns talk of extending the
defense to Taiwan, because it would blunt China's ability to
intimidate the island, overtly tie American forces to the defense
of Taiwan and encourage the island's pro-independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether China's threats to respond to a theater
missile defense system are a bluff. But last week, China's foreign
minister, Tang Jiaxuan, issued his strongest warning yet. Any
effort to include Taiwan in the system, he said, ``would amount to
an encroachment on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.''

IT'S CINDERELLA'S BALL IN NCAA TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Cinderella's pumpkin coach is a little crowded this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in NCAA Tournament history, five teams with
double-digit seeds have reached the Sweet 16. Before this season,
three double-digit seeds had survived to the second weekend four
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of uncharted waters for me,'' said Oklahoma coach
Kelvin Sampson, who had been 0-5 in the NCAA Tournament before his
team's two victories in the Midwest Region. ``I normally get up
here to talk about why we won or why we lost, but that's
inappropriate now. We're going to the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners, the No. 13 seed in the Midwest, are the longest
shot still playing. Miami of Ohio, led by Wally Szczerbiak, is a
No. 10 seed in the Midwest. In the East, No. 12 Southwest Missouri
State and No. 10 Purdue are still playing. And in the West, No. 10
Gonzaga is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a fluke situation for our team,'' Gonzaga coach
Don Monson said. ``Our kids believed they were going to win that
game \Ran 82-74 victory Saturday over second-seeded Stanford\S. ...
We haven't gone into a game this season where our kids didn't think
they were going to win. And that's a really hard mentality to get
in when it says Gonzaga on your jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The lower-seeded team has won 19 of the 48 games played. The
South is the only region that has followed form; the four top seeds
have all advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma is the only Big 12 Conference team still standing; all
three Western Athletic Conference teams are finished. Defending
champion Kentucky, which disposed of Kansas yesterday in overtime,
is the only Final Four team from last year still playing. The Big
Ten Conference has four teams in the Sweet 16, most for any league.
</P>
<P>
   For the surprise teams, those double-digit seeds, the next step
is the longest. Last year, Valparaiso (No. 13), Washington (No. 11)
and West Virginia (No. 10) all lost regional semifinals. The
lowest-seeded team to win the national championship was No. 8
Villanova in 1985. The lowest seed to reach the Final Four was No.
11 Louisiana State in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State probably has the toughest assignment,
facing championship favorite Duke in the East Regional semifinals
Friday. The Bears held their two NCAA opponents to a combined 83
points; the Blue Devils, winners of 28 in a row, beat their two
opponents by a combined 82 points.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Alford's team figures to be a huge underdog, but his
players appear to have things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to take it seriously, be happy that we're
there,'' senior center Danny Moore said. ``We need to be happy that
we've made the Sweet 16, the first time that's ever happened at our
school. Try to win, but if you lose, you've still had a great
year.''
</P>
<P>
   A year, they hope, where midnight has yet to strike.

STARS LIKE THIS DRAW WITH DESPERATE FLYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Unlike the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield brawl
the night before, this was a good tie.
</P>
<P>
   Led by captain Derian Hatcher, who stood his ground in an
opening-minute fight with Philadelphia Flyers captain Eric Lindros,
the Stars forged a 1-1 tie with the Flyers last night, before
19,656 at the First Union Center and a national television audience
on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   With the tie, the Stars extended the Flyers' winless streak to a
franchise-record 11 games (0-7-4) and handled a scrappy team that
had been berated by its owner and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good point overall,'' said goalie Ed Belfour, who
stopped 26 shots in moving his record to 30-10-9. ``They worked
really hard and you can tell they're desperate for a win.
Fortunately, we played good defensively and held them off the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that was because of Hatcher, who drew the assignment of
checking Lindros, the league's second-leading scorer. While Hatcher
and defensive mate Richard Matvichuk were successful in holding off
Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya (third and fifth in the league in
scoring) during the Stars' 4-0 victory on Friday, this was clearly
more a battle of man-on-man.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was asked to basically carry the load for the Stars in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guy was a machine,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said of the
battle of captains. ``He just absolutely loves this type of game.
The nastier, the uglier, the better. He had a field day today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher answered the bell 40 seconds into the game when Lindros
went right after him and challenged him to a fight. The two
heavyweights wrestled for position and each got one or two punches
in before heading off the ice for five minutes in the penalty box.
Hatcher called the fight a draw, but the truth was it showed the
Stars would not be pushed around by the much larger Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what he was doing, he came right at me,'' Hatcher said
of Lindros' attempt to inspire his teammates. ``Tonight,
Philadelphia dragged us into the battle, and we had a chance to
play well or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars played well, and Hatcher was magnificent. He played
just about every second Lindros was on the ice and held him to four
harmless shots. With Lindros' linemate John LeClair out with a hip
injury, the Flyers had little else in the offensive department.
Their second line of Rod Brind'Amour, Jody Hull and Colin Forbes
provided energy. But for the second consecutive game, the Stars
shut down a talented offensive team and proved a league-best 1.99
goals-against average is well-deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, so is the Stars' 42-12-11 record and 95 points _ 19
points better than second-place Colorado in the West and 11 points
better than the Eastern Conference-leading Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a great year,'' Flyers coach Roger Neilson said.
``A tie against Dallas is a good tie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took the lead in the second period when they wore down
the Flyers on successive shifts, which resulted in Mike Modano's
30th goal of the season. Modano, Jere Lehtinen and Jamie
Langenbrunner had to scrap for every inch of ice they could get,
and Modano fed Lehtinen in the slot for a great scoring chance.
Flyers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck came up with two saves (Lehtinen
also swiped at a rebound) before Modano waded through a pile of
bodies to slap in the game's first goal at the 3:51 mark of the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   The line of Mike Keane, Grant Marshall and Tony Hrkac helped set
up that goal by wearing down the Flyers on the previous shift. It
was part of a team effort that had Hitchcock relying on all six
defensemen and putting a great deal of responsibility on Keane and
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of good players tonight,'' Hitchcock said, ``a
lot of good players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers bounced back and ended Belfour's bid for a second
consecutive shutout when Brind'Amour made a strong move behind the
net and found Hull cutting to the goal. Hull somehow squeezed a
shot past Belfour at the 16:15 mark of the second period, and that
would be all of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Flyers (30-21-17) were pleased with their
effort, despite seeing their winless streak extended. And in the
face of criticism from chairman Ed Snider, who said two days
earlier the Flyers had suffered a ``complete mental collapse,'' and
having had a team meeting with general manager Bob Clarke before
the game, the Flyers said they gave a desperate and solid effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great tie,'' Hull said. ``We're playing the best
team in the league and they play well on the road. For a team that
hasn't won in 11, we'll take every point we can get.''

`CHARACTER' DESCRIBES CHANEY TO A `T` 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The story is a dozen years old and gets some
embellishment each time it's told.
</P>
<P>
   John Chaney is part of a daily pickup game among the athletic
staff. Guarding Chaney is Temple assistant women's basketball coach
Fran O'Hanlon, now the men's coach at Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Like most contests involving Temple basketball and Chaney, this
is a physical confrontation of the highest competitive order.
O'Hanlon, almost three decades younger, is all over Chaney, who was
a first-rate player in the old Eastern League.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney looks and looks. He cannot find an open man. ``Time
out,'' he bellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``TIME OUT?'' says O'Hanlon. ``You can't call time out in a
pickup game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My gym,'' says Chaney, not backing off an inch and revealing
the competitive side of the man who has become, in the words of
Kansas coach Roy Williams, ``truly a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend is winding down his career now. Oh, nothing is
imminent, unless Temple defies the odds, gets past Purdue on Friday
and wins the NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner, rather than later, which, for a man of 67, would
make sense. Unless, of course, you're talking about Chaney, still a
lion even in the winter of a career in which substance has always
meant more than style.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Chaney's latest group of players to talk about his ``tough''
love style, which includes in-your-face 5 a.m. practice sessions
that teach his players more than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not mentally tough,'' said guard Quincy Wadley,
``you're definitely going to fold. But there's nothing that I
wouldn't do for the man. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney feels the same way about his players, about friends who
have hovered around his program ever since he came to Temple 17
years ago after a 10-year stint at Cheyney State in suburban
Philadelphia, where he won a Division 2 national championship in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Chaney seems like Don Quixote tilting at windmills
when he takes on the NCAA over its academic admissions requirements
regarding test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Other times he goes way over the line, as he did when he turned
a postgame press conference after a loss to the University of
Massachusetts into a national incident when he threatened to
``kill'' former UMass coach John Calipari, words that Chaney now
says he deeply regrets.
</P>
<P>
   But that is Chaney: white dress shirt, tie loosened, a pained
expression that increases whenever one of his players does
something needlessly, like commit a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way he's always been, seeking perfection in a world
filled with imperfections. He was that way back at Cheyney State,
when he did everything from coach, to tape ankles, to make
breakfast for his team. Once he whipped up some eggs, which turned
green because of some imperfections in the cleaning of the frying
pan. No problem, said John-I-Am: he convinced his team that there
was such a thing as green eggs and ham and that wondrous things
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Some have. This winter, he passed the 600-victory milestone. He
was nominated to the Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   His teams, whether you like them or hate them, generally always
play hard, most notably on defense, where Temple's matchup zone can
frustrate the best of teams into the worst of games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, somebody from Cincinnati asked Chaney what was the
biggest mistake teams make in trying to solve the matchup zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a mystery out of BS,'' said Chaney in a
self-deprecating manner.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, most of it has worked over the years. Players come and
go and Chaney remains, fixed in his ways, irascible, controversial,
always looking for an edge, always seeking perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The players that have gone through the program still come back,
still remember. When Temple's new state-of-the-art arena, the Forum
at The Apollo of Temple, opened in 1997, a group of ex-Owls who had
gone on to the NBA decided to make their own contribution, chipping
in to buy a skybox that Chaney's family can use as often as it
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to Chaney cannot tell you when he will finally
decide he has had enough. Some say it will come when he keels over
on the bench, others say in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney has endured more than a modicum of tragedy in the past
few years, ranging from the murder of the son of close friend and
Temple alum Bill Cosby to the death of his longtime assistant and
best friend Jim Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   The past few years have aged him, but they have also added more
character to a man who some people swear has cornered the market on
the trait.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as usual, John Chaney transferred enough of that
character to his players that they played a near-perfect basketball
game in upsetting Cincinnati, 64-54.

TEMPLE'S SANCHEZ GETS THE POINT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The only job more challenging than being a point guard
for John Chaney is being a personal lawyer for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The task is close to thankless. You are working for a man who is
abnormally obsessed with the position, a man who believes that
without a quality point guard life has just about no meaning.
Truly. Now imagine being a young basketball player who not only has
to play a tough position for a completely demanding man, but who
also must learn what to do while living in an alien culture.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say hello to Juan ``Pepe'' Sanchez, late of
Bahia Blanca, Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Temple advanced to the NCAA East Regional semifinals in the
Meadowlands next weekend via a surprising 64-54 conquest of
Cincinnati Sunday at the FleetCenter. Lamont Barnes did a wonderful
job inside with 16 points and eight rebounds. Invaluable sixth man
Quincy Wadley provided 14 desperately needed points off the bench.
But no one was more responsible for Temple's triumphs over Kent and
Cincinnati than the junior point guard, who followed his 15-point,
9-assist, zero-turnover performance against Kent with a 14-point,
seven-rebound display against Cincinnati, not that numbers can ever
convey the value of a good point guard's game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Pepe's basketball background adequately prepared him
for being a John Chaney point guard. How could it? There are no
John Chaneys in Argentina, where basketball, while a popular sport,
is regarded as something more of an art form than a science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball in Argentina is happy basketball,'' explains
Sanchez. ``The one who scores the points or makes a fancy pass gets
all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no point guards, as such, back home. There are guards,
sure, and they have skills. Juan Espil is a very nice player. But
he's not a point guard, because no one wants any.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's score, score, score, score, and then run down the court
and score some more,'' says Temple assistant coach Nate Blackwell,
who likewise played point guard for John Chaney and, unlike many,
actually lived to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   John Chaney isn't interested in helter-skelter point guards. He
wants point guards who understand what it means to control tempo
and get the ball to the right people at the right time and who can
control the game from a defensive standpoint. Having a
keep-'em-honest outside shot is a plus, and it certainly helps if
the point guard makes his free throws. Most of all, he wants a
point guard who agrees with the coach that losing the basketball
via a turnover is, as Chaney says, ``like giving all your money to
a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a point guard for John Chaney is like pledging to the
Frat From Hell. Initiation starts on Day 1 and ends only when you
peel off that cherry-and-white uniform for the final time. ``He's
got to be able to handle the wrath of John Chaney,'' says
Blackwell, who was as classic a Temple point guard as Chaney has
ever had. ``It hasn't been easy for Pepe. There was a communication
problem, and sometimes there still is. But Pepe has really
matured.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, the 6-foot-1-inch southpaw is a cross between Dave
Wohl and Sarunas Marciulionis. He never loses his dribble, and he
never goes anywhere in a straight line if he can help it. He seems
to be thinking 20 seconds ahead of the play, and he never, ever
panics. His patience on offense is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The quintessential Pepe sequence came with the Owls leading,
47-35, with 7:18 remaining. Temple had the basketball out of bounds
underneath its basket. Cincinnati applied strong defensive
pressure, and Pepe called time out. He was handed the ball for a
second time, and, after surveying the situation, he called for
another 20-second timeout. Pepe knew that Coach Chaney would much
prefer that he whip out a Swiss Army knife from underneath his
jersey, slice the basketball in two, and ingest it rather than
throw a questionable inbounds pass.
</P>
<P>
   On his third try, Pepe did get the ball in play. He got it back,
and then dribbled and dribbled and dribbled some more, until he
spied Rasheed Brokenborough making a move out of the right corner.
Pepe slipped him the ball with a backhand pass, and Brokenborough
slashed to the hoop for a nice little running lefty hook. That
would be Temple's final basket of the game. The final 15 points
came on the free throw line, 7 of them supplied by Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepe Sanchez who arrived at the North Philadelphia campus
two years ago could not have made that play. ``The American game
has a timing to it,'' points out Temple assistant coach Dean
Demopoulos, ``and foreign players have trouble with it, especially
point guards. People who know him from Argentina say the adjustment
he's made has been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not understand the American game when I got here,''
Sanchez acknowledges. ``You have to give a lot of credit to the
coach. He taught me to be patient and to understand my role. Back
home, there are no roles. You shoot the ball, pass the ball, do
whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sanchez had good inherent defensive ability when he
arrived, he had no concept of the American game in that area,
either. ``He had to learn that you can take a gamble but it must be
a calculated gamble,'' says Blackwell. ``It can't be 50-50. It's
got to be at least 75-25.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple basically has no backup for Pepe Sanchez. The only thing
that gets him out of a Temple game is foul trouble. He got his
third personal with 12:59 remaining, and Chaney was distraught. He
kept him out for the next 2:45. He just couldn't stand it any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pepe is not in the game,'' Chaney explains, ``everything
is wrong. You need somebody in control of the train.''
</P>
<P>
   That little choo-choo is heading to the Sweet 16, and it
wouldn't be going there without Pepe Sanchez. And don't think
they're not grateful. ``It's a two-way street,'' says Demopolous.
``Pepe stuck with us. There were some rocky times for him, but he
hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Chaney tells a million stories, and now he's got another
one. He's got an Argentine point guard. He can tell people he's got
America's greatest Argentine import since Rita Hayworth.

TELL ME AGAIN WHO GAINS FROM ORIOLES' CUBAN TRIP

<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Please tell me again, somebody, why the
Baltimore Orioles going to Havana to play the Cuban national
baseball team is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Explain, if you will, how this is the reincarnation of
``ping-pong diplomacy'' and how Peter Angelos is going to play the
part of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it stinks,'' Rangers pitcher Tony Fossas said yesterday.
``If the United States has an embargo against Cuba, how can you go
there and play baseball?''
</P>
<P>
   Lefty reliever Fossas, 41, was born in Cuba and lived there
until age 10. First baseman Rafael Palmeiro, born in Havana, is
equally adamant about not playing.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons are political, but they are also deeply personal.
</P>
<P>
   They know. They have relatives in Cuba. They send those
relatives money, clothing, tissue paper, toothpaste _ some of the
necessities of life that are in unkindly short supply in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And now commissioner Bud Selig is sending them baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   A bad idea, born perhaps of noble intentions. But a dangerous
idea nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Before you begin that trite whine about politics and sports not
mixing, let me interrupt you. You don't know Cuba. You probably
have never seen Cuban athletes in action in person or been forced
to mingle with a Cuban delegation at a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   To these people, sports is politics and politics is sports. The
1959 revolution is a benchmark. To me, they seem incapable of
separating a pennant race from a testimonial to Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Ind., in 1987, I saw
Cuban boxers leave their spectator seats to go over and pummel an
anti-Castro protester. I saw a Cuban TV interviewer bring a
heavyweight U.S. wrestler, a Cuban defector, to real tears by
peppering him with ``reminders'' about the brothers, sisters,
aunts, cousins and loved ones that he'd never see again.
</P>
<P>
   At the Summer Olympics, Cuban athletes do not often speak to the
non-Cuban media. A question shouted in English invariably draws a
cold stare. Typically, the Cuban delegation sends its coaches to
meet any Olympic post-event interview requirements. Those coaches
are fluent in Castro-ese.
</P>
<P>
   We hear only what they want us to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the athletes at all,'' Fossas said on a rainy
day in the Rangers' clubhouse. ``You mention the word `programmed.'
When your life is in jeopardy, when you have families leaving a
country in rowboats, leaving a country in tires, living in a system
where everything your family had was stolen, living in a country
where you have no medicine, very little food, and you're expected
to live on $12 a month, and then, because you're an athlete who
maybe has been taken care of a little bit better, you don't say
anything _ how is that not `programmed?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fossas' point is eloquently put. In Cuba, sport is politics.
Athletes are not sportsmen _ they are emissaries who happen to play
sports.
</P>
<P>
   I'll say this for the Orioles: they'd better win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't win down there, they will be a laughingstock to
all Latin American nations,'' Fossas said. ``If they want to be
jokes, go down there with a team of A-ball guys, because those guys
\Rthe Cubans\S are going to be ready to play. You can bet they are
practicing day and night for this. Their whole lives will revolve
around that one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Please tell me again, somebody, what the Orioles have to gain by
this. It can't be the T-shirts, because the Cuban people can't
afford them. It can't be the gate receipts, because the Cuban peso
is only slightly more valuable than Monopoly money.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said, ``If this generates the kind of results we hope it
will, it could well be the start of something. Something
constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like, stealing more Cuban baseball players?
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Angelos actually told The Washington Post last
week, ``There is no political dimension to this visit.''
</P>
<P>
   If he really said that, his naivete is surpassed only by his
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is one neighborhood where the proverbial brotherhood of
sports is out of bounds. There are human rights issues that cannot
be ignored. There are good people _ some of them now American
citizens _ who are going to be terribly offended by the Orioles'
visit.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Castro is alive, it all has a political dimension in
Cuba, amigo. The Orioles are stepping into something that they are
ill-equipped to handle.
</P>
<P>
   They could be making history, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Another victory for the Castro revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody tell me, please, how this one is going to put food in
the Cuban people's mouths.

CELTICS CAN'T KEEP UP THE PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The game itself was not the problem. If you lived
in San Antonio, Chicago or New York and watched Celtics-Pacers on
NBC Sunday, you definitely wouldn't have channel surfed. You might
have even said to yourself, ``That game was great.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is more likely that you are a New Englander, not a Texan,
Midwesterner or frequent patron of the George Washington Bridge.
And chances are that the Pacers' 99-96 win over the Celtics at
Market Square Arena had you saying things to yourself, with ``great
game'' not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino stood in a hallway and said the Celtics played their
best game of the year. Larry Bird stood in another hallway and said
the Celtics ``manhandled'' his Pacers. ``Boston was hungry today,''
the Legend said. ``They came after us. They were aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, again, words were the Celtics' consolation prize. Because
for the fifth consecutive game and seventh time in eight March
games, they couldn't get what they needed. A win.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they weren't close. Dana Barros took a
3-pointer just before the final buzzer that could have sent the
game into overtime. Paul Pierce (15 points), playing his first game
in five days, followed an old-fashioned 3-point play with a free
throw that put the Celtics up, 94-91, with three minutes to play.
Antoine Walker had a layup blocked by Antonio Davis with 10.8
seconds left. The Celtics trailed, 98-96, at the time, and if the
shot had gone in this might be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is a remix of a familiar story and familiar
headline. Celtics Lose . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple options on that last play, but that was
basically what we wanted,'' Barros said of his stright-on 3-point
attempt, about 25 feet from the hoop. ``But, you know, it shouldn't
even have come to that. We've had leads in games, man. I'm talking
about double-digit leads. And we're not holding on to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is the part of the story where you will be able to
determine which way you lean in the land of NBA politics. You may
be like Barros. You may feel that a 10-point lead (88-78) with 6:39
remaining in a game should result in your team winning. You may
tell yourself that it doesn't make a difference if the game is on
the road or at home; against the one-win Clippers or 15-win Pacers.
A 10-point lead late should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you are like others, people who tell you that a young
team will do such things against a veteran team. They tell you that
the Pacers have Reggie Miller, a man who can make a substantial
lead disappear in seconds, as he did many times against the Knicks.
Or, for a more recent reference, Sunday against the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't beat themselves,'' Pitino said of the Pacers. This
is why he said it:
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a 10-point lead, the Celtics watched Rik Smits (28
points) put in a short hook shot. The lead was 8. That's when Kenny
Anderson saw Walker under the hoop, free for a layup. The point
guard laced a terrific pass; the forward missed the layup. Miller
made a jump shot. And then he hit a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Timeout, Celtics. You mentioned a 10-point lead? No such thing.
The lead was 3, 88-85. The Celtics were ahead. And in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bird talked before the game about how his team worked out
together during the lockout. This bunch is very close. They hang
out together, work out together, and even do a corny pregame
introduction routine together. They don't get down on each other
when they are down by 10 together, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're going to need right now,'' Anderson said.
``We can't allow ourselves to fall apart. We're slumping, we're on
a five-game losing streak. It's easy to start doubting each other
in a situation like this. We can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pierce had given them their 3-point lead, the Celtics
quickly lost it when Travis Best made a wide-open 3-pointer. Smits
followed with an 18-footer, Walker answered with a layup to tie it
at 96, and Smits came back with a 14-footer.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were done scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Walker got open in the lane with about 12 seconds left and
appeared set for an easy layup. Davis knocked the ball away the
right way: He stopped his man from scoring and the ball wound up in
the hands of a teammate (Best).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great block,'' said Walker, who led the Celtics with
16 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists. ``I didn't know where he came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Best was immediately fouled, but made only one free throw, which
meant the Celtics still had a chance with 5.8 seconds left. Barros
got free and his long shot went up . . . and off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a better team now than we were at the beginning of the
trip,'' Pitino said. He may be right. But there is not one win in
the last five games to support his statement.

PURDUE SHOCKS MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They came into the tournament through a back door, a
10th-seeded team that few people expected to be playing past the
first round and lots of people didn't think should have been part
of the 64-team NCAA field at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the Purdue Boilermakers, who finished 7-9 in the Big Ten and
staggered into the NCAA Tournmament with five losses in their last
six games, reaching the Sweet 16?
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Purdue forward Brian Cardinal what he would have
said a week ago if he had been told he was going to the Sweet 16.
``I'd want to know where my seat (in the stands) would be,'' said
Cardinal with a laugh following the Boilermakers' improbable but
convincing 73-63 win over No. 2 seed Miami Sunday at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cardinal and the rest of the Boilermakers will have the best
seat in the house Friday night at the Meadowlands when they face
Temple in an East Regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anything to lose,'' said Cardinal, who scored a
game-high 20 points, including a crucial 5-point spurt in the
second half after Miami had made its final push. ``People didn't
think we should have been in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers (21-12) had earned their way into Sunday's game
with a tough 58-54 win over Texas on Friday night. But the
conventional wisdom seemed to be that Miami (23-7), a rising power
in the Big East, would be a little too quick, too athletic for
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 13 minutes, the sellout FleetCenter crowd of
18,913 saw a game that gave no indication of the final outcome. The
score was tied, 17-17, when Miami forgot how to score, how to
shoot, how to play defense. Pick your negative.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line was that the Hurricanes didn't score a point the
rest of the half, while Purdue went on a 15-0 spree that was more a
slow jog than a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the key to the game,'' said Purdue coach
Gene Keady, who could only watch in amazement as his team pulled
steadily ahead without doing anything spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers sometimes don't give true indications of the course of a
game, but the first-half statistics were a chilling warning for
Hurricane fans. Miami, despite an overwhelming advantage (13-2) in
offensive rebounds, had shot a miserable 6 of 33 (18.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Even more disheartening for the 'Canes was their 3-point
production _ or lack of it. Forward Johnny Hemsley, who had poured
in nine 3-point shots in Miami's 75-54 opening-round victory over
Lafayette, had problems simply getting off a shot from 3-point
land, much less making one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to face-guard Johnny,'' said Miami
coach Leonard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   He had a remedy prepared: Get the ball inside. But that wasn't
working either. ``My biggest surprise was to have 13 offensive
rebounds and shoot only 18 percent,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Canes knew they were too good a team to put two halves that
bad together in one game.
</P>
<P>
   During intermission, Hamilton told his team not to panic in the
remaining 20 minutes but to speed the pace as much as it could.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by as many as 16 with 16:30 left, the
'Canes finally got into the tempo they wanted. In a six-minute
stretch they shaved the lead to 5 _ guard Vernon Jennings put in a
layup with 11:06 left to make it 43-38.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of situation that the 'Canes had thrived on all
through a regular season in which they finished second in the Big
East to Connecticut while leading the conference in shooting
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, sensing that perhaps it was finally going to see the
kind of competitive, down-to-the-final-buzzer game that fans at
other NCAA venues around the country had seen, began picking up the
Miami cause a little more.
</P>
<P>
   But in an eight-second span it ended, as Cardinal put in a
21-foot 3-pointer, then converted a layup following a steal by Mike
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the lead was back to 10 and the 'Canes had nothing
left. Or not enough left to overcome the steadiness of Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Or the quirkiness of Miami, which took twice as many shots as
the Boilermakers, outrebounded them, 45-29, and still lost badly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain that, Keady said, ``Thirty-seven free throws,
fewer turnovers, and stopping their best players from getting their
normal scoring average.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers did all of that, particularly stopping Hemsley,
who managed to get off only two 3-point shots and didn't make any.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has put the Boilermakers in the Sweet 16, much to
even their own surprise.

SNOWSTORM PICKS ITS WAY ALONG THE NORTHEAST COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Kan., Ohio, Mo., N.Y.)  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A huge storm that dumped more than a foot of snow
on parts of the Plains states over the weekend reached the East
Sunday and threatened to bring snow to a 75-mile-wide band from
Washington to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists said Sunday night, however, that the snow might
just as likely turn out to be rain, depending on the track that the
storm took and air temperatures. ``It's a real tough call,'' said
Paul Knight, a meteorologist at Penn State Weather Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, it was raining in Washington and New York City but
snowing in many places in between. More than an inch of snow had
fallen in Baltimore and Philadelphia by Sunday evening, while areas
of western Maryland had three to six inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Another Penn State meteorologist, Joe Koval, said that while he
expected New York City to get a combination of rain and snow, the
suburbs to the west and north could get a substantial amount of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Koval said that 10 to 12 inches of snow could fall in
Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam Counties as well as up to
6 inches in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Koval said heavy snow was expected in higher elevations in
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a bizarre storm,'' Knight said. ``It has gone in a
75-mile band from southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma, across
southern Missouri and up the Ohio River, snowing very hard in
Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight said 22 inches of snow fell over the weekend in parts of
southern Missouri, and The Associated Press reported that hundreds
of travelers spent Saturday night jammed into motels and community
shelters because of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   A 115-mile-long stretch of Interstate 70 from Wakeeney, Kan.,
west to the Colorado state line that had been closed by the storm
was reopened Sunday but remained snow-packed and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 travelers spent the night in Colby, Kan., filling
shelters set up by the Red Cross and the National Guard Armory.
Hundreds more spent the night in Limon, Colo., because I-70 was
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Signs posted at Salina and Hays had warned travelers that no
motel rooms were available in western Kansas. The Comfort Inn in
Colby ran out of rooms but offered lobby floor space to stranded
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the travelers was Joe Day, an amateur boxer heading back
to Houston from a match in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the breakfast room, laying on the floor watching
tapes of us getting beat up,'' Day said of himself and his
teammates. ``It's real fun.''

NO COMPENSATION FOR EDWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Patriots will not receive any compensation for the
loss to injury of Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Robert Kraft tried to convince his peers at the annual
owners meeting that New England should get a first-round pick after
the running back was injured in an NFL-sponsored Pro Bowl event
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the Patriots' first-round pick last year, suffered a
knee injury that appears to be career-ending during a spill in a
rookie beach football game.
</P>
<P>
   However, although the league sympathizes with the Patriots'
tough luck, reportedly there will be no compensation. Instead, the
league is studying a proposal to pay an injured player a full
year's salary if the injury occurs in a league-sponsored event.
That has not been voted on yet.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, the new Washington Redskins ownership group
will have a hard time getting voted in Monday. The group, headed by
New Yorker Howard Milstein, met with the league's finance committee
Saturday and it did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   The league had informed Milstein more than a week ago that his
financial package was too highly leveraged. He was told to put more
cash into the deal. Milstein reportedly presented a revised deal
Saturday, but it was not what the NFL had suggested. One league
executive said that if the financing wasn't reworked before the
vote, Milstein faced a difficult task getting the necessary 24
votes for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also put off to Tuesday or Wednesday an announcement on
the awarding of its 32d franchise. Los Angeles will get the nod,
but there will be some strings attached. The NFL will ask that
certain things be accomplished in terms of a new stadium, within a
time limit.

WORLDS OF PAIN FOR US WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPOO, Finland _ This time, it was Team USA that stood
dejectedly at center ice, forced to watch its rivals celebrate.
This time, the locker-room tears were those of sadness. This time,
it was different yet oh-so-familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The US may have an Olympic hockey gold medal, but Canada is
still No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 seconds into the third period in Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's final
of the Women's World Championship, with the game tied, 1-1,
Canadian defenseman Hayley Wickenheiser fired a power-play missile
from the blue line that ricocheted off the stick of Danielle
Goyette, sending the puck flying one way as US goaltender Erin
Whitten went another.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of the US women's national team winning its first world
championship went flying off with that goal. The Americans never
recovered and Canada went on to win, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got that goal, they really turned it up a notch,''
said US coach Ben Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Turning it up a notch in the gold-medal game of the world
championships is nothing new for Canada, which has won all five
dating back to 1990, each time at the expense of the US. And being
in the net when the Canadians toss their gloves heavenward in joy
at the final buzzer is nothing new to Whitten, either: She has been
the losing goaltender in every gold-medal loss since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's loss was especially painful to Whitten and her
teammates, because the 27-year-old veteran who narrowly missed
making the 1998 Olympic team played heroically, keeping her
struggling teammates in the game until the end with 27 saves.
``This might be the best game against Canada I've seen her play,''
said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Cammi Granato, the team's captain, agreed. ``Erin came in and
played her heart out; we just didn't put the puck in the net,''
said Granato, who has played on every US world championship team
since the tournament began. ``The chances we had, we didn't bury.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played tentatively in the first period. The closest
the US came to scoring was when Katie King, the left wing from
Salem, N.H., went head-to-head with a defender and landed one on
the roof of the net with 33 seconds left. But Canada was no more
forceful, and the period ended scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Schmidgall, the Minnesota Gopher who led all scorers in
the tournament and was named the top forward, rung up her fifth
goal 9:09 into the second period, giving the US a 1-0 lead when she
came across from right to left and angled the puck around Sami Jo
Small, the Canadian goalie who plays on the men's varsity team at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead failed to ignite the sluggish US, and less than
three minutes later Caroline Ouellette evened the score at 1-1
when, during a barrage of shots, she managed to barely sneak the
puck over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The period ended ominously for the US when, with 34 seconds
left, left wing Tricia Dunn of Derry, N.H., was called for
cross-checking. Just 25 seconds into the third period, Wickenheiser
teed it up, Goyette bounced it in, and Canada led, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's usually the difference when we play (this team),'' said
Smith. ``It's whose power play is clicking, whose penalty kill is
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 2 1/2 minutes after the Wickenheiser-Goyette bomb,
Geraldine Heaney added an unassisted rocket of her own (``I didn't
even see it,'' said Whitten), giving Canada a 3-1 lead and an
immeasurable confidence boost while the US faltered even though its
defense, led by Sue Merz of Greenwich, Conn. (named, with
Schmidgall, to the all-tournament team) and Whitten kept the
Americans close.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't exactly make up for it,'' said Whitten,
struggling to accept a compliment on her play. ``It hurts to have a
silver medal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Team Canada. ``To come out on top is huge for us,''
said Canadian right wing Jayna Hefford. ``I think after the
Olympics, we came back even hungrier. It was a little bit of
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And just another in a great long-running series. ``A year ago I
said I didn't want to play a 16th game,'' said Smith, recalling how
the US and Canada went into the gold-medal game in Nagano tied,
7-7, in their Olympic tuneup matches. ``And here we are.''

OPTIMISM BUSTING OUT OF RED SOX 'PEN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ When Red Sox reliever Jim Corsi wanders
through the locker room at City of Palms Park during spring
training, his message is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are always talking to the starters,'' he says. ``You
never want to talk to the guys in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, of course, as in the spring the starters finish
early, meet with the media, and go home. Bullpen regulars like
Corsi are lucky to get in an inning of work, and what they do
rarely rates a high five, much less an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing all right,'' said Corsi when finally asked Sunday
about his progress and that of the rest of the bullpen. ``Everybody
is throwing the ball good. As long as we stay healthy, we'll be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest tasks of the spring is to find a replacement
for Dennis Eckersley, who in the final year of his Hall of Fame
career last season pitched in 50 games, mostly as a setup man, and
had a 4-1 record with a save and a 4.46 ERA in 39 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Another order of business is to get closer Tom ``Flash'' Gordon
on the mound against live opposition for the first time this spring
and get him going.
</P>
<P>
   Then the brass must figure out how to utilize the rest of the
pen in order to get to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers for the middle relief/setup role include Corsi, Derek
Lowe, John Wasdin, and lefthander Ron Mahay. On the basis of his
strong showing in Sunday's 8-7 victory over the Cincinnati Reds,
lefthander Mark Guthrie seems a lock. He has the stuff to get
lefthanders and righthanders out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen is looking really good in the early schedule,''
said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``Corsi is right on schedule,
Wasdin is on schedule, Lowe too. Guthrie has really surprised me.
He's been really sharp. He's a guy with a good program, a good
idea. He knows what he's doing on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jimy Williams is quick to say the Sox can no more
``replace'' Eckersley than they can Mo Vaughn. But they're working
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what we can come up with, depending on how many
pitchers we carry,'' said Williams. ``The roster dictates that. It
depends upon how much protection we need for our regulars. How many
bullpen guys and so-called utility guys we need. The flexibility of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be honest and say I'd rather carry 11 (pitchers), but if
they think 12 is the right number, then that's what we carry. One
of the reasons we made some cuts today is that the bullpen has to
pitch more innings. We'd like to see some of these middle guys get
a couple of innings in a game rather than just one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox certainly want to see more of Guthrie, who most recently
pitched out of the Dodgers' bullpen. They like him a lot, and
Kerrigan thinks he can be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like today,'' said Kerrigan, ``he was trying to improve his
breaking ball and make it a little sharper. He threw a nice one to
Hal Morris in the ninth and had an outstanding split-finger
fastball. He's got real good command, like Corsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan pointed out that Corsi was tough last year against
lefthanders (.211). So was Gordon, as lefties hit only .189 against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll find any lefthander who can do better
than that,'' he said. ``We think Lowe has matured and shouldn't
have as much trouble this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is, the Red Sox believe they have several pitchers
who can handle righthanded or lefthanded batters.

RODMAN'S STATUS REMAINS UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Worm Watch '99, interrupted by a brief, nine-game
appearance by Dennis Rodman, has returned as the Los Angeles
Lakers' favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   They watched and waited for three weeks for Rodman to sign, the
anticipation ending with a contract and a nine-game winning streak
with him on the roster. Now he's missing again, with no sign when
he'll return.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman skipped practice Saturday, then informed the team he
would not be joining them on their six-game road trip, at least not
yet. By Sunday, the team was no closer to knowing when or if he'll
be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would be back,'' coach Kurt Rambis said, but for
this six-game road trip, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   Team spokesman John Black indicated the absence was excused _
``You could phrase it that way'' _ and that Rodman was being paid
for Sunday's game. Black said team executives had spoken with
Rodman's agent but he was uncertain whether anyone had spoken to
Rodman himself.
</P>
<P>
   The team is already moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else just has to step up,'' Shaquille O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off Rodman's disappearance, allowing that whatever
``personal business'' Rodman said he had to attend to was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's OK with me,'' O'Neal said, ``but I
ain't got time to worry about things I can't control. It's Kurt's
job to do whatever. ... We'll be fine. We've got J.R. (Reid), we've
got another thug (power forward), we ain't trippin'. We straight.
As long as he (Rodman) is there for the playoffs and the big dance
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis figures if Rodman needs the time off, maybe it's for the
best that he takes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that if players are happy, they're gonna play
better,'' he said. ``Whether they've got business problems or
personal problems, if you can allow them time to get rid of those
problems, they're going to be a lot better off on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want him as a person to feel good about himself,
whatever that takes. Regardless of what he does with us, that's
just the right thing to do.... But basketball-wise, we have jobs to
do. Whether he's here or not here, we still have to go out on the
floor and produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Derek Harper's sprained left ankle, suffered Friday
night, knocked him out of the game, leaving the Lakers with just 10
players in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's status remains day-to-day, but he'll have another two
full days to recuperate before the Lakers play again, Tuesday night
at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Derek is going to be back soon,'' Rambis said.

WORM'S TURN NO SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
 ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sitting in pampered luxury Sunday in a FleetCenter
suite, Garry St. Jean, the general manager of the Golden State
Warriors, had a one-word reaction to the news of Dennis Rodman's
temporarily leaving the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   From his loge seat in the same building, man-of-the-people Chris
Wallace, the general manager of the Celtics, had a similar initial
response.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after catching themselves, both men said basically the
same thing: Why should we be surprised?
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was not with the Lakers as they began a six-game/nine-day
road swing Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in Sacramento, and it began
inauspiciously, LA having its 10-game winning streak snapped,
105-101.
</P>
<P>
   He missed Saturday's practice, leaving with two bodyguards and
no explanation. The Lakers only would confirm that Rodman had taken
an indefinite leave of absence for personal reasons that were not
identified.
</P>
<P>
   This was a classic case of ``Be Careful What You Wish For'' for
the Lakers, and it remains to be seen what, if any, impact it will
have on the young, talented, impressionable team. Rodman had been
displaying some bizarre behavior, even by his wild standards, in
the weeks before signing that had to send out red flags. There was
the on-again, off-again, on-again quickie marriage to Carmen
Electra, the split with agent Dwight Manley, the rambling interview
on ESPN, and the X-rated news conference announcing his intention
to sign with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles general manager Jerry West, who never liked the idea
of bringing in Rodman, was laying low Sunday, probably thinking,
``Na, na, na, na, na, told ya' so.'' Rodman's signing was largely
because of the pushing of owner Jerry Buss; even the players who
originally pushed for Rodman grew tired of the soap opera before
his signing. Then, part owner/icon Earvin Johnson said on ``The
Late Show With David Letterman'' that the move would ``move us down
a notch in class'' if it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, however, that didn't appear to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had not lost since Rodman arrived on Feb. 20 and
Kurt Rambis succeeded Del Harris, taking that 10-game streak into
their game Sunday night. Rodman was averaging 10.3 rebounds a game
and had given the team much-needed toughness in his nine games. He
missed the second half of Friday's game with the Warriors because
of elbow soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was 90 minutes late for Saturday's practice at LA
Southwest College, but did speak briefly with Rambis. He stayed for
about 15 minutes, departing with his bodyguards in his white
Mercedes. He also had missed practice a week ago _ he was excused
from that one for personal reasons _ and already had been late to
one practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was part of the pattern in Chicago, too, and they seemed
to do all right,'' noted Wallace. ``As demonstrated by his track
record, it's part of the package you get. Teams have managed to win
despite the distractions, and I'm sure the Lakers factored that
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, however, are not the Bulls. Chicago had a focus
unlike any other team. The Bulls tolerated Rodman, they fought with
management, they even fought with each other. But they knew how to
win _ they had Michael Jordan and no one else did _ and they won.
The Lakers are in no such position, and even were leaning a bit on
Rodman because of his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about developing a team chemistry, and you knew
there was a history of volatility there,'' St. Jean said. ``You
knew what you were getting into. But I'll say this: I have no idea
what's going on with Rodman, but if anyone can get him back, it's
Jerry West. I don't know if people outside the business understand
how much he is respected in this league. When he speaks, it's like
E.F. Hutton _ you listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss, apparently, is not one of those people. He didn't listen _
and now his team is again in the spotlight, but for all the wrong
reasons. It's his mess to clean up.

MEETING IS EXCELLENT AT SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Trainer Bob Baffert's Kentucky Derby picture
is clouded by his own success.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, his 3-year-old filly owned by John and Betty
Mabee's Golden Eagle Farms, captured the $250,000 Grade I Santa
Anita Oaks on Sunday, holding off a late rush from stablemate Tout
Charmant to win the 1 1/16-mile race by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Exploit and Prime Timber, Excellent Meeting, who has
six victories and three seconds in nine starts, could help provide
Baffert with a good shot at winning a third consecutive Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was in Louisiana on Sunday for the Louisiana Derby.
Another of his hopefuls, General Challenge, finished fifth with
jockey Gary Stevens aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting was coming off a victory in the Grade I Las
Virgenes. Sunday's race, with Kent Desormeaux aboard, likely sets
her up for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Desormeaux must decide whether to stay with Excellent
Meeting or ride Real Quiet, who is scheduled to run the same day in
the Oaklawn Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux wasn't overly concerned with the close outcome in the
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if you look at the race, in the last hundred yards,
she (Excellent Meeting) was holding the other filly (Tout Charmant)
at bay,'' he said. ``I hope nobody gets too concerned out there and
that they don't lose any of their love for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's assistant trainer, Eoin Harty, was a little critical
of Desormeaux's ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kent rode this filly the way he rode Real Quiet last
week (in the New Orleans Handicap at the Fairgrounds) _ with a
little too much confidence,'' Harty said. ``He didn't give any
credit to Tout Charmant, and I knew Tout Charmant had improved a
lot since her last race (second in the Las Virgenes).''

ONLY CONCLUSION TO DRAW: A DAMAGING LOW BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boxing lost Saturday night. So did Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   The final hour of what had been a glorious month for boxing once
again cast a dark shadow over a sport that has shot itself in the
foot so often it's up to its knees in bullet holes because two
judges saw, or claimed to see, something they could not possibly
have seen. They claimed they saw a way for Evander Holyfield to
have retained his two thirds of the heavyweight title. This simply
did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fight was not as lopsided as many are claiming, it
was not a victory or even a draw for Holyfield. Lennox Lewis did
more than retain his third of the title at Madison Square Garden.
He jabbed and occasionally hooked his way to the right to call
himself the undisputed champion, and even those who favored
Holyfield going in could find no way to dispute that coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Although judge Eugenia Williams had Holyfield winning, 115-113,
and Larry O'Connell of Great Britain scored it a 115-115 draw, only
Stanley Christoudoulou seemed to get it right, giving the nod to
Lewis, 116-113. The Globe had Lewis winning, 115-114, with one
round even that in retrospect belonged to Lewis, the second. That
would have made him a 116-114 victor, but regardless how you
tallied the score it always added up to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The rounds he won he dominated with a long, often pawing jab
that stopped Holyfield from getting inside and some powerful right
hands that hurt him in the fifth round and bothered him at other
times, although never in the way one might have expected. With the
exception of the third _ which Holyfield took by trying to
overwhelm Lewis to make good on a prefight promise of a third-round
knockout _ the rounds that went to Holyfield were ones Lewis lost
more than the three-time heavyweight champion won.
</P>
<P>
   After seven rounds, Lewis led on all three cards and rightfully
so. But then, in Rounds 8 through 11, he unwisely chose to do
little or nothing and paid dearly for it. He lost all four rounds
on the judges' cards, and the Globe's as well, not because
Holyfield suddenly overwhelmed him _ as he had so many other
opponents late in a fight _ but simply because Lewis did little
more than pose.
</P>
<P>
   CompuBox's normally reasonable accounting of a fight's punch
stats seemed to go as far off the mark at that point as the judges'
cards did at the end, for they claimed Lewis threw 57, 57, 48, and
32 punches in those rounds and landed 30, 29, 31, and 25. If he
did, they must have been like the famed ``anchor punch'' Muhammad
Ali claimed to have knocked out Sonny Liston with in Maine, the
punch nobody saw but Liston, because Lewis did little but paw with
his left hand through most of those rounds. While Holyfield was not
effective even then, people need to remember this is boxing, not
fencing. You don't get points for touching your opponent; you get
points for stabbing him.
</P>
<P>
   This Lewis did through the first seven rounds almost at will and
again in the final one, when he came out throwing and controlled
all three minutes at a time when Holyfield needed something big and
was unable to come up with even something small. But Lewis unwisely
set himself up for problems with his approach once he thought he
had the fight under control, and he learned a harsh lesson. In
boxing, nothing is under anyone's control, except maybe promoter
Don King's.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, though, Lewis at least didn't lose his title, which
would have been the case had all three judges not given the final
round to the World Boxing Council champion. Had that not happened,
a mugging would have turned into a Brink's job, as trainer Emanuel
Steward insisted occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more upset than anyone,'' Lewis's trainer said. ``It
looked like Evander was working as a sparring partner. Except he
got paid $20 million (to Lewis's $9 million). It was not even a
close fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will try to say that's just boxing. No! No! It's
disgusting. Those judges should never be allowed to work again. It
was a plain robbery. There should be a federal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   That seemed a bit strong, but there is much bitterness and ill
will between Steward, Holyfield's former trainer, and the World
Boxing Association-International Boxing Federation champion's camp,
so what was more telling were the calmer words of Don Turner,
Holyfield's chief second and true believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox was only interested in outpointing Evander,'' Turner
said. ``He sacrificed his punching power to become elusive and he
did a good job. I was surprised by that. If there's a rematch,
Evander is smart enough to know he has to fight a different fight.
He has to apply more pressure next time. He's got to put leather on
the guy for the guy to respect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was definitely close. I thought we won the last four
rounds to win the fight, but I'm not complaining about the
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   I would think not if he had eyes in his head, which apparently
at least one judge didn't. Williams would later claim she saw
Holyfield ``land more blows.'' According to CompuBox's numbers, he
not only didn't do that, he landed fewer total punches than Lewis
landed jabs.
</P>
<P>
   Often in matters of controversy in boxing, it is wise to use the
eye test when all else fails, meaning just look at the two men
after the fight and adjust your thinking if necessary. Lewis came
into the postfight press conference wearing sunglasses in the dark
but otherwise seemed fit. Holyfield came in with a face that looked
like it should have been in granite guarding the top of some
European castle.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's smile was gone. Now he was a gargoyle, his left
cheek cut and swollen, both eyes puffy and half-closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 65 years old tonight,'' said Lou Duva, Holyfield's
first professional trainer. ``Look at his face. He's dying up
there. I know that kid. He's hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Today so is boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of the IBF, WBA and WBC Sunday ordered a rematch
within six months. But who knows what will happen then, as based on
Saturday night neither man is what he claims to be. Holyfield
looked old and far off his game from the opening bell, unable to
figure out how to get inside Lewis's half-foot reach advantage and
land the explosive combinations that long have been his trademark.
He lacked rhythm, timing, quickness, and combination punching, all
signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was equally disappointing despite his victory. Although he
controlled the action with his ring generalship, it was harmless
ring generalship, dominance without doing much with it. When he had
Holyfield in big trouble in the fifth round after landing a
crushing right hand that staggered the champion, he did nothing to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Lennox won big,'' said veteran trainer Angelo
Dundee. ``That was a bum decision. You know, it says in the Bible,
Forgive them for they know not what they do. And those guys didn't
know what in the hell they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lennox turns me off. He don't give you nothing. He don't
give you 100 percent. He should have destroyed Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   He should have because in front of him stood a great fighter
finally spent, his tank empty after a lifetime battling men like
Lewis, bigger, stronger men. Holyfield was a warrior to the end,
but the end it was. Had Lewis tried to make that obvious, there
might be no controversy. But he didn't, so when it was time to say
``and the winner is . . . '' everyone came up losers. Especially
boxing itself.

BRUINS IN HOLDING PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins woke up Monday morning in sole possession of
eighth place in the Eastern Conference. But not by much.
</P>
<P>
   They have made it easy on themselves at times this year. At
others, they have made it tough.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 games to go in the regular season, the Bruins have a
couple of days off before facing the Conference's fourth-place team
_ the Toronto Maple Leafs _ Wednesday at the new Air Canada Centre.
While the Bruins are holding on to their position by a thread (they
have 68 points to Florida's 67), the fact is, their schedule is
favorable in their quest for a playoff spot. Of the remaining
games, 13 of the 16 are against conference opponents. That may
sound intimidating, but the Bruins are in the position they said
they wanted to be in all along _ in control of their destiny. Are
things desperate? Definitely. But it's always better to be
desperate against teams against whom you can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend was a rather strange one. Against the Rangers Friday
night, the Bruins were where they wanted to be after two periods _
in a 1-1 tie. Some seven goals later, in a manic third, the Bruins
were fortunate to come out of Madison Square Garden with a 5-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   Against Buffalo Saturday night, the Bruins seemed to have just
enough energy to stave off the Sabres for two periods. But then
that reserve dried up and halfway through the third it was a 3-1
Buffalo lead and the Bruins looked as if they had run out of gas.
It was hard after the Bruins' huge win against the Rangers to
recover from that high.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 4-point game,'' said goalie Byron Dafoe, who is without any
doubt the Bruins' most valuable player this season, ``that was a
pretty devastating loss for the Rangers. I don't know what that
does to their psyche going down the stretch now, but the bottom
line was it uplifted us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not enough to beat the Sabres, but the Sabres have been
unforgiving opponents for the Bruins all year.
</P>
<P>
   The very best news for the Bruins is that their second line,
much maligned early in the year and changed during the season, has
been a contributing factor to their success recently.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton has been absolutely remarkable in his progress,
using his strength, puck-handling savvy, and ultra long reach to
help Anson Carter and Steve Heinze find their spotty scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a roller-coaster season for Boston. The Bruins' win
over the Rangers Friday helped them recover from the disappointment
of their loss to New York at home the previous weekend. Then their
loss to Buffalo Saturday mitigated their enthusiasm for having
dealt the Rangers a near death blow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere was somber last weekend,'' said Carter. ``Now
you see guys with heads up and chests pumped out and feeling good
about themselves. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   All that after the all-important Friday win. Despite their
happiness at beating the Rangers in the most unconventional and
un-Bruin way possible, Heinze said sometimes you just have to
accept what is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the polar opposite of what we wanted to do, it was
river hockey _ up and down, not enough defense, and just exactly
what we didn't want to do _ but fortunately we came out with a
win,'' said Heinze. ``The positive in that game was we scored a
bunch of goals but the negative was we didn't play anywhere near
what we wanted to defensively. For us to be successful through this
stretch and through the playoffs, it's going to be defense. It's
not going to be opening up the wide-open game.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss to the Sabres, with 16 games left, the Bruins
are still only 5 points out of the seventh spot. Not long ago, the
Bruins would've been thrilled to just hang on to eighth. Even given
Saturday's result, seventh isn't out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the teams above you, and you start to get a little
more positive, like let's chase these guys instead of looking over
your shoulder,'' said Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   The chase continues Wednesday.

MORE TESTS AWAIT KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The latest crucial test is behind them, but
another one awaits.
</P>
<P>
   It will be this way for the Los Angeles Kings for the rest of
this season, either until they grab a playoff berth or are
eliminated from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, whose 3-1 victory over Vancouver on Saturday night
was their second in a row, would take a giant step toward the
playoff picture with a victory tonight at the Forum against the
Eastern Conference-leading Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   A win would move the Kings (25-36-5) within three points of
Edmonton and Calgary, which share the eighth and final Western
Conference berth.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, Kings coach Larry Robinson was satisfied
following Saturday night's victory over Vancouver. It wasn't as if
the Kings played a perfect game, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the win,'' Robinson said. ``But at times,
we were fortunate. We had a 2-0 lead, and we got a little lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings held on, though, and Sunday, Robinson held a short
practice at Iceoplex.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the day came when Kings trainer Peter Demers
and massage therapist Dan Garcia received a special assignment: to
tend to the sprained ankle of iconoclastic rock-and-roller Marilyn
Manson before his concert Sunday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliate wanted: Kings general manager Dave Taylor said the
team is seeking its own American Hockey League affiliate to develop
players, but that any such arrangement probably won't happen until
at least the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at some things,'' Taylor said. ``We don't have
anything concrete. Down the road, it's definitely where we're going
to be. The time frame is uncertain. But we have talked to some
teams in the AHL.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Kings have placed some prospects in Springfield
of the AHL, which also receives players from the Phoenix Coyotes.
The Kings also have several players with the International Hockey
League's Long Beach Ice Dogs. Both arrangements expire after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The AHL is considered the top developmental minor league, with
the IHL home to more veteran players than the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire: One player omitted from the lineup the past two
games has been defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has struggled all
season after signing a contract that pays him $3.75 million a year.
When he was announced as a scratch before Saturday's game, a large
portion of the Forum crowd cheered.

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ The NFL expansion committee seems to be feverishly
working on a plan similar to Bob McNair's recent ``win-win''
proposition for getting NFL teams into both Houston and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Heads We Win, Tails You Lose Proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on the principle of two birds in the bush being worth
more than one in the hand. It's buying the sizzle and tossing the
steak into the alley. It's putting off until tomorrow what could be
done today.
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is selling it, and a significant
number of NFL owners continue to buy it. It should be McNair's cue
to walk away from Tagliabue's game and start playing by a different
set of rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon could have _ should have, by reasonable
standards _ been McNair's day to cash in on a long, well-played
hand of the NFL's expansion game. The last two cards McNair flipped
over on the table for the NFL expansion committee looked like sure
winners.
</P>
<P>
   After months of playing nice, looking owners in the eyes,
answering all the questions and laying out his cards perfectly
while Los Angeles floundered in search of direction, McNair
announced his win-win plan.
</P>
<P>
   He penned letters to at least eight teams that are looking for
better stadium deals. McNair offered to buy controlling interest in
any of those teams if their stadium issues were not resolved and an
expansion team was not awarded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The win-win plan seemed perfect for the league, because teams
currently hoping for better stadium deals _ San Francisco, Chicago,
Oakland, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, New England, Buffalo and
Phoenix _ could use McNair's offer as leverage in their
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If only one of those teams' negotiations fell apart, Houston
still could get an NFL team and the league could acquire the
much-coveted Los Angeles market through expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last week, McNair flipped over the apparent clinching
card, a shrewd guarantee that Houston would sell out every home
game for at least five years if a team arrived. It also seemed like
a perfect play for the league, guaranteeing Houston's formidable
television market even if LA viewers greeted expansion with a
collective ho-hum, as some believe they will.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final card McNair could play. It was smart, proper,
impressive and within the rules Tagliabue and the league set. It
should have had McNair raking the chips off the table when the
expansion committee swung open its doors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Tagliabue and a contingent of NFL owners continued
to fall for LA's bluff _ that somehow governmental support would
fall in line in Los Angeles and somehow one ownership group would
surface as a leader, even as a third group from Anaheim entered the
fray Sunday by delivering proposals to owners here.
</P>
<P>
   When the brief expansion committee meeting broke up Sunday,
owners emerged from behind the velvet ropes with gray faces and the
company line on their lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in discussions,'' Tampa Bay owner Malcolm Glazer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' New York Giants owner Wellington Mara
said.
</P>
<P>
   The clear message was that the NFL is prepared to extend the
deadline yet again for Los Angeles, still hoping that it gets its
bid together. One scenario had the deadline extended another 10
months, which would push up against the Jan. 31, 2000, deadline the
Houston group set. Then, if Los Angeles still is not prepared to
trump Houston, the expansion franchise would go to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   But how much longer can McNair sit at the table with all his
cards perfectly laid out, while Tagliabue and the expansion
committee keep pulling aces out of their sleeves and passing them
to LA under the table? How much longer can the Houston Livestock
Show &AMP; Rodeo wait for the new NFL stadium before it scoffs at it
all and takes a chunk of the $195 million in the Houston bid and
refurbishes the Astrodome?
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk the league has (with extending the deadline) is they
could lose Houston and still not have everything settled in Los
Angeles,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners indicated the expansion committee will award the
franchise to Los Angeles this week no matter McNair's apparent
winning hand. Others said they did not expect any decision about
expansion this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for McNair to leave this game and stretch his legs.
Walk over to Jim Irsay and talk about the Colts. Visit with New
England's Bob Kraft or Phoenix's Bill Bidwill and make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   McNair certainly is thinking about it and said as much in the
wake of Sunday's foot-dragging by the expansion committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're available,'' he said. ``We can tell (owners), `If you
can't work something out, we'd like to talk to you.' I'm a
businessman. I try to always have options.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair went to Kansas City last October and wowed owners with
his proposal. He later went to the NFL meetings in Miami and did
the same. He is here. The two leaders of the LA cause, Ed Roski and
Michael Ovitz, are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is ready,'' said San Diego owner Alex Spanos, one of
Houston's expansion supporters. ``Houston is there with everything
we need. We don't have to ask Houston for anything. As owners, we
want LA to take the lead, but they haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has given the NFL a win-win proposal that could put teams
in two of the biggest markets. He has guaranteed sellouts. He has
played by Tagliabue's rules, but Tagliabue keeps changing them.
</P>
<P>
   It's time McNair makes his own and goes shopping for the team he
deserves.

SWEET - AND SOUR - 16 
</HEADLINE>
 EAST ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Perhaps you couldn't tell the players without a
scorecard, but that wouldn't have been nearly sufficient to
identify the winners and losers who emerged from Boston's maiden
venture as a college basketball mecca.
</P>
<P>
   More than two Sweet 16 berths were at stake during the three-day
NCAA East Regional trial at the FleetCenter. Reputations, futures,
and public perceptions also were on the line, and one had to delve
far beyond the box scores for a legitimate retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith 16 random winners and losers after the weekend festival
on Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   --The FleetCenter wasn't merely a winner; it flat out hit the
jackpot in its bid to establish itself as a viable venue for
national events. Despite rotten weather Friday; doomsday forecasts
for even worse conditions Sunday night; the construction jungle
created by the Big Dig and the hotel being built in front of the
Fleet that turned the North Station area into a navigational
nightmare; and the utter lack of signage around the city
advertising the games, all sessions were sellouts. And not just in
terms of the tickets but the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive was the crowd for Friday afternoon's
opening session, a legitimate capacity gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just incredible,'' said Big East commissioner Mike
Tranghese, the NCAA basketball representative at the site. ``A lot
of times, you sell the tickets for the afternoon games but you
don't fill the seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese, an ardent proponent of the Fleet's big-event
potential, was virtually delirious with delight, believing the
weekend's developments can only enhance the arena's candidacy for
future men's regionals and the 2004 women's basketball Final Four,
for which Boston has bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to send a strong message to the NCAA,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   --Making Boston's performance even more remarkable were the
aforementioned traffic congestion and construction quagmire,
definite losers. But the hotel should be completed long before the
2004 Final Four, and the Big Dig can't last forever _ can it?
</P>
<P>
   --Perhaps the biggest loser on the court was George Mason
forward George Evans. The Colonial Athletic Association Player of
the Year shot 0 for 6 in a scoreless disaster as George Mason was
decimated, 72-48, by Cincinnati in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   --Temple guard Quincy Wadley was a winner, if for no other
reason than his powers of persuasion. Despite a broken left hand,
he somehow talked autocratic Owls coach John Chaney into letting
him play. After a cameo in Temple's opening 61-54 win over Kent, he
contributed 14 invaluable points off the bench Sunday as the Owls
shocked Boston co-favorite Cincinnati, 64-54.
</P>
<P>
   --Temple's zone defense was a winner. It flummoxed both
overmatched Kent and highly favored Cincinnati, solidifying
Chaney's coaching credentials, not that they needed it.
</P>
<P>
   --College basketball's supposed marksmen were losers, mainly
because just about everybody with the exception of Miami's Johnny
Hemsley (9 for 12 on 3-pointers, 31 points in the first round),
Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin (7 for 9 Sunday), and Purdue's Brian
Cardinal (5 for 7, 4 for 5 on threes Sunday) lost sight of the
basket. It was as if the Curse of Boston Garden had been placed on
the parquet. The nadir had to be the very first half of the
weekend, in which George Mason turned in a 5-for-31 eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   --The underwriters of the eight schools' insurance policies for
cheerleaders must be financial winners. Talk about high-risk
extracurricular activities: During every timeout, at least one
cheerleader per team was launched to about the same altitude as the
average space shuttle, doing midair triple spins for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   --The FleetCenter hot dogs, as toasty as an Alaskan winter
night, were losers, except possibly for gastroenterologists.
</P>
<P>
   --Sartorially, Kent stole the show. The Golden Flashes' golden
ensembles were beautiful to behold, in direct contrast to their
play.
</P>
<P>
   --In the individual fashion category, the award went to
Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins. His black-on-black ensemble,
color-coordinated with his hair, was slickness personified, though
it reflected the look of a Las Vegas lounge singer more than a
Midwestern mentor. And it was the perfect funereal statement after
the Bearcats' second-round nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   --Lafayette's basketball team was a winner even in losing. The
scrappy Leopards, making their first NCAA appearance in 42 years
and seeded 15th and last in Boston, gave this subregional's top
dog, Miami, a scare for one half and turned in a credible effort
despite losing Friday, 76-54.
</P>
<P>
   --Lafayette's royal rooters, the Zoo Crew, were vocal losers.
Their harassment of Hemsley went beyond protocol, and the constant
salute ``Hemsley sucks'' was a model of poor taste. Back to your
cages, Zoo Crew.
</P>
<P>
   --Purdue reserve Cameron Stephens was the most irresisitible
winner _ the underdog who makes good. His last-second jumper beat
Texas, 58-54, Friday in the regional's most dramatic game.
</P>
<P>
   --Conversely, Texas was a loser, killing itself with 22
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   --Purdue coach Gene Keady was a winner. Aside from salvaging a
season pocked by turmoil with the pair of upsets here, he showed
that the term scholar-athlete isn't necessarily lip service. As is
his habit when visiting an unfamiliar city, Keady took his players
on a tour of Boston, paying particular attention to the JFK Library
and the USS Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   --The loser among tourists was Purdue guard Jaraan Carroll. He
was limited in his sightseeing because he took the team nickname,
Boilermakers, a bit too literally. ``I couldn't get around much,''
he said, ``because of a boil on my foot.''

BEARCATS NOT SCARY AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They came into the NCAA Tournament as the Only Team
That Beat Duke, but that's not the label that will stick to
Cincinnati after the Bearcats were bounced in the second round for
the third straight year, this time by Temple, 64-54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about it coming in _ one and done _ and they were
right,'' said junior college transfer Pete Mickeal, whose teams at
Indian Halls (Iowa) Community College were 76-1, won back-to-back
national championships, and never had a season end as abruptly as
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about our reputation, but it's hard to live with
losing. Some guys, it means that it hurts for awhile. Not with me.
Every day I'm alive, I live with it, I walk around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Melvin Levett lived through the previous two
ousters, when Cincinnati lost by a point to Iowa State in the
Midwest Regional in 1997, then was beaten by a buzzer-beating bank
shot by West Virginia last year in the West Regional in Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Levett said, it was supposed to be different. The
madness wasn't supposed to end until April, with a Final Four date
and possible rematch with Duke in Florida. It wasn't supposed to
end with Levett missing shot after shot over the Temple zone,
especially in the first half, when the Bearcats made just two
baskets in the first 14 minutes while turning the ball over seven
times.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, Levett made just 4 of 13 shots, 2 of 10 from
3-point range, and didn't make his first 3-pointer until there were
five minutes left and Temple had long since beaten back
Cincinnati's one charge into contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the gym this morning, we shot for an hour and
I think I missed four shots,'' Levett said. ``Then to go out and
shoot the ball like that in the game . . . That's just typical of
how I've been, on and off the whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Only twice this season did Cincinnati score fewer points than it
did Sunday, and its 34.7 percent shooting (17 of 49) from the floor
ranked with its worst efforts of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make shots, we just don't have many perimeter
shooters,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said. ``If we have open
shots and don't make them, we struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   A telling stat about the Bearcats this season: In games in which
they scored 60 points or more, they were 23-0. In games in which
they were held under 60, they were just 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this game was going to be tough,'' Levett said. ``Our
shots were the key, rebounding was the key. We didn't get second or
third shots, while they had five shots on just one possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins's teams are known for their swagger, their belief that
they can intimidate teams into submission. But it became obvious
early that in Temple, the Bearcats were dealing with a team that
feared its own coach (John Chaney) more than anything the
opposition could throw at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them take the fight to us,'' said Mickeal, who sounded
mystified by the notion. ``The first time down the floor, they
backed it in (a Kevin Lyde layin), and then they did it again (a
Rasheed Brokenborough layup, followed by a short-range jumper by
Lamont Barnes). You can't let a team get that kind of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after falling behind by as many as 16 (29-13) late in the
first half, Cincinnati drew to within 35-29 on two Mickeal free
throws with 12:59 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we should have jumped on them,'' Levett said.
``They were tired, they were ready to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Temple's Quincy Wadley responded with a 3-pointer from
the left wing, the Bearcats misfired, and the Owls parlayed three
offensive rebounds into a Keaton Sanders layin. Suddenly, the
Temple lead was 11 again, and the Bearcats never drew closer than 7
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, who has taken his team to the Final Four once in 10
years, took exception to the idea that this team had underachieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about that,'' he said. ``We're going to take a
week off, take two weeks off, take finals, have a spring break, and
then go back to work like we always do.''
</P>
<P>
   But for senior Levett, there is no more work to be done at
Cincinnati, not on the basketball court. Underachievers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' he said. ``This isn't how it was supposed to
end.''

TEMPLE SPELLS DOOM FOR CINCINNATI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL VEGA 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It had all the makings of a bare-knuckled, schoolyard
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner was Cincinnati, which had an unmistakeable swagger
and aura of toughness and confidence after the Bearcats
accomplished a feat matched by no other team _ a victory over Duke.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner was feisty Temple, whose unrelenting matchup
zone defense and opportunistic offense reflected the tenacity of
its beloved coach, John Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   All that was missing from the opening tap was Michael Buffer
bellowing his trademark command, ``LET'S GET READY TO
RUUUUUMMMBLE!''
</P>
<P>
   To be succint: Temple answered the bell, racing to a 21-8 lead
after the first 6:27; Cincinnati did not, converting just 2 of 14
field goal attempts while committing seven of its 16 turnovers in
the first 14:19.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the sixth-seeded Owls (23-10) earned their first
Sweet 16 berth in six years _ and fourth overall under Chaney _
with an old-fashioned schoolyard whuppin' of the third-seeded
Bearcats, 64-54, in Sunday's NCAA East Regional second-round
matchup before a sellout crowd at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Temple suffered losses in its two previous NCAA
matchups with Cincinnati at Salt Lake City in 1995 (77-71) and at
Orlando in 1996 (78-65), the Owls gave no indication that they
would back down, let alone buckle at the knees, from yet another
physical confrontation with the Bearcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys were to draw from your own backgrounds, how many
times did you go to the schoolyard and know that dangerous Dan
McGrew was out there with the rest of them guys, ready to take your
ball, kick you in the ass, and send you home?'' Chaney said,
painting quite the metaphorical image. ``It didn't stop you from
going to the playground. You found motives to go out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys would take my ball every day and I'd go back with a
tennis ball. I didn't give a (expletive). It didn't matter to me.
When kids go out and play, they don't worry about what the pundits
or the talkin' heads talk about, they just go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what Chaney's Owls did. They just went out
and played. Without fear. Without apprehension. They just played
hard. They played tough. And, above all else, the Owls played
intelligently on all fronts by outshooting, outrebounding, and
outhustling Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Temple converted 20 of 45 shots while using a fierce matchup
zone that created 16 turnovers (10 steals) and held the Bearcats to
17-for-49 shooting. Temple won the rebounding battle, too, 32-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dug ourselves a hole that we had a hard time getting out
of,'' said Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins, whose team (27-6) looked
less like the one that beat the Blue Devils and more like the one
that suffered Conference USA losses to Marquette and Saint Louis in
making a second-round NCAA Tournament exit for the third year in a
row. ``Our whole deal coming in was that we had to do a better job
on the glass, both offensive and defensive glass. They beat us on
the offensive glass early. They made shots and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior forward Lamont Barnes led the Owls with 15 points on
5-for-8 shooting, hitting an improbable baseline skyhook in the
second half that extended Temple's 29-18 halftime lead to 31-18,
and grabbing three of his team's 32 rebounds. Junior guard Pepe
Sanchez added 14 points, hitting 9 of 10 from the foul line, and
had 7 rebounds, 4 steals, and 2 assists. Junior guard Quincy Wadley
came off the bench to chip in 14 points, hitting a huge trey in the
second half that enabled Temple to pull away, 38-29, after
Cincinnati pulled within 35-29 on a pair of Pete Mickeal free
throws with 12:59 to go.
</P>
<P>
   With Sanchez, Mark Karcher, and Rasheed Brokenborough each
nursing three fouls apiece, that proved to be the only point during
the game when it got truly dicey for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like coach always tells us, `Your will is always stronger than
your skill,' '' said Brokenborough. ``They tried to beat us
athletically and weren't using their heads in trying to attack and
beat our zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon Martin led the Bearcats with 16 points and eight rebounds
while guards Melvin Levett and Steve Logan overcame a combined
1-for-7 start to finish with 14 and 13 points, respectively. After
the Owls twice led by 16 (51-35 and 57-41), Cincinnati twice cut it
to 7 (59-52 and 61-54). But Temple, despite making only two field
goals in the final 8:10, won this battle of wills by making 15 of
its last 20 free throws to win going away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't about who's the toughest; it's about who wants to
win,'' Martin said, through eyes reddened by tears. ``It ain't
about who's the toughest. If that was the case, we'd just put on
the gloves and see who's the toughest. But it's not a boxing match,
it's a basketball game.''

CARDINAL'S RULE: INTENSITY WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With his high-top black-and-white sneakers, bulky back
knee pads, and gymnasium pallor, Brian Cardinal looks as if he
stepped out of a 1920s daguerrotype of Indiana basketball.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so he grew up in Illinois, dreamed of playing for the
Illini, and we're on the verge of the millennium. Let's not get too
technical. With his throwback look and style to match, this kid was
born to play in the state that is the game's cradle. And Sunday he
showed why as he basically willed 10th-seeded Purdue past second
seed Miami, 73-63, in the NCAA East Regional second round and on to
the Sweet 16 _ a most unlikely destination for a team that came
into the FleetCenter having lost five of its previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd told me a week ago I was going to the Sweet 16,''
said the 6-foot-7-inch junior forward, ``I'd want to know where I
was sitting, because I sure didn't think we'd get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal will be on the floor in the East semifinals against
Temple at the Meadowlands Friday in large part because that's where
he spent most of his time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, his statistics stood out: 20 points on 5-for-7
shooting, including 4 for 5 behind the 3-point line; 6 rebounds; 4
steals; and 2 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as anything, it was his kamikaze intensity that
embodied the Boilermakers' scrape-and-burn style, an admittedly
ragged production that did the trick because it harassed normally
cool Miami into a battle in the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal was at the center of virtually every scrum, slipping,
sliding, crawling, brawling for every loose ball, wrestling for
every rebound. In particular, he was on Tim James, the Big East
co-Player of the Year, like a brace _ and not the type the Miami
forward needed for his aching back. James wound up with 19 points
but shot only 7 for 21 and grabbed a mere eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too smooth out there,'' said Cardinal. ``I wear these
goofy-looking knee pads, and I just go out and try to play hard, do
the things guys don't like to do _ take charges, dive for loose
balls, contest for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to say it was the defense that stopped James (instead
of the bad back), but I don't know. We tried to take him and them
out of doing some things defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the misimpression that Cardinal was a mere
spiritual presence. He filled the box score with some vital bursts.
</P>
<P>
   His two 3-pointers keyed a 15-0 Purdue run that ended the first
half, boosted the Boilermaker advantage to 32-17, and, as Cardinal
said, ``put all the pressure on Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, when Miami responded to that pressure to
close within 43-38, Cardinal did his major damage within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the Hurricanes' Vernon Jennings driven for a scoop
than Cardinal was taking a pass on the wing from Tony Mayfield and
nailing a trey. Seconds after that, Mayfield stole the ball and fed
Cardinal for a layup that restored the double-digit spread, 48-38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach (Gene Keady) always talks about how there are going to
be runs during any game, times when things are not going well,''
said Cardinal. ``It was great the way we responded each time. I got
set up for a couple of open looks in the first half, then I was
lucky enough to hit a three and Tony made the great steal in the
second.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup de grace came at the foul line during the interminable
finish, and Cardinal _ whose father was the Illinois basketball
trainer and who figured he was destined for Champaign until Keady
persuaded him to cross state lines _ did his part, hitting six of
eight free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time to savor the victory, though not necessarily to
rest. As Cardinal went to sit at his locker, a television crew
requested that he stay on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to stand?'' said Cardinal. ``You guys are killing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time he stood still all day.

SHOOTING BLOWS HURRICANES OFF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If Sunday was the first time you'd seen the Miami
Hurricanes, you might have wondered why they bothered to reinstate
the basketball program 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd been watching them all season, you must have thought
this was their evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Hurricanes _ the top seed to play this weekend
in Boston _ dropped a giant stinkbomb at the FleetCenter, falling,
73-63, to No. 10 seed Purdue. Senior Tim James said the team wanted
to use this weekend's two games to show all of America that it
could play with anyone. In the end, Miami showed it could beat
dreaded Lafayette. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with these rather telling tidbits: Miami never led.
Miami scored 17 points in the first half. Miami took twice as many
shots as Purdue (76-38) and still lost. Miami shot 6 of 33 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 points represented the Hurricanes' third-lowest output of
the season. After knocking down 10 treys against Lafayette, they
made only one Sunday, an inconsequential one with 1:37 remaining.
Inside, they missed layup after layup _ coach Leonard Hamilton
counted 17 of them _ which took a little out of them as the game
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games where nothing went right,'' Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point probably came in the final 5:17 of the first
half. Miami, by then already into its bricklaying mode, managed a
7-0 run to tie the game at 17-17. The Hurricanes then pitched a
shutout for the rest of the half while Purdue scored 15 in a row.
Hamilton saw his team turn it over five times in that stretch, made
seven substitutions to no avail, and watched incredulously as his
team misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't finish our plays, for some reason,'' James said.
``It's no one's fault. We just didn't do it. We had a bad night.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, proud Purdue coach Gene Keady beamed ``we had nine
shutouts (possessions) in a row at the end of the half.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, it also was clear that Miami guard Johnny Hemsley
was not going to duplicate his dismantling of Lafayette, against
whom he made 9 of 12 treys Friday. He ended up scoring 13 points,
but had just 5 at the break and only a single field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue's Alan Eldridge played Hemsley airtight all afternoon.
Miami expected that after the Lafayette game. So the game plan was
to drive to the basket and get the ball into the post, where James
had made a comfortable living all season.
</P>
<P>
   But James had no more luck than Hemsley. He was 3 for 9 in the
first half and 7 for 21 in the game. He was hampered by a sore
back, but Hamilton refused to use that, or anything else, as an
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a situation where your team gets 27 offensive
rebounds and can't put any of them back in,'' the coach said. In
truth, he exaggerated a little; the Hurricanes were credited with
16 second-chance points. But those who saw the game knew exactly
what he meant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the horrible first half, Hamilton felt his team
would respond in the second. They had trailed UConn by 16 and won
that one, hadn't they? And Purdue wasn't UConn. Unfortunately for
Hamilton, Miami wasn't Miami, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' last chance came after they rallied to within
43-38 with 11:06 left. A minute later, the lead was back to 12 on 7
unanswered Purdue points.
</P>
<P>
   That was it, really. The Miami numbers were much better in the
second half, but it couldn't afford to match baskets with the
Boilermakers. Purdue attempted only 16 shots in the half and didn't
make a field goal in the final 7:34. It didn't matter. Miami had to
foul _ Purdue took 32 of its 37 free throws in the second half, 18
in the final 2:10.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Miami, they made their shots when it mattered.

LAKERS FALL TO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Their starting point guard was lost to injury,
their thuggish rebounder is just plain lost and now the Los Angeles
Lakers have a very clear reminder of what losing feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels strange,'' Shaquille O'Neal said Sunday night after a
stunning 105-101 loss to the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis put it more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate losing. Losing sucks,'' he said . ``I hated losing as a
player, I hate it as a coach. It's a horrible, rotten feeling. This
is a three-hour sleep night for me.''
</P>
<P>
   If the reaction is extreme, it's only because the Lakers hadn't
felt the sting in a while, since Feb. 22. And Rambis hadn't felt
one period since becoming the coach.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's 10-game winning streak, and Rambis' heretofore
perfect 9-0 record, came to a sudden halt in the face of the Kings'
back-breaking fast break, led by rookie point guard phenom Jason
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, better known as ``White Chocolate,'' gave the Lakers a
taste of what they missed _ the team coveted him on draft day _ and
they came away with a decidedly sour taste in their mouths after
watching him score a team-high 21 points, nine in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also led a transition attack the Lakers never matched,
leading to 25 fast-break points for the Kings, who ended a losing
streak to the Lakers at 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the made-over Kings, with Williams, Vlade Divac and
Chris Webber (19 points, 11 rebounds) aren't talented, but they are
the same folks who donated a victory to the Clippers just three
nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could have used the defensive intensity of Dennis
Rodman, taking a leave of absence, and Derek Harper (sprained
ankle), against Webber and Williams, but Rambis waved off such
suggestions as ``excuses.'' He pinned the loss on another party.
Himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost because of my inexperience as a head coach,'' he said.
``It was my fault. I wasn't able to deliver the things we needed to
do late in the ballgame. I wasn't able to get the team to do what I
wanted it to do. We didn't execute the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make myself clear, I guess, to run the plays I wanted
to get done. I didn't use my timeouts to get the players to foul
whenever they had to. And that's my job as a coach to make sure
they understand all that.''
</P>
<P>
   After a mea culpa like that, you'd hate to think what a losing
streak, or a .500 record, would do to the rookie head coach.
Rambis' martyrdom notwithstanding, this game was lost by lax
defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings running at will, Sacramento took a five-point
halftime lead and extended it to 10 by late in the third quarter.
The Lakers cut the deficit to four early in the fourth period, then
succumbed to Sacramento's perimeter shooting. The Kings went on a
15-6 run, sparked by 3-pointers from Vernon Maxwell and Peja
Stojakovic, and six points by Williams, making it 99-86 with 5:56
left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Even a 10-point quarter from Kobe Bryant fell short of bringing
the Lakers back. His late burst of five straight points cut the
deficit to 99-94 and the Lakers eventually got within three. But
they were forced to foul down the stretch and Williams made 3 of 4
free throws to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't play hard,'' said O'Neal, who scored a
game-high 33 points and rejected Rambis' mea culpas. The loss, he
said, ``was our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, mitigating factors. Without Harper, Derek
Fisher was forced to play 37 minutes, Bryant 43 minutes as he
started at off guard and backed up at point. Glen Rice, hardly
acclimated to the team and playing his second game in 10 months,
played 29 minutes and missed 8 of 12 shots. Rick Fox was pressed
into shooting-guard duty.
</P>
<P>
   It all combined for a less-than-efficient defensive effort. And
a loss that suddenly reminded everyone that changing coaches and
adding All-Stars hasn't made everything perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does leave a nasty taste in your mouth,'' Fox said of the
defeat, ``especially after being so dominant for a while there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, said O'Neal, ``Ten of 11 games, I'll take that any
time.''

HARVARD BOUNCED BY RPI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ The third period often has been Harvard's best,
with its superior conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before 3,117 at the
Houston Field House Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in the third game of the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference quarterfinals, the teams were even
at 2 entering the final 20 minutes. So Harvard had a good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But it was RPI that came up with two goals in the final period,
the first at 6:57 by Doug Shepherd and the other by Brad Tapper at
13:37. That gave the Engineers a 4-2 lead that they held on to, and
they will play St. Lawrence Friday in the semifinals in Lake
Placid, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-fought series with three very good games,'' said
Harvard coach Ronn Tomassoni, whose team finished with a 14-16-2
record (8-13-2 in the league). ``We kind of shot ourselves in the
foot, with sloppy play in the third period, and it (directly led
to) a couple of goals. We hadn't done that all week long. When you
give a team like RPI chances like that, they can really be
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   RPI, which finished third in the regular season, just wanted to
keep firing in the third period. ``Harvard did a great job of
packing it in around their goalie (Oliver Jonas),'' said RPI coach
Dan Fridgen. ``We had to shoot through three players to get it to
him. Harvard did a real nice job of keeping its turnovers low
throughout the series.''
</P>
<P>
   In getting the lead for RPI (22-11-2, 14-7-2), Shepherd
registered his ninth goal. He was wide open along the right side
and took a slow wrist shot. On the fourth goal Tapper blasted one
from the right side to give the Engineers plenty of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``RPI didn't beat us with any of their moves, they just got the
bounces,'' said Harvard captain Craig Adams. ``We played
outstanding, though. It was probably the best three games that
we've played all season. It wasn't perfect, but I was happy with
the way we played. We played our system, we were disciplined. Plus,
we held a high-scoring team down in goals. We just didn't take
advantage of the chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomassoni was delighted with the effort of his team, which
finished eighth in the regular season. ``Everyone chipped in,
everyone doing the little things,'' he said. ``We were playing like
a team. We came together. We felt pretty good going into the third
period with it tied. RPI probably didn't feel quite as comfortable,
as the team that was favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities in the third period,'' he added.
``Our guys played hard and played well, showing a lot of heart. You
look at the start of the season (2-8-1) and compare it to the way
we finished (8-4-1 in their last 13).''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas was outstanding in stepping in for J.R. Prestifilippo
(separated shoulder), finishing with 28 saves, 12 in the second
period. ``Oliver hadn't played in a month, and there was quite a
bit of pressure on him,'' Tomassoni said. ``He did an outstanding
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas didn't want to hear it. ``You lose, so there's no way that
you can be happy,'' the sophomore said.

PROVIDENCE SENDS BU PACKING 
</HEADLINE>
 UNIVERSITY-PROVIDENCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Just when it was beginning to seem Boston
University might regroup and return to the FleetCenter for the
semifinals of the Hockey East playoffs, Providence sent the
Terriers on to spring break instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Friars built a 2-0 lead in the first period and took it from
there to a 5-1 victory Sunday &UR;  &LR; night before 1,832 at Schneider
Arena in the deciding game of their three-game quarterfinal series.
The victory, which completed Providence's 5-1 domination of the
season series with BU, set up a semifinal matchup Friday against
No. 1 seed New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The other semifinal pits Boston College against Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The Friars are in the semifinals for the first time in three
years. For the Terriers (14-20-3), the defeat gave Jack Parker his
second 20-loss season in his 26 years as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had split 8-2 decisions Friday and Saturday at
Schneider. The Friars (20-16-1) had won the opener with a
third-period spurt, and the Terriers had returned the favor on the
strength of a second-period outburst. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night the Friars took
charge in the first period, building a 13-4 edge in shots.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pooley, who guided the Friars to the championship of Hockey
East in his second season in 1995-96, said he was proud of the way
his defense played. ``Tonight our guys were stoked up,'' he said.
``Give our seniors a lot of credit. They came through tonight,
big-time. We were 3 for 5 on the power play, and I'm sure that's
what Jack will say was their downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Parker, ``Power plays really killed us tonight.
They have the best power play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his Terriers were 0 for 16 in the series with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   After a wide open stretch during which referee Ned Bunyon let
the teams play freely, the Friars moved to a 1-0 lead when Doug
Sheppard deflected Jason Ialongo's shot past goaltender Michel
Larocque on a power play at 15:58 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Friars were on a power play, Jon Cameron
followed two shots by Jon Coe and put the puck in the net at 17:22.
</P>
<P>
   Providence built the lead to 3-0 in the second period when
defenseman Josh MacNevin's shot from just inside the blue line went
in at the 14:42 mark. The Friars had a 12-3 edge in shots in the
period _ they were warming up to face the Wildcats. They beat UNH,
6-1, Nov. 6, then lost a 3-1 decision in Durham the next night, and
were beaten, 4-2, in Durham Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The third period was more of the same, as the Friars extended
their lead. Nick Lent, a junior out of Westwood, Mass., who played
for the Omaha Lancers in the US Hockey League, stole the puck and
went in on a breakaway to register a goal at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Lake made it 5-0 at 12:12 to send the crowd into ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers avoided the shutout when defenseman Pat Aufiero's
shot trickled past goaltender Boyd Ballard with just 3:26 remaining
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Laracque finished with 27 saves, Ballard 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran us out of the building,'' said Parker. ``Physically.
Emotionally. Effort-wise. They played unbelievably hard tonight,
and we had no answer for it. We had just four shots in the first
period and two in the second. It was a great disappointment, but it
was because of how hard Providence played.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Providence, we'd be an over-.500 club and
we'd still be playing. They beat us five out of six times this
season. That's a feather in their cap. They really showed up. They
dominated us, and they dominated us in an area we could not seem to
solve all year. That was power play and penalty kills.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the less-than-stellar season, Parker said, ``We were picked
to be fourth. We ended up fifth. Nobody expected us to win the
Beanpot. We realy improved as the year went on. I think our
freshman class really came along. It was disappointing we reverted
back (Sundya night) to the less-than-competitive nature we showed
at times this year.''

TENNESSEE AWAITS EASY-GOING BC

 COLLEGE-TENNESSEE-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The Boston College women's basketball team
was still riding a wave of euphoria Sunday. It was just hours after
the Eagles had defeated Ohio State to advance to the second round
of the NCAA Tournament, and they had a day off until their next
game.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent _ Tennessee _ is not someone they want to spend a
lot of time dwelling on. So after practicing for an hour and a
half, the players headed back to their hotel to have a team meal
and go out to a movie. For one day, they figured, Tennessee could
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, though, comes the moment of truth. The game that
will be on ESPN at 9:30 p.m. pits the eighth-seeded Eagles (22-7)
against the No. 1 seeded Lady Vols (29-2) in the teams' first
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Yankees, or the UCLA men's basketball team of the
1960s and early '70s, and that's what this Tennessee team is to
women's basketball. The Lady Vols, ranked No. 2 in the nation, are
not simply the defending NCAA champions _ they are the three-time
defending champs. Three of their players _ Chamique Holdsclaw,
Tamika Catchings, and Semeka Randall _ last week were named
All-Americans. The team's average margin of victory this season was
27 points.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any glimmer of hope for BC, it's that Tennessee will
be without Randall, who suffered a severe ankle sprain in
Saturday's 113-54 win over Appalachian State. She's undergoing
icing and physical therapy with the hope of joining the team for
later games.
</P>
<P>
   Randall is Tennessee's third-leading scorer (14 points per game)
behind Holdsclaw (20.9) and Catchings (16.8).
</P>
<P>
   But BC coach Cathy Inglese said that Randall's absence is hardly
a consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see anybody, rival team or not, get injured,
especially at this time of year, when it's supposed to be the
dessert of the season,'' she said. ``But Tennessee is not a
one-player team. She's a vital part, but they have so many other
key parts and play so well together. Tennessee is a program, it's a
team, it's not one individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Randall in the backcourt, Tennessee coach Pat Summitt
said she'll call on sophomore Kristen Clement to start, and use
junior Niya Butts off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt, who watched BC's win over Ohio State Saturday night,
said she was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to come out and apply pressure to the
guards, or they'll have a field day,'' she said. ``And they do an
excellent job of handling and passing the basketball. Their
high-low game was textbook at times with how they executed and got
the ball inside.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's starting backcourt of Alissa Murphy (22 points) and Brianne
Stepherson (11) accounted for more than half their team's points.
</P>
<P>
   When they take the court Monday night, both BC and Tennessee
will carry with them memories of big games this season. For BC, it
will be upsets of nationally-ranked Notre Dame and Connecticut. But
for Tennessee, it will be losses to Purdue and Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt said her team has to be reminded of those games so the
Lady Vols don't think that they will just roll over their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've been in that situation twice this year in which
we had slow starts, we got behind, we did not come with the type of
attitude and intensity that was needed,'' Summitt said. ``And if
that happens, we look real average or way below average.''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt also said she realizes that her team can bring out the
best in its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that BC is thinking, `Hey, we have nothing to
lose, let's play hard, let's play loose, and in the end let's go
and beat Tennessee,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good to BC senior forward Paula Bacso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to lose, so we can just relax and play our
game,'' she said.

<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Down by 10 points early in the second half and
by 6 with 2:40 to play, top-seeded Connecticut dug deep to score
the last 8 points of its NCAA Mideast Regional second-round game
against No. 8 seed Xavier, the final 2 coming on a pair of Tamika
Williams free throws with 7.1 seconds left to pull out a pulsating
86-84 victory Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the freshman center/forward from Dayton, Ohio, will be
returning to her home state next weekend when the Huskies (28-4)
take on Iowa State Friday in the Sweet 16 at Cincinnati, but for
most of the second half, it looked as if Xavier would be the team
returning triumphantly to its home city.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's freebies marked the first time the Huskies had led in
the second half _ and since they had taken a 20-17 lead in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stepped to the line after teammate Shea Ralph had
missed an off-balance leaner and Amy Duran kept the ball alive with
a putback that caromed back to Williams. Xavier point guard Nikki
Kremer, who had gone 8 for 8 at the free throw line before missing
a pair of foul shots on her team's previous possession, fouled
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay settled,'' said Williams, who led UConn
with 19 points, 11 in the second half, 8 in the final 7:02. ``Coach
(Geno Auriemma) told me (during a timeout) that `You're going to
make one, then you're going to make two. A lot of things were going
through my head. I just took the deep breaths and tried to follow
through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They gained a lot of confidence against us early and we got a
little frustrated,'' said Auriemma. ``I'm just proud of our guys.
That was a pretty gutty performance at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began to unravel for Xavier (24-9) after a Kim Hotz layup
had given the Musketeers the 84-78 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A Williams putback was followed by an Xavier turnover when
Kremer couldn't penetrate the lane. UConn's Asjha Jones countered
with an in-the-paint hoop, then Xavier was called for a backcourt
violation. Svetlana Abrosimova tied the game with a minute to go on
a twisting layup and then Williams was called for the foul as she
tried to tie up Kremer.
</P>
<P>
   Kremer went to the line, missed both, and UConn called time with
28.6 seconds to go as the crowd of 10,027 at Gampel Pavilion went
ballistic, but that was just a prelude for the wild finish that
kept the fans on their feet long after the game had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who led all players with nine rebounds, six on the
offensive glass, credited Ralph and Doran with heads-up plays at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shea had to create something and it was a great effort by Amy
to keep the ball alive,'' said Williams. ``I've never been in a
situation like tonight where I've been on the line with a chance to
win the game for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier coach Melanie Balcomb, who once coached against UConn
counterpart Auriemma when she was an assistant at Providence, tried
to downplay the significance of the partisan crowd prior to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went down to Virginia Tech to play in front of 9,700
people, and yeah, we lost,'' said Balcomb, ``but we won 90 percent
of the game (a reference to Xavier's 61-60 defeat). Our players
aren't thinking about the crowd, they are thinking about UConn _ we
play them, not the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier did tune out the crowd for most of the game, but crucial
turnovers and missed free throws ended any hopes of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn turned up the pressure at the end of the game and we did
not execute,'' lamented Balcomb. ``This is a tough way to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallant Kremer, a Cincinnati native who had 17 first-half
points, said that ``those free throws will be with me for a while.
But I wanted to be the one to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was another Ohioan who made the difference.

BAKER TAKES SONICS FOR RIDE PAST CLIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sonics coach Paul Westphal insisted before Sunday's
game that he saw a different look in Vin Baker's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When Westphal further contended that his struggling star forward
had found his comfort zone, he probably didn't realize the accuracy
of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that Baker had his second straight solid
outing, finishing with 23 points and a game-high eight rebounds
that helped the Sonics defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 108-89 at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to be the first time all season that Baker's
confidence matched his strong play.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baker, his parents had everything to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   Since their arrival in town Friday morning, Baker said he's
found more solace in two days than he's had all of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very close to my parents,'' said Baker, whose mother,
Jean, and father, James, are visiting Seattle for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having them here is kind of helping me relax a little bit. My
mom is cooking and watching NCAA (tournament) games with me. And my
dad is just telling me to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost too bad the Sonics didn't think of flying out the
Bakers a lot sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Baker and the team believe this is the perfect time
to put past struggles behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics (11-9) snapped a two-game home losing streak in
winning their second straight game after losing five in a row. And
the schedule should provide the Sonics with a bit more relief and a
chance to string together several victories.
</P>
<P>
   They host Vancouver tomorrow before visiting Golden State and
Denver this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This is equally as important a stretch for Baker, who for the
first time this season has two straight solid performances under
his belt. He looked impressive scoring 18 points on 7-of-17
shooting during a win at Chicago last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vin Baker is all the way back,'' Westphal said. ``He
had a great game against Chicago, and everybody pretty much sensed
that he was going to play like Vin Baker is used to playing. Then
tonight, he backed it up, and it makes a big difference for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's influence on the game was evident by the Sonics'
fluidness on offense.
</P>
<P>
   With Baker powering to the basket nearly every time he touched
the ball, the Sonics' outside shooters were rewarded with open
looks. As a result, the Sonics shot 56.8 percent _ their best
shooting percentage this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton's 28 points and 11 assists paced the Sonics. Dale
Ellis, who started in place of an injured Billy Owens, finished
with 17. All five starters scored in double figure, and Detlef
Schrempf chipped in 12 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need inside presence,'' Schrempf said. ``Not many teams can
win consistently (shooting) from the outside. Vin is it. He's our
low-post guy. When he plays like he did today, it makes it easier
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker seemed to have everything working for him. He even made
seven straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not worried about making your free throws, you're
a little bit more aggressive offensively. I wasn't worried about
getting in the paint,'' Baker said. ``I kind of wanted to go to the
line. I'm going to look to be aggressive. . . . This was the first
game that I felt like I had everything going.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down there's only one way out, and that's to be
aggressive. My confidence is back. . . . I don't care if it's the
Clippers or anyone else, there's no one person who can hold me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their 1-19 record, the Clippers had not been pushovers
the past week. They beat Sacramento for their first victory last
Thursday. Portland needed overtime to dispose of the Clippers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the fourth quarter that the Sonics managed to
build more than an eight-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 77-75 at the start of the final period when they
pulled away for good. Payton scored four quick points, then after
Baker sank a pair of free throws, Hersey Hawkins went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins buried a 3-pointer and followed that with a fastbreak
layup off a steal. The sequence capped an 11-4 run and put the
Sonics ahead 88-79 with 8:41 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics blew the game open with a 25-10 run down the stretch.
The Sonics outscored the Clippers 31-14 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the Sonics' biggest lead was 50-42 a few minutes
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't nervous,'' Westphal said. ``I felt like it was
a good challenge for us to take the game. . . . It was a nice day
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   By the look on Baker's face, it was a great day.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The presidents of the three sanctioning bodies for
the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification bout
have ordered a rematch within six months. The bout Saturday night
at Madison Square Garden ended in a controversial draw, even though
it appeared that Lewis had clearly controlled the entire fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame there was so much controversy attached to this
important fight,'' Bob Lee, president of the IBF, told The
Associated Press. ``But we did what we thought was the most
sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee met with Gilberto Mendoza, president of the WBA, and Jose
Sulaiman of the WBC early Sunday morning, right after the fight,
and decided to order the rematch. Holyfield is the WBA and IBF
champion and Lewis holds the WBC title.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is whether a rematch can be scheduled,
considering the difficulty in working out the first bout. Both the
fighters and all the promoters involved are in favor of a rematch,
but that does not mean it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   There might not be enough money in the fight for both the boxers
_ Holyfield received $20 million for Saturday night's fight and
Lewis got $10 million. The rematch clause in Lewis' contract calls
for him to earn $15 million and Holyfield will probably ask for
more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, Gov. George Pataki said he would ask the New
York State Athletic Commission to look into the controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that his administration has worked hard to bring
championship boxing back to Madison Square Garden, ``but it has to
be done in a way that upholds the integrity of the game and
people's confidence in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Don King will have to get back the confidence and the
money from somewhere and it will be a tough sell, because it was
not a particularly tantalizing fight and the outcome appeared
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the fans' reaction to King after the fight on
Saturday night, it will be an uphill struggle. As he was exiting
the main arena to attend the post-fight news conference, someone
from the stands yelled: ``Hey Don! Where are you taking the judges
on vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reference to the fact that in the past King has taken
the jury members of his federal court trials on vacation or made
them his guests at fights that he promotes.
</P>
<P>
   King said he expects to be made the villain in the controversy,
but he said he had no role in picking or assigning the judges. Each
of the sanctioning organizations selected a judge and the judges
had to be approved by both fighters' camps.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' trainer, Emanuel Steward, said he objected to the judges,
but he would not say which judge or why. Steward said, however,
that he only mentioned his objections within the camp. Frank
Maloney, Lewis' manager, said he didn't have a problem with the
judges when they were first selected.
</P>
<P>
   The fight left unresolved the question of who the next
undisputed heavyweight champion would be, and it put a greater
focus on the subjective nature of scoring by the ringside judges.
And with Lewis clearly controlling the fight from start to finish
and not getting a victory, the public will again call into question
the integrity of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hurts me that this happened in my sport,'' Steward
said. ``People spent millions of dollars on this fight. We owe it
to them to make sure things like this don't happen. I don't take
this lightly. This is a disgrace to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Stanley Christodolou of South Africa scored the fight,
116-113, for Lewis. Judge Eugenia Williams of New Jersey scored the
fight, &QC; 115-113, for Holyfield and judge Larry O'Connell of Britain
scored the fight 115-115. It was one of the most controversial
decisions in a big-time fight in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was interviewed by Fox Sports following the bout,
said she didn't have a problem with her scoring. She was the only
judge to give Holyfield the fifth round, a round in which Lewis
landed a big right hand on the top of Holyfield's head and pinned
him on the ropes with a barrage of unanswered punches for 45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she based her final score on the number of punches
that Holyfield threw during the fight. According to Compubox punch
statistics, Holyfield landed only 130 of 385 punches, while Lewis
landed 348 of 613 punches. When informed that Holyfield threw fewer
punches than Lewis, Williams said she was merely doing her job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care what the public saw,'' Williams said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fight was broadcast live on TVKO pay-per-view to more than 1
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in the minority in her view that Holyfield (36-3-1)
won the bout. Even Holyfield's trainer, Don Turner, thought the
fight was a draw. ``I had Evander losing five of the first seven
rounds, but I had him winning the rest of the fight,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, 36, wasn't sure whether it should have been a draw.
``I haven't seen the fight yet,'' he said. ``When I watch it, I'll
let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Holyfield did not fight the right fight to beat
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to fight more inside, but he could never get
inside,'' Turner said. ``He was never able to land more than one
punch at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox fights better tall than any fighter I've ever seen. He
leans back more away from punches. He fought a very different fight
than I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield didn't look to be in good shape as he left the
post-fight news conference early Sunday morning. A doctor gave him
ice for various parts of his aching body and he remained standing
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Turner denied reports that Holyfield was treated early Sunday
morning for injured ribs, but he did confirm that Holyfield
suffered severe cramps in his legs during the bout beginning in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, Lewis, 33, fought a smart fight. He kept
Holyfield away with his jab and when Holyfield did manage to get
inside, Lewis tied him up so that he couldn't land any punches.
Holyfield also missed on several looping lefts and rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and the style was too much for him,'' Steward said.
``Evander was missing punches by two feet. That's just Lennox's
size and style.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis (34-1-1) did what he needed to do to walk away with the
undisputed heavyweight title, but he left it in the judges' hands
by not knocking out Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's prediction of a third-round knockout never
materialized, even though he picked up the action more in that
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did predict I would knock him out in the third round,''
Holyfield said. ``I was wrong. Maybe in the next fight.'' &QL;

 (ATTN: Fla., N.C., Ala., La.)  (Eds: This is Southern Exposure, a Southeast-oriented weekly
political notebook from the Washington Bureau of the New York Times
Regional Newspapers.) (js) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ed Flex is a hot topic on Capitol Hill these days,
but that isn't the name of a new member of Congress. It is
congressional shorthand for the educational flexibility bill at the
center of a political fight as Democrats and Republicans try to
outdo one another on school issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to score points on a subject traditionally dominated by
Democrats, Republicans are aggressively pushing an education
agenda, trying to one-up their rivals on an issue that resonates
with parents. But Democrats will not cede ground willingly as a
recent congressional debate illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans trumpeted the Education Flexibility Partnership Act,
a bill that would give local school districts greater freedom to
determine how to spend federal education money. They figure that's
a better message to sell to voters than earlier attempts to abolish
the federal Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local schools do more when Washington bureaucracies do less,
and that is what this bill does,'' declared Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many Democrats support the idea of more flexibility
for schools, they're not making it easy for Republicans. In both
the House and Senate, Democrats tried unsuccessfully to broaden the
legislation, proposing, for example, that it provide for the hiring
of 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Democrats joined Republicans to pass the initial
version of the bill, but more votes _ and skirmishes _ are likely
before the measure heads to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were clearly frustrated that Democrats didn't just
play along. ``This is a clean bill and it should be kept clean,''
said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., said a provision for more teachers
was an essential part of any education bill, insisting that her
party only wanted to improve the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH LUCK
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes companies may have run out of luck on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Two days of hearings highlighted the misleading promotions
sweepstakes companies often engage in, sending out letters that
strongly suggest to unsuspecting recipients that they have already
won a fortune. The catch? Buy a magazine subscription.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many consumers wind up with lots more to
read, but less money. And lawmakers said the elderly, who can be
more trusting and starved for attention, are frequently the victims
of such schemes, pouring their life savings into magazine
subscriptions and even traveling to pick up their non-existent
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal laws must be strengthened to prevent companies from
sending deceptive mailings, and to alert consumers that purchases
do not increase the likelihood they will win a major prize,'' said
Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   While executives from Publishers Clearing House, Reader's Digest
Association Inc., Time Inc., and American Family Enterprises
defended their practices as legitimate, lawmakers were skeptical
and promised tough new regulation of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   STATES' RIGHTS (AND WRONGS)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans love to talk about letting state and local
governments do their thing without any meddling from the federal
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes an issue that hits close to home with a key GOP
constituency and, suddenly, federal action doesn't seem like such a
bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., recently introduced a bill that would
prohibit individual cities from filing some lawsuits against gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Five cities _ Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New Orleans and
Bridgeport, Conn. - already sued gun manufacturers, arguing they
hold some liability for crimes committed with their weapons. The
National Rifle Association, which supports Barr's bill, believes
those lawsuits infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Barr agreed. ``If we stand by idly while law-abiding firearms
manufacturers are systematically bankrupted by abusive legal
tactics, a disastrous precedent will be set,'' said Barr, who
described the lawsuits as a product of a ``unholy alliance''
between lawyers, mayors and anti-gun activists.
</P>
<P>
   DEAN'S LIST
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Republican Bob Livingston didn't just leave
the speaker's chair temporarily vacant; he was also the senior
member of the Louisiana House delegation. Now GOP Rep. Billy Tauzin
will fill that role and he wants the post to be more than simply
ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tauzin, a former Democrat now in his 11th term,
said the wheeling-and-dealing Cajun wants state lawmakers to think
more like a cohesive group and put their collective muscle behind
measures with Louisiana significance. Their first test could be a
proposal to return more offshore oil royalties to states that bear
the impact of the drilling.

 ANALYSIS: CLINTON PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY MERELY SHUFFLES DEBT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Seldom has any proposal been more technically
bewildering and tactically effective than President Clinton's plan
to rescue Social Security.
<P>
   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan found himself
flummoxed trying to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's been an unfortunate set of _ well, I'll
say bookkeeping going on here, which _ let me see if I can clarify
exactly what is happening ...,'' Greenspan told a House
subcommittee early in March. He finally gave up, directing members
to some charts instead.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the plan looks simple: Clinton would devote 62
percent of the $4.5 trillion budget surplus projected over the next
15 years to help secure the retirement of the 76-million-member
Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, Clinton seems to address a problem that has
bedeviled armies of analysts and politicians for years, while
avoiding every painful or controversial measure _ from raising
payroll taxes to cutting benefits to making a transition to a
funded system _ that most experts thought were unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans found themselves outfoxed yet again, forced to agree
that they, too, want to devote the surpluses to America's favorite
federal program. Their hopes for huge tax cuts were quashed.
</P>
<P>
   But if saving Social Security was this easy, why didn't anyone
think of it before? Through a year of White House forums on Social
Security reform, attended by Clinton himself, nothing resembling
his plan ever came up.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker bluntly put it
in a report, the Clinton proposal ``does not represent a Social
Security reform plan'' and ``does not have any effect on the
projected cash flow imbalance'' in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Experts widely agree that the plan would not ``save'' Social
Security. Although White House officials say their proposal would
extend its solvency to the middle of the next century _ by adding
an astounding $2.8 trillion to its trust fund _ they concede that
the plan would not extend by even one day the critical date 14
years from now when the program runs short of cash to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan adopts such a novel approach that it took budget
experts a while to figure it out, but most agree that it boils down
to an accounting illusion. ``It's not as if it's doing anything
real,'' said Jagadeesh cq  &LR; Gokhale, a Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland economist.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, Clinton's plan would devote 62 percent of the huge
budget surpluses to rescue Social Security. As it turns out, the
surpluses are irrelevant to his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president chooses to equate the (money going to Social
Security) to 62 percent of the projected surplus,'' said former
Congressional Budget Office director Rudolph Penner. ``But he could
as easily equate it to 62 percent of the average temperature in
March.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials concede that the plan would credit
Social Security with trillions of new dollars regardless of whether
surpluses materialize.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion of ``saving the surplus for Social Security'' stems
from the long-standing myth of the Social Security trust fund, a
myth that Republicans and Democrats alike have been happy to
propagate since the program began in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security payroll taxes are right now bringing in billions
more dollars than Social Security spends on benefits. That excess
is supposedly held in a ``trust fund'' to pay benefits to future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there is nothing in the trust fund except government
debt. Congress has been spending the Social Security surplus for
years, and depositing bonds, or IOUs, in the trust fund. Although
the government will run a surplus this year of $107 billion, it's
actually a $7 billion deficit if excess Social Security money is
taken off the table.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the projected $4.5 trillion surplus will come
from excess Social Security payroll taxes. So when Clinton promises
to devote 62 percent of that surplus to Social Security, he is
simply using Social Security's own money to ``save'' Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those revenues will not be enough to prevent huge
shortfalls when Baby Boomers start retiring, so the administration
plan goes one step further.
</P>
<P>
   The plan takes the money that will accumulate from excess Social
Security payroll taxes _ $2.3 trillion _ and credits that to the
trust fund. It then turns around and says 62 percent of the entire
surplus _ including the Social Security money already counted _
will also be credited to Social Security _ another $2.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   But most of that money was already credited to the trust fund
the first time around. Clinton is crediting it again _ which is why
critics accuse Clinton of ``double counting'' the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Social Security trust fund gets a vast pool of
money _ $5.1 trillion in all _ that extends its solvency on paper
from 2033 to 2055.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most of the 62 percent _ the extra $2.8 trillion
_ appears out of nowhere. By counting Social Security revenues
twice, the Clinton plan winds up with $5.1 trillion for Social
Security and $1.7 trillion for new spending _ a total of $6.8
trillion from a projected surplus of $4.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is creating money out of thin air,'' Penner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration budget chief Jack Yew disputed charges of
double-counting, saying Republicans wanted &LR;  to spend Social
Security surpluses on tax cuts. ``Suddenly, what we do is called
double counting,'' Yew said. ``That's a double-standard, not
double-counting.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, White House officials are correct. Congress has
been doing its own version of double counting for years by sending
paper bonds to the trust fund and spending payroll tax revenue for
other things.
</P>
<P>
   However, the administration proposes to take the practice to a
whole new level by crediting phantom money to the Social Security
trust fund to make it appear more solvent.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``real'' surpluses _ the remaining 38 percent, or
$1.7 trillion _ that are expected outside of Social Security taxes,
Clinton would spend those on Medicare, the military and personal
savings accounts. ``None of the on-budget surplus is devoted to
Social Security, so you can't say you're improving Social
Security'' by using the surplus, said Gokhale, the Cleveland Fed
economist.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new money'' going to Social Security is simply a
bookkeeping credit of additional bonds to the trust fund. Adding
bonds _ which represent debt, or a promise to pay _ to the trust
fund does nothing to change the 2013 date when the hard cash coming
in from Social Security payroll taxes will no longer cover the hard
cash going out as benefit checks.
</P>
<P>
   That shortfall remains; Taxes will cover only about 75 percent
of benefits for future retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds have no real assets behind them, other than the
government's promise to redeem them. They are not cash. They are
debt, and for the government to come up with the cash to pay the
obligation they represent _ Social Security benefits _ it would
have to raise taxes or cut benefits or slash other spending. Those
are the same old ``hard choices'' that have haunted Social Security
all along.
</P>
<P>
   The administration concedes as much in its February budget.
``These (Social Security trust fund) balances are available to
finance future benefit payments ... but only in a bookkeeping
sense,'' the budget says on page 337. ``They do not consist of real
economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund
benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when
redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from
the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The
existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by
itself, have any impact on the government's ability to pay
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is by adding trillions of dollars of paper IOUs to this
same trust fund that the administration claims to be shoring up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the plan would just shuffle debt from one government
account to another, paying off Treasury bonds with one hand and
adding bonds to Social Security's trust fund with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the purpose of this accounting maneuver
is to ``hide'' some of the cash surplus, since politicians won't
raid anything earmarked for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the cash coming in will go to pay off the Treasury
debt. Then the nation will be in a better financial position in the
future when it needs to borrow to pay Social Security benefits.
``We're locking the surplus into debt reduction for Social
Security,'' Yew said.
</P>
<P>
   But all this would happen without Clinton's plan. Surpluses will
automatically go to retire government debt, without any new
accounting. Clinton would actually slow debt reduction because his
new spending eats up 38 percent of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts question whether shuffling debt from the Treasury
to the Social Security trust fund serves any purpose. ``It doesn't
matter where the debt is held,'' Gokhale said. ``It still has to be
serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   All those IOUs sitting in Social Security's trust fund will
eventually come due, and the only way to pay them is to borrow,
raise taxes, cut spending or inflate them away. This is the vexing
core of Social Security's dilemma, and Clinton does not address it.
</P>
<P>
   What do Republicans have to say? Taken by surprise, they at
first just embraced Clinton's popular promise to save 62 percent of
future surpluses for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But that promise is as meaningless as Clinton's. So now the GOP
leadership has agreed to remove Social Security revenues from
surplus calculations and forgo tax cuts. That does nothing to save
Social Security, but it shields Republicans from accusations that
they are raiding the program.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond taking Social Security revenues off the table,
Republicans are afraid to move on actual reform. ``That's about as
far as we've gotten,'' said a Senate GOP aide.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans would like to adopt some form of private
individual accounts, allowing workers to invest a portion, say 2
percent, of their payroll taxes in their own Social Security
retirement accounts. They see this as a way to allow workers to
build wealth and start putting real assets into the system rather
than trust-fund bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Several moderate Democrats support the idea, including Sens. Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and John
Breaux of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Some plans would tap Social Security's surpluses to finance the
accounts. But that would still leave the program with a future cash
shortfall. Painful cost savings would be needed, from raising the
retirement age, to forcing state workers into Social Security, to
lifting the ceiling on income subject to payroll taxes, to reducing
the inflation measure that lifts benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fault line in the Republican party right now is ...
can you do Social Security reform and not touch benefits ever,''
said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``Most of the Republicans would like
to say, `We don't want to touch benefits or raise taxes,' but I
don't know how you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said Republicans are scared that ``if they walk out and
do anything on benefits, they'll just get hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats generally back Clinton's pain-free extension of the
trust fund's life. But they fear Clinton also may have created a
Trojan Horse for private accounts with two other ideas in his plan:
investing some Social Security money in the stock market and
``USA'' savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   With just this in mind, Republicans have mostly praised
Clinton's plan as a positive step that opens the debate on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm emphasizing the things we're in sync on,'' said Rep. Jim
Kolbe, R-Ariz. ``He acknowledges there's a problem, acknowledges we
need to do something now and acknowledges that personal accounts
are feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, privatization advocates are counting on the
public never figuring out Clinton's plan. ``The public doesn't
understand the details, other than that the president said it was
OK to invest in the stock market and to have individual accounts,''
said Michael Tanner, head of the Cato Institute's project on Social
Security privatization.

 Community Activist Offers High-Tech Help
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As one of Silicon Valley's pioneering computer scientists,
former Cisco Systems &UR;  &LR; executive Bob Burnett helped create the vast
network of technology &UR;  &LR; that links the world today.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Burnett is trying to help link networks of humans so that
they can better deal with the world's biggest technological
dilemma, the Year 2000 computer problem, which he also had a hand
in creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're lucky, this is just going to be a blip,'' said
Burnett, who chairs a volunteer Year 2000 committee that is
advising the Berkeley city manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious problem, but it's something we can manage,'' he
said. ``But you have to hold everybody's feet to the fire.
Everybody's got to take it seriously, and there's got to be
critical oversight of every single public services provider.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, 58, vice president of engineering for networking firm
Cisco from 1988 to 1991, brings a combination of high-tech
expertise and community activism &UR;  &LR; to the Y2K problem. The problem
stems from a programming shortcut that may cause computer systems
to misinterpret the year 2000 as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is credited with expanding the city of Berkeley's focus
from just fixing city computer systems to developing contingency
plans to deal with potential wider scale disruptions in power,
water and food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at the internal issues, but we weren't focused
on the broader issues until Bob approached us,'' said Deputy City
Manager Phil Kamlarz. ``He and his committee opened our eyes.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Burnett also has addressed the state Legislature about the need
to upgrade 911 emergency systems to make them Y2K ready and has
spoken to church and community groups to help prepare the city's
low-income, disabled and elderly residents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Last month, Burnett was a featured speaker at a two-day
Oakland symposium that focused on getting neighborhoods and
communities prepared to help residents weather any Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to host a cable TV call-in show for Berkeley
residents called ``Y2K and Your PC'' scheduled for broadcast at 7
p.m. March 30 on the city's community access channel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike the army of Y2K pundits and consultants who have
sprung from the woodwork lately, Burnett says he's not out to make
a name or a quick buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a consultant; I don't have a book; I don't have a Web
site,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to. Born in Hollywood, raised in Newport Beach,
educated at Stanford University and able to retire comfortably from
Cisco Systems at age 50, the Berkeley resident already is living
the California dream.
</P>
<P>
   He's a self-described ``Quaker pacifist'' who since his
retirement has devoted his time as a consultant to nonprofit groups
on projects that ``involve spirituality, philanthropy and social
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he chairs a West Berkeley youth center and served
on an Alameda County committee that reviewed ways to convert the
Alameda Naval Air Station for civilian use. He also co-chairs
Responsible Wealth, a group trying to raise awareness among
``wealthy individuals about the growing gap between the rich and
poor around us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett is not a newcomer to trying to fix the Year 2000
problem. And had the world's computer programmers heeded warnings
by Burnett and others in the mid-1960s, the only worry come New
Year's Eve might have been whether there was enough champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, data still was entered into computers on punch cards,
which because of tight space restrictions used only the last two
digits of a year. This assumed that the first two digits would
always be ``19.''
</P>
<P>
   As these programs began to be rewritten in the
computer-mainframe language COBOL in the mid-1960s, Burnett said he
and other members of the worldwide COBOL standards body
unsuccessfully tried to push for expanding the ``year'' field to
four digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other parts of the industry were basically opposed to this''
because it was too time-consuming, said Burnett, who was at the
time a software programmer and manager for computer-maker Burroughs
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said the U.S. Department of Defense, at a time
when the Cold War was hot, was concerned because ``they had this
huge body of code they would have to go in and change.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett went on to work for Stanford Research Institute,
Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. and IBM. He joined Cisco Systems in
1988 just when the company that makes equipment linking computer
networks was starting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, newer computer programs that replaced older ones
continued using only two-digit year fields.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Burnett got involved in the Year 2000 problem again
when he approached the Berkeley City Council offering his help in
assessing what the city and its residents face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that because of my experience, I know a lot about it
that can be helpful and I'm definitely not panicked about it,'' he
said. ``It's something we really need to take seriously, and I
think we're doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   His committee, which will issue a report to the council next
month, has surveyed the Y2K plans for services like PG&AMP;E, East Bay
Municipal Utilities District and BART.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Burnett said he's encouraged by the progress made by
companies and utilities so far in fixing the Y2K problem. Still, he
remains cautious because he knows from experience that now's not
the time to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the experience of doing very large systems
integrations,'' Burnett said. ``And even if everybody works
diligently, almost always there's some strange stuff that happens
because there are so many different parts that have to be
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett tries to help residents who are panicked about Y2K, but
he says his wife, psychotherapist Kathy Barry, ``is better at
reassuring them than I.''

 BioScope/Tom Abate  
 All-Day Party to Honor the Discovery That Launched Biotech 
 Revolution 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Roughly a thousand people turned out Saturday for an all-day
celebration held at the University of California at Berkeley to
commemorate the scientific discovery that launched the biotech
industry 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1974 that Stanford geneticist Stanley Cohen and UC San
Francisco biochemist Herbert W. Boyer discovered the technique for
snipping a strand of DNA from one organism and pasting it into
another organism. The process gave scientists a new way to create
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the early applications of this discovery was using
bacteria as a factory to grow human insulin for diabetics.
Previously, insulin for diabetes drugs came from pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Since its earliest days, the specter of cutting and splicing the
master code of life has caused both excitement and apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event was billed as a chance to discuss not just the
scientific but the social, commercial and ethical dimensions of the
biotech revolution with a dozen distinguished speakers including
three Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   The most informing and entertaining part of the day was the
early morning tutorial held by UC Berkeley extension lecturer
Desmond Mascarenhas. The biotech entrepreneur held a three-hour
lecture on the basics of DNA technology for about 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mascarenhas explained the Human Genome Project, an effort to map
all the information in human DNA, by comparing DNA to a cassette
tape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like the tape, DNA is a long strand of information. And just
as a tape contains several songs, DNA is comprised of units, called
genes, that control various bodily processes from digesting food to
determining the color of a baby's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling tape from a cassette in his hand, Mascarenhas noted that
the pauses between songs are invisible to the eye. Yet they are
detectable by the playback head on the tape deck. In simple terms,
the Human Genome Project is trying to detect the start and stop
points of the roughly 100,000 genes in DNA. If scientists can
identify these genetic songs, perhaps they'll be able to do things
like turn off the genes that cause cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The audience more than doubled in size for the star-studded
afternoon session, which started with a keynote speech from James
Watson, who earned a 1962 Nobel Prize for his co-discovery of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Watson's speech was a disappointment. He has been one of the
main proponents of the federally funded Human Genome Project and
listeners had every reason to expect that he would explain the
importance of the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Watson used his pulpit to deliver a rambling commentary
on his career, punctuated by slides picturing his many scientific
cronies.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the panel discussion showed only occasional signs of
life, despite the impressive array of speakers, which included
William Rutter, chairman of Chiron Corp., and Jay Michael Bishop,
chancellor of UCSF.
</P>
<P>
   One question from the audience that created a stir was whether
genetically engineered foods should be labelled as such.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling has been popular in Europe, but in the United States
(outside of Berkeley) it has not been much of an issue. While other
panelists equivocated, Watson delivered a flat no. Labeling, he
said ``caters to the people who cry wolf when there is no proof
that a wolf exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Paul Rabinow, a UC Berkeley sociologist who has studied
the biotech industry, delivered a provocative observation when he
challenged the underpinnings of bioethics. In the past two decades,
said Rabinow, the field of bioethics has arisen to tackle questions
raised by medical and biotech advances _ such as when to pull the
plug on brain-dead patients on respirators, or whether it is proper
to choose the sex of a baby during in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   All very interesting issues, Rabinow said, particularly to the
lawyers, doctors and hospital administrators who make such
decisions _ not to mention the patients and families involved.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that bioethics has evaded other less-glamorous
but more important questions, such as why a society that is
spending billions to map the genome allows millions of people to go
without health insurance or the most rudimentary health care.

Vince ``Vega'' Nicholas unabashedly offers virtual voyeurs a
glimpse into his dorm room at San Francisco State. He alternately
mugs at a Web camera and trades one-liners in an online chat area.
</P>
<P>
   A shameless exhibitionist? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   A self-promoter who was chosen to be a guinea pig for new Web
site  &LR; www.webdorm.com &LR;  that chronicles the lives of selected
college students a la MTV's ``The Real World''? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Internet meets `The Real World' _ but without the
mandatory gay character,'' said Nicholas, 21, one of two dozen
college students nationwide who were picked to ``star'' on
WebDorm.com, a commercial Web site. ``People always bring up the
concern of being watched 24-7. I've heard the term Big Brother
being tossed around. But I think technology is something that
shouldn't be feared. It's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 miles away, at the University of Miami, a freshman
named Diva smiles into the watchful eye of a Web camera. The gabby
Marin County native said she doesn't mind sharing her life with the
World Wide Web 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think they're my best friend, which is both
strange and cool. They ask me to smile and wave at the camera,''
said Diva, 19, who declined to give her full name. ``There are some
weirdos who want to get too friendly, but online chat is as
friendly as I'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, WebDorm has installed tiny spherical cameras in
dorm rooms across the country that transmit snapshots to its Web
site every 30 seconds. Typically, each participant is photographed
by a single, fixed camera that cannot be turned off. The WebDormers
_ who use aliases such as NeonQueen and Sassy _ chat online with
visitors, post their musings in journals and receive messages in a
``guest book'' area.
</P>
<P>
   WebDorm stems from the growing popularity of Web cameras, as
well as the widespread use of the Internet among the
twentysomething crowd, according to Alex Chriss, the 21-year-old
Marin resident and Tufts University senior who created WebDorm.
</P>
<P>
   His motivation _ besides signing up advertisers _ is to dispel
the stereotype of What he calls the ``lazy, party-animal'' college
coed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hundreds of would-be WebDormers have filled out e-mail
questionnaires in hopes of being placed under a cyber microscope,
but only a few outgoing individuals have made the grade. Their
motivation isn't money _ the participants aren't paid though they
get to keep the $100 cameras after a semester _ but rather
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's legal, anything goes,'' Chriss said. ``Someone
may occasionally moon the camera. This isn't scripted. It may be
boring, but sometimes college life can be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on several days of viewing dorm rooms in California,
Florida, New England and the Great Lakes, &UR;  &LR; somnambulate might be
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which typically are fixed on desks in empty rooms,
offer small, fuzzy pictures with no sound. When WebDormers are
present _ many of the New England students were on spring break
last week _ the chief form of communication is online chats that
consist of inane chatter about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   A typical exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey (fill in the blank), wazzup?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much, bro. I'm hella tired. :-)''
</P>
<P>
   At least the characters from ``Seinfeld'' were funny when they
talked about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that hasn't stopped WebDorm from gaining a cult
following. ``It's somewhere to hang out and talk about college,''
said one self-admitted ``lurker,'' who asked not to be identified.
``I feel like I know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a fourth of all adult cybersurfers in the United States
are college students, according to CollegeClub.com, a portal site
 &LR; in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site and the Web in general are natural ways for students
to interact outside the walls of college,'' said Clay Shirky,
professor of new media at Hunter College in New York. ``College
students have plenty of time, and university networks have plenty
of bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Web cameras to record mundane, day-to-day activities
isn't new. Jennifer ( &LR; www.jennicam.com &LR; ), a 22-year-old free-lance
Web site designer, has chosen to be under the virtual surveillance
of four cameras for nearly three years from her Washington, D.C.,
apartment. The site requires a $15 annual subscription to view.
</P>
<P>
   And various campuses, including Stanford University, have Web
cams set up in public locales such as a dorm lounge or cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WebDorm is taking a slightly different approach, however. It
is presenting a sort of online episodic TV show patterned after
``The Real World,'' which documented the angst-ridden travails of a
group of twentysomethings for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching the show `Friends' and after the episode,
chatting live with Jennifer Aniston or Courtney Cox,'' said Farhan
Memon, co-founder of Yack.com, an online viewing guide in
Emeryville, who has viewed WebDorm. &UR;  &LR; ``The interactive element of
WebDorm makes this more than voyeurism; it is interactive
voyeurism. This transcends normal programming and becomes an
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure. They ar &LR; gue that WebDorm is the type of
navel-gazing, narcissistic Web site that glorifies vanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to the limits of living vicariously; it's the
height of visceral experiences,'' said Elizabeth Ferrarini, author
of ``Confessions of an Infomaniac.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we see an explosion of pay-for-view
porn sites like these,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is an alarmist view that San Francisco State's Nicholas
shares, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebDorm is pretty much built on trust and good people sharing
a service, like eBay,'' Nicholas said. ``Maybe if this gets bigger,
the weirdos and stalkers will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's cool,'' he said.

 Egghead Ads Marry Web, TV Technologies
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
There has been a lot of talk about the marketing potential of
``convergence'' between television and the Internet _ but not much
to show for it. The concept becomes more meaningful today, however,
with the airing on cable channel ZDTV of an apparently ordinary
commercial for computer and software merchant Egghead.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot, which will promote a monitor and two
computers being sold via Egghead.com's auction site, employs a
melding of Web and TV technologies that allows the ad to be altered
just minutes before airtime.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, Egghead sends product information and images from
its Web site over the Internet to ZDTV, or ZDTV can take the data
directly from Egghead's site. The Web content is converted into a
television-friendly signal and plugged into a template that
resembles the Egghead site. The whole package is then served up as
an ad _ completely bypassing the cumbersome and expensive use of
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  This process, which takes less than five minutes, will allow
Egghead to show the highest customer bid on each product in
mid-auction, &UR;  &LR; a feature that is expected to drive impulse shoppers
to the site in search of that $96 printer or $1,200 laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, created by New York agency Digital Pulp, display a
changing selection of products. Initially the spots will only say
``Bids start $1,'' but after some practice runs, they will show
actual bids.
</P>
<P>
   The technique lets Egghead staff decide at the last minute which
products to peddle in the ad. That's important because demand for
the high-tech gizmos on Egghead's auction can be volatile, moving
up or down appreciably in just a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional TV ads typically take weeks or months to create and
distribute. Even a simple Web banner ad can take up to two weeks to
get out the door, said John Brodeur, Egghead's chief marketing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that one day, memory (products are) really hot,''
said Brodeur. ``If the prices are going up and we have a lot in
stock, we can let people know they can get a great deal. Or we
might just have a great buy on some off-price IBM desktop computers
that we just purchased that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to off-load new merchandise before taking possession
of it will save Egghead the expense of shipping and storing it,
Brodeur added. Instead, Egghead's supplier often will be able to &LR; 
 &LR; ship purchases directly to the winning bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the absolute ultimate in latitude,'' said Brodeur,
whose site is the Web's ninth-most visited shopping destination,
according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Egghead intends to run 12 of these ``live-content'' ads each
day through the end of 1999 _ an unusually long run considering
that ad campaigns normally last just two or three months. The
e-commerce site Onsale has purchased air time for similar ads,
according to ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a similar 30-second spot on video would ``easily take
four hours'' of work in an expensive production facility and then
would have to be physically distributed, said Dave Seedall, ZDTV
vice president of engineering and operations, who developed the
live-content process over about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Simply aiming a TV camera at a computer monitor displaying the
Egghead site doesn't work because the images and text don't show up
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Groft, corporate media director for the San Francisco
advertising agency Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney, said the new technology is
beneficial but limited.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, ZDTV, a 24-hour channel dedicated to computer
news that was launched last year by magazine publisher Ziff-Davis,
reaches only 10 million households, compared with nearly 100
million for a national network.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the technique is best suited for advertising ``a very
targeted product to a very targeted consumer,'' Groft said. ``It
would work best for a limited-time product or excess inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad executive Ed Dilworth sees the live-content ads as an interim
step on the way to true convergence, which is more likely to be
seen on WebTV or direct (satellite) TV rather than a cable operator
like ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it could work in the future is, for example, I'm
watching a basketball game, and while I'm watching, I can click to
order tickets or buy a jersey,'' said Dilworth, chief executive of
San Francisco's Arnold Ingalls Moranville.
</P>
<P>
   ``ZDTV's application sounds interesting, but it's only a step in
the ultimate direction,'' he said.

 Project Oxygen May Blow Away Web Speeds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Neil Tagare is the Don Quixote of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the globe, the 37-year-old telecommunications
expert is proposing what many consider unfathomable: A $10 billion,
100,000-mile worldwide network that he claims will be up to 5.5
million times faster than the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Internet to flourish, it needs to become as
ubiquitous, fast and reliable as the phone system,'' Tagare said.
``Slow (transmission) speeds are deterring its growth among many
users and companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen ( &LR; www.oxygen.org &LR; ) _ a commercial venture that
hopes to leapfrog the nonprofit Internet2 _ would pump video, sound
and data at neck-snapping speed to users in 78 countries. The
underwater network of fiber-optic cables will traverse the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I call the project Oxygen because, like air, it is something
you have to have to live,'' Tagare said in a phone interview last
week from Bermuda, where Project Oxygen Ltd. is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Tagare is pursuing funding from private investors and bank
loans. His small organization has deals with 40 telecom carriers,
including Global Crossing Ltd. of Beverly Hills, who have bought
into the network. Lehman Brothers Inc. is Project Oxygen's
financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most mind-boggling, ambitious online project yet, and
it has exciting possibilities,'' said Greg Wood, spokesman for
Internet2 in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggest Tagare's plan is too mind-blowing and that the
former Nynex executive is flailing at high-tech windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that can go wrong,'' said analyst
Abhi Chaki of Jupiter Communications in New York. ``First, you have
to raise a lot of money and sign landing contracts with about 100
countries. Then, you have to complete undersea construction. Once
you've done all that, you have to keep the network up and running
at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dave Howard, chief engineer of Project Oxygen, admits, ``We
have a huge undertaking that encompasses all types of technology,
different companies and various cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the payoff is enormous,'' Howard adds. ``Eventually, every
consumer on the planet will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Against stiff odds, Tagare created a global network once before.
</P>
<P>
   FLAG (Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe), completed in 1996,
transmits vast amounts of data over high-speed phone lines directly
from Europe to the Far East. FLAG was the first privately funded
undersea telecom system. With the financial assistance of Nynex and
Tagare's persistence, the $1.6 billion project took seven and a
half years to construct.
</P>
<P>
   Project Oxygen will take nearly as long to build.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in mid-1997, it will undergo several phases before it
is completed in early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage, linking 20 countries that stretch from the
United States to the United Kingdom and Germany, will be completed
in six months at a hefty price tag of $3 billion. Tagare said he
already has raised $1.8 billion of that from investors, loans and
corporate sponsors such as Lucent, Pacific Telesis, Japan's NEC and
France's Alcatel.
</P>
<P>
   Once the pipeline is in place, the Oxygen organization hopes to
sell space on its network to telecommunications carriers,
corporations, broadcasters and Internet service providers (and
ultimately, consumers). Project Oxygen would be responsible for
maintaining the network.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Oxygen will ``allow anyone _ large corporation, cable
operator, Internet service provider _ to participate in the world's
fastest Internet service,'' Tagare said. ``It is not an exclusive
club for universities and selected companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The subtle dig is at Internet2, a coalition of universities and
high-tech companies formed in late 1996. Last month, it flipped the
switch on a key segment of its private research network that
connects 70 college campuses. The nonprofit organization includes
Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and
Harvard University, as well as major corporate sponsors Cisco
Systems, IBM, Qwest Communications and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-mile Internet2 network is up to 45,000 times faster
than the commercial Web, but it is not available to the public.
Only researchers and employees at the colleges and corporate
sponsors can use it. Consumers eventually will be able to use
cutting-edge applications created on Internet2 but only after they
have been developed and sold by Internet2 members for commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen, Internet2 and a similar project, the government-backed
Next Generation Internet, are modeled after the original Internet _
except they all use fiber-optic circuits instead of standard
telephone lines.

WILDCATTING IN 3-D  
 BY REBECCA SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a darkened theater at Chevron offices in San Ramon, an oil
geologist raptly watches a 3-D picture glide across a 28-foot
curved screen. The image shows water gradually invading an oil
reservoir deep beneath the earth's surface in Nigeria.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the mid-1960s, Chevron has extracted hundreds of millions
of barrels of ``sweet crude'' from the reservoir. But daily
production has slumped to fewer than 5,000 barrels from 23,000
barrels, as wells have become flooded with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's plenty of oil left,'' said Marcia Houghton,
Chevron's reservoir manager for Nigeria. ``The problem is getting
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, using newly developed 3-D visualization technology, her
team is testing whether yields can be boosted by increasing
underground pressure. The plan is to add water-injection wells at
strategic points to push the ``black gold'' to existing wells, much
the way sheepdogs push straggling sheep to a pasture gate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, test results look good. If things go according to plan,
the oil company's investment of less than $10 million for the new
injection wells could net $600 million worth of additional oil in
coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visualization technology lets us optimize the money we
spend,'' said Don Paul, Chevron's vice president of technology.
``It significantly reduces the uncertainty that's an inherent part
of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that visualization technology represents
the next big breakthrough in oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   It builds on improvements in seismic mapping, which uses sound
waves to plot the location of liquids, gases and minerals, and weds
it to production data and state-of-the-art graphics software.
</P>
<P>
   Using special projection equipment _ not to mention 3-D glasses
_ the result is a depiction of the total oil reservoir that appears
to float in space and can be tipped to show different perspectives
and manipulated to play out different scenarios. Test wells, for
instance, can be drilled or capped. And faults can be explored to
see how oil flows through them or around them.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-D images allow a team of experts to make decisions about
where and how to drill. End result: fewer wells that produce more
oil, more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry has been using computer-assisted visualization
tools for at least 20 years with the best computers available. The
motivation is strong because oil wells are expensive, costing
anywhere from $50,000 to several million dollars to drill.
</P>
<P>
   What's new is the ability to put information in a 3-D format and
make the tool available to an interdisciplinary team of experts in
geology, drilling and equipment design.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield was the first oil company to unveil a 3-D
visualization center, in March 1997. During the next 18 months,
Texaco, Chevron and Exxon got their centers up and running.
Chevron's San Ramon theater has been open only a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology will fundamentally change the way we do
exploration, develop reservoirs and even the way we manage our
operations,'' said Geoffrey Dorn, Arco's director of visualization
technology. ``We're applying it to geology first, but it'll
eventually change facilities designs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is taking its cues from other capital-intensive
businesses that are pushing the frontiers of 3-D design. The
semiconductor, automotive and aerospace industries, for example,
have used visualization technology to make operating models of
chips, cars and jets. Those models can detect design flaws before
products actually are made, reducing modification costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, experts expect the oil industry to use 3-D
technology not just to find oil in unseen places, but to improve
designs for drilling rigs and oil platforms and possibly for
refineries and service stations.
</P>
<P>
   Visualization technology would make sense in any era, but it's
especially important now with oil at half the price it fetched a
year ago. At Chevron, executives are keenly aware that they must
make investment dollars stretch further since earnings fell 39
percent last year. Though prices have risen this month, with
expectations that OPEC will curtail production, cost controls still
are in place.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the industry has taken two approaches to 3-D
visualization.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, like Chevron, rely on powerful workstations and
wraparound screens in theaters seating 20 to 50 people. Massive
amounts of data are crunched by the workstations to create 3-D
images that can be rotated to provide different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The second approach uses ``cave'' technology. Rooms are built
measuring 10- or 12-feet square. The walls, ceiling and floor act
as rear-projection screens. Three or four people can fit
comfortably inside each room, and data can be projected around them
and manipulated to show, for example, how wells might be drilled to
avoid hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. The theaters are
best for bringing together interdisciplinary groups of experts as
well as for making presentations to partnering companies. Chevron
spent $1.2 million to build and equip its two theaters. The second
theater is in La Habra (Orange County).
</P>
<P>
   The caves, which can cost $3 million apiece, are more complex.
They use supercomputer technology and are better suited to research
labs, which is why Arco's center is located at its research and
development center in Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of Chevron's system is IBM RS-6000 workstations.
For the Nigeria test, they've been loaded up with more than 30
years' worth of reservoir performance data and the best seismic
information available.
</P>
<P>
   To handle all the information, the reservoir is broken into
football-field sized cells or blocks. Thousands of bits of data are
loaded up for each field _ and there are 70,000 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's two theaters were built as part of its
$400-million-a-year budget for information technology. Chevron's
plan is to get more visualization centers deployed around the
company. Eventually, it would like to network them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the way you get value out of advanced
technology is to put it in the hands of people who run the
business, as opposed to putting it in a lab or technology center,''
said Chevron's Paul. ``The key to success is to distribute the
technology and get a wide variety of people interacting with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That means access to the technology is not just limited to
petroleum geologists. People who build facilities and run them also
are expected to test their designs and plans by using the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Industrywide, the continued advances in technology have helped
drive down the costs of oil production during the past 20 years.
Seismic mapping has helped. So has the ability to drill horizontal
wells, or holes that can curve and run sideways.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Chevron spent $15 to $17 to replace each
barrel of oil it produced. Today, technological improvements mean
that it costs only $5 or so to add a barrel of oil to reserves. And
continued advances in technology are expected to drive costs still
lower.
</P>
<P>
   At Arco, the technology already is saving real money.
</P>
<P>
   Before drilling a new well in the North Sea, a team visited
Dorn's visualization center last year. They quickly discovered that
the planned bore hole appeared likely to nick a water strata,
possibly adulterating the well and squandering a $10 million
investment.
</P>
<P>
   After months of work, a single day in the cave forced them to
make huge design changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better here than in the field, though,'' Dorn said.

 MEDICARE'S FATE HINGES ON DEAL FOR DRUG COVERAGE  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not an easy thing, having the fate of the nation's Medicare
program resting in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that awesome responsibility rests right now, to a remarkable
degree, with Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the Haas School of
Business at the University of California at Berkeley. She has one
of two pivotal votes on the National Bipartisan Commission on the
Future of Medicare, which is mulling recommendations for the
biggest overhaul of the $210 billion program since it began in
1965.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Tuesday, Tyson must vote on a proposal, developed by
commission chairman Sen. John Breaux, D-La., that would eventually
corral most of Medicare's senior citizen beneficiaries into managed
care health plans run by private insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democratic backers of the current Medicare
program are pushing for an expansion, to add prescription drug
coverage for the one-in-three elderly Americans who cannot afford
it today.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the possibility of a momentous deal. Call it
the Drug Deal of the Century. As a trade-off for privatizing
Medicare, Congress would add a drug benefit that could cost
taxpayers $20 billion a year, improving the program but chewing up
much of the savings.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Tyson and Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University
health economist who is also considered a swing vote, are holding
out for Breaux to add a drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal now has 10 votes on the 17-member commission.
Rules require 11 votes for approval. So Tyson and Altman are the
focus of an intense lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be the dean of the business school,'' said
Tyson, who served as President Clinton's chief economic adviser
from 1993 to 1996. ``For the last few weeks, this has become a
major issue, trying to decide the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An endorsement by the panel, which was created by Congress to
deal with Medicare's looming financial problems, would give a
bipartisan stamp of approval to Breaux's plan before it is sent to
a Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And for Clinton, whose effort to reform health care proved the
biggest policy failure of his first term, the Medicare plan
represents another chance to leave his mark on the nation's health
care system.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux has been trying to hammer together a drug benefit
proposal to win Tyson and Altman over. ``This is very much a work
in progress,'' he told panel members at the last meeting in
February. ``... What I've tried to do is explore every option in an
attempt to find a middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Breaux feels about adding drug coverage to
Medicare, he cannot add it without alienating Republican members
such as conservative Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. The impasse has
delayed the bipartisan commission report, which was expected on
March 1. The commission plans to meet Tuesday in another attempt to
make a decision, and must disband at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Its decision, however, will shape the debate over health care
reform well into the next century. ``It is likely to kick off a
health care debate as big as any we've had in the last five
years,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Menlo Park-based Kaiser
Family Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing the panel, Altman suggested, may be
insurmountable. ``They have to find how to expand the program, and
cut it back at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux proposal would do to senior citizens what private
employers did to their employees during the past decade _ steer
them into HMOs. Supporters of the plan believe managed care will
dramatically reduce health costs in Medicare, much as it has done
with private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the reform effort is the relentless march of the Baby
Boom generation toward retirement age and the costly medical
problems that accompany it. The population eligible for Medicare is
expected to swell to 76 million by 2030, nearly double the 40
million eligible today.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills is projected to
go bankrupt in 2008 - just before the first Baby Boomers hit
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare's promise of ever-expanding benefits is not
sustainable fiscally, politically or morally,'' wrote David
Kendall, senior analyst for the Progressive Policy Institute of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Medicare system, patients are not limited in
their choice of doctor. Medicare pays most hospital costs and 80
percent of the doctor bills, which are set by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In Breaux's version, Medicare will offer a menu of private
health plans to senior citizens, and guarantee payment for up to 88
percent of the average annual cost of the plans. Many of the plans,
typically HMOs, would be priced at or below the average. There
would be little or no premium cost. But seniors would have to pay
the difference if they wanted a more expensive health plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the idea sounds familiar, it is. Clinton's failed health
insurance reform attempted to apply the same model to provide
coverage to every American. The idea is called ``managed
competition,'' a term coined by Stanford Business School professor
Alain Enthoven.
</P>
<P>
   Although not involved in the current debate, he is on a
sabbatical in England, Enthoven called Breaux's plan a sound
proposal that would steer much of the Medicare population into
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best hope we've got,'' said Enthoven during a
visit to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors fear that Breaux's plan will turn Medicare into a
two-class system of quality health care for the well-to-do,
substandard care for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a political standpoint, it kills the system,'' said Rep.
Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Hayward, perhaps Medicare's fiercest
protector in Congress. ``Over time, poor people and middle-income
people will be shouldering more of the burden. ... We'll have a
very poorly structured, two-tiered system that leaves the oldest
and frailest and sickest bankrupt. That's where we were 30 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco physician Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, of the National
Campaign to Protect, Improve and Expand Medicare, called the Breaux
plan ``a welfare program for the insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer warns that Medicare beneficiaries who currently
enjoy the right to health care will get instead a voucher that will
buy less and less coverage over time.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point out that HMOs have already established a
track record in Medicare, with little to show for it. Roughly one
in seven Medicare beneficiaries is signed up with an HMO today, yet
studies suggest the health plans have cost the federal government
money, rather than saved it.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case on topics as complex as health insurance,
the two sides break on ideological lines. ``This is between people
who believe in the marketplace, versus people who believe in
entitlements,'' said Gail Wilensky, a health policy analyst who
headed the Medicare program during the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   A Breaux plan supporter, Wilensky said the reform effort is a
bid to realign the incentives in the Medicare program toward
cost-effective care. ``The way we try to control spending in the
current Medicare system is through price controls,'' said Wilensky.
To believers, Medicare can benefit from free-market efficiencies in
the same way the airline, energy and communications industries
brought lower costs through deregulation and enhanced competition.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings it back to Berkeley Business School Dean Tyson, the
woman Clinton chose to set his economic agenda. Where does she
stand on the question of market versus price controls?
</P>
<P>
   In the current Medicare system, she said, ``it's the role of
government to establish benefits, establish price and pay bills
around the country. That's an amazing amount of micromanagement.
... It is a very compelling reason for me to think about change.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also worried that the benefits within the Medicare system
will become illusory as pressures increase to reduce costs. ``The
danger is that, although the government says it will continue to
pay for procedures, it will pay less than they cost, and the
services will disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, said Tyson, is now ``at odds'' with the private health
care system on which it was based 30 years ago. ``It doesn't
provide drugs, and it is fee-for-service with controlled prices,''
she said. ``Fee-for-service with controlled prices is something the
private sector is aggressively moving away from.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not the words of a die-hard supporter of the old
Medicare system. ``There's no perfect solution,'' Tyson said. ``I
am personally trying to think of it as a set of policy
trade-offs.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Breaux can deliver the drugs, and that's a
big if, he has a deal.

   ESPIONAGE-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Although the Chinese
nuclear spying scandal may have a big impact on U.S. politics, it

   BUSH-DOLE-REVIEW (Des Moines) _ For all their individual
accomplishments, Elizabeth Dole and George W. Bush would not be
such hot tickets were it not for their pedigrees. But by distancing
themselves from their famous family members, they demonstrate the

<P>
   WHITE-HOUSE-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some political
psychologists and political scientists recommend the appointment of

that some union leaders have been able to jack up their salaries to
excessive levels is that it is often hard for members to find out
exactly what those salaries are. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-TITLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Clinton administration may
have reinvented the federal work force by cutting nearly 400,000

officials. By Stephen Labaton.

HOLD ONTO YOUR CAP TAKING THE CADDY FOR A SPIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Mention Cadillac, and the images that spring to mind
are pretty sedate: Midwestern grandfathers tooling down suburban
roads, perhaps, or chauffeurs in caps holding rear doors open for
wealthy widows carrying sculpted poodles out of Fifth Avenue
co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   These are precisely the images Cadillac is trying to change. The
result has been a series of offbeat _ and sometimes off-key _
efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for Cadillac. The latest:
Cadillac is building a race car to compete next year at Le Mans,
the venerable French race in which entrants try to drive as many
times around a track as possible in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fire-engine red is a popular color for race cars, but Cadillac
will stick to its heritage by painting its entry a shimmery
platinum hue. Still, some compromises are being made. To defray the
cost, Cadillac will allow other sponsors to put their logos on the
car, although Cadillac will insist that they not be gaudy. And
while the rules at Le Mans require that the race cars have two
seats, the Cadillac entry will definitely not include a chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that Le Mans cars must fit two people, but they fit
side by side, not one in the back seat,'' said John F. Smith,
Cadillac's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's corporate parent, General Motors, believes the move
makes sense. After largely ignoring the overseas market for luxury
cars for nearly a century, GM has decided it must fight back
against BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and other rivals by invading their
home markets. GM is trying to establish Cadillac as a global brand,
and while prosperous Americans may not pay much attention to events
like the Indianapolis 500, affluent car buyers in Japan and Europe
do tend to watch car races.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing enthusiasts were nonetheless amused that Cadillac
chose to trumpet its race car plans with an announcement that
began, ``50 years later, Cadillac returns to Le Mans.'' Unlike many
automakers, Cadillac does not have a racing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cadillacs did compete at Le Mans in 1950, and did remarkably
well, beating cars from racing giants like MG, Jaguar and Ferrari.
But both Cadillacs were entered by a wealthy businessman, not by
the manufacturer. For many years, auto racing ``was something the
standard of the world just didn't do,'' said Robert Casey, an auto
historian. ``They didn't need to; they had the North American
market nailed down.'' Cadillac anointed itself as the standard of
the world after winning a much-contested trophy for automotive
design from Britain's Royal Automobile Club in 1908, and has
periodically used the slogan since then in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many other auto manufacturers have genuine racing traditions.
Henry Ford raised the money to start Ford Motor Co. by building a
low, rakish car that won an important car race near Detroit in
1902. Ford did not actually drive the car, instead hiring a
daredevil bicyclist, Barney Oldfield, who learned to drive in the
week before the race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, with his company struggling against dozens of other
tiny automakers, Ford took a hand-built car out onto the fissured
ice of a lake near Detroit and personally drove it faster than
anyone had ever driven: a little over 91 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's feat was never officially recognized as a record. Land
speed records are calculated from a driver's average speed in two
runs across the same terrain with the second run in the opposite
direction to eliminate wind as a factor. Ford, having barely made
it across the rough ice in his first run, never went back. ``He
didn't care; it was worth it for the advertising,'' Casey said.
``He figured if you go faster than anyone else, you have the

   More recently, Honda has built its reputation for good-quality
cars and high-technology engines on its many years of racing
experience. Working in Honda's racing division is still essential
to executive success at the Japanese automaker, where the new V6
engine in the Honda Accord was designed by Katsumi Ichida, an
engineer whose previous assignment involved building race car
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in it to develop the people, the engineers,'' said
Thomas Elliott, Honda's executive vice president of North American
auto operations.
</P>
<P>
   Engines win and lose car races, and Cadillac believes that its
V8 Northstar, which has gotten good reviews from experts, can be
the reliable, high-performance engine it needs to compete at Le
Mans. But the engine will undergo so many modifications for racing
that it will become unrecognizable even to some mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac race car looks a little like a graying Batmobile,
judging from drawings released last week. But in a bid to enhance
future sales, GM designed the car to resemble the Cadillac Evoq, a
prototype coupe that Cadillac is displaying at auto shows this year
and is likely to begin selling in several years. The Evoq and the
race car are painted in a new platinum-colored paint that seems to
change from light to dark and back again depending on the
illumination and the angle from which it is viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac needs all the help it can get. Lincoln nearly outsold
it in the United States last year for the first time in more than
half a century. And some of Cadillac's attempts to change its image
have been failures.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac tried two years ago to woo professional women in their
40s by running television advertisements showing model Cindy
Crawford wearing knee-high boots and a tight, leather mini-dress as
she drove a new Cadillac past the stone walls of a castle. Adweek
described her outfit as a ``Wilma Flintstone-as-dominatrix
get-up,'' and the ads were soon pulled.
</P>
<P>
   But expanding Cadillac's tiny business overseas will be a fresh
start for an aging brand, and Cadillac hopes racing will help it
get off to a fast start abroad. While Americans may have strong
ideas about what a Cadillac is, Smith said, ``Europe and Japan are
a clean sheet of paper.''

   DETROIT _ Mention Cadillac, and the images that spring to mind
are pretty sedate: Midwestern grandfathers tooling down suburban
roads, perhaps, or chauffeurs in caps holding rear doors open for
wealthy widows carrying sculpted poodles out of Fifth Avenue
co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   These are precisely the images Cadillac is trying to change. The
result has been a series of offbeat _ and sometimes off-key _
efforts to build a new, sprier reputation for Cadillac. The latest:
Cadillac is building a race car to compete next year at Le Mans,
the venerable French race in which entrants try to drive as many
times around a track as possible in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fire-engine red is a popular color for race cars, but Cadillac
will stick to its heritage by painting its entry a shimmery
platinum hue. Still, some compromises are being made. To defray the
cost, Cadillac will allow other sponsors to put their logos on the
car, although Cadillac will insist that they not be gaudy. And
while the rules at Le Mans require that the race cars have two
seats, the Cadillac entry will definitely not include a chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that Le Mans cars must fit two people, but they fit
side by side, not one in the back seat,'' said John F. Smith,
Cadillac's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's corporate parent, General Motors, believes the move
makes sense. After largely ignoring the overseas market for luxury
cars for nearly a century, GM has decided it must fight back
against BMW, Mercedes, Lexus and other rivals by invading their
home markets. GM is trying to establish Cadillac as a global brand,
and while prosperous Americans may not pay much attention to events
like the Indianapolis 500, affluent car buyers in Japan and Europe
do tend to watch car races.
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing enthusiasts were nonetheless amused that Cadillac
chose to trumpet its race car plans with an announcement that
began, ``50 years later, Cadillac returns to Le Mans.'' Unlike many
automakers, Cadillac does not have a racing tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cadillacs did compete at Le Mans in 1950, and did remarkably
well, beating cars from racing giants like MG, Jaguar and Ferrari.
But both Cadillacs were entered by a wealthy businessman, not by
the manufacturer. For many years, auto racing ``was something the
standard of the world just didn't do,'' said Robert Casey, an auto
historian. ``They didn't need to; they had the North American
market nailed down.'' Cadillac anointed itself as the standard of
the world after winning a much-contested trophy for automotive
design from Britain's Royal Automobile Club in 1908, and has
periodically used the slogan since then in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Many other auto manufacturers have genuine racing traditions.
Henry Ford raised the money to start Ford Motor Co. by building a
low, rakish car that won an important car race near Detroit in
1902. Ford did not actually drive the car, instead hiring a
daredevil bicyclist, Barney Oldfield, who learned to drive in the
week before the race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, with his company struggling against dozens of other
tiny automakers, Ford took a hand-built car out onto the fissured
ice of a lake near Detroit and personally drove it faster than
anyone had ever driven: a little over 91 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's feat was never officially recognized as a record. Land
speed records are calculated from a driver's average speed in two
runs across the same terrain with the second run in the opposite
direction to eliminate wind as a factor. Ford, having barely made
it across the rough ice in his first run, never went back. ``He
didn't care; it was worth it for the advertising,'' Casey said.
``He figured if you go faster than anyone else, you have the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Honda has built its reputation for good-quality
cars and high-technology engines on its many years of racing
experience. Working in Honda's racing division is still essential
to executive success at the Japanese automaker, where the new V6

FINDING OUT HOW MUCH THE BOSS REALLY MAKES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the railing of unions about income
inequality, some labor leaders don't seem to take the issue too
seriously when it hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gus Bevona, the longtime president of a New York City
janitors' local who made $531,529 in 1997. That's 17 times what his
union's members earned on average. Or take Frank Wsol, head of a
teamsters local in Chicago, who was paid $473,069.
</P>
<P>
   These salaries may be small compared to what Bill Gates or
Michael Eisner make, but they are surprisingly high in a field
where people become leaders, at least in theory, because they are
more interested in raising their members' incomes than in raising
their own.
</P>
<P>
   A major reason some union leaders have been able to jack up
their salaries is that it is often hard for members to find out
what their leaders are paid. Many times, union leaders have their
salaries increased at sparsely attended board meetings, and
afterward they do little to broadcast the news, knowing it would
hurt their re-election chances. Until recently, often the only way
union members could find out how much their leaders earned was to
go or write to an office of the U.S. Department of Labor to ask to
see a bare-bones financial report that every parent union and local
must file annually.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, union members _ or members of the public _ wanting
to know how much a labor leader earned must request a form known as
an LM-2 for that leader's union. But there are complications that
make this process as hard as doing a jigsaw puzzle. It is often
necessary to track down an array of forms to get the whole picture.
A union official may be paid separately as president of a local,
president of a citywide joint council and board member of the
parent union.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to figure out Bevona's salary, union members must
go first to the Labor Department's Office of Labor-Management
Standards in lower Manhattan. There, they must ask for the LM-2
form for Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International
Union, Bevona's local, which represents 55,000 janitors and
doormen. The report shows the local paid him $365,401 in 1997 _ the
most recent year for which a report was filed.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to stop there. Bevona also served as
president of a related local, Local 32B-32J-144, representing
22,000 home health-care aides who assist the elderly and disabled.
The LM-2 for that local reveals that Bevona received an additional
$86,128. That raised his income to $451,529.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most intrepid union members might stop their search
right there, but Bevona was also a board member of the
Washington-based parent union. To determine how much he earned for
that post, it is necessary to ask the Labor Department's main
office in Washington for the parent union's LM-2. That form shows
that Bevona received an additional $80,000 for being on that board.
Voila, his 1997 income totaled $531,529.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department has recently made it easier to obtain LM-2
forms by requesting them through the Internet at
(www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/regs/compliance/olms/rrlo/ordern.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Bevona's unusual salary and the marble-lined penthouse apartment
he had built atop union headquarters were among the reasons his
parent union pressured him to take early retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that so many teamster leaders belong to what it calls the
$100,000 club, a dissident group called Teamsters for a Democratic
Union has begun collecting LM-2 forms for every teamster local. The
group has published what it found. Thus it became known that Wsol
received $428,745 from Local 710 in 1997 as well as $44,324 for his
work as vice president of Teamsters Joint Council 25 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to have an organization that makes a point of getting
these documents,'' said Ken Paff, national coordinator of Teamsters
for a Democratic Union. ``Ever since the 1980s when we really began
publicizing the members of the $100,000 club, the number of
teamster leaders earning that much has declined steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   But even LM-2 forms tell only a little of the story. When Bevona
retired, he stunned members by walking away with $1.5 million _
$850,000 in a lump sum severance payment and $650,000 in unused
vacation time. There was no mention of those accrued liabilities in
the LM-2 forms filed by Bevona's local, even in the lines where the
union was asked to list liabilities. And members who wanted to
learn details about Bevona's penthouse could learn nothing from the
financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When unions file these forms with the government, they should
be required to list information like how large a pension a union
leader is due and how much vacation time they are owed,'' said
Herman Benson, founder of the Association for Union Democracy, a
Brooklyn-based nonprofit watchdog group. ``That way members would
know if something outrageous is developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union members complain that most unions representing
government employees are exempt from the requirement to file LM-2
forms. Benson's group and many union members are lobbying for
legislation that would require such disclosure by government
employee unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some disgruntled union members also want the AFL-CIO to publish
guidelines on how much union leaders should earn. It makes no
sense, they say, for Wsol to earn more than twice as much as
AFL-CIO president John Sweeney or for Bevona to earn five times as
much as Dennis Rivera, president of a New York hospital workers'
union with more than double the membership of Bevona's local
</P>
<P>
   ``These guidelines,'' Benson said, ``would be a real moral boost
for the labor movement and might save it a lot of embarrassment.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration may have reinvented the
federal work force by cutting nearly 400,000 lower-level jobs, but
it has also reinforced an already top-heavy bureaucracy with more
layers of lavishly titled officials in the upper ranks of the
government, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study, by Paul Light of the Brookings Institution,
concluded that the administration has created as many new job
titles among the government's higher tiers in the last six years as
the seven prior administrations did over 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer positions include deputy to the deputy
secretary, principal assistant deputy undersecretary and associate
principal deputy assistant secretary. Any given department may have
only one of the new positions, but experience suggests that they
will spread.
</P>
<P>
   Titles that have already spread like kudzu through the agencies
since 1960 include deputy assistant secretaries (484), associate
assistant secretaries (148), assistant assistant secretaries (220)
and deputy assistant assistant secretaries (82).
</P>
<P>
   And a handful of officials hold titles like associate deputy
assistant secretary, chief of staff to the associate assistant
secretary, chief of staff to the assistant assistant secretary and
principal deputy to the deputy assistant secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of such jobs may help the self-esteem of
some officials and their bosses, but it has also contributed to
significant paper shuffling and delays in decision making, the
study says.
</P>
<P>
   The titles have been part of a six-year management overhaul by
the White House that has eliminated many of the more important
lower-level jobs and contracted them out to private companies. As a
result, people have found it harder to reach federal employees when
they call or write the government, and top officials have become
more insulated from the needs of the people and the issues that
affect them, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got here two months ago, and I've been saying, I've got
to have a chief of staff,'' Light said. ``That person would be
chief of staff to the senior fellow. But I won't really be somebody
until I have a deputy chief of staff.''

they call or write the government, and top officials have become
more insulated from the needs of the people and the issues that
affect them, the study says.

   ``I just got here two months ago, and I've been saying, I've got
to have a chief of staff,'' Light said. ``That person would be
chief of staff to the senior fellow. But I won't really be somebody
until I have a deputy chief of staff.''

   BERLIN _ The butcher, a florid man, was blunt about the
situation: ``Keine Puten'' _ ``No turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement might have seemed reasonable enough were it not
for several factors: The date was Dec. 24, the bird had been
ordered and paid for, a long line of solid German burghers with
similar orders for Christmas turkeys stood behind me, and Germany
has no recent recorded history of turkey shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the butcher insisted, with growing obstinacy, ``Keine
Puten.'' An explanation, of sorts, followed. A computer glitch. A
truckful of fowl erroneously sent to an unknown destination. The
impossibility of finding the truck in the sprawling Berlin area.
The absence of an alternative source of turkey in a city of 3.5
million people
</P>
<P>
   I expected a small uprising in the store, perhaps even a
revolution. Dozens of turkeys had been bought, their stuffings
readied _ only to disappear into an unfathomable void on the eve of
the party. Perhaps, I mused, foul play had seen the hapless birds
smuggled into nearby Poland, whose border with Germany has become a
haven for contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, the turkey dearth seemed scandalous.
But not, apparently, to my fellow shoppers. A few murmurings could
be heard, sober calls on mobile phones to spouses, brief
discussions with the butcher, and then the apparently contented
acquisition of various yuletide alternatives _ duck, filet of pork,
even large slabs of rumpsteak.
</P>
<P>
   Call this Meine Keineputenangst. I had always imagined that the
uniquely reassuring clunk of a Mercedes door closing _ the hermetic
union of perfect parts _ was the fruit of a society that prized
precision and efficiency. In their blindest manifestations, these
qualities had taken Germany down the darkest of roads. But they had
also created the finely balanced political institutions and
machines whose success raised the country from postwar ruin in
stunningly short order.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what sort of efficiency was it that left Bachhuber of
Wilmersdorf, one of Berlin's best-known butchers, without turkeys
to honor its orders on the day before Christmas? And what sort of
society was it that accepted this ghastly contretemps with such
equanimity that not a voice was raised?
</P>
<P>
   A society, it seemed, that was anything but settled. For the
first image was startlingly ``un-German.'' It suggested, if
anything, a flakiness that Germans tend to associate with societies
south of the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The second image, however, seemed quintessentially German, that
of a society terrified of disorder, wary of disruption; a people
still asking itself, at some subliminal level: ``Can we ever be
trusted again?''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it seems, that is Germany today, a place pulled
between two poles. This polarity challenges the new government of
the Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder. His Cabinet
ministers are very much of Germany's Latin-leaning, postwar
generation, with their houses in Tuscany, their taste for olive oil
rather than lard, for wine rather than beer, for bear hugs rather
than formal handshakes. Theirs is a Germany that is less formal,
more multicultural, more forward-looking and, yes, less reliable in
the sense that it is no longer content with its postwar role as
economic giant and political pygmy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an older Germany persists: that of
deep-seated angst, of tremendous formality, of people who will not
cross even empty streets if the pedestrian light is red, of
handshakes of such bone-crushing harshness they speak of
estrangement rather than closeness. A Germany of obedience to
authority, of rigidity and order and Herr-This and Frau-That and
strictly no first names.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Germany for which a voice raised threatens disorder,
and Schroeder's proposed reform offering German citizenship to many
foreigners is a potent threat to be resisted with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   I was recently directed from an airport bus to the rear door of
a Boeing 737 on a flight from Munich. Due to a misunderstanding,
the door was closed. We waited on the stairs in the cold winter
air. Minutes passed. Nobody was prepared to knock on the door.
Nobody was ready to raise a voice. Disconcerted paralysis
prevailed. This, I thought, is still a society that values order
above freedom.

   But a few weeks later, I find myself with Joschka Fischer, the
foreign minister from the environmentalist Green Party, a former
1960s revolutionary, watching his face twist into a wry grin as he
considers his delicious destiny: moving the Foreign Ministry later
this year into Hitler's former Reichsbank in Berlin, a place where
East Germany's Communist leader, Erich Honecker, also held court.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's is a Germany confident that history's lessons have
been learned, one that assumes the past but is not consumed by it,
one that feels it has earned the freedom to be bolder. A society
prepared to take the risk of moving its capital from Bonn back to
Berlin, the city where Bismarck's Reich ended in the humiliation of
World War I defeat and the punishment of Versailles, where the
Weimar Republic ended with Hitler, and where Hitler ended with
ruin. ``No devil lurks in Berlin,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Between these often contradictory images _ of caution and
risk-taking _ Germany now makes its way. It is today a place that
tends to shatter preconceptions. Take the autobahn system: the
stock images that arise are of magnificent highways full of
flashing BMW's and Mercedes and Porsches roaring along without a
speed limit to encumber them.
</P>
<P>
   Try this instead: a labyrinth of roadworks filled with cars
crawling along in 30-mile-long bottlenecks or breaking suddenly
from high speeds to negotiate diversions consisting of impossibly
narrow lanes. Of the 7,085 miles of autobahn in Germany, about
one-tenth is currently in the midst of construction or repairs. In
other words, it is rare to drive more than 10 miles without
encountering some sort of obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   What this reflects above all, of course, is the fact that
unification is still a work in progress 10 years after the fall of
the Berlin Wall; much remains to be done to connect the country and
make it whole. Germany, in short, is in the midst of change more
dramatic than in any other west European country.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff Olins, a London-based public relations agency, recently
put on a show in Berlin on the ``rebranding'' of Germany. Nations,
it seems, must also be brands today, capable of selling themselves
aggressively. The Berlin show was an exercise akin to the agency's
``rebranding'' of Tony Blair's Britain as a mecca of hip fashion
rather than the home of quaint old fogies. In the case of Germany,
too, the results were interesting.
</P>
<P>
   There was a postage stamp featuring model Claudia Schiffer. A
redesigned flag of red, yellow and blue _ all primary colors _
rather than the current black, gold and red (``Black is simply
negative,'' said Paul Vinogradoff of Wolff Olins). A photograph of
a pot of Nivea cream (Nivea is a German invention), with the
provocative caption, ``So smooth it must be French.'' Images of the
annual Berlin Love Parade, now the largest street party in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show that Germany can now present itself as a
place where diversity is celebrated, where people are loosening up,
where efficiency is anything but the whole story,'' Vinogradoff
said. The ``safe,'' ``conformist,'' ``perfectionist'' Germany of
today could, with the right encouragement, give way to a ``free,''
``flexible,'' ``relaxed'' and ``spontaneous'' place.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Some sort of transition is evidently under way. Germany
is already a place where you can no longer count on your turkey,
even if people are not yet ready to holler about it. We, by the
way, settled for goose.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: U.S. policy fails to adjust to changes in Iran
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now we have to hope the Clinton administration, still dully
treating Cuba as if the Cold War never ended, will somehow begin
fine-tuning our Iranian policy to take advantage of, and help
reinforce, the remarkable shift toward moderation there.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. The opening has been growing steadily since
reformer Mohammed Khatami was elected Iran's president in 1997, but
the best the State Department has been able to muster as a response
has been to doubt the genuineness and durability of the change
rather than pooh-poohing it outright.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Iran's recent, first-ever local elections under the
Islamic revolution's 1979 constitution, Khatami supporters cleaned
the clocks of conservative opponents, winning 12 of crucial
Tehran's 15 council seats and about 70 percent of the votes
nationally. No hardliners won, and women were elected in 20 cities,
one of many accumulating indications that the revolution's early,
hyper-Islamist misogynism is waning.
</P>
<P>
   And all this despite the fact that the Islamic medievalists who
dominate religious offices and much of the bureaucracy had
disqualified some 50 pro-Khatami candidates. Indeed, liberal
clerics, journalists and others earlier purged by the hardliners
were able to return to the political game via the local elections _
a pointed electoral rebuke to the revolutionary mossbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal'' is a relative term in Iran. Khatami and his allies
have no intention of cancelling the revolution or of unhitching
mosque and state, but they've set out an ambitious agenda even so.
The formers are softening the revolution's sharper social edges,
working to institutionalize democratic processes and trying to ease
Iran back into international respectability by disavowing the
revolution's past support for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is right not to get giddy. The conservative
ayatollahs retain potential blocking power. It is not clear
Khatami's theoretical disavowal of terrorism has in fact ended
Iran's role as haven and provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the State Department can work up something more
useful than rote skepticism. There's an opportunity here to help
turn Iran away from international mischief and perhaps even revive
its traditional role as a counterweight to adjacent Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintonites' record for flexibility is not encouraging. They
continue, for instance, acting toward Cuba as if it were still a
Soviet cat's-paw, instead of being, as it is, merely the shabby and
politically discredited fiefdom of an aged autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   As with Cuba, so with Iran. If unwilling yet to make any major
changes in our own standoffishness, Washington at least could stop
blocking the efforts of our own allies to knit both nations up into
working networks of trade and diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   As Iran's local elections neared, the United States publicly
wished for outcomes that would support Khatami but privately worked
to frustrate Khatami's attempts to increase trade with Europe, in
effect economically starving political reform. To say there's some
tension in those positions is to put it mildly.

   Don't Look Too Far
</P>
<P>
   Those unschooled in the nuances of presidential candidates'
announcements and exploratory committees may picture experts
huddled around a table deliberating whether their candidate should
take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling his 10-member exploratory panel last week, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush said he was ``grateful they will take time to help
me make this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush exploratory committee has no immediate plans to
meet. What's to explore? The governor himself said he would back
out only if his candidacy were greeted with ``a large thud.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole did not disclose her committee members' names
last week because there aren't any. ``That's a legalism,''
explained Mrs. Dole's senior strategist, Kieran Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   By registering an exploratory committee with the Federal
Election Commission, contenders can begin collecting money for
travel and early organizational efforts. But it is not required;
candidates could just as easily create full-fledged campaign
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Why do many hopefuls maintain the fiction that they are
exploring when there is little doubt of their intentions? If their
campaigns collapse early, they can make a graceful exit, saying
that _ technically _ they were never in the race. And why announce
in one grand event if you can build the drama?
</P>
<P>
   As one Federal Election Commission official put it, ``A lot of
this is going through the hoops just for the political mileage.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By RICHARD L. BERKE
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seuss He's Not
</P>
<P>
   It took only hours for William Ivey, chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, to decide about a $15,000 grant the agency
had authorized for a small Texas publisher to translate an unusual
children's book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Story of Colors,'' was written by Subcomandante
Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico. The
inside flap shows him in full military regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey took over in mid-1998 after the agency narrowly survived
attempts by House Republicans to extinguish it. Less than a day
after a reporter's phone call brought the book to his attention,
Ivey canceled the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book had passed through a yearlong review process,
Ivey used his powers to reject the grant by fiat because he was
worried that some federal funds might make their way to the rebel
group. ``I looked at the movement of money internationally and saw
our inability to know what the ultimate destination might be,''
Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a shock to Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor who runs
the Cinco Puntos Press in El Paso, Texas, with his wife and
daughter. Byrd said there was no chance Subcomandante Marcos would
receive any federal money because he had waived his rights to
income from the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published by a small Mexican press in 1997, is a
folk tale about mythical gods who created colors to liven up a dull
gray universe. The Lannan Foundation in Santa Fe, N.M., said it
would donate funds to Byrd's press to make up for the lost grant.
</P>
<P>
   _ By JULIA PRESTON
</P>
<P>
   This Old House: Fallingapart
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater, the Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece, ``represents
all the aspirations of the 20th century,'' says Lynda Waggoner, the
house's director. Unfortunately, it can also serve as a tidy
metaphor for a century that, for all its glories, has, well, had
its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, for all his towering vision, was notorious for
neglecting the basics _ like designing roofs that wouldn't leak.
When Fallingwater was being built in western Pennsylvania six
decades ago, the contractor suggested more steel reinforcing for
those dramatic slabs hovering above the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   But no one _ no one _ was allowed to tell the great architect
what to do, and Wright threatened to walk off the project. The
contractor quietly doubled the reinforcing anyway _ ``the building
probably would not be standing today'' if he hadn't, Ms. Waggoner
said. But even that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   For Fallingwater is _ oh, it's no use resisting the tailormade
wordplay _ slowly falling into the water. The contractor was right:
The concrete is gradually bending, with one corner of the house 7
inches lower than it should be. The exterior is now adorned with
distinctly un-Wright-like steel beams to keep the whole thing from
collapsing. These will stay until there's a permanent solution.
</P>

   The Cold War receded a bit farther following a ceremony in

became the first former Soviet-bloc nations to formally join NATO.
At the gathering at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the foreign ministers of

   Don't Look Too Far
</P>
<P>
   Those unschooled in the nuances of presidential candidates'
announcements and exploratory committees may picture experts
huddled around a table deliberating whether their candidate should
take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling his 10-member exploratory panel last week, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush said he was ``grateful they will take time to help
me make this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush exploratory committee has no immediate plans to
meet. What's to explore? The governor himself said he would back
out only if his candidacy were greeted with ``a large thud.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole did not disclose her committee members' names
last week because there aren't any. ``That's a legalism,''
explained Mrs. Dole's senior strategist, Kieran Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   By registering an exploratory committee with the Federal
Election Commission, contenders can begin collecting money for
travel and early organizational efforts. But it is not required;
candidates could just as easily create full-fledged campaign
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Why do many hopefuls maintain the fiction that they are
exploring when there is little doubt of their intentions? If their
campaigns collapse early, they can make a graceful exit, saying
that _ technically _ they were never in the race. And why announce
in one grand event if you can build the drama?
</P>
<P>
   As one Federal Election Commission official put it, ``A lot of
this is going through the hoops just for the political mileage.''

   Dr. Seuss He's Not
</P>
<P>
   It took only hours for William Ivey, chairman of the National
Endowment for the Arts, to decide about a $15,000 grant the agency
had authorized for a small Texas publisher to translate an unusual
children's book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Story of Colors,'' was written by Subcomandante
Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista rebels in southern Mexico. The
inside flap shows him in full military regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey took over in mid-1998 after the agency narrowly survived
attempts by House Republicans to extinguish it. Less than a day
after a reporter's phone call brought the book to his attention,
Ivey canceled the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book had passed through a yearlong review process,
Ivey used his powers to reject the grant by fiat because he was
worried that some federal funds might make their way to the rebel
group. ``I looked at the movement of money internationally and saw
our inability to know what the ultimate destination might be,''
Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a shock to Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor who runs
the Cinco Puntos Press in El Paso, Texas, with his wife and
daughter. Byrd said there was no chance Subcomandante Marcos would
receive any federal money because he had waived his rights to
income from the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book, first published by a small Mexican press in 1997, is a
folk tale about mythical gods who created colors to liven up a dull
gray universe. The Lannan Foundation in Santa Fe, N.M., said it
would donate funds to Byrd's press to make up for the lost grant.

   This Old House: Fallingapart
</P>
<P>
   Fallingwater, the Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece, ``represents
all the aspirations of the 20th century,'' says Lynda Waggoner, the
house's director. Unfortunately, it can also serve as a tidy
metaphor for a century that, for all its glories, has, well, had
its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, for all his towering vision, was notorious for
neglecting the basics _ like designing roofs that wouldn't leak.
When Fallingwater was being built in western Pennsylvania six
decades ago, the contractor suggested more steel reinforcing for
those dramatic slabs hovering above the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   But no one _ no one _ was allowed to tell the great architect
what to do, and Wright threatened to walk off the project. The
contractor quietly doubled the reinforcing anyway _ ``the building
probably would not be standing today'' if he hadn't, Ms. Waggoner
said. But even that wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   For Fallingwater is _ oh, it's no use resisting the tailormade
wordplay _ slowly falling into the water. The contractor was right:
The concrete is gradually bending, with one corner of the house 7
inches lower than it should be. The exterior is now adorned with
distinctly un-Wright-like steel beams to keep the whole thing from
collapsing. These will stay until there's a permanent solution.

   Uncertainty on Kosovo Plan
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a second round of Kosovo peace talks, scheduled to
start in Paris on Monday progress looked as elusive as ever. The
Clinton administration tried all week to persuade the ethnic
Albanians to sign on to the peace plan, which grants autonomy to
Kosovo for a three-year period with 28,000 NATO-led troops as
overseers. But the Kosovo Liberation Army, concerned about having
to disarm, kept debating, not signing.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Richard Holbrooke returned to Washington from a visit
to President Slobodan Milosevic, of Yugoslavia, without any
concessions. In Kosovo, fighting flared. With increased numbers of
Serb forces deployed in the Serbian province and the ethnic
Albanians poised for combat, the outlook appeared grim.

   Verdicts in French AIDS Case

<P>
   Former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and a member of his
Cabinet were acquitted of charges of criminal manslaughter and
negligence in the deaths of hundreds of transfusion patients who
contracted AIDS from contaminated blood in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, now speaker of the lower house of Parliament, and
Georgina Dufoix, minister of social affairs in Fabius' Socialist

supplies for the AIDS virus mandatory from Aug. 1, 1985, a special
high court ruled.

<P>
   Edmond Herve, health minister at the time, was convicted of two
cases of negligence, but was given no sentence. The court said he
should have ordered the recall of previously untested blood when
the risk of potential contamination first became known, rather than
let it be used for several more months.

IN ILLINOIS, IT'S THE POLITICAL LIFE FOR RILEY, GILHOOLEY ET AL.

   CHICAGO _ There seems to be truth in the adage about the luck of
the Irish, at least when it comes to running for political office.
As sure as the Chicago River runs green for St. Patrick's Day,
politicians with Irish names hold all but a few of the major
offices in Illinois _ from Fitzgerald to Madigan to Devine, a pair
of Ryans, and, of course, another mayor named Daley. The sons and
daughters of Erin also do pretty well elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a choice, people pick Irish,'' said Michael Hout, a
sociologist at the University of California in Berkeley who
conducted a study of how people of mixed backgrounds identify
themselves on census forms. More people identified themselves as
Irish than immigration and natural selection alone would predict,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The background least often chosen was British. ``For all the
Anglophiles at Harvard, there seems to be some antipathy west of
there to be identified as British,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hout suggested that the ``positive cultural markers'' of the
Irish, traits stereotypically associated with that group _
gregariousness, wit, charm and ``the flavor of the underdog'' _
make them appealing to many Americans. Even St. Patrick's Day, a
day set aside to celebrate the Irish, plays a role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very things that the Irish were once vilified for _ being
boisterous, charmers, social animals, storytellers _ are seen as
wonderful attributes in American society today,'' said Paul Green,
a political-science professor at Governors State University.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the euphonious quality of Irish names makes
them songlike. It has become so common for American parents to use
Irish last names like Ryan, Shannon and Kelly for their children's
first names that a Harvard researcher is studying the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Irish love of words seems tailor-made for
politics. President Clinton proclaims ancestral links to Ireland,
as did former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and many
predecessors. John F. Kennedy was the first Irish Catholic elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Irish-Americans have long been disproportionately represented in
Congress, said Melvin Holli, a political scientist at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, and the author of books about
ethnicity and politics. ``The priesthood, the police force and
politics _ that's the Irish trinity,'' said Holli, referring to the
Irish influence on those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As an immigrant group that arrived speaking English, the Irish
built political machines in 19th-century Chicago and New York; they
survived by making inroads in municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Irish names have been on the ballot so long, goes one theory,
that people simply feel comfortable voting in Irish-Americans. It
certainly helped the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son,
Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for judgeships in Chicago have sometimes been called
``the Irish Sweepstakes,'' given the names of the usual victors. In
one campaign for a Cook County judge last year, voters were given a
choice between James Patrick McCarthy and Bonnie Fitzgerald
McGrath, who happened to be Jewish. McCarthy emerged as the victor,
most likely because he was a Democrat, which can still trump the
opposition in most Chicago wards. (Not always. Michael Flanagan, an
unknown Republican, toppled the powerful, though indicted, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski.)
</P>
<P>
   Today Irish-Americans, according to research gathered by the
Rev. Andrew Greeley, the Roman Catholic priest and novelist, are a
prosperous, privileged ethnic group. It has been a long journey
from the days when the 19th century refugees of the potato famine
endured open ridicule and discrimination. ``Scratch a convict or a
pauper,'' read an editorial in The Chicago Evening Post in 1868,
``and the chances are that you tickle the skin of an Irish
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being the Chicago descendants of those
immigrants seem to have had the last word even though they are
outnumbered by Americans whose ancestors came from Germany, Eastern
Europe, Africa and Mexico. Chicago baseball teams play in stadiums
named for Irishmen: Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park. O'Hare airport
is named for a World War II hero. An Irish-American has been mayor
for all but nine of the past 66 years, including the first Mayor
Daley, whose ``idea of affirmative action was nine Irishmen and a
Swede,'' his press secretary, Frank Sullivan, once said. It is a
different world for his son, who has put together a diverse City
Hall team. Nearly half of black voters supported Daley in his
landslide victory in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Alderman Mathias Bauler wrote a ditty that said
while most immigrant groups detested each other, they would all
vote for an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   Bauler, who was of German descent, did not use his given first
name in Chicago politics: he went by the nickname Paddy.

sociologist at the University of California in Berkeley who
conducted a study of how people of mixed backgrounds identify
themselves on census forms. More people identified themselves as
Irish than immigration and natural selection alone would predict,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The background least often chosen was British. ``For all the
Anglophiles at Harvard, there seems to be some antipathy west of
there to be identified as British,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hout suggested that the ``positive cultural markers'' of the
Irish, traits stereotypically associated with that group _
gregariousness, wit, charm and ``the flavor of the underdog'' _
make them appealing to many Americans. Even St. Patrick's Day, a
day set aside to celebrate the Irish, plays a role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very things that the Irish were once vilified for _ being
boisterous, charmers, social animals, storytellers _ are seen as
wonderful attributes in American society today,'' said Paul Green,
a political-science professor at Governors State University.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the euphonious quality of Irish names makes
them songlike. It has become so common for American parents to use
Irish last names like Ryan, Shannon and Kelly for their children's
first names that a Harvard researcher is studying the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Irish love of words seems tailor-made for
politics. President Clinton proclaims ancestral links to Ireland,
as did former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and many
predecessors. John F. Kennedy was the first Irish Catholic elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Irish-Americans have long been disproportionately represented in
Congress, said Melvin Holli, a political scientist at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, and the author of books about
ethnicity and politics. ``The priesthood, the police force and
politics _ that's the Irish trinity,'' said Holli, referring to the
Irish influence on those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As an immigrant group that arrived speaking English, the Irish
built political machines in 19th-century Chicago and New York; they
survived by making inroads in municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Irish names have been on the ballot so long, goes one theory,
that people simply feel comfortable voting in Irish-Americans. It
certainly helped the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son,
Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for judgeships in Chicago have sometimes been called
``the Irish Sweepstakes,'' given the names of the usual victors. In
one campaign for a Cook County judge last year, voters were given a
choice between James Patrick McCarthy and Bonnie Fitzgerald
McGrath, who happened to be Jewish. McCarthy emerged as the victor,
most likely because he was a Democrat, which can still trump the
opposition in most Chicago wards. (Not always. Michael Flanagan, an
unknown Republican, toppled the powerful, though indicted, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski.)
</P>
<P>
   Today Irish-Americans, according to research gathered by the
Rev. Andrew Greeley, the Roman Catholic priest and novelist, are a
prosperous, privileged ethnic group. It has been a long journey
from the days when the 19th century refugees of the potato famine
endured open ridicule and discrimination. ``Scratch a convict or a
pauper,'' read an editorial in The Chicago Evening Post in 1868,
``and the chances are that you tickle the skin of an Irish
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being the Chicago descendants of those
immigrants seem to have had the last word even though they are
outnumbered by Americans whose ancestors came from Germany, Eastern
Europe, Africa and Mexico. Chicago baseball teams play in stadiums
named for Irishmen: Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park. O'Hare airport
is named for a World War II hero. An Irish-American has been mayor
for all but nine of the past 66 years, including the first Mayor
Daley, whose ``idea of affirmative action was nine Irishmen and a
Swede,'' his press secretary, Frank Sullivan, once said. It is a
different world for his son, who has put together a diverse City
Hall team. Nearly half of black voters supported Daley in his
landslide victory in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Alderman Mathias Bauler wrote a ditty that said
while most immigrant groups detested each other, they would all
vote for an Irishman.
</P>
<P>
   Bauler, who was of German descent, did not use his given first
name in Chicago politics: he went by the nickname Paddy.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ It would seem like the simplest of
questions, one that could be settled with a few good maps and maybe
a cheap global positioning device: Where on Earth, quite literally,
is the town of Badme?
</P>
<P>
   Badme is a place of no particular consequence in the highlands
between Ethiopia and its much smaller kin, Eritrea, two nations of
great promise on the Horn of Africa. But lying on the battlefields
near this town are the corpses of perhaps 10,000 soldiers _ maybe
less, maybe more _ who died over the last month because each nation
claims Badme and the surrounding area as its own. (For comparison's
sake, 3,200 people have died in Northern Ireland's sectarian
conflict in the last 30 years, according to the U.S. State
Department).
</P>
<P>
   None of the Badme region has much value or historical or
emotional resonance. It is merely undefined. And its outlines
became so ambiguous in a way that tells the story of many conflicts
in modern-day Africa: The colonists of a century ago, in this case
Italy and Britain, buried a time bomb or two in the treaties that
marked off their ambitions. African rulers of today have been
unable, or unwilling, to defuse them.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the treaties are wildly complicated and laughably
imprecise, using tribes and river junctions and obscure mountains
as reference points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' Professor Bahru Zewde said in his office
at Addis Ababa University early this month. He is one of Ethiopia's
leading historians, and he knows as much as anyone about the
history of the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which were a
single nation until Eritrea split off six years ago with Ethiopia's
blessing. He has come to the conclusion, deliberatively and
sincerely, that Badme belongs to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Eritrea says it has looked long and hard at
the same evidence. Asked to make the Eritrean case for this
article, a government spokesman pointed a reporter in the direction
of a Harvard-trained lawyer and U.S. citizen born in Eritrea,
Seyoum Haregot. He is a technical adviser to the United Nations in
Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and he emphasized that he is only a
civil servant who researched the issue not for the government but
out of curiosity. ``I am not ideological about it at all,'' he
said. ``But I believe the Eritreans are right.''
</P>
<P>
   What is fascinating is that both Bahru and Haregot differed
barely at all in the evidence they presented. Each side seems to be
looking at the same facts and drawing completely contrary
conclusions. That has made the dispute especially hard to solve.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, then, is a summary of the major treaties that
marked off the boundary between Ethiopia and Eritrea and how those
documents have been interpreted to justify the latest of Africa's
bloody wars.
</P>
<P>
   Of a dozen or so treaties signed near the turn of the century,
three are important. The key signatories were Italy, which
colonized Eritrea, and Ethiopia, which fought off the Italians'
southward march and remained independent.
</P>
<P>
   A 1908 treaty between the Ethiopians and Italians established
the long eastern border as a line running parallel to the Red Sea.
A 1900 treaty, also between Italy and Ethiopia, established the
eastern part of the Ethiopia-Eritrea boundary along the Mereb River
and two tributaries. To the west, a straight line was drawn between
the town of Tomat, in present-day Sudan, northward to Todluc. And a
treaty signed in 1902 _ the essence of the problem _ moved that
straight line to the east. But the reference points were not the
most precise. Those points became the junction, on the south,
between the Setit and Maieteb Rivers and, on the north, between the
Mereb and Mai Ambessa Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   On some later maps, the 1902 line is moved even farther east,
but in either case Ethiopia claims that the line, which is about 50
miles long, falls to the west of Badme. That is to say, Badme is
Ethiopian.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the maps show this straight line, however capricious it
might be,'' Bahru said. ``There is no way the line could bend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Eritreans say that even if the line does not bend, it
can indeed move. Haregot pointed to two other sections of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   One provides that the Kunama tribe, a group of highland cattle
drivers, be included in Eritrea. (``This is, as you say in America,
baloney,'' grumbled Professor Mesfin Wolde-Mariam, a retired
geographer and past head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, who
is opposed to the war completely and furious with both sides.
``People are not stones.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other provision says that Mount Ala Tacura is also included
in Eritrea (The State Department claims it cannot even find this
mountain).
</P>
<P>
   The effect of those two additions, Haregot said, appears to move
the line further east, putting Badme in Eritrea. ``There is no
confusion about the delineation,'' he said. ``That can be
determined by cartographers. There should not be a fight between
the two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But a U.S. official said that even Haregot's interpretation does
not do justice to the issue's full complexity. As an example, he
described the terrain around Badme: ``It's desert right on the edge
of the Ethiopian plateau, and when the rains come they come
suddenly and they rush off the side of the mountains with
tremendous force. When you have water moving with such force, the
rivers move over 97 years. And so the lines move.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain that the treaties made the land theirs, Eritrean forces
marched into the Badme region in May 1998. Fighting lasted a month.
Then, after nine months of re-arming, fighting erupted again Feb.
6.
</P>
<P>
   By Feb. 26, Ethiopia had pushed the Eritreans out of Badme and
Eritrea agreed to a peace proposal drafted last year by the
Organization of African Unity. Ethiopia, saying it had accepted the
plan long ago and was not sure it trusted Eritrea, has not yet
agreed to a truce.
</P>
<P>
   If a cease-fire ever comes, the peace plan requires that experts
go over the ground and finally define the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not think of the borders,'' said Mesfin, of those who
planned Eritrea's independence in 1993. ``So, hurriedly, they were
independent. Now we have no idea what on earth is happening. And
mind you, these are the same people on both sides. They speak the
same language, have the same culture. It's very depressing.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waiting to get to the waiting room
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, March 17, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is anything I dread more than going to the doctor's
office, it's calling the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   It is a terrifying undertaking. Often, I sit around and plan how
I am going to respond to any number of hurdles presented to me on
the other end of the phone line.
</P>
<P>
   The most common is the doctor's office receptionist who answers,
rapidly says ``Hold, please,'' and then does not return, if at all,
for about 7 to 10 minutes while I listen to elevator music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the doctor's offices where, after waiting on hold
for a while, you get a voice mail identifying someone as the
``appointments secretary,'' but she is not presently in; please
leave your name and number and (maybe) she'll call back.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, once connected to a living person, the most
intimidating question I'm asked is: ``Are you a first-time
patient?''
</P>
<P>
   If I answer affirmatively, I will not be able to get an
appointment with the doctor for at least three months, as there is
some sort of fraternal hazing period within the medical profession
that dictates new patients be put in a holding pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my nose is bleeding,'' I plead, ``It's been bleeding off
and an on for a week. Can't you give me something earlier than May
10?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry sir, but that's the earliest date we have for a new
patient. Perhaps you ought to go to the emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   That much blood there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who trains doctors' office personnel, and often
wonder what my own wife was like when she worked in a doctor's
office for 12 years. I know how she reacts to things I say at
times, so I'd hate to ever hear her ask if I'm a new patient.
</P>
<P>
   It likely boils down to a case of good guy, bad guy _ the
physician instructing his staff to protect him or her at all times,
to keep _ simultaneously _ six patients in six tiny patient rooms,
to obtain blood oaths in writing that all costs will be paid by
Medicare, private insurers or the estates of the patients, and to
leave Wednesday afternoon open for golf.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when you eventually get to see the doctor and complain
about how difficult it was to get an appointment, or how much
resistance there was by office staff to having your blood drawn
without first seeing the doctor, he or she promises to talk with
staff to see that such mistreatment does not occur.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, never happens, was never intended to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a splurge of trying to visit doctors for any
number of reasons, I spent a good part of my time on the phone _
waiting, arguing, begging, giving my life history and trying to
sound like a patient patient, which I was not.
</P>
<P>
   Before the doctor's telephonic guardian even asked the nature of
my illness or need, she wanted to know my insurance benefits. On
one call, I was told that the doctor could not see me because his
group did not work with my insurance company. It took me a while to
convince her that putting the whole thing on my MasterCard would be
just fine and that I would deal with the insurance people later.
</P>
<P>
   People paying up front sometimes bewilders doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three doctors with whom I tried to make appointments last
week for diverse afflictions, I successfully received booking
before the summer solstice for two of them. On the third, I simply
gave up when I heard the doctor's guardian flipping page after page
in her calendar.
</P>
<P>
   From the number of flips, it was beginning to sound like July.
And I wasn't even a first-time patient there.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder (and tremble): What would it be like if we
had socialized medicine?

STANLEY KUBRICK: THE QUOTABLE RECLUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (editors: also see DIMAGGIO-INTERVIEW-REVIEW. The Times is running
the two pieces together under a single headline, ``The Silent
Celebrity and the Quotable Recluse.'')  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interview setting _ Sunday morning in a sprawling, empty
movie studio outside London _ was sepulchral, as vast and quiet as
Hal the computer's trans-galactic homicide scene in ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   And the reclusive film director Stanley Kubrick was formidable,
indeed, when he finally entered a dimly lit office to be
interviewed, brandishing his wariness of celebrity before the lone
questioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the master director proved a charming hermit. Kubrick was
quotably forthcoming 12 years ago once common ground was found in
the only other thing the transplanted New Yorker allowed himself to
watch during the final, manic editing process of making a film _
the latest football Giants videotapes sent from home.
</P>
<P>
   _ By FRANCIS X. CLINES
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick seemed particularly taken by the ads that accompanied
the telecasts, finding them to be a source of serendipitous
inspiration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen those Michelob commercials? They're just
boy-girl, night-fun, leading up to pouring the beer, all in 30
seconds, beautifully edited and photographed. Economy of statement
is not something that films are noted for.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He smiled in establishing a fine plebeian mood, a belief in
the common-man audience, as he talked of making movies and scouring
all manner of fiction and nonfiction in his endless search for
fresh epiphany:
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with being excited by a story and finally it's
telling the story on the screen. ... It's the most difficult thing.
A good story is a miraculous discovery. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``That first impression is the most precious thing you've got,
you can never have it again _ the yardstick for any judgment that
you have as you get deeper and deeper into the work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ His love of it all became clear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a movie is a process of going into smaller and smaller
detail and finally winding up in the minutiae of how does a
footstep sound on the sound track when you're remixing the film.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes from the most wonderful literary atmosphere to
desperation. It can be as crude as standing up and writing on the
back of an envelope when someone's just said something and it's 4
o'clock with the winter sun fading. You've got to shoot it and
you're trying to exploit something that's just come up. It's like a
quarterback calling an automatic play when he sees the defense he's
up against.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick had trust in the ``more democratic intelligence'' of
the public versus the critics, especially after ``2001'':
</P>
<P>
   ``People who didn't have the responsibility of having to explain
it or formulate clear statements about it two hours after they saw
the film weren't troubled.''

STANLEY KUBRICK: THE QUOTABLE RECLUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (editors: also see DIMAGGIO-INTERVIEW-REVIEW. The Times is running
the two pieces together under a single headline, ``The Silent
Celebrity and the Quotable Recluse.'')

<TEXT>
<P>
   The interview setting _ Sunday morning in a sprawling, empty
movie studio outside London _ was sepulchral, as vast and quiet as
Hal the computer's trans-galactic homicide scene in ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   And the reclusive film director Stanley Kubrick was formidable,
indeed, when he finally entered a dimly lit office to be
interviewed, brandishing his wariness of celebrity before the lone
questioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the master director proved a charming hermit. Kubrick was
quotably forthcoming 12 years ago once common ground was found in
the only other thing the transplanted New Yorker allowed himself to
watch during the final, manic editing process of making a film _
the latest football Giants videotapes sent from home.
</P>
<P>
   _ By FRANCIS X. CLINES
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick seemed particularly taken by the ads that accompanied
the telecasts, finding them to be a source of serendipitous
inspiration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen those Michelob commercials? They're just
boy-girl, night-fun, leading up to pouring the beer, all in 30
seconds, beautifully edited and photographed. Economy of statement
is not something that films are noted for.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He smiled in establishing a fine plebeian mood, a belief in
the common-man audience, as he talked of making movies and scouring
all manner of fiction and nonfiction in his endless search for
fresh epiphany:
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with being excited by a story and finally it's
telling the story on the screen. ... It's the most difficult thing.
A good story is a miraculous discovery. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``That first impression is the most precious thing you've got,
you can never have it again _ the yardstick for any judgment that
you have as you get deeper and deeper into the work.''
</P>
<P>
   _ His love of it all became clear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a movie is a process of going into smaller and smaller
detail and finally winding up in the minutiae of how does a
footstep sound on the sound track when you're remixing the film.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes from the most wonderful literary atmosphere to
desperation. It can be as crude as standing up and writing on the
back of an envelope when someone's just said something and it's 4
o'clock with the winter sun fading. You've got to shoot it and
you're trying to exploit something that's just come up. It's like a
quarterback calling an automatic play when he sees the defense he's
up against.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kubrick had trust in the ``more democratic intelligence'' of
the public versus the critics, especially after ``2001'':
</P>
<P>
   ``People who didn't have the responsibility of having to explain
it or formulate clear statements about it two hours after they saw
the film weren't troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Making a movie is like chess:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a series of steps that you take one at a time, and it's
balancing resources against the problem, which in chess is time and
in movies is time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ To direct a movie is to protect a single idea:
</P>

SEEING BEYOND SPIES IS THE HARD PART 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A spy worms his way into a delicate niche of U.S.
military intelligence. He steals its secrets and sells them to
another government. His treachery inflicts the gravest damage to
U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Another spook sets out to purloin a foreign government's trade
secrets. The foreign government smells a rat, sets a trap that
snares the spy, her boss, his deputy and two colleagues, and sends
them all packing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, the spy was Jonathan Pollard, working for
Israel. In the second case, the spies were the CIA's, their target
France. Both cases caused political thunderstorms. Like most
storms, they passed without permanently altering the landscape. The
United States and Israel remain close, and Washington and Paris are
amiable, after a fashion, a couple reconciled after an infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Now assume, as one well might, that China _ no ally _ has been
caught, red-handed, spying on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese-American has been fired from the Los Alamos nuclear
laboratory, suspected of swiping bomb blueprints, though he has
been charged with nothing. Beijing stands accused of suborning
Chinese-Americans for treason, using its embassies as dens of
espionage, filching a recipe for miniaturizing nukes.
</P>
<P>
   And the White House is being flayed by Republicans in Congress
(or running for president) who say the administration turned a
blind eye to Chinese military and intelligence threats, deep-sixed
the Los Alamos case and sold out national-security concerns to a
mercantile foreign policy driven by campaign-contributing
corporations and shady Chinese middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery goes beyond concerns that holes in the national
security fence were closed too slowly for America's own good. The
political charges are as powerful as tabloid headlines. Atom spies!
Nuclear scandal! Pusillanimous policymakers pussyfoot with Chicoms!
</P>
<P>
   What effect will this have on U.S. politics? Potentially plenty,
since a presidential campaign is looming, and exciting
foreign-policy issues are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   And what effect will this have on U.S. diplomacy, with a summit
coming between the world's most powerful and most populous nations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically zero,'' said Donald Gregg, a former CIA station
chief and ambassador in South Korea, and deputy national security
adviser to President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   James Lilley, a former CIA station chief and ambassador in
Beijing, said: ``Espionage is largely separate from the mainstream
of foreign policy. You compartment it, you keep demagoguery out of
it, you investigate, you nail the spy and you punish him, and you
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a similar
point: ``We should be adult enough to understand that major
countries are going to be spying on us. I'm assuming that we are
spying on China. That should not in itself affect diplomatic
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, grow up, America. Stop acting shocked to
discover spies in the global Casbah. The world these days is driven
by money, not ideology. And national interests, not angels and
devils, are what motivate intelligence strategies and international
relations in general.
</P>
<P>
   So, these old hands say, the Los Alamos case should not derail
U.S. diplomacy; rather, it is likely to gradually decay into the
background of the continuous, contentious chatter between the
United States and the Middle Kingdom _ if diplomacy's logic
prevails. Still, they say, it could become a lightning rod and thus
draw a storm sufficient to change the weather in Washington and the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of human rights, trade, the Chinese aiming missiles
against Taiwan, Chinese views of future warfare _ put that into a
presidential campaign, and you have a problem,'' Lilley said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who knows a thing or two about the interplay of
diplomacy and politics, said: ``We are drifting into a
confrontation because of our inability to connect our diplomatic
policy to public support. You cannot open a newspaper without
reading an attack on China. It's a nostalgia for confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in search of enemies, China makes a decent target. Its
spy services, its army and its state industries all show
``exceptional interest'' in buying or stealing U.S. technology to
modernize its backward military, the Pentagon says. China spies on
the United States much as the Soviets did (it was the first to
penetrate the CIA with a long-time mole, Larry Wu-tai Chin, who
worked there from 1952 to 1981). Its nuclear weapons are capable,
at least in theory, of turning Los Angeles and Seattle into
smoking, radiating ruins.
</P>
<P>
   But how real is that threat? China's nuclear arsenal is not much
more potent than America's was when Mao Tse-tung took charge 50
years ago, and U.S. deterrent power is overwhelming. China has
perhaps two dozen weapons capable of striking the American
homeland. If the Chinese so much as twitch a trigger finger, the
Pentagon can vaporize their nuclear silos and their cities in one
fell swoop. And if the Chinese did indeed steal the trick of
miniaturizing nuclear weapons from Los Alamos, speeding the day
they can place several warheads on a single missile, there is no
evidence yet that they have figured out how to deploy that force in
a way that alters the strategic balance with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a smaller, smarter Chinese bomb could undercut U.S.
interests if it altered the balance of fear in Asia. Since
Hiroshima, nuclear weapons have proved far more useful as
instruments of blackmail _ or, more politely, symbols of strength _
than as military tools. When China rattles its shorter-range
missiles, Taiwan and Japan listen. A many-headed missile is a
talisman that would place China in the nuclear heavyweight class,
far beyond regional upstarts like India and Pakistan. And since the
Chinese have sold missile technology to Iran, a breakthrough for
Beijing may someday be marketed in Tehran.

</P>
<P>
   Now a clamor is rising for far tighter security at the national
laboratories like Los Alamos. Chinese espionage presents a unique
problem there. It exclusively uses ethnic Chinese operatives, in
large numbers, each supposed to gather a tiny piece of a puzzle.
``You are looking at an individual collecting one small part one
time, and you don't have the quality of case that our country will
take to prosecute as far as espionage,'' said one senior FBI
official _ which may explain why there have been no arrests in the
Los Alamos case.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis chills the spines of scientists and Sinophiles.
``We have a disproportionate dependence on foreign-born scientists
at the labs; they love to work here because it's an open society,
so they can do cutting-edge work in a congenial atmosphere,'' said
Chas. W. Freeman Jr., a diplomat in Beijing under President Ronald
Reagan and co-chairman of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation. ``So
will there now be a pall of suspicion against Chinese scientists?
Are we now going to have a witch hunt? If you ratchet it up and
exclude foreign-born scientists, what will that do to our
competitive edge?''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook wasn't sunny for the summit before the latest storm.
President Clinton still cannot find a new U.S. ambassador willing
to carry out his policies, a mix of mercantile zest and missionary
zeal. The Chinese have never been thrilled with the United States
slamming them for political repression, selling warplanes to their

   And the prospects for China's most-favored-nation status and its
admission to the World Trade Organization won't improve if the
Clinton administration cannot find a way to speak bluntly in
private to the Chinese and publicly to the American people about
nukes and spooks.

<P>
   ``Some people in the United States are busy spreading the `China
threat' fallacy and trying to find a new enemy for the United
States,'' said Chinese Ambassador Li Zhao-xing in a speech in
Washington in January. It evoked something that former Assistant
Defense Secretary Joseph Nye, now dean of the Kennedy School of
Government, said in 1995: ``If you treat China as an enemy, China
will become an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy, like politics, is the art of the possible. Since the
Cold War, Americans have dreamt of engaging Chinese leaders who are
more like us than Marx or Mao. Still, it is hard to be a great
nation without a great enemy.

   Now a clamor is rising for far tighter security at the national
laboratories like Los Alamos. Chinese espionage presents a unique
problem there. It exclusively uses ethnic Chinese operatives, in
large numbers, each supposed to gather a tiny piece of a puzzle.
``You are looking at an individual collecting one small part one
time, and you don't have the quality of case that our country will
take to prosecute as far as espionage,'' said one senior FBI
official _ which may explain why there have been no arrests in the
Los Alamos case.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis chills the spines of scientists and Sinophiles.
``We have a disproportionate dependence on foreign-born scientists
at the labs; they love to work here because it's an open society,
so they can do cutting-edge work in a congenial atmosphere,'' said
Chas. W. Freeman Jr., a diplomat in Beijing under President Ronald
Reagan and co-chairman of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation. ``So
will there now be a pall of suspicion against Chinese scientists?
Are we now going to have a witch hunt? If you ratchet it up and
exclude foreign-born scientists, what will that do to our
competitive edge?''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook wasn't sunny for the summit before the latest storm.
President Clinton still cannot find a new U.S. ambassador willing
to carry out his policies, a mix of mercantile zest and missionary
zeal. The Chinese have never been thrilled with the United States
slamming them for political repression, selling warplanes to their
archfoe Taiwan, embracing their old enemy Vietnam, and envisioning
a united Korea allied with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospects for China's most-favored-nation status and its
admission to the World Trade Organization won't improve if the

POLITICAL ANIMALS: GROWLING OVER DOGS' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In cities and towns across the nation, a chorus of politically
influential voices cries out in unison: Woof!
</P>
<P>
   From leash laws to legislation to curb dangerous animals to
regulations limiting the number of dogs per household, canine
questions have become the new hot button of local politics. In New
York City, an effort to curb leashlessness escalated this month as
armed police were brought into what had been a Parks Department
offensive; 450 summonses have been issued in the last two weeks.
Dog owners compare themselves to Jews under Hitler, while the parks
commissioner snarls about ``dog terrorists.'' The city will soon
pass out cell phones to volunteers to snitch on leash violators.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are equally pitched in Avon, Conn., where dog owners
are in revolt over not being able to let dogs run freely in a large
park. In Boston, pooper-scooper laws are a flashpoint. In Venice
Beach, Calif., a ban on dogs on the boardwalk is the issue. In St.
Petersburg, Fla., it is the process of determining which dogs are
too vicious to live. In Cheektowaga, N.Y., pooch lovers seethe at
the legal limit of three dogs per household. In Annapolis, Md., and
Highland Park, Mich., owners are infuriated over bans on pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Seattle, San Francisco and scores more cities,
people scream for more dog space in city parks. In Santa Fe, N.M.,
last year, a resident filed a $2 million suit against the city,
charging ``Gestapo-style'' enforcement of the leash law.
</P>
<P>
   Dog politics is decidedly local: State laws have little to say
about regulating Rover, and Washington almost nothing. The fight is
over local regulations, and it occurs in city, town and village
councils. But, according to the March issue of Governing, which
tracks trends in local government, the fights have all too much in
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``A seemingly innocuous proposal is quickly followed by a
response stunningly disproportionate to its weightiness in the
public policy arena,'' it said. ``If you thought taxes were the
only issue that made voters' blood boil, then you haven't had a dog
issue appear on the public agenda lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high-pitched emotions and the sharp polarization,
participants often liken dog issues to abortion. ``There is no
middle ground,'' said Fred Marquis, administrator of Pinellas
County, Fla., where the heated discussion has been over how to
determine if a dog is dangerous and worthy of being impounded. ``As
with abortion, people are either totally opposed or totally
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lea Benjamin, a former dog trainer who now writes novels
about a detective who is accompanied by a pit bull, agreed:
``There's no way you can have a calm discussion about this with
anybody. It's like talking about religion. At the end of 10 hours,
nobody's mind is going to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversies are not fueled by an increase in dogs.
Although the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association
expects an increase in a census it is now preparing, the estimated
number of dogs in the country two years ago, 54.6 million, was
virtually the same as in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, according to James Weverka, president of the
National Animal Control Association, is that dogs in recent years
have gotten larger, are more likely to be guard dogs and tend to be
confined in smaller spaces by working people who spend less time
with them. Upshot: dogs that seem more threatening roam limited
public spaces, whose owners are more likely to treat them
indulgently.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Weverka _ who serves as animal control manager in
Lincoln, Neb., where a dog catcher was recently beaten by an irate
owner _ says the view of dogs has changed fundamentally from the
time when they were prized for herding or hunting. The increase in
the number of people living alone, including older people whose
children have left the roost, may be a factor. ``There's now a
feeling that dogs are members of the family,'' he said. ``A member
of the family would never bite or attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The love people feel for their furry best friends is suggested
by the stuff the 28.5 million dog owners buy their pets as
Christmas presents. A new apartment tower being built in
Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood will offer a ``doggie bar,'' with
water and treats for pups, and ``doghouse room service,'' providing
milk, bottled water and gourmet dog food. The feeling is almost
parental: Ms. Benjamin says that in 20 years as a dog trainer, she
routinely addressed owners as mommy or daddy, and was never
corrected. But to psychiatrists the attachments may be deeper
still.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth Skodnek, chairman of the psychiatry and psychology
department at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y.,
suggested that dog owners perceive their pets as an extension of
themselves. ``They take everything the pet does or doesn't do very
personally,'' he said. ``If the pet is criticized, they feel
criticized.'' But he said it may be more than even that. ``Pet
owners allow their pets to do things they wouldn't do themselves,''
he said. ``The pet gives them a chance to feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings add ferocity and flair to the dog owners'
presentations. At an Avon, Conn., town meeting last summer, more
than 400 showed up with leashes around their necks. They called a
plan to bar dogs from running free in 230-acre Fisher Meadows Park
a crime against nature, and vowed disobedience. But the ban was
supported in a September referendum. Now, Phil Schenck, the town
manager, wants to bring the warring groups together, perhaps to
find some smaller park area where dogs can go at certain times.
``You need to take the emotion out of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the ban are clearly in the majority, Schenck said.
Similarly, the New York City Parks Department says that user
surveys of parks favored by dog users show that most people in the
parks do not come with dogs; it adds that mail is running more than
3-to-1 in favor of its crackdown. In particular, people are irked
that dog owners berate low-paid park rangers, often minorities, as
Nazis, give them names like Eva Braun and exultantly unleash their
dogs after an enforcer goes around the corner. A typical letter:
``I have yet to see a dog owner take anything other than a position
of righteous indignation when someone objected.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question, perhaps, is what is a dog? Under English
common law, dogs were considered valueless, mere providers of
pleasure as opposed to livestock, which were considered property.
But thinkers from Homer to Freud have invested canines with deeper
importance _ in the same vein as today's dog defenders.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's ultimate aim is not to eliminate pooches but
persuade people to look down on leash-law violators _ just as
people now complain about smokers in restaurants. ``Unleashed dogs
are violating human rights,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern,
owner of Boomer the (leashed) Wonder Dog.

PONDERING A WHITE HOUSE SHRINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID WALLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, people are
wondering what can be done to prevent such a mess from ever
occurring again. For one thing, both major parties are poised to
eliminate, or at least eviscerate, the Office of the Independent
Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But how about an Office of the Independent  &UR; Counselor &LR;  instead?
Some experts suggest that to address the problem of people in the
White House who can't control their darker impulses, the country
needs a shrink on call for Chief Executives, their families and top
aides.
</P>
<P>
   The point was underscored by George Stephanopoulos' revelation
in a new memoir last week that he received psychiatric help and
mood-elevating medication to treat anxiety and depression while
Clinton spin doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental and emotional health treatment is the last political
taboo,'' said Stephanopoulos. ``That was one of the reasons I
resisted seeking help, for fear it would get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephanopoulos exhibited classic avoidance behavior when
asked if he would lobby for an Executive Shrink. The White House
also declined to comment on the notion _ even though the Clinton
administration has championed greater access to mental health care
for all Americans, and the president himself has sought counseling
for his problems from clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Does the notion of an on-call White House shrink seem all that
crazy, in light of the burdens of the presidency and today's
confessional culture?
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to psycho-biographers to ponder whether a White House
psychiatrist could have helped President Clinton curb
self-destructive tendencies. Or if a shrink could have alleviated
President Richard M. Nixon's palpable paranoia, or soothed a
war-haunted President Lyndon B. Johnson. But Fred Greenstein, a
former president of the International Society for the Study of
Political Psychology, considers the presidency too important to be
deprived of immediate psychological support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have someone who is untreated with his finger
on the button or someone who had some place to vent?'' asked
Greenstein, adding a line from Hamlet: `` `Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert, a professor of politics at Northeastern
University and author of ``The Mortal Presidency: Illness and
Anguish in the White House'' (1992), seconds Greenstein's opinion.
He says the White House medical office _ already staffed by five
full-time doctors _ could easily include a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As attitudes towards mental dysfunction change, presidents
might find mental health specialists in the White House
increasingly useful,'' writes Gilbert. ``They would be able to
receive treatment for psychological distress in a routine way, and
the country might be spared an emotionally disabled or impaired
chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear not. Even now, if a president were to suddenly suffer a
severe breakdown, a helicopter filled with security-cleared
psychiatrists would likely land on the White House lawn faster than
you could say, ``So tell me, how long have you been feeling this
way?''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Amy Weiss said the president
can already avail himself of a number of specialists, including a
psychiatrist, at Bethesda Naval Hospital, where presidents undergo
annual physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should receive the same type of medical care
that everybody else receives,'' said Dr. Lawrence Mohr, a White
House physician during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton
administrations. Nevertheless, Mohr expressed apprehension about
turning the White House ``into a hospital,'' and saw no reason to
hire a full-time presidential psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did former President Gerald R. Ford. ``I don't see the need
for someone in that discipline being assigned specifically to the
White House medical office,'' said Ford. ``I think I was normal. I
think I am still normal. If I had any problem along that line
develop, the White House can acquire the best almost
instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether presidents should undergo a mandatory
psychological exam as part of their annual physical, former
President Jimmy Carter replied: ``No, you don't have a mandatory
requirement in the law to check a president for athlete's foot.''
But he added, ``I believe that mental illness should be considered
with the same import as physical illness.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfulfilled wish. Despite Clinton's plea during his
last State of the Union Address that ``no American should ever be
afraid to address'' mental illness, and despite the public's
embrace of ``Analyze This,'' the new mobster-in-therapy hit, there
is considerable doubt over whether Americans are ready to accept a
president on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it may be fine for a mafia boss to have
self-doubts, but not presidents of the United States,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Center for the People and the Press.
``The public wants presidents to steer straight ahead and not look
back, not over-think his hang-ups. The ghost of Thomas Eagleton
still haunts us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Eagleton was the Democratic senator from Missouri who was
dumped from George McGovern's 1972 presidential ticket over the
disclosure that he had been hospitalized for depression and
received electro-shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagleton experience notwithstanding, some say a president
who owned up to psychotherapy might be able to engender public
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than call it a mental health problem, I would couch it
in familial terms,'' suggested Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic
political consultant. ``If you say my president has a problem that
required counseling because he wanted to protect his family and
children, that's much more palatable. Still, the idea of their
leaders needing help is tough for many Americans to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worries Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The signal to the
world that the American president, the leader of the free world, is
having to get advice as to his mental condition might destabilize a
lot of things, including stock markets and negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, said
there would have to be precautions against a
free-associator-in-chief divulging secrets. ``The psychiatrist
would also probably have to sign a document obligating him to raise
an alarm if he detected serious problems that could affect the
president's ability to govern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if White House doctors judge the president incapable of
performing his duties, they can alert the vice president, who can
then invoke the 25th Amendment. It gives the vice president, backed
by a majority of the Cabinet, the power to remove a disabled
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski, however, said the practical concerns of leadership
could render a White House psychiatrist pretty useless. ``My guess
is that these therapists would be sitting there for four years and
never see the president,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Justin Frank, a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist, who
volunteered in an interview to be the first First Shrink, admits
that the doctor-president relationship might be challenging. ``A
therapist would have to be flexible about makeup sessions,'' said
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   And would the president have the right to know whether his ally
by the 50-minute hour were a Democrat or a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Frank, ``but I would have the right not to tell
him.''

wondering what can be done to prevent such a mess from ever
occurring again. For one thing, both major parties are poised to
eliminate, or at least eviscerate, the Office of the Independent
Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But how about an Office of the Independent  &UR; Counselor &LR;  instead?
Some experts suggest that to address the problem of people in the
White House who can't control their darker impulses, the country
needs a shrink on call for Chief Executives, their families and top
aides.
</P>
<P>
   The point was underscored by George Stephanopoulos' revelation
in a new memoir last week that he received psychiatric help and
mood-elevating medication to treat anxiety and depression while
Clinton spin doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental and emotional health treatment is the last political
taboo,'' said Stephanopoulos. ``That was one of the reasons I
resisted seeking help, for fear it would get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephanopoulos exhibited classic avoidance behavior when
asked if he would lobby for an Executive Shrink. The White House
also declined to comment on the notion _ even though the Clinton
administration has championed greater access to mental health care
for all Americans, and the president himself has sought counseling
for his problems from clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Does the notion of an on-call White House shrink seem all that
crazy, in light of the burdens of the presidency and today's
confessional culture?
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to psycho-biographers to ponder whether a White House
psychiatrist could have helped President Clinton curb
self-destructive tendencies. Or if a shrink could have alleviated
President Richard M. Nixon's palpable paranoia, or soothed a
war-haunted President Lyndon B. Johnson. But Fred Greenstein, a
former president of the International Society for the Study of
Political Psychology, considers the presidency too important to be
deprived of immediate psychological support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have someone who is untreated with his finger
on the button or someone who had some place to vent?'' asked
Greenstein, adding a line from Hamlet: `` `Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert, a professor of politics at Northeastern
University and author of ``The Mortal Presidency: Illness and
Anguish in the White House'' (1992), seconds Greenstein's opinion.
He says the White House medical office _ already staffed by five
full-time doctors _ could easily include a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``As attitudes towards mental dysfunction change, presidents
might find mental health specialists in the White House
increasingly useful,'' writes Gilbert. ``They would be able to
receive treatment for psychological distress in a routine way, and
the country might be spared an emotionally disabled or impaired
chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear not. Even now, if a president were to suddenly suffer a
severe breakdown, a helicopter filled with security-cleared
psychiatrists would likely land on the White House lawn faster than
you could say, ``So tell me, how long have you been feeling this
way?''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Amy Weiss said the president
can already avail himself of a number of specialists, including a
psychiatrist, at Bethesda Naval Hospital, where presidents undergo
annual physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should receive the same type of medical care
that everybody else receives,'' said Dr. Lawrence Mohr, a White
House physician during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton
administrations. Nevertheless, Mohr expressed apprehension about
turning the White House ``into a hospital,'' and saw no reason to
hire a full-time presidential psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did former President Gerald R. Ford. ``I don't see the need
for someone in that discipline being assigned specifically to the
White House medical office,'' said Ford. ``I think I was normal. I
think I am still normal. If I had any problem along that line
develop, the White House can acquire the best almost
instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether presidents should undergo a mandatory
psychological exam as part of their annual physical, former
President Jimmy Carter replied: ``No, you don't have a mandatory
requirement in the law to check a president for athlete's foot.''
But he added, ``I believe that mental illness should be considered
with the same import as physical illness.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfulfilled wish. Despite Clinton's plea during his
last State of the Union Address that ``no American should ever be
afraid to address'' mental illness, and despite the public's
embrace of ``Analyze This,'' the new mobster-in-therapy hit, there
is considerable doubt over whether Americans are ready to accept a
president on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it may be fine for a mafia boss to have
self-doubts, but not presidents of the United States,'' said Andrew
Kohut, director of the Pew Center for the People and the Press.
``The public wants presidents to steer straight ahead and not look
back, not over-think his hang-ups. The ghost of Thomas Eagleton
still haunts us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Eagleton was the Democratic senator from Missouri who was
dumped from George McGovern's 1972 presidential ticket over the
disclosure that he had been hospitalized for depression and
received electro-shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagleton experience notwithstanding, some say a president
who owned up to psychotherapy might be able to engender public
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than call it a mental health problem, I would couch it
in familial terms,'' suggested Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic
political consultant. ``If you say my president has a problem that
required counseling because he wanted to protect his family and
children, that's much more palatable. Still, the idea of their
leaders needing help is tough for many Americans to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worries Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The signal to the
world that the American president, the leader of the free world, is
having to get advice as to his mental condition might destabilize a
lot of things, including stock markets and negotiations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security adviser, said
there would have to be precautions against a
free-associator-in-chief divulging secrets. ``The psychiatrist
would also probably have to sign a document obligating him to raise
an alarm if he detected serious problems that could affect the
president's ability to govern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if White House doctors judge the president incapable of
performing his duties, they can alert the vice president, who can
then invoke the 25th Amendment. It gives the vice president, backed
by a majority of the Cabinet, the power to remove a disabled
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski, however, said the practical concerns of leadership
could render a White House psychiatrist pretty useless. ``My guess
is that these therapists would be sitting there for four years and
never see the president,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Justin Frank, a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist, who
volunteered in an interview to be the first First Shrink, admits
that the doctor-president relationship might be challenging. ``A
therapist would have to be flexible about makeup sessions,'' said
Frank.
</P>
<P>
   And would the president have the right to know whether his ally
by the 50-minute hour were a Democrat or a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Frank, ``but I would have the right not to tell
him.''

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Announcing her presidential exploratory
committee here last week, Elizabeth Dole invoked the last
Republican hero, Ronald Reagan. Three days earlier, presenting his
own committee in Austin, Texas Gov. George W. Bush mentioned the
first Republican hero, Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Neither made even a reference to two of the biggest names in
Republican politics today, who also happen to be their most
prominent supporters: former Sen. Bob Dole and former President
George Bush, respectively. Both were conspicuously absent from the
events. The closest Dole came to appearing with his wife was in one
of seven blown-up photographs that served as the backdrop. (Reagan
got equal billing: There was a photograph of him and Mrs. Dole.)
</P>
<P>
   A Bush or a Dole has appeared on every Republican presidential
ticket since 1976. But by distancing themselves from their famous
family members, the latest Bush and Dole candidates to seek the
White House demonstrate the complications _ the drawbacks as well
as advantages _ of belonging to political dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their individual accomplishments, Mrs. Dole and Bush
would not be such hot tickets _ they are swamping the GOP field in
early polls _ were it not for their pedigrees. Behind the scenes,
they have been eagerly tapping into their families' extended
financial and political networks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the obligatory questions by reporters about his father,
Bush repeated his well-practiced reply after his announcement last
week: ``I inherited half his friends and all his enemies. I'm
working on the other half of his friends _ and trying to peel off a
few of his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the voters who regard the Bush and Dole names as famous,
others view them as infamous. So the two newest national contenders
are forced to make a purely political calculation: How closely do
they want to be identified with losers? Who can forget that Dole,
the former Senate Republican leader, suffered a humiliating defeat
to President Clinton in 1996? Or that former President Bush was
ousted from office by him in 1992?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is very straightforward, to try to get all the
benefits of the famous name _ and none of the negatives,'' said
Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary in the 1996 campaign. ``The
spotlight would not be nearly as bright for Elizabeth if her last
name were Doyle. But any losing campaign leaves bad memories, so
too much deja Dole can hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are sensitive to the suggestion that they are
riding on familial coattails. Bush, who earned $14 million from a
minority investment in the Texas Rangers baseball team, is a widely
popular governor in his own right; Mrs. Dole served in five
administrations, twice in the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Both are determined not to be compared with the Kennedys, whose
patriarch, Joseph Kennedy, was perceived as prodding his sons into
politics. Americans ``are a robustly anti-dynastic culture,'' said
Tony Dolan, Reagan's former chief speech writer, who recently met
with the elder Bush in Texas. ``George W. has to make clear that he
doesn't think he has a right to inheritance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's newly hired pollster, Linda DiVall, distinguished
her candidate from another spouse of a famous politician _ Hillary
Rodham Clinton _ who is toying with running for the U.S. Senate
from New York. ``She is not running because she is the spouse or
out of any sense of entitlement _ or what we see with Hillary
Clinton,'' Ms. DiVall said. ``And there's no attempt to hide him.
But she needs to establish her individual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In personality alone, the candidates cannot be accused of being
spinoffs of their more celebrated _ in some cases, scorned _ kin.
Mrs. Dole, who has never been elected to office, is a regimented
perfectionist; her husband, a veteran politician, is known for his
looser, seat-of-the-pants approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at contrasts to his father, Bush cited his distinct
upbringing and achievements. ``I went to Sam Houston Elementary
School in Midland, Texas,'' he said last week. ``And he went to
Greenwich Country Day in Connecticut. I married Laura; he married
Barbara. He was never a governor, and, therefore, it's hard to get
an apples-to-apples comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But comparisons are inevitable, particularly since both
candidates have refused to answer questions about their positions
on crucial national and international matters. That has left their
rivals to fill in the blanks. Naming no names, two familiar
presidential candidates, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes, himself
the scion of publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes, recently sought to
get at the son by condemning the father's promise of a ``kinder and
gentler'' nation.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have been left to assume _ rightly or wrongly _ that Gov.
Bush's and Mrs. Dole's philosophies do not diverge appreciably from
that of former President Bush or Dole. Despite the governor's
popularity in the polls, for example, surveys continue to show that
many Republicans confuse Bush with his father. And in random
interviews at Republican events, participants who favor abortion
rights often remark that Bush's anti-abortion stand was tolerable
because they remembered that his father once was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Mrs. Dole and Bush to define themselves has left
Republicans searching for hints. That Richard Darman, President
Bush's budget director, has been nowhere to be seen in his son's
organization has sent a signal that the governor has a more
conservative economic philosophy. Many conservatives blame Darman
for talking the president into the politically fatal tax increase
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   From the opposite perspective, many conservatives groused last
week about Mrs. Dole's hiring of Ms. DiVall because she has worked
for Planned Parenthood and the National Education Association,
which are seen as liberal organizations. (Ms. DiVall says she has
also had many conservatives on her client roster, including Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.) In
assembling a staff, Mrs. Dole has pointedly reached beyond her
husband's advisers from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, one of Bush's top supporters, state Sen. Thurman
Gaskill, said voters should not expect the governor to campaign
alongside his father. Gaskill, who was also a big backer of the
elder Bush, explained, ``Conservatives always had some reservations
with President Bush, and that's who the governor has to appeal to.
He wants to make them feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their determination to break free, Bush and Mrs. Dole
can take heart that Vice President Al Gore, the current Democratic
front-runner, dare not attack them for their lineage. After Gore
was picked as Clinton's running mate in 1992, his father, former
Sen. Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., remarked that his namesake was
destined for the White House, saying, ``He was raised for it.''

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good science often starts with flights of imagination that are
all but unknown publicly. That's because the creative process ends
in scientific reports cast to seem as dry and objective as
possible. All the same, history shows scientists driven by visions
not only wild in their own day, but sometimes still audacious.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Kepler, who discovered that the planets move in
elliptical paths around the Sun, was motivated by a mystical love
of musical harmonies. Friedrich August Kekule, a founder of organic
chemistry, told of hitting on the ring structure of benzene after a
dream in which a snake curled itself into a loop. Ernest
Rutherford, inspired by the majesty of the solar system, proposed a
model of the atom in which electrons orbit around a central
nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, science is toying quietly with the notion that all
terrestrial life came from Mars _ that we, in effect, are the
Martians.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that billions of years ago, life arose first on the
red planet, probably dotted back then with blue lakes and seas.
Cosmic collisions sent the alien slimes and microbes flying on
rocky debris through space like so many windblown seeds until they
fell to Earth and flourished, in time producing such specimens as
Monica Lewinsky and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound goofy. But supporting evidence, if sketchy, has
been growing steadily for a decade. So Aliens ``R'' Us is a hot
topic. Scientists even plan to address the issue experimentally as
Mars probes costing many billions of dollars swing into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, nearly everybody believes it's
plausible,'' said Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell
University. ``Who knows? Maybe we are the little green men.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rummel, a top NASA biologist who explores the
extraterrestrial life issue, agreed. ``It's a fascinating
question,'' he said, adding that scientists in the next few years
may find that Martians and Earthlings are ``really the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The wilder dreams of science are seldom aired in public. When
they are, the unveiling tends to be done by superstars, not the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sagan, the late astronomer and science author, in his 1994
book, ``Pale Blue Dot'' (Random House), asked gingerly if the
Earthly tree of life could have arisen from Martian seeds, if the
two planets ``regularly exchanged life-forms'' over the ages.
</P>
<P>
   So too, Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA's structure, in
his 1981 book, ``Life Itself'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), broached the
more general idea that primitive life came to Earth from somewhere
in outer space, a notion known as panspermia.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such musings lies a problem of logic that has grown more
unsettling in recent years. The time appears to have been very
short between the end of the lethal bombardment of the young Earth
by all kinds of planetary crud and building blocks (the same blitz
that pockmarked the Moon) and the start of terrestrial life. By
some estimates, the two events were nearly simultaneous, leaving no
time for the slow twists and turns of biologic evolution. So
scientists often look to the heavens for answers.
</P>
<P>
   As a birthplace, Mars seems increasingly apt. Though cold and
dry today, it is thought to have been wetter and warmer long ago. A
growing number of scientists argue that it was far more habitable
than the early Earth, if only because its small size made it less
of a target for cosmic intruders big enough to wipe out all
rudimentary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being out when the hunters are drunk,'' said Norman
Sleep, a geophysicist at Stanford University who sees Mars as the
cradle of life. ``You're better off being a rabbit than a deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also wowing Mars fans is the discovery that cosmic smashups of
an ordinary sort have sent hundreds of tons of the distant planet
falling to Earth. Experts estimate that a Mars rock lands as often
as every three days, and that billions have done so over time _
even though only 13 of them have been identified so far.
</P>
<P>
   The rain of debris from Mars was hardest, experts agree, in the
Earth's early days. And the reverse trip was far less likely
because the Sun pulls Earth debris away from Mars and toward
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of Cornell and his colleagues, using big computers to
track likely paths of Mars debris, made news in 1996 by showing
that the trek to Earth through the wilds of outer space could be as
short as a few months. ``We were stunned to see how easily this
material moves around,'' Burns remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists see other tantalizing clues. Some forms of
terrestrial life, they note, can withstand dangerously high levels
of radiation _ the main bar to unprotected life surviving the
rigors of outer space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, scientists reported that Deinococcus radiodurans, a
microbe often found around nuclear reactors, could easily handle a
dose 3,000 times stronger than what would kill a human. A riddle is
why the microbe's skills evolved, since Earth apparently never
experienced such high levels of radiation. Could it be that it came
from somewhere in space where radiation is much higher?
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, scientists hope to settle the Aliens
``R'' Us question once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Mars probes are already returning stunning photos. NASA hopes to
find Martian life, either fossil or extant, and return samples of
it to Earth by 2008 for detailed analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, scientists say, we may finally find ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, this wasn't a live issue,'' said
Sleep. ``Now everybody is thinking about the possibility.''

IF YOU WANT TO SEE A MARTIAN, LOOK IN THE MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good science often starts with flights of imagination that are
all but unknown publicly. That's because the creative process ends
in scientific reports cast to seem as dry and objective as
possible. All the same, history shows scientists driven by visions
not only wild in their own day, but sometimes still audacious.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Kepler, who discovered that the planets move in
elliptical paths around the Sun, was motivated by a mystical love
of musical harmonies. Friedrich August Kekule, a founder of organic
chemistry, told of hitting on the ring structure of benzene after a
dream in which a snake curled itself into a loop. Ernest
Rutherford, inspired by the majesty of the solar system, proposed a
model of the atom in which electrons orbit around a central
nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, science is toying quietly with the notion that all
terrestrial life came from Mars _ that we, in effect, are the
Martians.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that billions of years ago, life arose first on the
red planet, probably dotted back then with blue lakes and seas.
Cosmic collisions sent the alien slimes and microbes flying on
rocky debris through space like so many windblown seeds until they
fell to Earth and flourished, in time producing such specimens as
Monica Lewinsky and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound goofy. But supporting evidence, if sketchy, has
been growing steadily for a decade. So Aliens ``R'' Us is a hot
topic. Scientists even plan to address the issue experimentally as
Mars probes costing many billions of dollars swing into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, nearly everybody believes it's
plausible,'' said Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell
University. ``Who knows? Maybe we are the little green men.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rummel, a top NASA biologist who explores the
extraterrestrial life issue, agreed. ``It's a fascinating
question,'' he said, adding that scientists in the next few years
may find that Martians and Earthlings are ``really the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The wilder dreams of science are seldom aired in public. When
they are, the unveiling tends to be done by superstars, not the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Sagan, the late astronomer and science author, in his 1994
book, ``Pale Blue Dot'' (Random House), asked gingerly if the
Earthly tree of life could have arisen from Martian seeds, if the
two planets ``regularly exchanged life-forms'' over the ages.
</P>
<P>
   So too, Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA's structure, in
his 1981 book, ``Life Itself'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), broached the
more general idea that primitive life came to Earth from somewhere
in outer space, a notion known as panspermia.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such musings lies a problem of logic that has grown more
unsettling in recent years. The time appears to have been very
short between the end of the lethal bombardment of the young Earth
by all kinds of planetary crud and building blocks (the same blitz
that pockmarked the Moon) and the start of terrestrial life. By
some estimates, the two events were nearly simultaneous, leaving no
time for the slow twists and turns of biologic evolution. So
scientists often look to the heavens for answers.
</P>
<P>
   As a birthplace, Mars seems increasingly apt. Though cold and
dry today, it is thought to have been wetter and warmer long ago. A
growing number of scientists argue that it was far more habitable
than the early Earth, if only because its small size made it less
of a target for cosmic intruders big enough to wipe out all
rudimentary life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being out when the hunters are drunk,'' said Norman
Sleep, a geophysicist at Stanford University who sees Mars as the
cradle of life. ``You're better off being a rabbit than a deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also wowing Mars fans is the discovery that cosmic smashups of
an ordinary sort have sent hundreds of tons of the distant planet
falling to Earth. Experts estimate that a Mars rock lands as often
as every three days, and that billions have done so over time _
even though only 13 of them have been identified so far.
</P>
<P>
   The rain of debris from Mars was hardest, experts agree, in the
Earth's early days. And the reverse trip was far less likely
because the Sun pulls Earth debris away from Mars and toward
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of Cornell and his colleagues, using big computers to
track likely paths of Mars debris, made news in 1996 by showing
that the trek to Earth through the wilds of outer space could be as
short as a few months. ``We were stunned to see how easily this
material moves around,'' Burns remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists see other tantalizing clues. Some forms of
terrestrial life, they note, can withstand dangerously high levels
of radiation _ the main bar to unprotected life surviving the
rigors of outer space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, scientists reported that Deinococcus radiodurans, a
microbe often found around nuclear reactors, could easily handle a
dose 3,000 times stronger than what would kill a human. A riddle is
why the microbe's skills evolved, since Earth apparently never
experienced such high levels of radiation. Could it be that it came
from somewhere in space where radiation is much higher?
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, scientists hope to settle the Aliens
``R'' Us question once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Mars probes are already returning stunning photos. NASA hopes to
find Martian life, either fossil or extant, and return samples of
it to Earth by 2008 for detailed analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, scientists say, we may finally find ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, this wasn't a live issue,'' said
Sleep. ``Now everybody is thinking about the possibility.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BLACK AND BLUE &LR;  By Anna Quindlen. Dell, $7.50. The heroine of
this novel is a Brooklyn nurse who packs up her 10-year-old son and
flees her abusive husband, reinventing herself in Florida and
waiting anxiously for her past to catch up with her. ``Quindlen
understands thrillers, and her story is well constructed,
beautifully paced,'' Maggie Paley wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSILIENCE: THE UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE &LR;  By Edward O. Wilson.
Vintage, $14. The renowned sociobiologist argues that consilience _
a grand union of knowledge bound by a set of universal laws _ has
been achieved in the natural sciences but needs to be extended to
the humanities and social sciences. Such a vast interweaving of
disciplines is urgently needed, he maintains, to solve global
problems like the destruction of the environment. ``Wilson's book
sweeps across vast areas of learning in lucid, unpretentious, often
eloquent prose,'' Daniel J. Kevles wrote last year. It is ``an
arresting exposition of Wilson's religion of science and a kind of
sermon ... intended to assist in the reform of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALIENS OF AFFECTION: STORIES &LR;  By Padgett Powell. Owl/Holt, $14.
These tales are populated by lively eccentrics and losers who cast
off the bland conformity of contemporary Southern life. ``In all of
the stories there is the good humor and humane intelligence that
make Powell's work so appealing,'' A.O. Scott wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ONE BEST WAY: FREDERICK WINSLOW TAYLOR AND THE ENIGMA OF
EFFICIENCY &LR;  By Robert Kanigel. Penguin, $17.95. Frederick Winslow
Taylor (1856-1915) helped to reshape industry by arguing that the
key to increased productivity is not raw muscle alone but knowledge
gained by painstaking inspection and measurement and then properly
applied. ``Kanigel's richly detailed biography ... shows how much
drama there was in the mundane when Taylor was making it the stuff
of a new `science' of efficiency,'' George F. Will wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAR: A DRAMA OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE &LR;  By Mary Walton. Norton,
$17. This is an account of the radical redesign of the Ford Taurus
for the 1996 model year and a critical analysis of Ford's corporate
culture. ``This is the rare business book that is a page turner,''
Keith Bradsher wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAPA HEMINGWAY: A PERSONAL MEMOIR &LR;  By A.E. Hotchner. Carroll &AMP;
Graf, $13.95. The author was a close friend during the last 14
years of Ernest Hemingway's life, and his admiring account is
filled with gossip, anecdotes and observations of Hemingway's daily
routines, from his obsessive work habits to his fondness for
alcohol sponge baths. ``Part Boswell, part Euripides, Hotchner has
written a greatly detailed and very loving book,'' Vance Bourjaily
wrote in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HEMINGWAY WOMEN &LR;  By Bernice Kert. Norton, $16.95. This book
focuses on the writer's complex relationships with his four wives
and his domineering mother, Grace. The author reserves ``her
highest praise for the women Hemingway hated the most _ especially
his mother,'' Aaron Latham wrote in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOUSE GUN &LR;  By Nadine Gordimer. Penguin, $12.95. In
post-apartheid South Africa, a liberal white couple are stunned
when their son kills another white man in a crime of passion and
chooses a black lawyer for his defense. Last year the reviewer Jack
Miles called this an ``elegantly conceived, flawlessly executed
novel'' about race, violence and spiritual turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST APOCALYPSE: EUROPE AT THE YEAR 1000 A.D. &LR;  By James
Reston Jr. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. A.D. 999 was a decisive, if
bloody, year in European history, one in which the continent
finally began to gain ground in its long wars against Viking,
Moorish and Magyar invaders, and Christianity overwhelmed the
forces of paganism. ``Reston constructs a colorful and dramatic
story,'' David Walton wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARNEY'S VERSION &LR;  By Mordecai Richler. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Barney Panovsky is a cranky, aging Jewish Canadian who
puts his failing memory to the test when he sets out to refute the
mean things written about him in a rival's autobiography. Barney's
memoir, stretching back to 1950s Paris and covering three marriages
and his best friend's death, manages to offend just about everyone
involved. In 1997 James Shapiro called Richler ``a gifted stylist,
with a great ear for parody and comic dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY
KRAVITZ &LR;  ($14), an earlier novel featuring another of the author's
Jewish anti-heroes, an enterprising hustler who claws his way up
from the mean streets of Montreal. ``The total effect is as brash
and blatant as a sports car rally _ and as suggestive of power,''
Florence Crowther wrote in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GRANDMOTHER'S TALE: AND SELECTED STORIES &LR;  By R.K. Narayan.
Ecco, $16. These stories exploring small-town Brahmin society in
southern India are marked by simple narratives, sharply drawn
characters and a Hindu humanism. In 1994 the reviewer Shashi
Tharoor called the author ``a consummate teller of timeless tales,
a meticulous recorder of the ironies of human life ... India's
answer to Jane Austen.''

STEVE MARTIN: STILL WILD BUT NOT AS CRAZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Steve Martin with Goldie Hawn in a scene
from ``The Out-of-Towners.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn can't help being funny together.
 &HT;    Case study: Hawn has just finished chatting with a group of
journalists at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, and Martin is on
deck. They're there to promote their second film together, ``The
Out-of-Towners,'' a remake of the 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis
comedy.
 &HT;    As Hawn rises to leave and Martin appears in the doorway, a
journalist asks Hawn who designed her outfit.
 &HT;    The actress scrunches her face.
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' she says.
 &HT;    Martin is happy to help out, loping forward to tug on the collar
of Hawn's sweater and examine its label.
 &HT;    ``It's a Marnie,'' he says.
 &HT;    And the skirt? Martin, clearly enjoying himself, heads south to
inspect another label.
 &HT;    ``Your pantyhose are by ... '' he says jokingly, then reads the
skirt label aloud: ``Handmade, hand wash in cold ... ''
 &HT;    Everyone laughs, Hawn included, and then the actress heads out
and leaves the stage to Martin, a funnyman who these days is funny
only when he wants to be.
 &HT;    ``The Out-of-Towners'' is one of those times. Opening nationwide
on April 2, it casts Martin and Hawn _ who first teamed for
``Housesitter'' (1992) _ as a long-married Ohio couple confronting
empty-nest syndrome. Their answer is a trip to New York in quest of
a restored spark to their marriage, but the journey quickly
deteriorates into a barrage of muggings, arrests, drug-induced
strange behavior and frustrating encounters with a haughty hotel
manager (John Cleese).
 &HT;    The idea for the remake came from Paramount Pictures chief
Sherry Lansing, recalls Martin, who says he loved the original
film.
 &HT;    ``Sherry Lansing had the idea, and I felt that the
antidisestablishmentarianism of the situation ... '' he stops as
reporters' pens clatter in dismay, then laughs.
 &HT;    ``No, it was Sherry's idea,'' he says more conventionally. ``It
sounded good. Then I got a little cold feet, but Goldie convinced
me. She said, `I think this movie is really about something
important. I think it's about what happens when the kids are grown
_ how does a couple that's been busy for 19 years get back together
and what are they going to do?'
 &HT;    ``I thought that was a good topic,'' he says, ``and the script
started developing in that specific direction.''
 &HT;    On the set, the actor reports, he and Hawn _ both veteran
comedians whose work has turned more serious of late _ relished the
give-and-take of an out-and-out comedy.
 &HT;    ``We make each other laugh,'' he says. ``That gives you a lot of
encouragement. A lot of things were boldly ad-libbed, and they
worked.
 &HT;    ``We both came up in television,'' Martin adds, ``and there's a
great quickness and expediency about television. We're both
expedient, and we both know that to worry something to death kills
it. So we'd say, `Let's just try it. Let's just do it.'''
 &HT;    There was a time when Martin made a movie or two every year.
These days he turns up onscreen less often, and when he does it's
less likely to be in a zany, highly commercial comedy than in a
smaller drama such as ``The Spanish Prisoner'' (1998) or something
he himself wrote, such as the upcoming ``Bowfinger.''
 &HT;    ``I was talking with a friend the other day,'' he says, ``and w
said that the problem today is that the only success is a total
success. We don't take pride in artistic success or a medium
success _ Hollywood only views success as total success.''
 &HT;    Besides, he's becoming more and more active offscreen,
particularly as a writer. A turning point was ``Picasso at the
Lapin Agile'' (1995), the highly acclaimed stage play that explored
the creative and scientific processes.
 &HT;    ``In a weird way I think the writing has helped my acting,'' he
says. ``When you do the same thing over and over you get better,
but you also get disconnected from it. Writing is very direct _
it's you and the paper, and it's coming out of your heart.
 &HT;    ``When I wrote the play I thought, `Why can't I write a
screenplay in the same spirit as I wrote the play?''' he recalls.
``I didn't care about anything, and I didn't think anybody was even
going to see `Picasso.'
 &HT;    ``So I gave it a shot with `Bowfinger.'''
 &HT;    Directed by Frank Oz _ who put Martin through his paces in
``Little Shop of Horrors'' (1986), ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''
(1988) and ``Housesitter'' _ ``Bowfinger'' stars Martin and Eddie
Murphy, and will reach theaters this summer.
 &HT;    ``It's about a loser movie producer who tries to get a movie
made with a big star who refuses to do it,'' says Martin, who plays
the producer to Murphy's actor. ``We decide to make the movie
anyway, with him in it, but without telling him.
 &HT;    ``Eddie is so talented it makes me sick.''
 &HT;    Being a screenwriter _ which he has been since ``Roxanne''
(1987) _ is only one of Martin's accomplishments. In a career which
has had more than its share of ups and downs, he's passed through
myriad incarnations as a magician, a stand-up comedian, a comedy
writer for hire, a frequent guest host of ``Saturday Night Live,''
a stage and screen actor, a playwright and a short-story author, to
name only the high points.
 &HT;    But it was his years as a stand-up comic which set the stage for
everything else. Martin regularly sold out 20,000-seat arenas in
his heyday as the ``wild and crazy guy'' who kept a fish in his
pocket and walked about the stage with an arrow through his head.
 &HT;    The wild and crazy guy made Martin famous, the first stand-up
comic to achieve rock-star levels of success. But eventually he
abandoned the fish, the arrow and the stand-up routine altogether.
And while there are certain aspects of that persona in the goofy
physical comedy of ``The Out-of-Towners,'' he says he's never
really looked back.
 &HT;    ``I don't miss it,'' he says. ``Ever. It's a very hard thing to
do. It's hard because you stake everything on every show, and they
can't all be great.
 &HT;    ``So many things can be wrong,'' he adds. ``The audience or you
or the microphone. Those great shows stand out, which means the
rest of them were not that good.''
 &HT;    At 53, with little concern about box-office numbers or star
perks and with the confidence of an actor who can afford to age _
since his livelihood was never predicated on movie-star looks or
sex appeal _ Martin can pretty much do what he wants when he wants.
 &HT;    It's an enviable position, and one that is rare in Hollywood,
especially for women.
 &HT;    ``It's much harder for women, even young actresses,'' he says.
``If you're known at 22 for being a sexy girl, then at 28 there's
the next sexy girl, unless you've established something.
 &HT;    ``That's the accomplishment of Goldie and Diane Keaton, but
especially Goldie,'' he says. ``She was the young, sexy girl, but
she transcended it through, I think, being the kind of person she
is. Goldie's talented _ really smart, astute and direct.''
 &HT;    As for himself, Martin says he's perfectly at ease with growing
older. The shock of white hair that made him look older when he was
in his late 20s now lets him merely look his age.
 &HT;    He also feels more comfortable with himself, personally and
professionally, he adds.
 &HT;    ``It's better,'' he says, hunting for words. ``Through time,
people respect you. People are not just using you. They're
awestruck sometimes.''
 &HT;    And then he smiles.
 &HT;    ``They're more polite than in the old days, when people would
come up to me and say `Be funny!'''

 &HT;    He isn't even 27 yet, and Ben Affleck has already won an Academy
Award, become an international celebrity and had a much-publicized
romance with one of Hollywood's hottest actresses.
 &HT;    You can call him an overnight success if you like _ Affleck
won't mind.
 &HT;    ``You get lucky,'' he says. ``You just have to hang onto the
hope that it's going to work out for you at some point. If you
actually considered the odds of becoming successful in Hollywood,
it would become too depressing and demoralizing. You have to
understand it has as much to do with good fortune as it does with
talent and hard work.''
 &HT;    Well, talent doesn't hurt. Affleck was a triple threat in 1997,
when he proved himself as a leading man in Kevin Smith's quirky
independent film ``Chasing Amy,'' then shone as a supporting actor
in the box-office smash ``Good Will Hunting.''
 &HT;    And, oh yes, he and ``Good Will'' co-star Matt Damon also took
home an Oscar for best original screenplay.
 &HT;    The next year wasn't bad, either _ 1998 brought a featured role
in the blockbuster ``Armageddon'' and another eye-catching
supporting turn, this time in the Oscar-nominated ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' It was a part he'd accepted primarily to be close to his
girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, the lovely _ and also Oscar-nominated _
star of the Elizabethan-era romance.
 &HT;    Those two years are a tough act to follow, but Affleck will do
his best, starting with ``Forces of Nature,'' a romantic comedy
co-starring Sandra Bullock and opening nationwide on March 19.
 &HT;    Affleck, who was typecast as a tough guy in early roles in films
such as ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993) and ``Mall Rats'' (1996), is
looking forward to his role as a conservative, buttoned-down New
Yorker who, on his way to his wedding in Georgia, encounters a
series of delays and an eccentric, free-spirited young woman
(Bullock) who makes him rethink his life.
 &HT;    ``I'm actually a very firm and devout believer in happily ever
after,'' the actor says. ``I think that's the noblest of all human
endeavors. When you get to the everyday challenge of sharing your
life with somebody, I think the whole is greater than the sum of
the parts.
 &HT;    ``It takes compromise and sacrifice,'' he adds. ``But the ideal
world is where you wake up with the same person every day and feel
lucky to be there, because you support one another.''
 &HT;    Any hopes he had of achieving that goal with Paltrow apparently
were dashed when the couple's much-publicized romance ended
abruptly earlier this year. At least it seemed to end _ but Affleck
and Paltrow were sitting together at the Golden Globe Awards in
January, and he later made a surprise appearance when she
guest-hosted ``Saturday Night Live.''
 &HT;    Affleck won't shed any light on his current status with Paltrow,
but he doesn't mind talking about their ``Saturday Night Live''
duet.
 &HT;    ``So much scurrilous stuff had been written about us that I
thought it would a way to poke fun at the whole aspect of people
caught in the bind of having to lead public lives while trying to
hide their private lives,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``It's like everybody was chasing us, to the point where we felt
like a pair of bizarre little hamsters running on a wheel,'' the
actor says. ``How would you like it if your romances got reported
in the media? I put hexes on those writers. I send them a little
voodoo curse.''
 &HT;    The reality, he admits, is that there's little he can do about
the media's fascination with his love life.
 &HT;    ``It's hard to have a sense of humor, but you have to accept it
and roll your eyes,'' he says. ``You can't win except by being
yourself, and you can't just stay at home alone and worry about it
_ that's no fun.''
 &HT;    Affleck sighs.
 &HT;    ``They had me dating Calista Flockhart,'' he says bemusedly. ``I
think I met her once, at the Golden Globes two years ago. I have no
idea where that came from.
 &HT;    ``Some of the things that are written about me are so bizarre
that I just have to laugh,'' he adds. ``There was a story that I
went and bought every condom in a Wisconsin 7-Eleven. I have never
even been in Wisconsin.
 &HT;    ``But the best part,'' he says with a laugh, ``was that Trojan
sent me a gift basket full of, like, thousands of condoms with a
note that said, `Now you only have to go to 7-Eleven for beer.'''
 &HT;    Anyone wondering about Affleck and Bullock should look
elsewhere. Paltrow was a frequent visitor to the set _ her mother,
Blythe Danner, even has a role in the film _ and, anyway, Affleck
insists that it's far from inevitable that an actor fall in love
with his leading lady.
 &HT;    ``In real life,'' he says, ``you're really looking for another
person that goes beyond the kind of one-line image that the media
has created for them.''
 &HT;    Affleck gives his own image a new twist in ``Force of Nature,''
when he is forced into doing an impromptu striptease in a bar. Yes,
he drops his pants _ it was his shirt that he kept on, actually.
 &HT;    ``There's a reason,'' the actor explains. ``I have tattoos on my
shoulders, and if I had taken my shirt off they would have had to
cover them with makeup, because they wouldn't have fit my
character. That's a laborious process which I went through on
another film, and I'll do anything to avoid it.
 &HT;    ``But I worked hard on my moves when I was stripping,'' he adds
with a grin. ``I was hedging my bets, thinking maybe I could
develop a second career. I'm always ready to pick up another
trade.''
 &HT;    While Affleck is obviously kidding, he doesn't deny that there
were times early in his Hollywood career when he couldn't help
wondering about other lines of work.
 &HT;    ``I remember auditioning for `Beverly Hills 90210' when I really
needed money,'' he says. ``I had never watched the series, and I
kind of did what I thought was a very subtle reading. Even though
it was a romantic part, I didn't want it to be a cliche.
 &HT;    ``The next day the producers called my agent and told them how
terrible I was,'' he recalls. ``They basically said, `Your guy had
so little energy we could hardly hear him. I guarantee you he will
never appear on `Beverly Hills 90210!'
 &HT;    ``And my agent was screaming at me, `Who do you think you are,
Marlon Brando? You were auditioning for a teen series!'''
 &HT;    Chances are that Affleck could get on the show nowadays at the
drop of a hat, given the teen following he's acquired since playing
the guy who got the girl (Liv Tyler) and risked his life to save
the world in ``Armageddon.'' But the actor remains ambivalent about
his image as a hunk.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a mistake to get caught up in how the media is
categorizing you,'' he says. ``It's easy to become a canvas on
which the audience and the media paint their own fantasies. All you
can do as an actor is to try and be your best, without trying to
live up to what you think people want you to be.
 &HT;    ``The upside,'' Affleck adds, ``is that you get a kick out of
being successful, which is a rarity for any actor who's had to
struggle. You get perks and opportunities that you never knew
existed.
 &HT;    ``The downside is that you not only give up your privacy, you're
known for who people think you are from what they see up there on
the big screen. And that means they don't really know you at all.''

SCOT FREE: ROBERT CARLYLE HAS GONE HOLLYWOOD, AND HE'S HAVING A
BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Robert Carlyle in a scene from
``Ravenous.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No wonder so many people want to kill James Bond.
 &HT;    Take Robert Carlyle, the Scottish actor who will play the
villain in the latest Bond installment, ``The World is Not
Enough.''
 &HT;    As Bond, Pierce Brosnan drives a cool Aston-Martin car with all
the latest accessories, including the newest ``Bond girl,'' Denise
Richards. Between stunts, he finds time to down yet another martini
_ shaken, naturally, but not stirred.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carlyle's character is actually dying even before the
film starts. With a bullet lodged in his brain, he's utterly
ruthless because he has literally nothing to lose.
 &HT;    ``Look, I don't really want to dominate James' world. I just
want to blow it up,'' Carlyle says with a maniacal laugh. ``I'm a
total destructo!''
 &HT;    If the star of the down-and-dirty British films
``Trainspotting'' (1996) and ``The Full Monty'' (1997) seems out of
place in the jet-set world of James Bond, he's equally incongruous
in Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, where he's visiting briefly to
meet the press for his new film, ``Ravenous.''
 &HT;    The 38-year-old actor walks in still yawning and rubbing his
head _ which is almost completely bald for his Bond duties. Still,
he looks fit and handsome in jeans and a black Hugo Boss suit
jacket.
 &HT;    It's shortly after breakfast _ which is just as well, because
``Ravenous,'' which co-stars Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy
Davies and David Arquette, deals with the not-exactly-appetizing
subject of cannibalism.
 &HT;    Set in 1847 America, it concerns a group of settlers who, on
their way west, are forced to take shelter in an isolated cave. One
thing leads to another, and ... well, let's just say that Carlyle's
character develops a whole new culinary philosophy.
 &HT;    Even after ``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' this is
material which is, to put it mildly, noncommercial.
 &HT;    ``I don't consider the life consequences, career consequences or
other people's sensibilities when I choose a role,'' Carlyle says
calmly. ``I don't think it's my job to worry about these matters.
Some actors do, of course, but I don't want to build a whole career
on how I think people will perceive my every move.''
 &HT;    Which is good, because ``Ravenous'' is sure to be controversial.
Even the cast was caught up in debate, the actor recalls, with
daily discussions on and off the set about cannibalism and the
inescapable question, ``Would you if you had to?''
 &HT;    ``The subject is infinitely fascinating,'' Carlyle says. ``I
think, without a doubt, I'd do it. What I believe in is the
survival instinct, which is the most powerful emotion we have _
you're always going to try to keep your nose above the water.''
 &HT;    His next three films, all due this year, are on more
conventional themes. They include ``Plunkett and MacLeane,'' a
period film about two highwaymen, with Liv Tyler co-starring. Then
comes ``The World Is Not Enough,'' followed by the big-screen
adaptation of Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir, ``Angela's
Ashes,'' directed by Alan Parker and co-starring Oscar nominee
Emily Watson.
 &HT;    Carlyle has only recently completed filming ``Angela's Ashes''
on location in Dublin, which movie magic turned into the grim
Limerick of McCourt's youth.
 &HT;    ``Every single morning, I had dirt applied all over my body,''
the actor recalls, grimacing. ``It was disgusting. We actually had
a pot on the set called `Standard Grime.' They would take out this
bucket and slop it all over you. It really messed up your skin.''
 &HT;    It was an anything-but-glamorous development in a career that
has already offered a fair number of unexpected twists for the
Glasgow-born son of two house painters, who originally planned to
follow in their footsteps.
 &HT;    ``I was 24 years old and working as a house painter,'' he
recalls. ``But then a friend of mine gave me a copy of `The
Crucible.' When I read this great work, I thought, `How fantastic
to be able to talk to the world about important issues!'
 &HT;    ``It seemed like a beautiful way to make a living.''
 &HT;    Talking to the world was one thing, but doing it in a Scottish
accent was another. Even in drama school he had to fight against
pressure to homogenize his speech.
 &HT;    ``Early on,'' he recalls, ``a professor said to me, `You'll
never work because you refuse to change your accent.'''
 &HT;    Actually, however, Carlyle has worked steadily, usually as
morally challenged characters in grittily realistic British films
and television shows.
 &HT;    After reaching more or less the extreme as ``Trainspotting's''
repellent thug Begbie, a guy who delighted in ``glassing'' _
shoving people's faces through glass windows or doors _ Carlyle was
looking for a more human, sympathetic role. He found it in ``The
Full Monty'' as Gaz, an unemployed, divorced father who finally
resorts to joining his similarly downsized mates in staging a strip
show.
 &HT;    ``To me that film is still about gender politics,'' he says.
``It's about men suddenly having to look at themselves in the way
that men have been looking at women for years.''
 &HT;    And about women looking at them, which is a lingering sensitive
point. The final scene of the film involves an audience of hundreds
of women whooping and cheering the blue-collar strippers. Audiences
for the film saw it only from behind, but the women on the set
actually saw ... well, the fuller Monty.
 &HT;    ``Filming that strip scene was the most terrifying thing in my
whole life,'' Carlyle says, looking like he might blush even now.
``I would never do it again, no matter how much money was involved.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have on that little sock that most men use in nude
scene,'' he says, stammering. ``Consequently I felt so exposed.
Plus there were 300 women out in the audience watching us.''
 &HT;    Fortunately, he adds with a laugh, they weren't equipped with
cameras.
 &HT;    ``Thank God they didn't have them,'' he says. ``I would faint if
I saw those pictures on the Internet.''
 &HT;    The international success of ``The Full Monty'' made him at
least a modest-scale movie star, a development which he never
expected.
 &HT;    ``It stuns me,'' he admits. ``If I would have predicted that
one, I probably would also be giving you lottery numbers today.''
 &HT;    He insists that celebrity hasn't affected his life, which is
focused on his wife Anna, a makeup artist.
 &HT;    ``We don't have an entourage,'' he says. ``I don't live that
way. My wife doesn't want a fur coat, and we already have a house.
So our lives haven't changed on that level.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, the one thing you are never prepared for as an
actor is a precious little thing called choice,'' Carlyle adds.
``That's the biggest thing in my life _ I never believed that there
would come a day when I could choose what work I wanted to do. It's
amazing. But it's also a pressure _ once you have choice, you don't
want to lose it.''
 &HT;    Part of his reason for choosing to be a Bond baddie was to offer
an homage to his personal hero.
 &HT;    ``I used to go see the James Bond films with my father in the
early '60s and '70s, when Sean Connery was playing Bond,'' he
recalls. ``To me, he was the only Scottish actor. He was the only
one who worked, and he sounded like me. So that link between
Connery and Bond and acting and Scots was fundamental for me.''
 &HT;    Last year he finally met Connery in person.
 &HT;    ``He is my hero,'' Carlyle says, ``so I didn't say much. I could
just stammer out how much I appreciated his work and he said,
`That's nice, son.' Those three words were enough inspiration for
me.''

 Includes a color slide of Steven Hill, Angie Harmon and Sam
Waterston in a scene from ``Law &AMP; Order.'' 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Robert Altman's movie ``The Player'' (1992), Peter Gallagher
plays a movie-studio executive who suggests eliminating writers
from the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he argues, it's easy to come up with stories _ simply
pick any article out of a newspaper. He demonstrates by reading a
random headline: ``Further Bond Losses Push Dow Down 7.15
Percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Connery as Bond,'' a sycophantic sidekick chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   It was satire then, but one of the most successful shows on
television has turned the idea of ``ripped from the headlines''
plots into a weekly triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order'' has enjoyed nine seasons of escalating success
on the strength of real crime stories transformed into compelling,
compact and morally complex dramas. Recently renewed for its 10th
season, the series will celebrate its 200th episode in May and
shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   What's its secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``More narrative in 45 minutes than most people get from four or
five feature films,'' says Sam Waterston, who is in his fifth
season as Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories don't condescend to the audience,'' the actor
adds, ``and you get a new perspective on stuff that's in the news.
I think it helps people to think about current events.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Orbach is ideally qualified to assess the show's appeal:
In his seventh season as the languid Detective Lennie Briscoe,
Orbach has been prowling the ``Law &AMP; Order'' set longer than any
other principal-cast member except Steven Hill (District Attorney
Adam Schiff). He sees the show in terms of the classical Japanese
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said to me recently, `It's like kabuki,''' Orbach
says. ``It has a very structured form. You know you're going to see
a mystery solved in the first half, then the trial and the
resolution by the end of it. It's a nice, neat package, and I think
people get hooked on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. ``Law &AMP; Order'' is one of the few shows on
television _ ``Seinfeld'' and ``Hill Street Blues'' also come to
mind _ to beat back early threats of cancellation and blossom into
hits. In addition to its Wednesday-night slot on NBC, the show
plays in reruns on A&AMP;E where, despite airing four times a day, it
has actually increased its audience since launching on cable in
fall 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of popularity breeds security in a show's staff, which
may help explain the strong sense of jovial camaraderie on the
Manhattan sound stage where the show is filmed.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent Friday-afternoon shoot, half the principal cast
was laughing like high-school students on the last day of class. S.
Epatha Merkerson and Angie Harmon (Lt. Anita Van Buren and
Assistant District Attorney Abbie Carmichael) were enthusiastically
singing off-key Neil Sedaka tunes for Waterston and the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, as soon as the director called ``Action,'' the
trio would slide into a dour grilling of a murder suspect in the
show's familiar, drab-green interrogation room. Never mind that,
week after week, the three _ along with Orbach, Hill and Benjamin
Bratt (Detective Ray Curtis) _ adopt a bewildered melancholy for
their roles. Despite it all, the cast and crew call themselves
``the family,'' a label that says everything about the cheery
nature of their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see each other there's smiles, there's hugs, there's
kisses,'' Merkerson says. ``They genuinely love me and I genuinely
love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, in her first season on the show, has particular praise
for the veteran Waterston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brilliant,'' she says. ``I'm a perfectionist, and he's
taught me so much. I usually learn something from Sam at least once
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, one of the show's strengths has been the
parity among its cast _ no one actor has stood above the other
members of the ensemble or pulled focus away from the show itself.
Heavyweight actors such as Michael Moriarty and Paul Sorvino have
come and gone, along with six other principals, but ``Law &AMP; Order''
keeps on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this ensemble quality has made the show a tough sell.
Without a single marquee star like, say, Jennifer Aniston from
``Friends,'' viewers take longer to warm to a series. It has thus
been an unintentional, though hardly unwelcome, experience for
``Law &AMP; Order'' to find itself benefiting from the tabloid hoopla
over Bratt's relationship with Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love Ben,'' Merkerson says, sounding like an approving
older sister. ``The attention tickles me, because he really is a
great guy, so whatever press he gets, as long as it's positive, I
think it's great for the show and it's great for him. He's one of
the good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break in filming, Orbach agrees. But he also has a
partial explanation for Bratt's appeal, offered in a conspiratorial
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ben first came on the show,'' he says, ``I said, `Get him
to take his shirt off once. Let's see him in his strapped T-shirt
once, so the ladies will know what's under the suit. I want them to
see that this guy is like Schwarzenegger!'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on location in Brooklyn, Bratt hears about this and
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that hysterical,'' he says, almost embarrassed. ``On
most levels the attention is a bother, mostly because my personal
life truly is no one else's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I understand the curiosity it holds for people,'' he
admits, ``because I, like most other people from time to time,
enjoy my little bits of gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just when it's focused on me, it's a bit more
irritating,'' he finishes with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That attention is at its most immediate when ``Law &AMP; Order''
goes on location, which it does for roughly four of each episode's
eight shooting days. Though the Texas-born Harmon could do without
the subfreezing winter shoots, she adds that she loves the
opportunity to get onto the streets where the shows are actually
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than us working on the court steps,''
she says, ``and the real assistant DAs and the real cops walk by
and say, `Way to go, Harmon!'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone even notices them, though. After all, this is New
York, where people tend to be blase about even such things as
television shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry and Ben had a scene once where they were shooting
outside, and they thought they had closed off the block,''
Merkerson recalls. ``But somebody got through. The guy whisked
between them as they were doing the scene. They just looked at each
other and continued on with the scene, and that was the take that
was used.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth season that Bratt and Orbach have been paired
onscreen, but no one knows how long the team will continue. Bratt
has talked about leaving for other projects _ he and his brother
Peter produced ``Follow Me Home,'' an award-winning film that
played at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago _ and the show
changes principal actors on a fairly regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast changes have kept it interesting for the audience,''
Orbach says. ``People get fired, they move, they have a baby or
they get transferred, you know? It's kind of like life.''

 &HT;    Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn can't help being funny together.
 &HT;    Case study: Hawn has just finished chatting with a group of
journalists at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, and Martin is on
deck. They're there to promote their second film together, ``The
Out-of-Towners,'' a remake of the 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis
comedy.
 &HT;    As Hawn rises to leave and Martin appears in the doorway, a
journalist asks Hawn who designed her outfit.
 &HT;    The actress scrunches her face.
 &HT;    ``I don't know,'' she says.
 &HT;    Martin is happy to help out, loping forward to tug on the collar
of Hawn's sweater and examine its label.
 &HT;    ``It's a Marnie,'' he says.
 &HT;    And the skirt? Martin, clearly enjoying himself, heads south to
inspect another label.
 &HT;    ``Your pantyhose are by ... '' he says jokingly, then reads the
skirt label aloud: ``Handmade, hand wash in cold ... ''
 &HT;    Everyone laughs, Hawn included, and then the actress heads out
and leaves the stage to Martin, a funnyman who these days is funny
only when he wants to be.
 &HT;    ``The Out-of-Towners'' is one of those times. Opening nationwide
on April 2, it casts Martin and Hawn _ who first teamed for
``Housesitter'' (1992) _ as a long-married Ohio couple confronting
empty-nest syndrome. Their answer is a trip to New York in quest of
a restored spark to their marriage, but the journey quickly
deteriorates into a barrage of muggings, arrests, drug-induced
strange behavior and frustrating encounters with a haughty hotel
manager (John Cleese).
 &HT;    The idea for the remake came from Paramount Pictures chief
Sherry Lansing, recalls Martin, who says he loved the original
film.
 &HT;    ``Sherry Lansing had the idea, and I felt that the
antidisestablishmentarianism of the situation ... '' he stops as
reporters' pens clatter in dismay, then laughs.
 &HT;    ``No, it was Sherry's idea,'' he says more conventionally. ``It
sounded good. Then I got a little cold feet, but Goldie convinced
me. She said, `I think this movie is really about something
important. I think it's about what happens when the kids are grown
_ how does a couple that's been busy for 19 years get back together
and what are they going to do?'
 &HT;    ``I thought that was a good topic,'' he says, ``and the script
started developing in that specific direction.''
 &HT;    On the set, the actor reports, he and Hawn _ both veteran
comedians whose work has turned more serious of late _ relished the
give-and-take of an out-and-out comedy.
 &HT;    ``We make each other laugh,'' he says. ``That gives you a lot of
encouragement. A lot of things were boldly ad-libbed, and they
worked.
 &HT;    ``We both came up in television,'' Martin adds, ``and there's a
great quickness and expediency about television. We're both
expedient, and we both know that to worry something to death kills
it. So we'd say, `Let's just try it. Let's just do it.'''
 &HT;    There was a time when Martin made a movie or two every year.
These days he turns up onscreen less often, and when he does it's
less likely to be in a zany, highly commercial comedy than in a
smaller drama such as ``The Spanish Prisoner'' (1998) or something
he himself wrote, such as the upcoming ``Bowfinger.''
 &HT;    ``I was talking with a friend the other day,'' he says, ``and we
said that the problem today is that the only success is a total
success. We don't take pride in artistic success or a medium
success _ Hollywood only views success as total success.''
 &HT;    Besides, he's becoming more and more active offscreen,
particularly as a writer. A turning point was ``Picasso at the
Lapin Agile'' (1995), the highly acclaimed stage play that explored
the creative and scientific processes.
 &HT;    ``In a weird way I think the writing has helped my acting,'' he
says. ``When you do the same thing over and over you get better,
but you also get disconnected from it. Writing is very direct _
it's you and the paper, and it's coming out of your heart.
 &HT;    ``When I wrote the play I thought, `Why can't I write a
screenplay in the same spirit as I wrote the play?''' he recalls.
``I didn't care about anything, and I didn't think anybody was even
going to see `Picasso.'
 &HT;    ``So I gave it a shot with `Bowfinger.'''
 &HT;    Directed by Frank Oz _ who put Martin through his paces in
``Little Shop of Horrors'' (1986), ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels''
(1988) and ``Housesitter'' _ ``Bowfinger'' stars Martin and Eddie
Murphy, and will reach theaters this summer.
 &HT;    ``It's about a loser movie producer who tries to get a movie
made with a big star who refuses to do it,'' says Martin, who plays
the producer to Murphy's actor. ``We decide to make the movie
anyway, with him in it, but without telling him.
 &HT;    ``Eddie is so talented it makes me sick.''
 &HT;    Being a screenwriter _ which he has been since ``Roxanne''
(1987) _ is only one of Martin's accomplishments. In a career which
has had more than its share of ups and downs, he's passed through
myriad incarnations as a magician, a stand-up comedian, a comedy
writer for hire, a frequent guest host of ``Saturday Night Live,''
a stage and screen actor, a playwright and a short-story author, to
name only the high points.
 &HT;    But it was his years as a stand-up comic which set the stage for
everything else. Martin regularly sold out 20,000-seat arenas in
his heyday as the ``wild and crazy guy'' who kept a fish in his
pocket and walked about the stage with an arrow through his head.
 &HT;    The wild and crazy guy made Martin famous, the first stand-up
comic to achieve rock-star levels of success. But eventually he
abandoned the fish, the arrow and the stand-up routine altogether.
And while there are certain aspects of that persona in the goofy
physical comedy of ``The Out-of-Towners,'' he says he's never
really looked back.
 &HT;    ``I don't miss it,'' he says. ``Ever. It's a very hard thing to
do. It's hard because you stake everything on every show, and they
can't all be great.
 &HT;    ``So many things can be wrong,'' he adds. ``The audience or you
or the microphone. Those great shows stand out, which means the
rest of them were not that good.''
 &HT;    At 53, with little concern about box-office numbers or star
perks and with the confidence of an actor who can afford to age _
since his livelihood was never predicated on movie-star looks or
sex appeal _ Martin can pretty much do what he wants when he wants.
 &HT;    It's an enviable position, and one that is rare in Hollywood,
especially for women.
 &HT;    ``It's much harder for women, even young actresses,'' he says.
``If you're known at 22 for being a sexy girl, then at 28 there's
the next sexy girl, unless you've established something.
 &HT;    ``That's the accomplishment of Goldie and Diane Keaton, but
especially Goldie,'' he says. ``She was the young, sexy girl, but
she transcended it through, I think, being the kind of person she
is. Goldie's talented _ really smart, astute and direct.''
 &HT;    As for himself, Martin says he's perfectly at ease with growing
older. The shock of white hair that made him look older when he was
in his late 20s now lets him merely look his age.
 &HT;    He also feels more comfortable with himself, personally and
professionally, he adds.
 &HT;    ``It's better,'' he says, hunting for words. ``Through time,
people respect you. People are not just using you. They're
awestruck sometimes.''
 &HT;    And then he smiles.
 &HT;    ``They're more polite than in the old days, when people would
come up to me and say `Be funny!'''

 Includes a color slide of Ben Affleck with Sandra Bullock in a
scene from ``Forces of Nature.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He isn't even 27 yet, and Ben Affleck has already won an Academy
Award, become an international celebrity and had a much-publicized
romance with one of Hollywood's hottest actresses.
 &HT;    You can call him an overnight success if you like _ Affleck
won't mind.
 &HT;    ``You get lucky,'' he says. ``You just have to hang onto the
hope that it's going to work out for you at some point. If you
actually considered the odds of becoming successful in Hollywood,
it would become too depressing and demoralizing. You have to
understand it has as much to do with good fortune as it does with
talent and hard work.''
 &HT;    Well, talent doesn't hurt. Affleck was a triple threat in 1997,
when he proved himself as a leading man in Kevin Smith's quirky
independent film ``Chasing Amy,'' then shone as a supporting actor
in the box-office smash ``Good Will Hunting.''
 &HT;    And, oh yes, he and ``Good Will'' co-star Matt Damon also took
home an Oscar for best original screenplay.
 &HT;    The next year wasn't bad, either _ 1998 brought a featured role
in the blockbuster ``Armageddon'' and another eye-catching
supporting turn, this time in the Oscar-nominated ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' It was a part he'd accepted primarily to be close to his
girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, the lovely _ and also Oscar-nominated _
star of the Elizabethan-era romance.
 &HT;    Those two years are a tough act to follow, but Affleck will do
his best, starting with ``Forces of Nature,'' a romantic comedy
co-starring Sandra Bullock and opening nationwide on March 19.
 &HT;    Affleck, who was typecast as a tough guy in early roles in films
such as ``Dazed and Confused'' (1993) and ``Mall Rats'' (1996), is
looking forward to his role as a conservative, buttoned-down New
Yorker who, on his way to his wedding in Georgia, encounters a
series of delays and an eccentric, free-spirited young woman
(Bullock) who makes him rethink his life.
 &HT;    ``I'm actually a very firm and devout believer in happily ever
after,'' the actor says. ``I think that's the noblest of all human
endeavors. When you get to the everyday challenge of sharing your
life with somebody, I think the whole is greater than the sum of
the parts.
 &HT;    ``It takes compromise and sacrifice,'' he adds. ``But the ideal
world is where you wake up with the same person every day and feel
lucky to be there, because you support one another.''
 &HT;    Any hopes he had of achieving that goal with Paltrow apparently
were dashed when the couple's much-publicized romance ended
abruptly earlier this year. At least it seemed to end _ but Affleck
and Paltrow were sitting together at the Golden Globe Awards in
January, and he later made a surprise appearance when she
guest-hosted ``Saturday Night Live.''
 &HT;    Affleck won't shed any light on his current status with Paltrow,
but he doesn't mind talking about their ``Saturday Night Live''
duet.
 &HT;    ``So much scurrilous stuff had been written about us that I
thought it would a way to poke fun at the whole aspect of people
caught in the bind of having to lead public lives while trying to
hide their private lives,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``It's like everybody was chasing us, to the point where we felt
like a pair of bizarre little hamsters running on a wheel,'' the
actor says. ``How would you like it if your romances got reported
in the media? I put hexes on those writers. I send them a little
voodoo curse.''
 &HT;    The reality, he admits, is that there's little he can do about
the media's fascination with his love life.
 &HT;    ``It's hard to have a sense of humor, but you have to accept it
and roll your eyes,'' he says. ``You can't win except by being
yourself, and you can't just stay at home alone and worry about it
_ that's no fun.''
 &HT;    Affleck sighs.
 &HT;    ``They had me dating Calista Flockhart,'' he says bemusedly. ``I
think I met her once, at the Golden Globes two years ago. I have no
idea where that came from.
 &HT;    ``Some of the things that are written about me are so bizarre
that I just have to laugh,'' he adds. ``There was a story that I
went and bought every condom in a Wisconsin 7-Eleven. I have never
even been in Wisconsin.
 &HT;    ``But the best part,'' he says with a laugh, ``was that Trojan
sent me a gift basket full of, like, thousands of condoms with a
note that said, `Now you only have to go to 7-Eleven for beer.'''
 &HT;    Anyone wondering about Affleck and Bullock should look
elsewhere. Paltrow was a frequent visitor to the set _ her mother,
Blythe Danner, even has a role in the film _ and, anyway, Affleck
insists that it's far from inevitable that an actor fall in love
with his leading lady.
 &HT;    ``In real life,'' he says, ``you're really looking for another
person that goes beyond the kind of one-line image that the media
has created for them.''
 &HT;    Affleck gives his own image a new twist in ``Force of Nature,''
when he is forced into doing an impromptu striptease in a bar. Yes,
he drops his pants _ it was his shirt that he kept on, actually.
 &HT;    ``There's a reason,'' the actor explains. ``I have tattoos on my
shoulders, and if I had taken my shirt off they would have had to
cover them with makeup, because they wouldn't have fit my
character. That's a laborious process which I went through on
another film, and I'll do anything to avoid it.
 &HT;    ``But I worked hard on my moves when I was stripping,'' he adds
with a grin. ``I was hedging my bets, thinking maybe I could
develop a second career. I'm always ready to pick up another
trade.''
 &HT;    While Affleck is obviously kidding, he doesn't deny that there
were times early in his Hollywood career when he couldn't help
wondering about other lines of work.
 &HT;    ``I remember auditioning for `Beverly Hills 90210' when I really
needed money,'' he says. ``I had never watched the series, and I
kind of did what I thought was a very subtle reading. Even though
it was a romantic part, I didn't want it to be a cliche.
 &HT;    ``The next day the producers called my agent and told them how
terrible I was,'' he recalls. ``They basically said, `Your guy had
so little energy we could hardly hear him. I guarantee you he will
never appear on `Beverly Hills 90210!'
 &HT;    ``And my agent was screaming at me, `Who do you think you are,
Marlon Brando? You were auditioning for a teen series!'''
 &HT;    Chances are that Affleck could get on the show nowadays at the
drop of a hat, given the teen following he's acquired since playing
the guy who got the girl (Liv Tyler) and risked his life to save
the world in ``Armageddon.'' But the actor remains ambivalent about
his image as a hunk.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a mistake to get caught up in how the media is
categorizing you,'' he says. ``It's easy to become a canvas on
which the audience and the media paint their own fantasies. All you
can do as an actor is to try and be your best, without trying to
live up to what you think people want you to be.
 &HT;    ``The upside,'' Affleck adds, ``is that you get a kick out of
being successful, which is a rarity for any actor who's had to
struggle. You get perks and opportunities that you never knew
existed.
 &HT;    ``The downside is that you not only give up your privacy, you're
known for who people think you are from what they see up there on
the big screen. And that means they don't really know you at all.''

SCOT FREE: ROBERT CARLYLE HAS GONE HOLLYWOOD, AND HE'S HAVING A
BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Robert Carlyle in a scene from
``Ravenous.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    No wonder so many people want to kill James Bond.
 &HT;    Take Robert Carlyle, the Scottish actor who will play the
villain in the latest Bond installment, ``The World is Not
Enough.''
 &HT;    As Bond, Pierce Brosnan drives a cool Aston-Martin car with all
the latest accessories, including the newest ``Bond girl,'' Denise
Richards. Between stunts, he finds time to down yet another martini
_ shaken, naturally, but not stirred.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Carlyle's character is actually dying even before the
film starts. With a bullet lodged in his brain, he's utterly
ruthless because he has literally nothing to lose.
 &HT;    ``Look, I don't really want to dominate James' world. I just
want to blow it up,'' Carlyle says with a maniacal laugh. ``I'm a
total destructo!''
 &HT;    If the star of the down-and-dirty British films
``Trainspotting'' (1996) and ``The Full Monty'' (1997) seems out of
place in the jet-set world of James Bond, he's equally incongruous
in Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, where he's visiting briefly to
meet the press for his new film, ``Ravenous.''
 &HT;    The 38-year-old actor walks in still yawning and rubbing his
head _ which is almost completely bald for his Bond duties. Still,
he looks fit and handsome in jeans and a black Hugo Boss suit
jacket.
 &HT;    It's shortly after breakfast _ which is just as well, because
``Ravenous,'' which co-stars Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy
Davies and David Arquette, deals with the not-exactly-appetizing
subject of cannibalism.
 &HT;    Set in 1847 America, it concerns a group of settlers who, on
their way west, are forced to take shelter in an isolated cave. One
thing leads to another, and ... well, let's just say that Carlyle's
character develops a whole new culinary philosophy.
 &HT;    Even after ``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' this is
material which is, to put it mildly, noncommercial.
 &HT;    ``I don't consider the life consequences, career consequences or
other people's sensibilities when I choose a role,'' Carlyle says
calmly. ``I don't think it's my job to worry about these matters.
Some actors do, of course, but I don't want to build a whole career
on how I think people will perceive my every move.''
 &HT;    Which is good, because ``Ravenous'' is sure to be controversial.
Even the cast was caught up in debate, the actor recalls, with
daily discussions on and off the set about cannibalism and the
inescapable question, ``Would you if you had to?''
 &HT;    ``The subject is infinitely fascinating,'' Carlyle says. ``I
think, without a doubt, I'd do it. What I believe in is the
survival instinct, which is the most powerful emotion we have _
you're always going to try to keep your nose above the water.''
 &HT;    His next three films, all due this year, are on more
conventional themes. They include ``Plunkett and MacLeane,'' a
period film about two highwaymen, with Liv Tyler co-starring. Then
comes ``The World Is Not Enough,'' followed by the big-screen
adaptation of Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir, ``Angela's
Ashes,'' directed by Alan Parker and co-starring Oscar nominee
Emily Watson.
 &HT;    Carlyle has only recently completed filming ``Angela's Ashes''
on location in Dublin, which movie magic turned into the grim
Limerick of McCourt's youth.
 &HT;    ``Every single morning, I had dirt applied all over my body,''
the actor recalls, grimacing. ``It was disgusting. We actually had
a pot on the set called `Standard Grime.' They would take out this
bucket and slop it all over you. It really messed up your skin.''
 &HT;    It was an anything-but-glamorous development in a career that
has already offered a fair number of unexpected twists for the
Glasgow-born son of two house painters, who originally planned to
follow in their footsteps.
 &HT;    ``I was 24 years old and working as a house painter,'' he
recalls. ``But then a friend of mine gave me a copy of `The
Crucible.' When I read this great work, I thought, `How fantastic
to be able to talk to the world about important issues!'
 &HT;    ``It seemed like a beautiful way to make a living.''
 &HT;    Talking to the world was one thing, but doing it in a Scottish
accent was another. Even in drama school he had to fight against
pressure to homogenize his speech.
 &HT;    ``Early on,'' he recalls, ``a professor said to me, `You'll
never work because you refuse to change your accent.'''
 &HT;    Actually, however, Carlyle has worked steadily, usually as
morally challenged characters in grittily realistic British films
and television shows.
 &HT;    After reaching more or less the extreme as ``Trainspotting's''
repellent thug Begbie, a guy who delighted in ``glassing'' _
shoving people's faces through glass windows or doors _ Carlyle was
looking for a more human, sympathetic role. He found it in ``The
Full Monty'' as Gaz, an unemployed, divorced father who finally
resorts to joining his similarly downsized mates in staging a strip
show.
 &HT;    ``To me that film is still about gender politics,'' he says.
``It's about men suddenly having to look at themselves in the way
that men have been looking at women for years.''
 &HT;    And about women looking at them, which is a lingering sensitive
point. The final scene of the film involves an audience of hundreds
of women whooping and cheering the blue-collar strippers. Audiences
for the film saw it only from behind, but the women on the set
actually saw ... well, the fuller Monty.
 &HT;    ``Filming that strip scene was the most terrifying thing in my
whole life,'' Carlyle says, looking like he might blush even now.
``I would never do it again, no matter how much money was involved.
 &HT;    ``We didn't have on that little sock that most men use in nude
scene,'' he says, stammering. ``Consequently I felt so exposed.
Plus there were 300 women out in the audience watching us.''
 &HT;    Fortunately, he adds with a laugh, they weren't equipped with
cameras.
 &HT;    ``Thank God they didn't have them,'' he says. ``I would faint if
I saw those pictures on the Internet.''
 &HT;    The international success of ``The Full Monty'' made him at
least a modest-scale movie star, a development which he never
expected.
 &HT;    ``It stuns me,'' he admits. ``If I would have predicted that
one, I probably would also be giving you lottery numbers today.''
 &HT;    He insists that celebrity hasn't affected his life, which is
focused on his wife Anna, a makeup artist.
 &HT;    ``We don't have an entourage,'' he says. ``I don't live that
way. My wife doesn't want a fur coat, and we already have a house.
So our lives haven't changed on that level.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, the one thing you are never prepared for as an
actor is a precious little thing called choice,'' Carlyle adds.
``That's the biggest thing in my life _ I never believed that there
would come a day when I could choose what work I wanted to do. It's
amazing. But it's also a pressure _ once you have choice, you don't
want to lose it.''
 &HT;    Part of his reason for choosing to be a Bond baddie was to offer
an homage to his personal hero.
 &HT;    ``I used to go see the James Bond films with my father in the
early '60s and '70s, when Sean Connery was playing Bond,'' he
recalls. ``To me, he was the only Scottish actor. He was the only
one who worked, and he sounded like me. So that link between
Connery and Bond and acting and Scots was fundamental for me.''
 &HT;    Last year he finally met Connery in person.
 &HT;    ``He is my hero,'' Carlyle says, ``so I didn't say much. I could
just stammer out how much I appreciated his work and he said,
`That's nice, son.' Those three words were enough inspiration for
me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In Robert Altman's movie ``The Player'' (1992), Peter Gallagher
plays a movie-studio executive who suggests eliminating writers
from the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he argues, it's easy to come up with stories _ simply
pick any article out of a newspaper. He demonstrates by reading a
random headline: ``Further Bond Losses Push Dow Down 7.15
Percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Connery as Bond,'' a sycophantic sidekick chimes in.
</P>
<P>
   It was satire then, but one of the most successful shows on
television has turned the idea of ``ripped from the headlines''
plots into a weekly triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order'' has enjoyed nine seasons of escalating success
on the strength of real crime stories transformed into compelling,
compact and morally complex dramas. Recently renewed for its 10th
season, the series will celebrate its 200th episode in May and
shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   What's its secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``More narrative in 45 minutes than most people get from four or
five feature films,'' says Sam Waterston, who is in his fifth
season as Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories don't condescend to the audience,'' the actor
adds, ``and you get a new perspective on stuff that's in the news.
I think it helps people to think about current events.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Orbach is ideally qualified to assess the show's appeal:
In his seventh season as the languid Detective Lennie Briscoe,
Orbach has been prowling the ``Law &AMP; Order'' set longer than any
other principal-cast member except Steven Hill (District Attorney
Adam Schiff). He sees the show in terms of the classical Japanese
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said to me recently, `It's like kabuki,''' Orbach
says. ``It has a very structured form. You know you're going to see
a mystery solved in the first half, then the trial and the
resolution by the end of it. It's a nice, neat package, and I think
people get hooked on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. ``Law &AMP; Order'' is one of the few shows on
television _ ``Seinfeld'' and ``Hill Street Blues'' also come to
mind _ to beat back early threats of cancellation and blossom into
hits. In addition to its Wednesday-night slot on NBC, the show
plays in reruns on A&AMP;E where, despite airing four times a day, it
has actually increased its audience since launching on cable in
fall 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of popularity breeds security in a show's staff, which
may help explain the strong sense of jovial camaraderie on the
Manhattan sound stage where the show is filmed.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent Friday-afternoon shoot, half the principal cast
was laughing like high-school students on the last day of class. S.
Epatha Merkerson and Angie Harmon (Lt. Anita Van Buren and
Assistant District Attorney Abbie Carmichael) were enthusiastically
singing off-key Neil Sedaka tunes for Waterston and the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, as soon as the director called ``Action,'' the
trio would slide into a dour grilling of a murder suspect in the
show's familiar, drab-green interrogation room. Never mind that,
week after week, the three _ along with Orbach, Hill and Benjamin
Bratt (Detective Ray Curtis) _ adopt a bewildered melancholy for
their roles. Despite it all, the cast and crew call themselves
``the family,'' a label that says everything about the cheery
nature of their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see each other there's smiles, there's hugs, there's
kisses,'' Merkerson says. ``They genuinely love me and I genuinely
love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, in her first season on the show, has particular praise
for the veteran Waterston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brilliant,'' she says. ``I'm a perfectionist, and he's
taught me so much. I usually learn something from Sam at least once
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, one of the show's strengths has been the
parity among its cast _ no one actor has stood above the other
members of the ensemble or pulled focus away from the show itself.
Heavyweight actors such as Michael Moriarty and Paul Sorvino have
come and gone, along with six other principals, but ``Law &AMP; Order''
keeps on keeping on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this ensemble quality has made the show a tough sell.
Without a single marquee star like, say, Jennifer Aniston from
``Friends,'' viewers take longer to warm to a series. It has thus
been an unintentional, though hardly unwelcome, experience for
``Law &AMP; Order'' to find itself benefiting from the tabloid hoopla
over Bratt's relationship with Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love Ben,'' Merkerson says, sounding like an approving
older sister. ``The attention tickles me, because he really is a
great guy, so whatever press he gets, as long as it's positive, I
think it's great for the show and it's great for him. He's one of
the good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break in filming, Orbach agrees. But he also has a
partial explanation for Bratt's appeal, offered in a conspiratorial
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ben first came on the show,'' he says, ``I said, `Get him
to take his shirt off once. Let's see him in his strapped T-shirt
once, so the ladies will know what's under the suit. I want them to
see that this guy is like Schwarzenegger!'''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on location in Brooklyn, Bratt hears about this and
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that hysterical,'' he says, almost embarrassed. ``On
most levels the attention is a bother, mostly because my personal
life truly is no one else's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I understand the curiosity it holds for people,'' he
admits, ``because I, like most other people from time to time,
enjoy my little bits of gossip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just when it's focused on me, it's a bit more
irritating,'' he finishes with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That attention is at its most immediate when ``Law &AMP; Order''
goes on location, which it does for roughly four of each episode's
eight shooting days. Though the Texas-born Harmon could do without
the subfreezing winter shoots, she adds that she loves the
opportunity to get onto the streets where the shows are actually
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better than us working on the court steps,''
she says, ``and the real assistant DAs and the real cops walk by
and say, `Way to go, Harmon!'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone even notices them, though. After all, this is New
York, where people tend to be blase about even such things as
television shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry and Ben had a scene once where they were shooting
outside, and they thought they had closed off the block,''
Merkerson recalls. ``But somebody got through. The guy whisked
between them as they were doing the scene. They just looked at each
other and continued on with the scene, and that was the take that
was used.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth season that Bratt and Orbach have been paired
onscreen, but no one knows how long the team will continue. Bratt
has talked about leaving for other projects _ he and his brother
Peter produced ``Follow Me Home,'' an award-winning film that
played at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago _ and the show
changes principal actors on a fairly regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast changes have kept it interesting for the audience,''
Orbach says. ``People get fired, they move, they have a baby or
they get transferred, you know? It's kind of like life.''

 &HT;    Connerly: Race has no place in government
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ward Connerly has been called everything from a
traitor to his race to a courageous champion of fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, a Sacramento, Calif., businessman, is the architect of
affirmative action bans in California and Washington state. As
chairman of the American Civil Rights Coalition, he is on a mission
to add more states to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly traces his interest in ending affirmative action to
1994, a year after he was appointed to the University of California
System's Board of Regents. Two constituents, Jerry and Helen Cook,
convinced him that their son, James, had been denied admission to
the University of California-San Diego medical school because he
was white. Connerly said he found that the school was giving too
much weight to race in an effort to make the school racially
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   With support from then-Gov. Pete Wilson, Connerly persuaded the
regents in 1995 to end racial considerations in admissions and then
pursued a ballot proposition. In November 1996, the state's voters
endorsed his efforts and ended affirmative action programs. Two
years later, Washington voters followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who gives his age as ``59 going on 80,'' was in Austin
last week to support the Campaign for a Colorblind America, which
is backing legislation to end racial and gender considerations in
Texas, including in state hiring and contracting. Affirmative
action is no longer used in Texas colleges because of a federal
appeals court ruling in what is known as the Hopwood case.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly spoke with American-Statesman reporter Mary Ann Roser.
An edited text of his remarks follows:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe we have attained a colorblind society?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't care whether we have a colorblind society; I want my
government to be colorblind.
</P>
<P>
   When you see the blindfolded woman holding the scales of
justice, it's saying, ``Government is colorblind.'' I don't think
we will ever become a colorblind society by practicing race
consciousness. It just imbeds race more into our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But as you know, affirmative action was started to remedy a
history of discrimination against blacks. They went through slavery
and haven't been in the middle class that long.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't live in the past. I live right now. I see all of the
success stories of black people and the accomplishments many have
made, mostly on their own. And I see a society that is for the most
part improving. More is to be gained building on the positive
rather than building on a negative paradigm. That negative paradigm
is saying to blacks, ``You can't do it on your own without help
from the white people.''
</P>
<P>
   That fosters the very prejudice people start off with _ that
blacks aren't smart. We then take that prejudice and perpetuate it.
. . . We're better off sometimes to give people tough love. I'm
finding that Asians and Latinos are assimilating into American
life, and blacks are the last to do it. . . . I blame it on black
families.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are you interested in what happens in other states, and
what is your ultimate goal?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the Congress or the Supreme Court would act, my interest
would cease to exist. But the Congress will not act on this issue .
. . because the Jesse Jacksons of the world and the NAACP will
protest and call people racists. Despite what the president said
about wanting to have a dialogue on race, when the rubber hits the
road, these organizations that want to defend race-based
affirmative action don't want to have a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm trying to do is keep the ball rolling until the Supreme
Court says whether Bakke is the law of the land. (The 1978 Supreme
Court's Bakke decision said race could be among an array of factors
considered in university admissions but not the sole factor.)
Saying race should be among the factors is like saying you're a
little bit pregnant. . . . There's no such thing as race being one
of many factors. They're taking this as a loophole and driving Mack
trucks through it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the extent of your campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would like to get two or three more critical states to
embrace initiatives like Proposition 209 in California and
Initiative 200 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Texas one of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, Texas doesn't have the initiative process. I'm looking at
Nebraska, Oregon, Colorado, Michigan and Florida . . . iven the
situation in California and Texas, if we're able to get Florida, we
would have a large segment of society living under a race-free
system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wasn't very welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   A: He met with me, but he doesn't want to pursue an initiative,
and I understand why. He's put together a coalition based on race.
When you put together a rainbow coalition, you don't want someone
like Ward Connerly coming in and upsetting the apple cart. He was
concerned about how black legislators would react. . . . One black
legislator said, quote, he should take his little butt back to
California and leave it there, unquote. It was the same thing they
said about civil rights workers in Selma. As a national taxpayer, I
think I have a legitimate right to participate in the deliberations
of that state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many people believe blacks and Latinos score below whites and
Asians on achievement tests because they are not getting an
adequate education in K through 12. Should they be excluded from
the best universities when they can graduate and succeed there?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one's excluding anyone. We're saying these are the rules
of the game. We're not basing decisions on racial or ethnic
characteristics. There are middle-class blacks who are going to
suburban schools and getting preferences to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you using test scores as the standard of who should get
into an elite school?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not saying test scores are the sole measures, but GPA and
SAT scores are reliable, and I don't think there's any cultural
bias. Whatever standard you use, apply it equally. I do not accept
that some schools are inferior to others, and therefore, we should
only give black people, Latinos and Native Americans some kind of
break across the board. There are Asians and low-income whites
going there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think there is no discrimination against minority
groups?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's discrimination against fat people, and there's
discrimination against gays, too, and none of it's justified. The
solution to ending discrimination is eradicating the prejudice. The
prejudice is that blacks cannot succeed without a preference.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do about teachers who have lower expectations of
minority students, and those students, in turn, get lower test
scores and grades?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm told the same thing about poor white trash. The problem
to me is not one that has a racial genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever benefited from affirmative action?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think I may have been appointed to the Board of Regents
because the governor was trying to diversify the board. But I must
remind you, regents serve 12-year sentences, unpaid, and if that's
a benefit, God help me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's prestigious.
</P>
<P>
   A: It might be prestigious, but if someone walks up to you in
the airport and threatens you, you can stick that prestige in your
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you feel compelled to be in this fight?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've always believed in integration and taking people at
their merits. I'm in an interracial marriage. My wife is Irish. In
this nation, checking these boxes (on census forms, etc.) is
something I abhor. I believe the day has to come when the American
people will say to their government: ``Stop it. We don't want you
classifying us by race.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You don't like to be called an African American. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't born in Africa, I haven't been there, and I'm not
going there. I think someone who was born in Africa and becomes an
American citizen is an African American. I'm an American citizen
and am partly of African descent, about an eighth or so. I have
more Irish blood and more Native American blood. Why should I
follow the one rule that says one drop of black blood makes you
black? African American is a social term. It is a politically
correct term. I simply refuse to use that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel uncomfortable in your skin?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all. If I could choose to have a color, it would be
this. I know you mean no harm, but I really resent that if I take
the position that affirmative action is wrong, I am somehow engaged
in self-loathing, as some of my detractors say. We should be able
to take political positions without someone ascribing psychological
conditions to us. I'm very comfortable in my skin color, but I
don't believe we should have these categories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel lonely when you're confronted by other blacks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lonely, yes, because they are American citizens and they
don't understand what I'm about.
</P>
<P>
   I was on the ``Chris Rock Show,'' and he asked me, ``Why are you
doing this?'' I told him, and he said: ``You're probably right.
It's just hard for black people to come to terms with it.'' I'm not
doing this to take anything away from black people or Latinos. I'm
doing this because I want black people to become self-reliant and
not stand on the outside looking in. The fruits of American
democracy are there for us to pick off the tree. The day is come
for us to do that.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: David vs. Goliath in indoor soccer
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I've spent many weekends sitting on cold metal
bleachers at soccer games with icy, gale-force winds blowing in my
face, bemoaning that none of my sons chose to play basketball or
swim _ you know, cozy indoor sports.
</P>
<P>
   So you'd think I'd be thrilled when our youngest son had the
chance to play indoor soccer this winter. It's a wonderful
opportunity between the fall and spring seasons to put another
10,000 miles on our SUV _ soccer utility vehicle _ traveling to
Dallas for all the games.
</P>
<P>
   We passed on the opportunity. We did agree, though, that our son
could be a substitute player if needed. He was needed.
</P>
<P>
   With the team seriously depleted by spring break trips, our son
got called in for the last weekend of games to determine the season
championship. So there we were, sitting in a nice,
climate-controlled environment with restrooms, a concession stand
and pro shop. I warmed to the sport right away, despite the
constantly blaring rap music.
</P>
<P>
   As best I can tell, indoor soccer is a blend of ``regular''
soccer, ice hockey and roller derby. The artificial-turf field is
encircled by a wall about 4 feet tall, topped with netting that
also covers the ceiling. As in hockey, the pace is fast and
relentless and the boards are a key part of the game _ just ask any
kid who gets bounced off of them.
</P>
<P>
   Our guys handled the first team easily, surging ahead quickly
and staying there. The second game _ which was for the season
championship _ proved more difficult, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious was that at least two of the players on the
opposing team of 11- and 12-year-olds were nearly 6 feet tall,
close to 170 pounds and had facial hair. Now, as the mother of
three sons, I understand how fickle hormones can be during puberty.
They can sneak up on a guy between his morning Pop Tart and his
afternoon Bagel Bites and leave him 6 inches taller with a voice
suddenly hitting octaves known only to Swiss yodelers.
Nevertheless, these boys were huge.
</P>
<P>
   I hurriedly conferred with fellow parents and was assured that
all birth certificates had been carefully checked and that these
were not, as I had first assumed, 17-year-olds who had been held
back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite valiant play by our team, we lost that final game
resoundingly, 6-2. But then, in a complicated system I only
understood later, we suddenly had 3 more minutes on the clock and
the scoreboard was back to 0-0. With that 6-2 victory, the other
team had tied us for first place on points tallied throughout the
season. The championship was to be decided in six minutes of
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The team that scores first wins _ sudden death, and when I saw
that my baby was paired against one of those behemoths, I thought
it might be just that.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic David and Goliath matchup. My son's head came
almost to his opponent's chest _ almost. He was outweighed by
probably 90 pounds. My heart sprang to my throat and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   With about two minutes left in the game, speed and lesser size
came to this David's advantage as he sped past the lumbering giant,
kicked the ball through his towering legs (I'm not sure, but I
think he may have run through the guy's legs, too), picked up the
ricochet off the boards and slingshot it into the corner of the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd _ and our team _ went wild! It was one of those rare
moments you cherish after spending endless hours at soccer games
and practices for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Life doesn't often hand us such nice endings, when the
scoreboard is set back to 0-0 and more time is added to the clock.
But it sure is sweet when it does.

   COMMENTARY: System rage: A hard kick to high tech
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Lane
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Every newspaper's oral lore includes at
least one story about an overwrought reporter throwing a
typewriter. Maybe out a window. Maybe at an editor.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has changed that. Even the most sedentary editors
have time to run before you can heave a monitor at them. Throwing a
computer out a window is hard to do spontaneously. It takes heavy
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop people from trying.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey by a Massachusetts-based computer-network consulting
firm, 83 percent of computer network managers complained that
enraged users smashed their computers.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard was the most-cited victim, according to Concord
Communications' ``Network Rage Survey.'' Nineteen percent of
network managers reported keyboards smashed on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This is understandable. Keyboards are just right to grasp on
either side and crack squarely in half on a desk's edge. Their
cords, however, make them hard to throw. If you have it together
enough to unplug a standard, six-pin DIN connector, you probably
are too self-possessed to throw the thing out a window.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike typewriters, which are heavy enough to break through
glass for maximum dramatic effect. A keyboard rebounds helplessly
off the pane while everyone watches and you feel stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Second place in the survey was a tie with 17 percent of network
managers reporting either shattered monitors and beaten mice.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad that some people will take out their anger on a
helpless little mouse. But it is neat to twirl them menacingly over
your head.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor violence is more understandable. Where blocked writers
used to stare at a blank piece of paper until their eyes lost
focus, they now stare at a Super VGA monitor until their eyes lose
focus. Huge progress.
</P>
<P>
   A monitor bears the additional burden of being the bearer of bad
news. That's where error messages flash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A system error has occurred. Please reload. All your work will
be converted into stray electrons that will evaporate like a summer
rain _ OK?''
</P>
<P>
   There is something devilish about being forced to click buttons
that say ``OK,'' when things are not remotely OK.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of paper is you can fight it. Wad it into tight
balls. Throw it against walls. Set it ablaze in extreme instances.
Monitors have a way of exploding when you try to do those things.
</P>
<P>
   Or so people tell me.
</P>
<P>
   A small but significant minority of those surveyed _ 4 percent _
said their system users kicked computer hard drives hard to death.
</P>
<P>
   This is made possible by vertical CPU cases that stand on the
floor. A person used to be forced to climb on a chair to administer
a good, swift kick to a hard drive. You can destroy amounts of data
undreamed of 10 years ago and without undue exertion. This, too, is
great progress.
</P>
<P>
   The computer managers surveyed also volunteered horror stories
about computer users who became enraged on seeing the message
``push any key'' and not finding a key marked ``any.''
</P>
<P>
   Another told of a user who fumed when her e-mail wouldn't go
through even though she included a zip code.
</P>
<P>
   Another told of a user who when told to ``insert next disk'' did
so _ on top of the other two already stuck in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Will Calmas, a Boston-based workplace psychologist, analyzed the
survey and says this wreckage is an all-too predictable symptom of
worker isolation. Companies will spend millions on new computers,
he observed, but fail to invest in the people who work them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have other outlets for getting out their
frustration,'' he said. Cubicle dwellers don't know where to
complain and are embarrassed to ask questions. They are left angry,
untrained and alone with a frustrating box. The result: People push
the ``reset'' button _ hard, with their wingtips.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests businesses should either pay attention to the
people at the keyboards or develop a keyboard that can bounce off a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rageproof hardware could become all the rage.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The origin of fables
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Payton is 13 and he has a problem. ``I'm
short, Ms. Schuett,'' he complained one day after class. I didn't
tell him I'd already noticed that. ``I'm never going to grow any
more because I smoked some cigarettes when I was 8. It was my
cousin's idea. He's short too.''
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to watch this year's Academy Awards because I'm a
shoo-in to take home the Oscar for Best Straight Face on a Middle
School Teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payton,'' I begin, talking behind my hand so I can grab my
face in case it threatens to stretch into a big grin, ``I'm not
condoning smoking. It's a lousy habit. But I really don't think a
few cigarettes have stunted your growth. If your cousin is short
too, it's probably a genetic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' Payton drawls, as he studies his knuckles like they're
a biology project, ``it's cigarettes. I know it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he serious, I ask myself, or is he scamming me because he's
forgotten his gym clothes and doesn't want to go to third period? I
ask him. He looks shocked so I drop it.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few weeks the Feel Good Department (Guidance
Office) has been stuffing teachers' mailboxes with reams of
touchy-feely stuff designed to make educators more sensitive to the
problems (real and imagined) of our youthful charges.
Thoughtlessly, I filed mine right away in the recycling box,
figuring I'd cut out the middle man. That's the part where I stack
them in the IN box and pretend I'm going to get around to reading
them one day when I don't have 85 essays to grade. I'm thinking
maybe I should have saved some because my next suggestion falls
flat. ``Payton, maybe you should talk to the guidance counselor.''
For good measure I throw in a little psycho-babble. ``How do you
feel about that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``NO WAY,'' is his immediate and emphatic response. When I ask
why, he looks at me as though I'd just fallen off the tail end of
the turnip truck and explains. ``He's tall. How can he know what
it's like being me? I figured you'd understand because you're short
too.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly flattered, but I am committed, so I blurt out
the first thing that comes to mind. ``Mickey Rooney is short.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton stares blankly and asks if he goes to school here. No
point in trying to explain, it's a generation(s) gap thing.
Instead, I tell him a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a sophomore in high school, there was a really cool
junior guy who played varsity basketball. We called him Boo Boo.''
Payton interrupts wanting to know if Boo Boo was tall. ``Real
tall,'' I tell him. ``At least 6 feet.'' Payton moans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September of my junior year, this little pipsqueak shows up
in the halls. It turns out he's Boo Boo's younger brother. So guess
what we nicknamed him?''
</P>
<P>
   Payton cares less so I tell him anyway. ``Poo Poo.'' No
response. ``You know, because he was such a little ... fellow?''
Still nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``About once a week, some wiseguy would stuff Poo Poo in a
locker, slam the door and go to class, leaving Poo Poo to bang on
the door until a teacher came to check out the racket and called
the janitor to let him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boo Boo, being tall and a great basketball player, had more
girls than he could get around to. Poo Poo couldn't even get a date
for the Saturday sock hop. Then a funny thing happened between Poo
Poo's sophomore and junior years. He grew 6 inches over the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton perks up. ``In one summer? Wow! How tall was he then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About five-three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, did he grow another 6 inches the next summer and play
basketball and get girls?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answer artfully, ``but now he's a CPA and has lots of
money and is married to the prettiest girl in his class. I saw them
a couple of years ago at a reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton cocks his head to one side in disbelief and asks: ``Ms.
Schuett, is that true? You swear?'' I ask him if a teacher would
lie. He thanks me and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Now I understand the origin of fables. Aesop must have been a
middle school teacher.

 &HT;    Gender gap still a wage gap into next millennium
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many more girls are heading off to college these days that
women's pay is sure to surge in the 21st century. And that growing
earning power could trigger the biggest changes in family structure
since men left the cave to hunt. Women with fat paychecks may
become the key breadwinners of the next century or even choose to
skip marriage entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions seem reasonable, given demographic trends. In
1950, fewer than one college student in four was female. Today
nearly six college seniors in 10 are women. The U.S. Department of
Education projects that by 2008, women will outnumber men in
college, 9.2 million to 6.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But before we start conjuring up images of Lucy and Ethel
heading off to the office while Ricky and Fred tie on aprons at
home, take a closer look at what is really happening. Professors
will tell you that a huge pay gap is indeed about to open up, but
not in favor of females. Men are the ones on the verge of a big pay
raise, while most women are on track to take lower-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   How can that be? If women are going to college in greater
numbers, today's wage data would suggest they are going to make
lots of money. The U.S. Census Bureau says that in 1997, the latest
year for which statistics are available, the average salary for a
college graduate was $40,478 a year, while high school graduates
earned only $22,895 a year. So if more women than men are going to
college, it would follow that in the next century we can expect to
see women paid better than men.
</P>
<P>
   But that assumption could turn out to be dead wrong. In fact,
the end of the 20th century may well be the high-water mark for
women's wages _ currently 76 percent of what men make _ because the
economy increasingly is rewarding people with high-tech skills, not
broad-based knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In a technology-oriented economy, the people earning hefty
salaries are not the English majors with years of formal education
but rather the Web designers, computer programmers and auto repair
technicians with the know-how to control advanced equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And by a huge margin, the people entering these high-tech jobs
are male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are not going into those areas (that involve) math and
technology,'' said Norma Kent, spokeswoman for American Association
of Community Colleges. She notes that at two-year colleges, 58
percent of the students are female. However, although women
dominate in overall numbers, few are choosing the fields that offer
high pay.
</P>
<P>
   Kent said the problem is not that women don't take tough
courses; many succeed in difficult science classes in nursing and
other medical fields. But women are reluctant to enter the
male-dominated area of information technology. ``I don't believe
they lack the intellect to do the work,'' she said. ``I think it's
just cultural.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, girls are not encouraged to immerse themselves in new
technologies, she said, noting that most children's computer games
involve good guys blowing up bad guys. Boys quickly get the hint
that the computer is designed to amuse, well, guys; girls feel left
out. When boys decide to skip the four-year college experience to
start training with high-tech equipment, they may be making a smart
financial move.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the cost of tuition at the typical two-year
community college is about $1,500 a year. That means an 18-year-old
can spend $3,000 to get trained in computer programming, machining
or air-conditioning repair. At age 20, he might well get a
``signing bonus'' to take a job that pays $30,000 a year. With
overtime pay, men not yet old enough to drink legally can be making
$40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that with the fortunes of a young woman seeking a
four-year degree at a liberal arts college. By the time she is 22,
she may have piled up tens of thousands of dollars in debt, and her
starting pay as an elementary school teacher will average about
$25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even women who gain admission to the nation's Ivy League
colleges may have limited earning power compared with their male
counterparts who skip college to go straight to work in the rapidly
expanding high-tech world. The U.S. Department of Labor projects
that employment in computer and data-processing services will grow
108 percent between 1996 and 2006, making it the nation's fastest
growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although about 65 percent of all 18-year-olds do go on to get
some form of higher education, teachers report that the motto
``learn less, earn more'' is increasingly resonating with boys who
can leap directly into good, computer-related jobs with companies
such as Cisco Systems or Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Young men are often only too glad to pass on the poetry and rush
straight toward the stock options. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is
their role model; he dropped out of college to start a company that
has built his personal wealth to roughly $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all young women go to college to prepare for a
low-paying career. Women are filling up half the classroom seats in
many law and medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   But these traditionally lucrative professions often can't
compare with the rewards of computer-related jobs. A recent report
by Newsweek magazine listed the fastest-growing jobs. The top three
were database manager, computer engineer and systems analyst. The
three positions with the highest pay were chief information
officer, wireless engineer and software development manager.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the courses they are taking today in high school, few
young women will be prepared to enter those high-paying,
fast-growing jobs. In a recent study, the American Association of
University Women found that females made up only 17 percent of the
students taking advanced-placement computer science tests in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   But if women aren't entering the high-tech world, what will
happen in other arenas? If more bright young men skip college to
avoid those tiresome English classes, will they be failing to
prepare themselves for management?
</P>
<P>
   Again, Gates may be the role model. Though the Harvard dropout
is extremely smart about software, his recent court appearances on
videotape in an anti-trust suit suggest he might have benefited
from more English and drama classes. Microsoft's interests might
have been better served by having a more well-rounded chairman to
speak for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next century will produce a strange kind of power
sharing between men and women, with men controlling the technology
and well-educated women taking important positions as lawmakers,
judges, physicians and corporate board members. ``I think more
women will gravitate toward politics,'' Sandy Bernard, president of
the university women's association, predicted.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps men will be so busy making money, they won't much
care who's minding Congress.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Study urges aid for businesses owned by people of
color
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Minority business enterprise, taken as a whole, is no
small business anymore. And the time has come when it needs to
advance beyond the civil rights stage and into the real world of
business.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thrust of a new study commissioned by the Minority
Business Development Agency, a federal government branch that
watches and provides some services to businesses owned and operated
by African-Americans, Latinos and others.
</P>
<P>
   A whole family of policies and programs designed to help
minority business is predicated on the thought these enterprises
need shelter in some cases, or special aid in others, to start,
gain footing and become self-sustaining. The federal interest in
this matter is based on the thought minority-owned businesses are
good for urban communities, create broader opportunities and help
provide employment.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Milken Institute of Santa Monica, Calif., finds
businesses owned and operated by African-American, Hispanic, Asian
and Native American entrepreneurs now amount to some $205 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they are growing at twice the rate of all U.S. firms,
and they seem destined to climb steeply because of growing
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These communities are gaining new importance as both producers
and consumers of products and services,'' said the report. ``In
addition, many minority communities are located in key population
centers such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growth of these businesses, minority businesses have
suffered chronically from insufficient capital, both to operate and
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   This can be remedied, the report said, not by larger government
programs but by reorganizing how the businesses are financed.
</P>
<P>
   The study, titled ``Mainstreaming Minority Business,'' advocates
a pooling of public and private funds for business development
among minorities, and developing secondary markets for the funding
as we do for housing _ thereby generating a larger capital pool.
</P>
<P>
   Another key recommendation is to develop more businesslike ways
to grade applications for lending so the paperwork moves faster and
decisions are better based.
</P>
<P>
   Courtland Cox, director of MBDA, praised the recommendations and
said they raise hopes of better access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas are not new, just novel as envisioned to help
minority enterprises,'' Cox said. He said most of the
recommendations could be implemented with changes in regulations
and should not require major new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank, which is
expanding in Atlanta, said the program ``looks promising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon how they implement the program, it could help
to provide more capital for community development, and that would
really be important,'' said Andrews. ``It could also help community
banks remain strong as an alternative to other banks.''
</P>
<P>
   William Stanley, of Stanley Love Stanley architects in Atlanta,
said the greater access to capital will be welcome but added,
``Just as important as capital is an improvement in procedures that
can speed up paperwork, so that businesses can respond better to
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank, one of the country's largest players in
small-business loans, declined to comment specifically on the
proposals. It said it will follow the changes with interest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mark Williams, an Atlanta spokesman for the company,
said that it invites people to examine the work it is doing here
and elsewhere in financing minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Greater capital flow would be especially helpful, of course, for
construction enterprises and many high-tech businesses that tend to
depend heavily on capital.
</P>
<P>
   Said the report: ``To sustain growth, minority businesses need
greater access to supplies of capital at all critical stages of
business development, including equity and seed capital, mezzanine
debt and senior debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the specific proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop secure Collateralized Loan Obligations from a pool of
minority business loans and establish Special-Purpose Vehicles,
ideally through an existing government agency, to implement a
secondary market for CLOs to fill financing gaps.
</P>
<P>
   _ The SPVs would administer pools of small-business loans
purchased from lending institutions and would promote credit
enhancement through a reserve fund that insures the loan pools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish industrywide efficiencies in the small-business
lending market through development of standardization in credit
scoring, standardized loan documentation and borrower education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deregulation of SBA programs so steps can be taken to create
incentives for equity investment and participation in minority
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the overhaul of regulations could take a year or two,
but some changes could start sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The complete report can be seen on the Milken Institute Web site
at http://www.milken-inst.org under ``What's New.''

 &HT;    15-year love affair with the cell phone sure to continue
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a way it crept up on us, this love for the pocket
phones you see dangling from belt loops, strapped to waists or
tucked discreetly into vest pockets and purses. The cell phone,
which turns 15 this year, has displaced lots of calls that once
were made on desk phones.
</P>
<P>
   Another fallout has been noticed and appreciated by all frequent
travelers at airports. Many pay phones are unoccupied in the busy
passageways. No need to scramble for coins or stand in lines,
because so many people are carrying their own phones.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wireless generation.
</P>
<P>
   Personal chatter by phone has become unimaginably convenient,
and been accepted swiftly, since its introduction in 1984 when
BellSouth and others started their service. But what does that say
about the old phone and the various ways we approach telephoning?
What changes can we expect in the future?
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that when it comes to communication, change
is not new. It is today's pace that is revolutionary. Consider
this: The phone was invented in 1876 and Bell Telephone Co. started
a year later, but it was 1929 before President Hoover had a phone
installed in his office. Previously presidents had to step into a
booth outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, soccer moms and dads watch sons and daughters play in the
sunlit afternoons _ still in touch with their offices or homes by
way of the cell phone, whose new array of batteries allows
continuous operation for days, not hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that more than 30 percent of my talking on phones
takes place in the car, on my cell phone,'' said WillIam Stanley,
architect of the new Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that it is the perfect way to return phone calls, and I
do it hands-free by working on a speaker. The only problem is you
can't take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   You just know, however, that right around the corner is a system
for dictating on tape notes even as you speak by way of wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, whose architecture business is international, says he
uses his cell phone almost exclusively in Africa, where he has many
projects and where the land-line phone service is not well
developed.
</P>
<P>
   David Kettler, a BellSouth vice president who specializes in
technological advances, says at least two things are happening in
phone evolution right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying in the business that narrowband, such as
conversation, is moving toward wireless, and broadband, such as
Internet connection and data transmission, is moving toward wired
communication,'' Kettler said.
</P>
<P>
   This could mean that everyday phone use, such as chatting with
friends or reporting in to the office, could continue to flow
toward the hand-held devices such as cell phones. And the present
trend toward wired cable modems and similar devices connected to
the phone lines will be used for big volumes of information.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so simple. The wireless industry has some of the
sharpest technical minds in the world at work on ways to move
volumes of information by way of wireless networks. As the
economics begins to balance the prices between wired and wireless
communication, prevailing styles may drive even bigger increases in
the use of hand-held and other wireless communicators.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if people, especially business people, have some concerns
about privacy in cell phone conversations, Kettler said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, even though digital technology has made it harder for
people to intercept conversations between wireless phones, that
technology is not seen as matching the security of wired phones.
But steps are being taken to increase security, through encryption
and other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of ``dead spots'' and other gaps in cell phone
service is also being addressed through a continuous upgrading of
wireless networks, Kettler said. The expansion of cell phone
service areas, and the introduction of systems that minimize
roaming charges, make wireless phone service more handy and more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Our preference for cell phones is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the handy nature of wireless phones, and the improving
efficiency of the batteries that make operation more convenient,
wireless subscribers grew from 3.5 million in 1990 to 24 million in
1995. Today's estimates approach 69 million. The Yankee Group, the
Boston-based research organization, predicts 141 million
subscribers by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, improving technology and falling prices could
accelerate the already steep climb.
</P>
<P>
   Kettler says the new advances will not necessarily be in phones
but in the networks that connect the phones. For instance, very
soon, he said, we may have phones that combine the low expense of
the portable phone used around the house, with the power and reach
of the cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have networks that track your use of the phone,'' he
said, ``so that when you use it in the house you are charged the
same rate as the regular house wired phone, but when you leave the
house with it the network will charge a low wireless rate around
the neighborhood, and a higher one as you range around the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are already developing wireless networks within
the house so that phones and computers can communicate within the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another alternative to the ordinary phone is the Internet
phone, where a caller could dial up through the computer and reach
a person on the other end of a phone line, or on a computer.
</P>

 &HT;    15-year love affair with the cell phone sure to continue
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a way it crept up on us, this love for the pocket
phones you see dangling from belt loops, strapped to waists or
tucked discreetly into vest pockets and purses. The cell phone,
which turns 15 this year, has displaced lots of calls that once
were made on desk phones.
</P>
<P>
   Another fallout has been noticed and appreciated by all frequent
travelers at airports. Many pay phones are unoccupied in the busy
passageways. No need to scramble for coins or stand in lines,
because so many people are carrying their own phones.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the wireless generation.
</P>
<P>
   Personal chatter by phone has become unimaginably convenient,
and been accepted swiftly, since its introduction in 1984 when
BellSouth and others started their service. But what does that say
about the old phone and the various ways we approach telephoning?
What changes can we expect in the future?
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that when it comes to communication, change
is not new. It is today's pace that is revolutionary. Consider
this: The phone was invented in 1876 and Bell Telephone Co. started
a year later, but it was 1929 before President Hoover had a phone
installed in his office. Previously presidents had to step into a
booth outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, soccer moms and dads watch sons and daughters play in the
sunlit afternoons _ still in touch with their offices or homes by
way of the cell phone, whose new array of batteries allows
continuous operation for days, not hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that more than 30 percent of my talking on phones
takes place in the car, on my cell phone,'' said WillIam Stanley,
architect of the new Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that it is the perfect way to return phone calls, and I
do it hands-free by working on a speaker. The only problem is you
can't take notes.''
</P>
<P>
   You just know, however, that right around the corner is a system
for dictating on tape notes even as you speak by way of wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, whose architecture business is international, says he
uses his cell phone almost exclusively in Africa, where he has many
projects and where the land-line phone service is not well
developed.
</P>
<P>
   David Kettler, a BellSouth vice president who specializes in
technological advances, says at least two things are happening in
phone evolution right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying in the business that narrowband, such as
conversation, is moving toward wireless, and broadband, such as
Internet connection and data transmission, is moving toward wired
communication,'' Kettler said.
</P>
<P>
   This could mean that everyday phone use, such as chatting with
friends or reporting in to the office, could continue to flow
toward the hand-held devices such as cell phones. And the present
trend toward wired cable modems and similar devices connected to
the phone lines will be used for big volumes of information.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so simple. The wireless industry has some of the
sharpest technical minds in the world at work on ways to move
volumes of information by way of wireless networks. As the
economics begins to balance the prices between wired and wireless
communication, prevailing styles may drive even bigger increases in
the use of hand-held and other wireless communicators.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if people, especially business people, have some concerns
about privacy in cell phone conversations, Kettler said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, even though digital technology has made it harder for
people to intercept conversations between wireless phones, that
technology is not seen as matching the security of wired phones.
But steps are being taken to increase security, through encryption
and other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of ``dead spots'' and other gaps in cell phone
service is also being addressed through a continuous upgrading of
wireless networks, Kettler said. The expansion of cell phone
service areas, and the introduction of systems that minimize
roaming charges, make wireless phone service more handy and more
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Our preference for cell phones is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the handy nature of wireless phones, and the improving
efficiency of the batteries that make operation more convenient,
wireless subscribers grew from 3.5 million in 1990 to 24 million in
1995. Today's estimates approach 69 million. The Yankee Group, the
Boston-based research organization, predicts 141 million
subscribers by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, improving technology and falling prices could
accelerate the already steep climb.
</P>
<P>
   Kettler says the new advances will not necessarily be in phones
but in the networks that connect the phones. For instance, very
soon, he said, we may have phones that combine the low expense of
the portable phone used around the house, with the power and reach
of the cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have networks that track your use of the phone,'' he
said, ``so that when you use it in the house you are charged the
same rate as the regular house wired phone, but when you leave the
house with it the network will charge a low wireless rate around
the neighborhood, and a higher one as you range around the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are already developing wireless networks within
the house so that phones and computers can communicate within the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another alternative to the ordinary phone is the Internet
phone, where a caller could dial up through the computer and reach
a person on the other end of a phone line, or on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in that form of telephoning, Kettler said, ways must
be found for completing the calls between areas as the signal moves
over various kinds of networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't easy, but it is being done,'' he said, ``and that
form of telephoning will be a factor in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the growth in wireless communication, snail mail
and the traditional phone are the only ways to reach more than 90
percent of households around the country. At last count some 94
percent of households had phones.
</P>

nearly 99 million households in the United States, more than 18
million already have more than one phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, households now average 2.5 phone lines, and the
consultants say that by next year upper-income families could
average five lines to the house.

 &HT;    Astronomy sites offer assistance in searching night sky
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people, the answers are in the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Forget horoscopes and the Academy Awards and go outside tonight
and look up. Those little sparkling points of light _ the stars _
and those larger lights that do not twinkle _ the planets _ have
provided answers and beauty since the first humans walked the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To learn about them and enjoy them, you need nothing more than
your eyes and mind (if you throw in your heart, they'll be even
more beautiful). In fact, most astronomers recommend that novices
postpone buying a telescope and spend some time just observing
using the naked eye or binoculars and a good star chart. A star
chart is simply a map of the skies that helps you find and identify
the larger objects.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find many useful resources on the Internet. While you'll
eventually want to buy a star chart, you can get online help
locating objects in the sky at a page called Stig's Sky Calendar at
http://www.skycalendar.com
</P>
<P>
   /skycal/index.html. (If you use a search engine, you'll find
several charts of the night sky on the Net).
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know what it'll take to get started, you'll want to
read a little bit about astronomy. In this case, too, you'll
eventually want a good book for beginners. But you can find plenty
of information online. Let's start with the Beginner's Guide to
Naked Eye Astronomy at http://user.icx
</P>
<P>
   .net/(tilde)ngc457/nakedeye.htm. You'll learn the basics that
can make watching the skies more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Continue your education by hitting the back button on your
browser to go to a more general section of The Beginners Guide (or
simply type in http://user.icx
</P>
<P>
   .net/(tilde)ngc457/beginner.htm). This page offers all sorts of
useful information _ everything from star charts, to advice on
selecting a telescope or pair of binoculars, to articles that will
help you identify the constellations. Knowing the constellations is
a great help, since you can use them as landmarks to the rest of
the wonders of the sky. Since it's fairly easy to recognize the
major constellations, you'll save a lot of time as you search the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   If your interest in astronomy continues, a couple of things are
likely to happen. You'll eventually want a telescope, and you'll
also have questions about astronomy that aren't answered in the
books you own or the Web pages you find.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can help in both areas.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the search for a good telescope. Let's suppose
you don't have an unlimited cache of money. There's a terrific page
called How to Choose a Quality Telescope for Under $500 at
http://www.eecs.uic.edu
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)dlent/btel.html. This site is exceptional because it
literally leads you by the hand in a series of pages that begin
with explaining the basics of the optics telescopes use. You'll
learn there is more than one type of telescope and find out about
the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Finally, after your
education is complete, you'll wind up on a page that gives you
addresses for some reputable companies that sell telescopes. One
bit of advice to take to heart: Avoid any telescope that costs less
than $100. The optics will be so bad you'll be better off using
your naked eyes or binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's find some places where you can get direct answers to
your questions. Several astronomy groups offer this service
including: Curious About Astronomy? Ask an Astronomer at
http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu

 &HT;    PalmPilot-Mac software improved
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a long time coming but apparently worth the wait. At
least that is the initial review coming from the Internet about
3Com's new Mac software for its PalmPilot line of hand-held
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Called MacPac 2.1, this software lets you back up and
synchronize your PalmPilot data on a Mac. It has been hailed so far
as a lean package that runs fast and offers some innovative
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing MacPac, some Windows users told me they will
switch to the Mac so they can use our software,'' Doug Wirnowski,
PalmPilot product manager, recently told trade news magazine
MacWeek.
</P>
<P>
   The MacPac is great news for the Mac community. The PalmPilot,
which has sold more than 2 million units in the past several years,
is the only hand-held computer that lets you back up and
synchronize personal information on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, the synchronization software for the Mac
paled in comparison with its Windows counterpart for the PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. What 3Com did was take the old Claris Organizer,
which was a excellent personal information manager, and retool it
for the PalmPilot. But 3Com has done more than just translate
Organizer to the PalmPilot. It has actually improved on the old
software.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Organizer as MacPac 2.1 synchronizes some data in
only 11 seconds, according to 3Com tests.
</P>
<P>
   You can also install applications for the PalmPilot through
drag-and-drop technology. That is, you just drag an icon of the
application onto an icon of the PalmPilot on your desktop for
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty new feature is the addition of AppleScript, which
lets users customize their Macs. Now you can do this, too, on the
PalmPilot. For example, you could program your PalmPilot to back up
certain files every day at a specific time.
</P>
<P>
   With MacPac 2.1, the PalmPilot can now communicate with an iMac,
Apple's hottest-selling new computer.
</P>
<P>
   MacPac 2.1 is available online at 3Com's site, in stores and in
catalogs. It retails for $15. The computer CD also includes other
software, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader and the basic version of
Shana's Expense Creator program.

 &HT;    Snap launches site about Holocaust
 &HT;    (Eds: Sunday night means 3/14.)
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere at the intersection of commerce and content, Web
portal Snap found itself a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/CNet-owned Web portal has launched its extensive
Holocaust Resource Center to coincide with NBC's airing of the
Steven Spielberg film ``Schindler's List'' on Sunday night. Users
who want to access the resource center should go to
http://www.snap.com and type in ``holocaust'' in the search box.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust Resource Center is a well-organized site built to
help educate viewers about the Holocaust and help promote
Spielberg's nonprofit Shoah foundation, which documents stories of
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pleasant experience. Categories such as
``concentration camps'' aren't easy to click on, and an eerie sense
of gloom pervades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of thing that's designed to drive
traffic,'' says Edmond Sanctis, Snap's chief operating officer.
``The film is incredibly powerful and an important film. From our
perspective, it's something we are proud to be associated with as a
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Snap, like its portal competitors Yahoo!, Lycos, Exite and
Netscape's NetCenter, has been unabashedly about commerce and
utility. The site has the usual assortment of sports scores, stock
quotes, shopping and e-mail ``sticky products'' designed more for
utility and return visits than anything else. In the portal arena,
where ``sticky products'' are everything, a site devoted to
commemorating horrific acts of human cruelty and suffering is no
sticky product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true most of our messaging to the public has been
whimsical and practical ways to be useful and have fun,'' says Snap
Executive Producer Katharine English. ``But we are all information
junkies anyway; this was a chance to bubble up to the challenge.''

<P>
   English says Snap and other portals in the business of
collecting and organizing information are the ideal companies to
build informational and educational sites for users that don't
necessarily have anything to do with selling books or NCAA Final
Four pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Internet does best,'' she says. ``Think about
how much information you can access _ it's awesome. It's
overpowering. But the days of feeling awed by the power of
information have largely waxed and waned in the age of commerce and
utility and giant corporate mergers. But all this information
hasn't gone away. Look at the number of new sites that launch every
day. The Internet isn't just about mergers and stock quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   English says content is what drives the Web, though new users
probably don't know that yet. ``People who are coming online today
think it's all about e-mail and gaming, but it's not. It's about
accessing rich, deep areas of Internet information.''
</P>
<P>
   English is right. Before portals were all about news, weather,
sports and shopping, they were simple ``search engines'' that
helped Web surfers hunt down the volumes of information on the Web
they could never locate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is true the Holocaust Resource Center isn't going to draw as
much traffic as ESPN SportsZone, GeoCities or even Mr. Showbiz, but
Snap doesn't care. The company says this is an opportunity to
gather its resources and use them to help educate and inform Web
surfers who are moved by the film and want to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   However, everyone at Snap is quick to say this isn't a publicity
stunt or a gimmick to get viewers to leave their TVs and log on to
Snap. The site will be up long after the movie has aired and will
remain a resource on the site indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get some mileage from this on air, that's great, but
that's not why we did it,'' English says. ``It's really about
bringing to the front the kind of work this team does every day
that isn't that high profile and raising awareness to the Shoah
Foundation in another venue _ online. When you stop to think about
it, we're all so commerce-driven here in Silicon Alley start-up
land. More people think of their stock options rather than teaching
kids to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an opportunity to give people access to information
they never had before. This is where the Internet is really alive.
Somebody took the time to assemble this information,'' adds
English. ``This is also where the power of convergence of TV and
online media really manifests. We have the opportunity to drive
people to television and tell them to watch this very important
film based on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably hundreds of thousands of people who have no
idea who Oskar Schindler is. But if they have been touched by the
power of this painful yet uplifting kind of story, it doesn't have
to end for them there. They can go online and take it a step
further and find a place to get involved or try to understand how
something like this could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about convergence, but from my perspective
this is just the beginning. It's our opportunity to weave this
information into users' minds,'' English says. ``It should be
people like us (who build these sites). ``We have access to this
information. It shouldn't be buried; it should be high profile.''

 &HT;    Web can help harried parents with science projects
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each spring, I dread the month of March, because March brings
with it the Science Fair project, which can turn the knees of a
strong, normally capable parent into jelly, especially one with
multiple children, which usually means multiple projects.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for me and other Science Fair-impaired parents, there's
the Internet, which can be the starting point to a more meaningful
project, or least some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Using a search engine such as Yahoo! or Excite and the words
``science fair project,'' or on America Online, ``Science Fair
Central,'' you can quickly find a wealth of resources.
</P>
<P>
   At http://www.eduzone.com
</P>
<P>
   /Tips/Science/SHOWTIP2.HTM, there's a site with the catchy title
``No More Clay Volcanoes: Your 1999 Science Fair.'' It gives a
straightforward, text-only step-by-step guide, which can make a
handy reference guide as your budding scientist selects and puts
together a project. Not surprisingly, the site's author notes that
the most successful projects are those in which a student is
genuinely interested. This site is part of a larger site called
Room 103, which answers science and technology questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimate Science Fair Project is a giant umbrella site that
includes multiple pages with ideas, idea links and writing hints.
The idea generation page (http://www.isd77.k12.mn
</P>
<P>
   .us/resources/cf/ideas.html) includes a worksheet that poses
questions with suggested topics to insert in the blanks that help
get a student's mind thinking properly about how to select a
project. Below is an example taken from the page:
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the effect of on ?
</P>
<P>
   detergentgermination of seeds
</P>
<P>
   temperaturethe volume of air
</P>
<P>
   _ How/to what extent does the affect ?
</P>
<P>
   humiditygrowth of fungi
</P>
<P>
   color of a materialits absorption of heat
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can also be used to compile a non-Internet resource
list. The names of several science publications as well other
resources can be found at
http://www.ipl.org/youth/projectguide/mags. Hyperlinks on the page
will take you to the online version of the publication.
</P>
<P>
   The research resources listed on this page, such as the
dictionary, are good, but may be difficult for young children to
navigate. And in the case of NASA, the recommended thesaurus costs
money. The MerriamWebster site (http://www.m-w.com
</P>
<P>
   /dictionary.htm), while offering less depth in the definitions,
is free and easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   And as we discovered, digital information takes many forms. We
now take extra care when feeding one subject of my son's project.
For on the Internet, we discovered a handy fact _ African bullfrogs
will gladly bite, and eat, the fingers of the hand that feeds them.

 &HT;    Snap launches site about Holocaust
 &HT;    (Eds: Sunday night means 3/14.)
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere at the intersection of commerce and content, Web
portal Snap found itself a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/CNet-owned Web portal has launched its extensive
Holocaust Resource Center to coincide with NBC's airing of the
Steven Spielberg film ``Schindler's List'' on Sunday night. Users
who want to access the resource center should go to
http://www.snap.com and type in ``holocaust'' in the search box.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust Resource Center is a well-organized site built to
help educate viewers about the Holocaust and help promote
Spielberg's nonprofit Shoah foundation, which documents stories of
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pleasant experience. Categories such as
``concentration camps'' aren't easy to click on, and an eerie sense
of gloom pervades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of thing that's designed to drive
traffic,'' says Edmond Sanctis, Snap's chief operating officer.
``The film is incredibly powerful and an important film. From our
perspective, it's something we are proud to be associated with as a
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Snap, like its portal competitors Yahoo!, Lycos, Exite and
Netscape's NetCenter, has been unabashedly about commerce and
utility. The site has the usual assortment of sports scores, stock
quotes, shopping and e-mail ``sticky products'' designed more for
utility and return visits than anything else. In the portal arena,
where ``sticky products'' are everything, a site devoted to
commemorating horrific acts of human cruelty and suffering is no
sticky product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true most of our messaging to the public has been
whimsical and practical ways to be useful and have fun,'' says Snap
Executive Producer Katharine English. ``But we are all information
junkies anyway; this was a chance to bubble up to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   English says Snap and other portals in the business of
collecting and organizing information are the ideal companies to
build informational and educational sites for users that don't
necessarily have anything to do with selling books or NCAA Final
Four pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Internet does best,'' she says. ``Think about
how much information you can access _ it's awesome. It's
overpowering. But the days of feeling awed by the power of
information have largely waxed and waned in the age of commerce and
utility and giant corporate mergers. But all this information
hasn't gone away. Look at the number of new sites that launch every
day. The Internet isn't just about mergers and stock quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   English says content is what drives the Web, though new users
probably don't know that yet. ``People who are coming online today
think it's all about e-mail and gaming, but it's not. It's about
accessing rich, deep areas of Internet information.''
</P>
<P>
   English is right. Before portals were all about news, weather,
sports and shopping, they were simple ``search engines'' that
helped Web surfers hunt down the volumes of information on the Web
they could never locate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is true the Holocaust Resource Center isn't going to draw as
much traffic as ESPN SportsZone, GeoCities or even Mr. Showbiz, but
Snap doesn't care. The company says this is an opportunity to

stunt or a gimmick to get viewers to leave their TVs and log on to

remain a resource on the site indefinitely.

 &HT;    Videoconferencing easy enough on PC
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't really dabbled in videoconferencing online since,
well, the first time I ever tried dabbling in it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in mid-1997, I bought a $99 (after rebate) card that
had inputs for cable TV, radio antennas and a camcorder or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   So I jumped online and grabbed a freeware version of CU-Seeme, a
videoconferencing program developed by Cornell University (CU, get
it?). I planned to hook up my camera and do a little virtual
chatting.
</P>
<P>
   After installing the program, I hooked into a reflector _ the
server where CU-Seeme users log in _ run by NASA, and I opened a
small window with a long and static shot of three guys in ties
talking about astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged but bored, I tried another reflector. I logged in and
``called'' another nickname by clicking his icon.
</P>
<P>
   I was greeted by a grainy, black-and-white,
choppy-but-unmistakably-live image of a nude male torso.
</P>
<P>
   That was all I needed to send me scurrying to the tranquil
island of ``Myst.''
</P>
<P>
   I never did get around to hooking up my camcorder ... until now.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine in Atlanta, who is anti-technologically
inclined, was lamenting the cost of long-distance when she called
her son, who lives in Boulder, Colo. She didn't believe me at first
when I told her she could call him for 35 cents and see him while
she spoke to him simply by buying a Quickcam and downloading some
free software.
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, she didn't quite understand the words ``software,''
``download'' or ``Quickcam,'' but I was able to convince her
anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   The Quickcam _ plus a cheapo microphone for transmitting sound _
cost $96, and it installed by connecting to a parallel port.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to download Microsoft Netmeeting, a
full-fledged freeware videoconferencing program, and she was all
set.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, parallel ports are not good conduits for digital
video. The picture from the Quickcam leaves a lot to be desired,
and it's useless for any kind of frame grabbing or video digitizing
beyond making really bad, fuzzy screen savers.
</P>
<P>
   But for Net videoconferencing, it's more than adequate. (Not to
mention a much cheaper solution over time than those 10-10
long-distance deals.)
</P>
<P>
   I also decided to try out my camcorder and card for comparison.
The results were striking.
</P>
<P>
   The card I bought was a Video Highway Xtreme, and it has inputs
for TV, VCR, coaxial, cable, composite video, S-video and AM/FM
radio antennas. To use a digital video card as I did, you'll need a
camcorder or some other video source.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the time it took to install the card initially,
which went relatively painlessly as far as video drivers go, I had
my camcorder broadcasting in less time than it took to set up the
Quickcam.
</P>
<P>
   Netmeeting and CU-Seeme work in similar ways, a model based on
the Internet chatting network IRC: A person logs into a server _
called reflectors for CU-Seeme and isl servers for Netmeeting _
that transmit sound, video and/or text. Anyone logged in can ``call
up'' anyone else by clicking their icons. Calls can be accepted,
declined, blocked, ignored or conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact people directly across the Net for a
``person-to-person'' connection with a program like ICQ, or, in the
case of Netmeeting, across different isl servers.
</P>
<P>
   (The reason I use Netmeeting: It's free, and I knew the
Microserfs would make it optimized to run on Win 95/98.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also several shareware programs _ such as VDOphone,
CU-Seeme and Intel Intercast _ to try out.
</P>
<P>
   One important caveat regarding testing different programs: Video
drivers and associated files go to the very heart of your operating
system, and chaos can result when switching between driver sets,
video capture devices, etc.
</P>
<P>
   An old version of Intel Internet phone scotched my settings for
CU-Seeme and Netmeeting ... even after removing the Intel program
and restoring my previous system.ini file. If you are wary of
messing with your system's device manager or the system registry,
pick one program and stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, be prepared for what transpires on the public
servers. Your family chat could very well be listed next to a user
nicknamed Naked in Nantucket.

for TV, VCR, coaxial, cable, composite video, S-video and AM/FM
radio antennas. To use a digital video card as I did, you'll need a
camcorder or some other video source.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the time it took to install the card initially,
which went relatively painlessly as far as video drivers go, I had
my camcorder broadcasting in less time than it took to set up the
Quickcam.
</P>
<P>
   Netmeeting and CU-Seeme work in similar ways, a model based on
the Internet chatting network IRC: A person logs into a server _
called reflectors for CU-Seeme and isl servers for Netmeeting _
that transmit sound, video and/or text. Anyone logged in can ``call
up'' anyone else by clicking their icons. Calls can be accepted,
declined, blocked, ignored or conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact people directly across the Net for a
``person-to-person'' connection with a program like ICQ, or, in the
case of Netmeeting, across different isl servers.
</P>
<P>
   (The reason I use Netmeeting: It's free, and I knew the
Microserfs would make it optimized to run on Win 95/98.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also several shareware programs _ such as VDOphone,
CU-Seeme and Intel Intercast _ to try out.
</P>
<P>
   One important caveat regarding testing different programs: Video
drivers and associated files go to the very heart of your operating
system, and chaos can result when switching between driver sets,
video capture devices, etc.
</P>
<P>
   An old version of Intel Internet phone scotched my settings for
CU-Seeme and Netmeeting ... even after removing the Intel program
and restoring my previous system.ini file. If you are wary of
messing with your system's device manager or the system registry,
pick one program and stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, be prepared for what transpires on the public
servers. Your family chat could very well be listed next to a user
nicknamed Naked in Nantucket.

 &HT;    Junk e-mail a way of life, but you have a few defenses
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll never forget the thrill I felt when I opened my first
e-mail. Maybe it's strange to feel nostalgic about something that
is theoretically as neutral as computer bytes. But turns out that
Marshall McLuhan was wrong as far as I'm concerned. The message is
the message, and it's the content that matters, not how it arrives.
</P>
<P>
   I still love e-mail when it comes from a friend. But so much of
it is true junk, and I delete that unread. Nowadays the junk
outnumbers the good mail.
</P>
<P>
   Readers often write me, thinking I have some secret method of
shielding them from the invasion that arrives daily in the mailbox
when they log on. Truth is, I can't stop it from coming to my own
mailbox, and if I could come up with a good method of doing that, I
would be a saner man.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few ways to control junk mail, but some of them are
counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you probably have received unsolicited e-mail that
has a helpful note at the bottom offering to remove you from the
mailing list if you'll just ask for that to be done. Sometimes this
is a sincere offer from an ethical merchant. Other times it is a
trick to authenticate your e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   In some mass mailings, the whole notion is to get you to
respond. Once you've responded, your e-mail address commands a
premium price among the e-mail list peddlers. You've just raised
your hand and said, in effect: Yes, I'm here, and the address
works.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a person to do?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there isn't a heck of a lot you can do to protect
yourself against the really unethical mailers. These people care
only about profiting from your name. But there are a few steps you
can take to diminish the amount of junk that arrives. Here's a
start:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check with your Internet provider and ask if it offers any
system for filtering out junk mail. These junk mail filters use
various schemes, but most look for the addresses of known junk
mailers. If it's offered, use it. These systems won't eliminate the
junk but will reduce its volume.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you leave public messages on the Internet, you can avoid
using your real address. Some people change the return address on
their account to fool automatic software that harvests e-mail
addresses from postings in almost the same way thresher machines
harvest grain on the farm. For instance, if your real e-mail
address is bhusted(at)ajc.com, it can be changed to
bhusted(at)spamfilter.ajc.com. People who understand e-mail will
figure out what you're doing, but the automatic software will be
fooled and any mail sent to you will go astray. (The downside of
this method is that many Internet users whom you might legitimately
want to hear from also will be fooled, so I don't recommend it
unless you understand that you might also miss some real mail this
way.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Unless you just can't stand it, avoid registering at Web sites
for free gifts and informational mailings offered by some sites.
That puts your e-mail address in the basket to be swapped, sold and
abused.
</P>
<P>
   _ Write your Internet provider and ask that it take any steps it
can to protect you from junk e-mail. While there aren't many things
the provider can do to help at this stage, it's good to register
your indignation since you are something truly valuable to them: a
customer. A groundswell of disapproval will register if the ISPs
has to decide whether to seek or back legislation to control junk
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, keep your sense of humor about all this (I cannot
always obey my own advice, by the way). Just as the paper variety
of junk mail will continue to arrive in your mailbox at home, junk
e-mail is a fact of life. Open an e-mail account, and it will come.
</P>

cannot respond to all e-mail. Personal home page:

 &HT;    Young reviewer not enchanted by this 'Fairy Tale'
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Fairy Tale'' activity center wasn't magical for Laura
Thompson of Marietta. The 11-year-old software reviewer stopped
just short of calling the CD-ROM program boring and confessed it
didn't hold her attention for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK,'' she said, being generous. ``It just wasn't
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura said the fairy-themed activity program was less than
entertaining and didn't capture her imagination. She said she's
unlikely to use the software again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairy Tale'' promotes itself as a true-story-come-to-life, in
which kids can experience the enchanting world of fairies and
fantasy. Set against a tropical background with realistic forest
sounds, the program is filled with fairy trivia, puzzles, word
games and numerous magical activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the activity center are 17 video clips,
featuring two little girls who believe in fairies and try to
convince others (probably adults) that fairies exist.
</P>
<P>
   None of that worked for Laura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't get it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The program also features an interactive 3-D garden and a way
for kids to create sets for their very own fairy tale adventure.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, escaped Laura, who said she didn't see any choices of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I had worked harder at it, I would have come up with
something nice,'' Laura said. ``But there were none that I really
liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the program didn't interest her much, Laura didn't
explore all of the ``numerous magical activities'' that the program
boasted.
</P>
<P>
   The only segment that was remotely interesting to her was the
quiz that followed each video clip, but even that fell short for
this bright reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part was pretty fun, but it was way too easy,'' she said.
``Maybe it would have been fun for someone younger.''

 &HT;    Author sees opportunity in Y2K bug
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not everyone is a ``Chicken Little'' when it comes to the
Millennium Bug. Take John F. Mauldin, who has written a book called
``How to Profit From the Y2K Recession.'' Mauldin is an investment
analyst and self-proclaimed Y2K expert.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he advocates taking financial advantage of any
disruption, profiting off the hysteria of others. The book is
published by St. Martins Press and retails for the suggested price
of $24.95.

</P>
<P>
   Here's a new computer CD game designed for Atlanta, where the
love of Civil War history runs high. In ``North vs. South,''
players re-enact some of the important battles of the Civil War.
You'll find Bull Run, Gaines' Mill, Cedar Mountain, Antietam,
Gettysburg and the Wilderness. This turn-based game lets you
command everything from a corps to a brigade. You can choose
whether to play from the North or South side. The game, published
by Interactive Magic, is available only for PCs with systems
Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   You've shot deer, driven race cars and flown fighter jets. Now
you can ride a bucking bull on your computer. That's right, the
latest simulation software emulates the rodeo. It's called
``Extreme Bullrider'' and is published by Activision. With this
game, you can choose to be one of 20 different riders, select one
of 10 different bulls and pick one of six arenas. There are also 10
different bullfighting clowns to choose from. ``Extreme Bullrider''
is available only for PCs with systems Windows 95 or higher.

   Amateur astronomers take note. There's a wonderful site on the

 &HT;    Calendar Creator apace with the times
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like Calendar Creator has been around as long as there
have been computers to run it, and I doubt its popularity has ever
waned. Making personalized calendars is one of those things
computers do exceedingly well, and most people can use such
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Calendar Creator is published now by Broderbund, and just came
out in Version 6. I would have to say its power and versatility
have outpaced its ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating, useful and even educational program; but
it's unnecessarily difficult to use. Just for an example, there are
several different properties boxes accessed both by right-clicking
or via pull-down menus. This is confusing.
</P>
<P>
   If you just want to make a calendar to keep your appointments
and print it out month by month or week by week, this is pretty
easy. If you poke around a little, you'll find a raft of pre-set
events you can add, from French Saints Days to Japanese holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Since Japan may yet rule the world, it's good to know that under
their calendar, Sept. 15 is Respect for the Aged Day.
</P>
<P>
   You can type in your own events or just use a color code to
remind you of, for instance, your regular haircut appointment or
your semiannual visit to the soothsayer.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars can be printed out in a lot of different ways, and of
course you can add pictures to them. The program comes with a
selection of nice pictures for this purpose. Most usefully, you can
print a calendar in Instabook form for carrying in a purse or a
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feature for synchronizing a PalmPilot with the
Calendar in the PC, and Calendar Creator makes a move toward
becoming a personal information manager with an address book.
Entering information into it is rather cumbersome, with a lot of
unnecessary pop-up data entry boxes.
</P>
<P>
   You can have the calendar remind you, by way of a
memory-resident scheduler, of upcoming events. Also, in a neat
little trick, if you enter, let's say, Oct. 3 as your momma's 73rd
birthday, then next year it will automatically change the notation
on that date to show it is her 74th. One assumes, of course,
Calendar Creator is solidly Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   As in most programs these days that make any kind of graphic
presentation, you can do it from scratch or you can use one of many
built-in templates. There are lots of fancy fonts. You can make a
clean, easily grasped calendar, or you can make one virtually
illegible. Computers are very democratic this way.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this is a most useful and complete program, and
with a little persistence you can cut through its confusion and use
it to help with a lot of tasks. It costs about $60.

is a sincere offer from an ethical merchant. Other times it is a
trick to authenticate your e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   In some mass mailings, the whole notion is to get you to
respond. Once you've responded, your e-mail address commands a
premium price among the e-mail list peddlers. You've just raised
your hand and said, in effect: Yes, I'm here, and the address
works.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a person to do?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there isn't a heck of a lot you can do to protect
yourself against the really unethical mailers. These people care
only about profiting from your name. But there are a few steps you
can take to diminish the amount of junk that arrives. Here's a
start:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check with your Internet provider and ask if it offers any
system for filtering out junk mail. These junk mail filters use
various schemes, but most look for the addresses of known junk
mailers. If it's offered, use it. These systems won't eliminate the
junk but will reduce its volume.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you leave public messages on the Internet, you can avoid
using your real address. Some people change the return address on
their account to fool automatic software that harvests e-mail
addresses from postings in almost the same way thresher machines
harvest grain on the farm. For instance, if your real e-mail
address is bhusted(at)ajc.com, it can be changed to
bhusted(at)spamfilter.ajc.com. People who understand e-mail will
figure out what you're doing, but the automatic software will be
fooled and any mail sent to you will go astray. (The downside of
this method is that many Internet users whom you might legitimately
want to hear from also will be fooled, so I don't recommend it
unless you understand that you might also miss some real mail this
way.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Unless you just can't stand it, avoid registering at Web sites
for free gifts and informational mailings offered by some sites.
That puts your e-mail address in the basket to be swapped, sold and
abused.
</P>
<P>
   _ Write your Internet provider and ask that it take any steps it
can to protect you from junk e-mail. While there aren't many things
the provider can do to help at this stage, it's good to register
your indignation since you are something truly valuable to them: a
customer. A groundswell of disapproval will register if the ISPs
has to decide whether to seek or back legislation to control junk
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, keep your sense of humor about all this (I cannot
always obey my own advice, by the way). Just as the paper variety
of junk mail will continue to arrive in your mailbox at home, junk
e-mail is a fact of life. Open an e-mail account, and it will come.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail: tecbud(at)ajc.com. Bill appreciates hearing from you but
cannot respond to all e-mail. Personal home page:

 &HT;    Calendar Creator apace with the times
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like Calendar Creator has been around as long as there
have been computers to run it, and I doubt its popularity has ever
waned. Making personalized calendars is one of those things
computers do exceedingly well, and most people can use such
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Calendar Creator is published now by Broderbund, and just came
out in Version 6. I would have to say its power and versatility
have outpaced its ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fascinating, useful and even educational program; but
it's unnecessarily difficult to use. Just for an example, there are
several different properties boxes accessed both by right-clicking
or via pull-down menus. This is confusing.
</P>
<P>
   If you just want to make a calendar to keep your appointments
and print it out month by month or week by week, this is pretty
easy. If you poke around a little, you'll find a raft of pre-set
events you can add, from French Saints Days to Japanese holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Since Japan may yet rule the world, it's good to know that under
their calendar, Sept. 15 is Respect for the Aged Day.
</P>
<P>
   You can type in your own events or just use a color code to
remind you of, for instance, your regular haircut appointment or
your semiannual visit to the soothsayer.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars can be printed out in a lot of different ways, and of
course you can add pictures to them. The program comes with a
selection of nice pictures for this purpose. Most usefully, you can
print a calendar in Instabook form for carrying in a purse or a
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feature for synchronizing a PalmPilot with the
Calendar in the PC, and Calendar Creator makes a move toward
becoming a personal information manager with an address book.
Entering information into it is rather cumbersome, with a lot of
unnecessary pop-up data entry boxes.
</P>
<P>
   You can have the calendar remind you, by way of a
memory-resident scheduler, of upcoming events. Also, in a neat
little trick, if you enter, let's say, Oct. 3 as your momma's 73rd
birthday, then next year it will automatically change the notation
on that date to show it is her 74th. One assumes, of course,
Calendar Creator is solidly Y2K compatible.
</P>
<P>
   As in most programs these days that make any kind of graphic
presentation, you can do it from scratch or you can use one of many
built-in templates. There are lots of fancy fonts. You can make a
clean, easily grasped calendar, or you can make one virtually
illegible. Computers are very democratic this way.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this is a most useful and complete program, and
with a little persistence you can cut through its confusion and use
it to help with a lot of tasks. It costs about $60.

   ENCEPHALITIS (San Francisco) _ Dozens of cases of encephalitis

Disease Control and Prevention is trying to find causes for the
many cases of encephalitis that defy explanation. By ULYSSES
TORASSA.
</P>

driving. By ERIC McCORMICK.
</P>
<P>
   CAL-ADMISSIONS (San Francisco) _ This week the regents of the
University of California are set to vote on a plan to make the top
4 percent at every California high school eligible for the

inner-city areas. By KATHERINE SELIGMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC-SURGEON (San Francisco) _ Dr. Alan Gaynor, a San
Francisco dermatologist nationally known for his glib guest
appearances on TV talk shows, has been placed on five years
probation by the Medical Board of California, in part for the
half-blinding of a woman who suffered a needle stab to the eye in
his office. By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-CORPORATIONS (San Francisco) _ Traditional corporations
should emulate the informality, flat organizational structures and
quick decision-making prowess of Silicon Valley companies if they
plan to succeed in the future. By WENDY TANAKA.
</P>
<P>
   WINE-INSTITUTE (San Francisco) _ The Wine Institute has morphed
from a relatively sedate trade group hosting wine tastings and
endorsing cookbooks into a sophisticated public policy and lobbying
organization. Some 430 dues-paying commercial wineries _ out of a
statewide total of 740 _ belong to the Wine Institute. By DAVID
ARMSTRONG.
</P>

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   STAR-WARS (Undated) _ It's been 22 years since the first ``Star
Wars'' film, 19 years since the second and a mere 16 since the

1/2-minute trailer for the prequel isn't revealing much about what
awaits us. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   STAR-WARS-JUNKIE (Undated) _ The full title is ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' but most fans call it EP1 or TPM.

lined up by the block to see the original ``Star Wars.'' That was

   ELIA-KAZAN (San Francisco) _ Next Sunday, Elia Kazan, 89 years
old, famous worldwide as a distinguished director of theater and
film, will walk to the podium at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los
Angeles to receive an honorary Oscar. This may turn out to be the
most divisive and troublesome moment in the Academy's history
because Elia Kazan is also known worldwide as the stool pigeon who
sold out his colleagues before the House Committee on Un-American
Activities (popularly known as HUAC) in 1952. By NANCY SCOTT.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   CORKSCREWS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The first patent for a corkscrew was
taken out in 1795 by the Rev. Samuel Henshall in Oxford, England.
Since then, there have been hundreds, and for some people, a
corkscrew is as personal as a fountain pen. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.

whites. This year, Hahneiser is heading to Libya. Hahneiser is one
of a growing number of people seeking rare sights and unusual
experiences on their vacations.In the tourism business, it is known
as ``adventure travel.'' By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-URUGUAY (Salto, Uruguay) _ A riot of scents greets
visitors to the Uruguayan town of Salto, which is laid out in a
grid with a mix of architectural styles _ 19th-century,
neo-classical, stone-columned municipal buildings and boxy
flat-roofed stores and houses. Eucalyptus trees and jasmine vines
perfume the daytime air, and we inhale the aroma of grilled freshly
slaughtered beef and lamb as we drive to our Art Deco hotel. By
LINDA TRISCHITTA.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS (Phoenix) _ The National Football League will lift its
ban on embattled 49ers co-owner Eddie DeBartolo after the 1999-2000
football season, sources said. Three sources close to DeBartolo and
the club, and two officials of another team familiar with league
deliberations, say DeBartolo must also pay an unspecified fine
first. By SCOTT WINOKUR.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Wow, has San Francisco changed
since Joe, Dom and Vince DiMaggio were lads? There are too many
ways to count, but one street scene tells the tale. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ For sharing some of what he saw
during his five years in Bill Clinton's inner circle, George
Stephanopoulos is being called a weasel and a Judas. Maybe worst of
all, long-time Clinton haters (people Stephanopoulos presumably
can't stand) are crowing, ``Welcome aboard! What took you so
long?'' By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Constitution appears to
mean that no one can take your property except through a legal
process involving a finding of guilt. But don't kid yourself. Today
these words all too often ring hollow as the federal government,
the states, counties and cities across the land avail themselves of
the opportunity to sequester private property. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   CLACK-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Arlene Perez left the care of her
children to others while she was adrift in the white storm of
cocaine and heroin abuse and a whirlwind of partying. But in the
end, it was the love for the children she'd abandoned that pulled
her back to sobriety's shore. By CARY CLACK.
</P>
<P>
   FLORES-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Forty years after the arrival of
Barbie, Mattel is understanding the influence the doll can have on
little girls. At last, the company is putting money toward issues
where Barbie's image could be a greater force: supporting programs
that teach girls about technology, money and finance, math and
science, life skills and career planning. By VERONICA FLORES.
</P>
<P>
   EINSTEIN-RECALLED (New York) _ It was April 1954, and I had come
to see Albert Einstein at his home in Princeton, N.J., to ask if he
would accept an achievement award from Lord &AMP; Taylor. And would he
make an acceptance address at a luncheon at the Waldorf? By REA
LUBAR DUNCAN.

 &HT;    TECH BRIEFS: Tending to business from the beyond
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A St. Louis company has come up with the software program for
the ultimate control freak.
</P>
<P>
   PreNeed funeral planning software lets you make your own funeral
arrangements, from choosing a funeral director to picking the hue
of your headstone. The program, which retails for $39, is billed as
the first funeral planning product for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows-based program creates the PreNeed Plan, divided into
two areas: picking the cemetery, entombment and cremation; and
funeral services and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The program starts at the end, covering the issue of where to
place the remains. From there, topics covered include organ or body
donations. If organ donation is your wish, the manual that comes
with the floppy disc lists an address to request a Uniform Donor
Card.
</P>
<P>
   Next the program suggests choosing a burial site.
</P>
<P>
   If a cemetery is the place for you, the folks at Power Solutions
for Business recommend paying in advance, since cemetery costs tend
to double every 10 years. Once a site is chosen, you need to pick a
size and factor in cemetery costs, such as fees for opening and
closing the grave, grave liners, decorations, plantings and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more helpful sections covers funeral costs, which can
be surprisingly high. Urns, for example, can run as high as $1,000.
The manual offers a little insight into how casket salespeople
work. The sale of a casket, the manual reads, is where the funeral
director makes a large chunk of his or her money. The manual points
out the less-expensive models usually won't be prominently
displayed, if at all. Casket sellers are required to furnish a
price list when showing product, according to the manual.
</P>
<P>
   One of the final items is cost. According to the manual, funeral
costs climb 4 percent to 6 percent per year, sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done, you can print a report that can serve as a
guideline for the family and funeral director to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Camcorder digital photos
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic has launched what it claims to be the first camcorder
with the ability to take still digital photos.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic PV-L759 and PV-L859 use the SanDisk CompactFlash
memory card. The cards are used in more than 140 products,
including digital cameras, hand-held PCs, audio recorders and photo
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic camcorders will come with a 2-megabyte memory
card. The feature will let users download images from the camcorder
on the memory card and then move them to a color printer or a PC to
look at or attach to e-mail, Web sites documents or sales
presentations. The cards will hold more than 60 standard resolution
or 15 high-resolution photos.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorders have a suggested retail prices starting at about
$800.
</P>
<P>
   SanDisk, which makes flash data storage products, is based in
Sunnyvale, Calif. The company's site on the Web is
http://www.sandisk.com.
</P>
<P>
   The defense rests
</P>
<P>
   http://www.nolo.com is a Web site for the do-it-yourself lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Rated the No. 1 legal site on the Web by Yahoo!, nolo.com is a
collection of legal resources. Included is an update on new
copyright laws, tips for being a successful landlord and consumer
rights, which include what to know about your rights as car renter.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers special links, including ones for parents and
children, spouses and partners, and small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   A legal dictionary is available, as is a store at which you can
buy books and a site from which you can download software.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might not be willing to take the law in their own
hands. But at the very least, the site offers a decent compilation
of lawyer jokes. Sample: How does a pregnant woman know she's
carrying a future lawyer? She has an extreme craving for baloney.

 &HT;    Hillary has time to set up camp in N.Y.
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How can Hillary Rodham Clinton run for senator of New York?
She lives in Washington, D.C. Can anybody run for senator of New
York, no matter where they live?
</P>
<P>
   A: Run? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution says you must be a resident of the state
``when elected.'' In New York, according to Lee Daghlian of the New
York Board of Elections, there is no law outlining what ``be a
resident'' means. Move in with a friend, buy a condo, whatever.
Guess New York voters will decide that individually.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Daghlian says he is asked this question dozens of times a
day recently.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help me find a license plate frame that says ``Swedish
Driver'' with a Swedish flag.
</P>

   Q: Somebody thought it would be clever to sign me up for about
30 various magazine subscriptions. Nothing against Martha Stewart,
but I'm just not real interested in her publication. Nor do I want
Seventeen, Quiltmaker,etc. If I simply ignore the bills, will I get
bad credit? Do I have to spend time and money mailing
cancellations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, time and a few postage stamps. Contact each publisher
and explain you did not order the subscriptions and are canceling.
If you call, make a log of the date and the person with whom you
spoke; if you write, copy the letter. If the magazines continue to
arrive after repeated attempts to cancel, call the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service. It may take a few months to get this
straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To the best of my memory, there was a law passed in the 1950s
that made it illegal to put a refrigerator not in use outdoors
without removing its doors to prevent children from playing inside
and being suffocated. Is this correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Refrigerator Safety Act of 1956 requires that
refrigerators be manufactured to open from the inside. The industry
moved from latch closures to magnetic ones in response to this act.
The law is not retroactive so does not apply to refrigerators made
before 1956.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ken Giles of the Consumer Products Safety
Commission, abandoned refrigerators should either have the door
removed, be chained shut or have the opening blocked. A child's
safety is at stake. Q: On Paul Harvey'sradio program recently there
was a story about a 1943 penny sold at auction for $84,000. I was
going through an old coin collection and found one of the pennies.
It is a 1943 penny without a mint mark. Could you find out what it
is worth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you have a magnet? If the penny is attracted to the
magnet, it is steel and may be worth as much as 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Rare coin dealer Larry Spencesays during World War II copper was
needed for the war effort. In 1943 most pennies were made of steel.
But a few (blank, S or D) were made of copper. These are worth big
bucks today.
</P>
<P>
   To compound matters, wacky jokers occasionally plate 1943 steel
pennies with copper and try to pass them off as rare. Also many
1943 steel pennies have turned black and owners think they are
copper.
</P>
<P>
   If your penny passes the magnet test, take it to a reputable
dealer who will have it authenticated by the American Numismatic
Association.Then get ready to hear, ``Going, going ... gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whom do I contact to buy an episode of Alfred Hitchcock
Presents?It aired about 40 to 45 years ago and starred Joseph
Cotten.Anyone who saw it could never forget it!
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a lot to go on. I found three episodes by the master of
suspense casting Joseph Cotten: ``Dead Weight'' (1959),
``Together'' (1958) and ``Breakdown'' (1955). I hope it was
``Breakdown,'' which is available from Movies Unlimited at (800)

   A: Messmer's rendition of the anthem tears eyes, lumps throats
and raises the spirits of the rabble. A founding partner of the IHL

 &HT;    Hillary has time to set up camp in N.Y.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How can Hillary Rodham Clinton run for senator of New York?
She lives in Washington, D.C. Can anybody run for senator of New
York, no matter where they live?
</P>
<P>
   A: Run? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution says you must be a resident of the state
``when elected.'' In New York, according to Lee Daghlian of the New
York Board of Elections, there is no law outlining what ``be a
resident'' means. Move in with a friend, buy a condo, whatever.
Guess New York voters will decide that individually.
</P>

   Poor Daghlian says he is asked this question dozens of times a

 &HT;    Antenna adds local stations to satellite dish
 &HT;    (With photo.)
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the limitations of satellite television service is that
satellite services don't carry local channels. Your satellite
system delivers all kinds of movies, sports and special interest
programming, but if you want to watch your local news, you're out
of luck.
</P>
<P>
   TERK Technologies of Commack, N.Y., sells a line of antennas
that solve that problem by attaching directly to your 18-inch
satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   TERK says consumers can attach its TV41 and TV42 antennas to
their satellite dishes in a few minutes using no tools.
</P>
<P>
   The short lengths of wire required for installation are included
with the antennas. The wires prevent the signal loss sometimes
associated with running long separate wires from a rooftop antenna
to every television set in the house. The TERK antennas also have
built-in amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   The antennas are attached inconspicuously to the back side of
satellite dishes with built-in clips. Because they attach directly
to the dishes, they eliminate the need for a bulky roof-top
antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The TV41 model is designed for satellite systems attached to one
television set, and its suggested retail price is $59.95. TV42 is
designed for satellite systems attached to two televisions, and it
retails for about $79.95.
</P>
<P>
   TV42 won a Best of Show award at the International Consumer
Electronics Show in January, and TERK began shipping it and the
TV41 to retailers around Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to sell the products through electronic
specialty stores such as Circuit City and Best Buy, but they may
not be available locally yet. Internet purchasers will find them on
the Crutchfield and J&AMP;R Music World sites.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the antennas and other TERK Technology
products, you can visit the company's Web site at www.terk.com or
call (800) 942-8375.

 &HT;    Internet security isn't a dream
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think somebody's watching you?
</P>
<P>
   You're not just being paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, despite its cryptic user names, anonymous e-mail
accounts and extensive use of passwords, is still very much a
wide-open prairie in which everything you do _ from Web browsing to
buying _ is subject to somebody else's prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When you are on the Web, you are vulnerable. If somebody sets
their mind to it, they can steal your credit card information,
usurp your identity or just monitor your frequent visits to
furby-fetish.com.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the technology that keeps snoops out of
your business and keeps your private information private is
improving, and within a few years, an infrastructure and set of
tools will be in place that will make it much harder to break into
a person's virtual life.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s recent inclusion of security ID features on its
Pentium III and some Pentium II processors generated protests from
groups concerned about privacy. Intel says the feature is meant to
make electronic commerce more secure, but privacy advocates say the
chip allows Intel to monitor people's Internet use and habits _ a
violation of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The protests show that privacy and security are big concerns to
both users and to companies as use of the Internet becomes more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thompson, an independent security analyst working in
Austin, says security that protects privacy and transactions is
better than a lot of people think. And it keeps getting better.
Thompson, who's advised IBM Corp. and Intel on security, says he's
optimistic that security enhancements will become invisible parts
of communication and transaction software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty close,'' Thompson said. ``A lot of
security concerns are being addressed (by software makers) and
biometrics and voice recognition are going to revolutionize
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Biometric readers _ which would identify a user through
fingerprints, a retina scan or a facial scan _ would be many times
more secure than a password or PIN-code based transaction system.
</P>
<P>
   And voice-recognition passwords, which would identify a user by
the unique characteristics of their voice pattern, would also
tighten up security and could be simply implemented through a
microphone and the right software.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said these methods of identification will speed along
Internet commerce, allowing transactions of up to billions of
dollars at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Other privacy concerns _ unsolicited e-mail and unwanted
snooping of a user's information _ may also become things of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Software that filters unwanted e-mail is becoming increasingly
sophisticated as is security on basic Web browsing and online
buying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, using a credit card on the Internet on a secured,
encrypted connection is one of the safest things you can do on the
Net. Giving a credit card number on the Net, Internet experts such
as Thompson say, is safer than giving up your credit card for
billing at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds a little too bright and trouble-free, it may
be. As home networking _ hooking up multiple computers through a
single high-speed Internet connection in the home _ grows, home
users will have to use some of the same security measures used by
large companies such as Dell Computer Corp. today.
</P>
<P>
   Firewalls, which allow information to come into a local network,
but block access from the outside, will have to be implemented if
home users want to keep their data private. But users will have
greater options about what content comes through their network
connection and what information they want to make available.
</P>
<P>
   As more of our daily lives _ the things we buy and the
information we use _ originate online, it'll be more important than
ever to guard our information vigilantly as the tools to do it
become available.

usurp your identity or just monitor your frequent visits to
furby-fetish.com.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the technology that keeps snoops out of
your business and keeps your private information private is
improving, and within a few years, an infrastructure and set of
tools will be in place that will make it much harder to break into
a person's virtual life.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s recent inclusion of security ID features on its
Pentium III and some Pentium II processors generated protests from
groups concerned about privacy. Intel says the feature is meant to
make electronic commerce more secure, but privacy advocates say the
chip allows Intel to monitor people's Internet use and habits _ a
violation of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The protests show that privacy and security are big concerns to
both users and to companies as use of the Internet becomes more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thompson, an independent security analyst working in
Austin, says security that protects privacy and transactions is
better than a lot of people think. And it keeps getting better.
Thompson, who's advised IBM Corp. and Intel on security, says he's
optimistic that security enhancements will become invisible parts
of communication and transaction software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty close,'' Thompson said. ``A lot of
security concerns are being addressed (by software makers) and
biometrics and voice recognition are going to revolutionize
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Biometric readers _ which would identify a user through
fingerprints, a retina scan or a facial scan _ would be many times
more secure than a password or PIN-code based transaction system.
</P>
<P>
   And voice-recognition passwords, which would identify a user by
the unique characteristics of their voice pattern, would also
tighten up security and could be simply implemented through a
microphone and the right software.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said these methods of identification will speed along
Internet commerce, allowing transactions of up to billions of
dollars at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Other privacy concerns _ unsolicited e-mail and unwanted
snooping of a user's information _ may also become things of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Software that filters unwanted e-mail is becoming increasingly
sophisticated as is security on basic Web browsing and online
buying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, using a credit card on the Internet on a secured,
encrypted connection is one of the safest things you can do on the
Net. Giving a credit card number on the Net, Internet experts such
as Thompson say, is safer than giving up your credit card for
billing at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds a little too bright and trouble-free, it may
be. As home networking _ hooking up multiple computers through a
single high-speed Internet connection in the home _ grows, home
users will have to use some of the same security measures used by
large companies such as Dell Computer Corp. today.
</P>
<P>
   Firewalls, which allow information to come into a local network,
but block access from the outside, will have to be implemented if
home users want to keep their data private. But users will have
greater options about what content comes through their network
connection and what information they want to make available.
</P>
<P>
   As more of our daily lives _ the things we buy and the
information we use _ originate online, it'll be more important than
ever to guard our information vigilantly as the tools to do it
become available.

 &HT;    Author of `Burn Rate' started a firestorm

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Michael Wolff tried to get an Internet business
going way back in the early years of the World Wide Web. It was
1996, and he was in a new medium.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about his adventures in dealing with venture
capitalists, media barons, old and new, and other Internet gold
seekers in a book, ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Burn rate is the term for how much money a startup goes through
in excess of its income. It seems to be the hallmark of an Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Wolff is a journalist who writes about the Internet for
New York magazine and other publications. He was in Austin as a
keynote speaker at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin American-Statesman spoke with Wolff last week. Here
is an edited transcript:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the gold rush years on the Internet over?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are very much still going on. The gold is just
apparently pouring out of those hills.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The people you dealt with didn't seem to have a good idea of
why they wanted to be on the Net or what to do there. They just
thought that's where they should be.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a very fair statement. The same thing still holds
true. People still haven't figured out where it's going, but they
are still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why can't anyone grab hold of the Net and what's going on
there?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are in this period where every nine months, everything
changes. Every phase of this business from online services to push
technology to whatever is the flavor of the moment. Now it's
e-commerce. That will change.
</P>
<P>
   No model, no real business solution has lasted more than nine
months. The more logical way to look at that is that e-commerce
will peter out in a given number of months. To be replaced by
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, how do you make money on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know the answer to that. No one knows the answer to
that. This is the major question. What are the benefits of the
Internet? How do you protect, at the very least, your downside?
That we can't even begin to imagine how big the upside will be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you write the book?
</P>
<P>
   A: This book was for me very much two things. I wanted to tell a
story that was very compelling and that a lot of people were
experiencing. I also wrote the book because these guys that I dealt
with were bums. They deserved the harsh light of day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was their reaction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The people I wrote about were furious. It was beyond fury;
they were murderous. It never really occurred to most of the people
in the book that someone would really set down the conversations
they had in business meetings. It just had never happened to them.
Maybe it had never happened to anyone before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you feel reliving all that as you wrote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For one thing, I guess I was taken about how funny this was.
When I was going through it, it didn't seem funny. It was all
extraordinarily painful. In hindsight, though, it was pretty funny.
No one knew what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will your keynote be about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The experiences I recount in the book. About writing the
book. About what it's like to really record a piece of this very
odd history that we've all been experiencing. And I'll make some
predictions about what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the predictions I've been making recently is that
there will be a time when the Internet goes away. It really becomes
transparent. It is part of every business. Every transaction and
part of all aspects of everybody's life. Therefore we don't notice
it anymore. Amazon.com becomes part of the books business. AOL
becomes part of the media.

   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   COXNET-PTECH 0312 -- PCs with the new Pentium III chip from
Intel are on shelves now. These new machines are the fastest yet,
reasonably priced and _ based on early reports _ relatively
bug-free. Just don't buy one. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   FACT BOX -- Facts about the new Pentium III chip.
</P>
<P>
   TECH BRIEFS -- Sports teams have had their own Web sites since
the Internet became popular. Now individual players are taking the
cue. For example, San Antonio Spurs second-year power forward Tim
Duncan has launched http://www.slamduncan.com, known as The
Official Tim Duncan Website. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY -- As soon as they're available in your neighborhood
_ and if you have the money to spare _ get a cable modem and use it
to connect to the Internet. That's what I did a week ago. It made a
big difference, but maybe not in the ways you'd expect. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE LIFE -- This year's hot technology trend is compelling
content from media players such as newspapers, magazines,
television networks and cable companies. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET NOTES -- One of the most popular instruments for
amateur musicians is the guitar. As it turns out, the Web is a
terrific resource for would-be guitar players. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the current week. This
layout is now available.)
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONE-BDAY _ In a way it crept up on us, this love for the
pocket phones you see dangling from belt loops, strapped to waists
or tucked discreetly into vest pockets and purses. The cell phone,
which turns 15 this year, has displaced lots of calls that once
were made on desk phones. Continuing improvements in service and
lower prices assure the public's love affair will grow ever more
meaningful. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH
GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ For many people, the answers are in the stars.
Forget horoscopes and the Academy Awards and go outside tonight and
look up. Those little sparkling points of light _ the stars _ and
those larger lights that do not twinkle _ the planets _ have
provided answers and beauty since the first humans walked the
Earth. To learn about them and enjoy them, you'll find many useful
resources on the Internet. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SCIENCEPROJECTS _ I dread the month of March. It's the
Science Fair project, which can turn the knees of a strong,
normally capable parent into jelly, especially one with multiple
children, which usually means multiple projects. Using a search
engine such as Yahoo! or Excite and the words ``science fair
project,'' or on America Online, ``Science Fair Central,'' you can
quickly find a wealth of resources. (Hill, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ It has been a long time coming but apparently well
worth the wait. At least that is the initial review on the Internet
about 3Com's new Mac software for its PalmPilot line of handheld
computers. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCHER _ The portal site snap.com creates a non-profit area
devoted to the Holocaust to tie in with NBC's showing of
Schindler's List Sunday night. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN I haven't really dabbled in videoconferencing
online since, well, the first time I ever tried dabbling in it.
After installing the equipment and the program, I hooked into a
reflector _ the server where CU-Seeme users log-in _ and was
greeted by a grainy, black-and-white, choppy-but-unmistakably-live
image of a nudemale torso. That was all I needed to send me
scurrying to the tranquil island of ``Myst.'' I never did get
around to hooking up my camcorder ... until now. (Yandel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Readers often write me, thinking that I have some
secret method of shielding them from the invasion that arrives
daily in the mailbox when they log on. There are ways to control
junk mail. And some of them are counter-intuitive. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-KIDS _ The Fairy Tale activity center wasn't magical for
Laura Thompson, our 11-year-old software reviewer. She stopped just
short of calling the CD-ROM program boring and confessed that it
didn't hold her attention for very long. (Davis, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ Not everyone is a ``Chicken Little'' when it comes
to the Millennium bug. Take John F. Mauldin, who has written a book
called, ``How to profit from the Y2K Recession.'' Mauldin is an
investment analyst and self-proclaimed Y2K expert. And in his book
he advocates taking financial advantage of any disruption from the
Millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ A St. Louis company has come up with the software
program for the ultimate control freak. PreNeed funeral planning
software lets you make your own funeral arrangements, from choosing
a funeral director to picking the hue of your headstone. The

<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ It seems like Calendar Creator has been around as
long as there have been computers to run it, and I doubt it's
popularity has ever waned. Calendar Creater is published now by
Broderbund, and just came out in Version 6. I would have to say its
power and versatility have outpaced its ease of use. (Warner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-ANTENNA _ One of the limitations of satellite television
service is that satellite services don't carry local channels. Your
satellite system delivers all kinds of movies, sports and special
interest programming, but if you want to watch your local news,
you're out of luck. TERK Technologies of Commack, N.Y., sells a
line of antennas that solve that problem by attaching directly to
your 18-inch satellite dish and add the local signal to the wiring
you already have for the satellite. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-PRIVACY _ As the Internet blooms, even the most
technophobic among us deals daily with logins, passwords and the
ever-present issue of privacy. But as network technology gets away
from the desktop and the keyboard, a whole new set of privacy
options arise. How will you protect your smart cards, digital
assistants and home networks? (Gallaga, Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-WOLFF-QNA _ Michael Wolff tried to get an Internet business
going way back in the early years of the World Wide Web. He wrote
about his adventures in dealing with venture capitalists, media
barons, old and new, and other Internet gold seekers in a book,
``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet.''

new and old music, Bob Wills is still the king in Texas, musicians
say. Even though rock killed his career (despite his claim that he
was rock before Elvis and before it was dubbed that), he was
posthumously inducted Monday (March 15) into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame. What does Texas swing have to do with rock 'n' roll?
Wills' daughter lives here, Austin's Asleep atthe Wheel is his
never-ending tribute band and Austinites Al Escovedo and JD Gilmore
recently contributed to a new Wills tribute album featuring a bunch
of punk rockers. Is Bob Wills still the king? And why? (McLeese,
Austin American-Statesman). 40. WITH PHOTOS.

   PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   COXNET-PTECH 0312 -- PCs with the new Pentium III chip from
Intel are on shelves now. These new machines are the fastest yet,
reasonably priced and _ based on early reports _ relatively
bug-free. Just don't buy one. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   FACT BOX -- Facts about the new Pentium III chip.
</P>
<P>
   TECH BRIEFS -- Sports teams have had their own Web sites since
the Internet became popular. Now individual players are taking the
cue. For example, San Antonio Spurs second-year power forward Tim
Duncan has launched http://www.slamduncan.com, known as The
Official Tim Duncan Website. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY -- As soon as they're available in your neighborhood
_ and if you have the money to spare _ get a cable modem and use it
to connect to the Internet. That's what I did a week ago. It made a
big difference, but maybe not in the ways you'd expect. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE LIFE -- This year's hot technology trend is compelling
content from media players such as newspapers, magazines,
television networks and cable companies. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET NOTES -- One of the most popular instruments for
amateur musicians is the guitar. As it turns out, the Web is a
terrific resource for would-be guitar players. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the current week. This
layout is now available.)
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONE-BDAY _ In a way it crept up on us, this love for the
pocket phones you see dangling from belt loops, strapped to waists
or tucked discreetly into vest pockets and purses. The cell phone,
which turns 15 this year, has displaced lots of calls that once
were made on desk phones. Continuing improvements in service and
lower prices assure the public's love affair will grow ever more
meaningful. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH
GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CYBERSCENE _ For many people, the answers are in the stars.
Forget horoscopes and the Academy Awards and go outside tonight and
look up. Those little sparkling points of light _ the stars _ and
those larger lights that do not twinkle _ the planets _ have
provided answers and beauty since the first humans walked the
Earth. To learn about them and enjoy them, you'll find many useful
resources on the Internet. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SCIENCEPROJECTS _ I dread the month of March. It's the
Science Fair project, which can turn the knees of a strong,
normally capable parent into jelly, especially one with multiple
children, which usually means multiple projects. Using a search
engine such as Yahoo! or Excite and the words ``science fair
project,'' or on America Online, ``Science Fair Central,'' you can
quickly find a wealth of resources. (Hill, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ It has been a long time coming but apparently well
worth the wait. At least that is the initial review on the Internet
about 3Com's new Mac software for its PalmPilot line of handheld
computers. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETWATCHER _ The portal site snap.com creates a non-profit area
devoted to the Holocaust to tie in with NBC's showing of
Schindler's List Sunday night. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   POWERUSER-COLUMN I haven't really dabbled in videoconferencing
online since, well, the first time I ever tried dabbling in it.
After installing the equipment and the program, I hooked into a
reflector _ the server where CU-Seeme users log-in _ and was
greeted by a grainy, black-and-white, choppy-but-unmistakably-live
image of a nudemale torso. That was all I needed to send me
scurrying to the tranquil island of ``Myst.'' I never did get
around to hooking up my camcorder ... until now. (Yandel, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHNOBUDDY _ Readers often write me, thinking that I have some
secret method of shielding them from the invasion that arrives
daily in the mailbox when they log on. There are ways to control
junk mail. And some of them are counter-intuitive. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-KIDS _ The Fairy Tale activity center wasn't magical for
Laura Thompson, our 11-year-old software reviewer. She stopped just
short of calling the CD-ROM program boring and confessed that it
didn't hold her attention for very long. (Davis, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ Not everyone is a ``Chicken Little'' when it comes
to the Millennium bug. Take John F. Mauldin, who has written a book
called, ``How to profit from the Y2K Recession.'' Mauldin is an
investment analyst and self-proclaimed Y2K expert. And in his book
he advocates taking financial advantage of any disruption from the
Millennium bug. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-REPORT _ A St. Louis company has come up with the software
program for the ultimate control freak. PreNeed funeral planning
software lets you make your own funeral arrangements, from choosing
a funeral director to picking the hue of your headstone. The
program, which retails for $39, is billed as the first funeral
planning product for the PC. (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-TOOLS _ It seems like Calendar Creator has been around as

<P>
   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>

<P>
   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.
</P>

   -----
 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.
</P>

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

A VIRUS BY ANY OTHER NAME IS STILL TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ack! I've been attacked by a killer Trojan worm!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you read that right. We consumers would call it a virus.
But experts in Computing Land say the correct term is either
``Trojan'' or ``worm.'' (I added the ``killer'' part for fun!)
</P>
<P>
   It all started with an innocent session at the computer. I sat
down, signed online and checked my e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, and many times the messages come with
attachments, such as electronic greeting cards or press releases
sent as Word documents.
</P>
<P>
   So I wasn't surprised to see an e-mail waiting for me that
carried an attached file. This one was a small executable program
called ``happy99.exe.''
</P>
<P>
   I detached the file and, just to be safe, scanned it with my
anti-virus software. ``No viruses detected,'' came the message a
couple seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   So, being the trusting individual that I am, I went ahead and
double-clicked happy99.exe. A window opened and I was treated to a
rather nice display of fireworks shooting skyward and exploding.
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough of that, I thought. I closed the window and deleted
happy99.exe.
</P>
<P>
   Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't give it another thought until late Monday, when I again
checked my e-mail. There was an automated message from a City of
Phoenix computer informing me that a message I'd sent to a city
employee had been killed before it was delivered because it
contained a virus.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to make of such an e-mail. But to see what
was happening, I sent myself a test e-mail. Soon it arrived in my
e-mail box. Guess what was attached? You got it. A copy of
happy99.exe.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I hit the Internet, and conducted a search using the
term ``happy99.exe.''
</P>
<P>
   As I quickly learned, this isn't just a fireworks display. This
``Trojan'' or ``worm'' program digs into computer systems, renames
itself and changes settings. Then, each time the infected system is
used to send e-mail or post newsgroup messages, the Trojan/worm
attaches a copy of happy99.exe to the outgoing message.
</P>
<P>
   And all this takes place without the user of the infected system
ever knowing _ unless someone or something (like a city of Phoenix
computer) bonks them over the head and says, in effect, ``Stop
spreading that stupid program!''
</P>
<P>
   Both Symantec, the maker of Norton Anti Virus software, and Data
Fellows call happy99.exe a ``worm.'' Others argue that it's a
``Trojan.'' All seem to agree it's not a ``virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, a virus is a program that can replicate
itself, can cause damage to computer systems and networks and can
attach itself to other programs. A Trojan is a type of virus that
masquerades as a benign application, but doesn't replicate itself.
A worm is a type of virus that can replicate itself but cannot
attach itself to other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it, happy99.exe is a pain.
</P>
<P>
   I believe happy99.exe first reared its ugly head in January.
Reliable documents describing its existance and how to rid it from
infected systems didn't begin appearing online until February.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, happy99.exe is just weeks old, that would explain
why my anti-virus software failed to detect it. To keep up with all
the new viruses, anti-virus software must be updated, something I
hadn't done since October.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, several Web sites include instructions for manually
removing happy99.exe from infected systems. The one I used is at
www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html.
</P>
<P>
   I followed the instructions and removed happy99.exe from my
system. Then I purchased and downloaded a new anti-virus program,
which I immediately updated. When it ran, it discovered and deleted
a piece of happy99.exe that I had missed.
</P>
<P>
   Then I sent e-mails with warnings to people I thought might have
received copies of happy99.exe from me between the initial
infection of my system and the discovery of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   What a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you may be wondering if your system is infected. If so,
send yourself an e-mail to see if anything comes attached.
(Obviously, this will work only if your e-mail service allows you
to receive attachments.) You also can conduct a file search of your
hard drive. If you find happy99.exe, ska.exe, ska.dll or
wsock32.ska, you got it, baby!
</P>
<P>
   And, if anybody sends you e-mail with happy99.exe as an
attachment, just delete it. The havoc occurs only if you execute
the file by double-clicking it. If you see the fireworks window,
you've gone too far, and have infected your system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I've learned my lesson: It's not enough to use
anti-virus software. You must keep it updated. And be careful with
those attachments. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Is no privacy a bug?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now you've probably heard about the privacy flap concerning
the new Intel Pentium III chip. The computing world flew into a
tizzy when it was discovered that an identifier on every Pentium
III could be used to track computer users online.
</P>
<P>
   The latest big ``privacy oops'' comes from Microsoft. It seems
as though the software giant's popular Office 97 software suite
inserts a type of serial number in electronic documents. And the
number, the company recently admitted, can be used to trace
authorship and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, amid a flurry of complaints much like those
endured by Intel, Microsoft announced it planned to offer a
software patch that will prevent Office 97 programs from quietly
adding the identifying number to electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   A software patch? Patches are usually created and distributed to
fix software glitches, or bugs. And bugs are accidental software
problems that are unintended and unwanted. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Apple: Read all about it
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new book is due out this month that details the history, warts
and all, of Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.95 book, ``Apple Confidential _ The Real Story of Apple
Computer Inc.,'' was written by San Francisco freelance writer Owen
Linzmayer and published by No Starch Press.
</P>
<P>
   Apple enthusiasts will recognize Linzmayer's name. He's covered
Apple since 1980, has written articles for just about every major
Macintosh publication and writes a column for ``MacAddict''
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If you've always wanted to read about Apple, from its humble
roots to last year's blockbuster turnaround thanks to the hugely
popular iMac, this would be a great place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Linzmayer details how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started
Apple, how a ``forgotten founder'' walked away from the company and
gave up hundreds of millions of dollars, how Microsoft's dominance
of the software and computing industries affected the company, how
it fared under a variety of chief executive officers and much, much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The book is full of basic facts anyone will appreciate. But it's
also full of interesting extras that Apple fanatics should love.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has several pages of ``Apple insiders'' who
helped launch the company. The list includes what they did and
where they are now. Interestingly, it also displays their actual
signatures, which were chemically etched inside early Macintosh
computers. This was done because Jobs believed the machine was a
piece of art.
</P>
<P>
   So, check out ``Apple Confidential'' if you get a chance. I
found the book well worth the purchase price. &QL;

MERLE HAGGARD FINDS `NEW COUNTRY' TOO SLICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It comes as a surprise to hear Merle Haggard, one of
America's most gifted songwriters, proclaim, ``There's nothing I
hate worse than perfect music.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, what could be more perfect than the heartfelt lyrics
of the country-music standards penned by Haggard over four decades
_ tunes such as ``Big City,'' ``Silver Wings,'' ``Today I Started
Loving You Again'' and ``Workin' Man Blues''?
</P>
<P>
   But there he is, on the phone from his home in northern
California, expressing concern that country music in the '90s has
had its roots polished right out of it.
</P>
<P>
   While talking about Y2K computer fears, of all things, Haggard
segues into his hopes for American music in the new millennium:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we're at a moment of change. Not only are we
going to be changing computers and everything, I think we're gonna
be changing music. If we lose a lot of this electronic necessity,
maybe we'll go back in search of something not quite so perfect,
with a little more humanity involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an Elvis Presley, a Hank Williams or a Jimmie
Rodgers out there, maybe we ought to let him on the air and see
what he sounds like. There's got to be somebody out there, but I
don't think we'd hear him nowadays because he's been refined and
he's been made to play with that same band _ that (begin ital) same
band. (end ital) Oh, my god, I'm so tired of that one drummer I
could shoot him!''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard is referring to the stable of hired studio guns in
Nashville who pop up on a startling number of recordings by various
artists, fostering the homogenized sound known nationwide as ``new
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Upbeat tempos and good-time sounds are the mainstay of new
country.
</P>
<P>
   Good times don't often take center stage in the music of
Haggard, a writer and performer who prefers more realistic material
that's ``unprepared and unrefined.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest emotions and well-crafted stories that paint a picture in
the listener's mind are his trademarks: ``It's like a film. I
always like to look at a song, actually visualize it and see if you
could take a picture that would describe what you're trying to sing
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Poet of the Common Man,'' Haggard has recorded
70-plus albums of tales about hard work, hard times, various states
of romance and folks who ``drink a little beer in the tavern'' on
payday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the talent that moves musicians such as Alabama's
Randy Owen to call him ``without a doubt the greatest singer,
songwriter, artist that has ever been,'' Haggard quietly replies:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I think it's probably a gift. Then you cultivate
it and hone it in as a craft. Then you become hooked on it and then
maybe you have a little success, and then you're absolutely
spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a little success _ including 40 No. 1 hits and
induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame _ and years of
grueling tours (for which he seemingly wrote his own soundtrack
with such classics as ``Ramblin' Fever''), Haggard, 61, has shifted
into a lower gear, spending as much time as he can with his sixth
wife, Theresa, and their two young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theresa and Bennie and Janessa and the life that I have now is
the greatest period I've ever experienced in my life,'' he says.
``I've got a nice houseboat there (at Lake Shasta), and I've got a
studio here close by. . . . It rains a lot up here. That's low
pressure, and low pressure is good for recording. . . . On a
postcard day, the music sounds a little brittle.''
</P>
<P>
   His music has mellowed, embracing hints of Dixieland, jazz and
blues and losing the grit of early hits like ``Branded Man'' and
``Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink,'' as have his politics.
Befriended by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in years gone by,
Haggar d is more apt to be hanging out with tree-huggers these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to stay clear of politics and remind myself that that's
not my chair. I'm an entertainer. I entertain both Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to sit myself out there somewhere as a citizen. And
I did go down to the steps of the state Capitol in protest of
cutting down these giant redwoods up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a man in Texas that owns these things named (Charles)
Hurwitz. I think he's a terrible man; I think he represents the
evil side very well. . . . Somebody said, `Why don't you go out
there and look at those trees before you cut them down?' And he
said, `I don't have to take a look at them; I own them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's don't sell Niagara Falls,'' Haggard added.
</P>
<P>
   Let's don't sell Yosemite Falls or Mount Rushmore or Old
Faithful _ and let's don't sell these damn trees up here!''
</P>
<P>
   (It now appears the redwoods will be saved under a deal approved
this month between the California and federal governments and
Hurwitz's Pacific Lumber Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the state of the nation he has shown such love for
in songs like ``Fightin' Side of Me,'' Haggard chuckles, ``I'll let
you know right after Y2K. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The prognosis for the next few months is so unsteady. It's
like everybody's on quicksand. . . . Having built such a society on
electronics, and here all of a sudden, we may have to go back to
wood stoves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's got half their mind on what they're doing
and half their mind on what they think they should be getting ready
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard is getting ready for the release of a second
autobiographical book, with Paramount Pictures negotiating for the
film rights, as well as a third gospel album and a new mainstream
record.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Haggard remains _ to put it in his humble words
_ a man in search of ``a melody that hopefully will be recognizable
should somebody want to whistle it.''  &QL;

FINAL CHAPTER IN STORIED SAGA OF BRAHMIN BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG AND CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The announcement that BankBoston Corp. will be acquired
culminates a storied 215-year history for an institution started by
Yankee merchants and shipowners.
</P>
<P>
   America's first independent bank, which has agreed to be
purchased by Fleet Financial Group, was a sleepy Brahmin
institution for much of its first century. Yet in modern times,
BankBoston produced some innovations that made it stand out among
regional banks: establishing a beachhead in Latin America and
becoming an influential, behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Known as The Massachusetts Bank, it was started in 1784 with
$255,500 in capital to provide loans, bank notes, and deposit
services to Boston business owners who wanted their own institution
instead of depending on British banks.
</P>
<P>
   Following some of its customers in the wool and coffee trade,
BankBoston opened operations in Argentina and Brazil in the early
1900s. Today, Latin America accounts for 20 percent of the bank's
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the bank's flirtation with the silver screen. In
the 1930s, financial institutions were reluctant to lend to
Hollywood studios or to bankroll movies.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Serge Semenenko, who had landed a job at the bank despite
a flamboyant persona and a lack of pedigreed Yankees on his family
tree. Semenenko, a senior executive, was the bank's Hollywood
connection. Like his stuffy peers, he loved yachts. But unlike
them, he insisted on crewing his boats with chorus girls, putting
many a Hub bluenose out of joint. His Hollywood deals made so much
money for the bank that all was forgiven. In the 1950s, Semenenko
helped the bank buy a roughly 30 percent stake in Warner Brothers
Studio.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, BankBoston emerged as the region's premier bank,
eclipsing Shawmut Bank of Boston. And as the nation headed into
World War II, BankBoston was the 10th largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, however, banking was being transformed by
changes in federal law that accelerated the pace of consolidation.
By 1984, BankBoston had slipped to 20th place among the nation's
largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Social changes had occurred as well. No longer was the bank the
exclusive club of well-heeled Ivy Leaguers. First a Southerner,
William L. Brown, was brought in to run the place. And, later, Ira
Stepanian, the son of an Armenian immigrant who sold cigars, took
over as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other local banks, BankBoston was hurt by the collapse
in the real estate market in the late 1980s. It reported a $395
million loss in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Such losses meant the bank had to implement huge layoffs. Not
long afterward, in 1991, Bank of Boston stock hit an all-time low
of $3 a share. On Friday, its shares closed at just under $47, a
figure made more impressive by the fact that the stock split in
June.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, BankBoston was known as an institution
that specialized in serving large commercial customers. Among other
things, it was noted for nurturing Raytheon Co.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the few regional banks with a substantial overseas
presence, BankBoston has experienced its share of international
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For more than seven decades, it has operated in Latin America,
opening an office in Buenos Aires in 1917. It has strong operations
in Brazil _ a country whose economic uncertainties have affected
the bank's recent financial results.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston also spent 37 years in Cuba, where it had six
branches before Fidel Castro suspended operations in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1990s, Bank of Boston chose to expand
deeper into consumer banking and small-business lending, largely
through the purchases of smaller banks, including BayBanks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BankBoston's headquarters were undergoing a major
transformation. The US banking industry faced increased competition
for customers and loans by other institutions, such as mortgage
companies and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, it had become clear that BankBoston either had
to grow by acquiring a rival bank or run the risk of being acquired
itself, possibly by a giant bank from outside the region. When
Fleet acquired Shawmut National Corp. in 1995, its position as the
largest bank in the region was fortified.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Stepanian seemed reluctant to make a deal that could take
the bank to the next level. So the bank's board of directors
pressured him to resign and turned to Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford,
who promptly engineered the acquisition of BayBanks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of New England's second and third-largest banks
pushed BankBoston to new prominence. In the process, the bank,
which had been known as Bank of Boston, dropped the ``of'' from its
name and became known as BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, BankBoston acquired Robertson Stephens, a San
Francisco-based investment firm that enables the bank to underwrite
the public stock offerings of technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gifford seems on the verge of making the biggest deal of his
career by selling his institution to Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   What will that mean? One possible scenario is that a bank with a
storied history will see its name disappear into the history books.
And Gifford will likely be remembered as a man who didn't sell his
bank to an outsider but to a hometown rival.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a certain irony in the purchase of BankBoston. A
Boston Globe story in 1984 noted that BankBoston was such a redoubt
of Brahmins that it didn't hire its first Irish-American employees
until World War II. Now it will be acquired by Fleet, headed by
prominent Irish-American businessman J. Terrence Murray.

INVESTOR BELIEVES ADVISER GAVE SOME BAD ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 38, and until October 1997 I had my entire IRA of
$100,000 invested in Fidelity funds, with 40 percent in Magellan,
30 percent in Blue Chip Stock, and 30 percent in Low-Priced Stock
funds. An American Express/IDS financial adviser told me I was not
following the proper asset allocation rules and said I would be
better off in the long run if I took his advice. So I transferred
the entire balance, putting 8 percent in IDS Strategy Aggressive
Growth, 17 percent in IDS Research Opportunities, 10 percent in IDS
Global Bond, 27 percent in IDS Growth, 8 percent in IDS Extra
Income, 11 percent in IDS Emerging Markets, 11 percent in IDS Small
Company Index, and 8 percent in IDS International funds. All
positions are in Class B shares. I recently did some research and
realized that most of these funds are not performing well relative
to their peers. Did I make a mistake? I don't like the fact that he
is only investing in IDS funds. I want to go back to my old way of
investing, which was to depend on Morningstar reports to help me
pick the funds myself. Should I go it alone?
</P>
<P>
   L.N., Boxford, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Your feeling that the portfolio as a whole has performed
relatively poorly is justified. But the question is: How much do
you want to pay to dig yourself out of this problem?
</P>
<P>
   Since you bought Class B shares, you will face redemption fees
if you sold at this point. So you might want to consider which
funds are performing the best, and which alternative IDS funds you
might transfer into without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin, though, with a discussion of asset allocation. I
believe asset allocation is a moving target, and what is a
well-allocated portfolio for a 38-year-old is quite unsuitable for
a 68-year-old, and vice versa. Given that this is all retirement
money, your two bond funds are inappropriate at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   As I calculate your current portfolio, it works out to 52
percent in traditional growth vehicles (Strategy Aggressive,
Research Opportunities, and Growth), 19 percent international
(International and Emerging Markets), 18 percent in fixed-income
(Global Bond and Extra Income), and 11 percent small cap. I have no
problem with the growth segment, but I find the international
position a bit too large and too risky.
</P>
<P>
   I would consolidate the two international positions into IDS
International. At some point you might want to risk money on
emerging markets, but the time isn't now.
</P>
<P>
   I would move the money that's in IDS Strategy Aggressive to IDS
New Dimensions, which is the group's only fund rated five stars by
Morningstar). And I would leave the Growth and Research
Opportunities positions as is.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining 29 percent, I would bite my tongue and
withdraw, despite the exit fees. I would then go to Vanguard and
divide the money evenly between Vanguard Small-Cap Index and
Vanguard Specialized Health Care funds.
</P>
<P>
   Why swap one small-cap index fund for another, especially if it
will cost you a redemption fee? Look at the 18.31 percent 52-week
loss for IDS Small-Cap Index fund as reported by Lipper Analytical
Services as of Feb. 25, and then compare it with the 14.23 percent
loss for Vanguard Small-Cap Index for the same period, and you have
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   As for future IRA contributions, you would probably do better by
following your former practice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Correction: I recenlty incorrectly calculated the effects of
retaining a CD as an alternative to paying off a $59,000 7.125
percent mortgage for J.J. of Sharon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In my calculations, I omitted a critical step _ subtracting the
taxes that would be due on the money earned by a 6.13 percent
$59,000 CD, a matter of $1,012.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the difference between the cost of the interest of $4,203
a year and the after-tax return from the CD accounts, plus the tax
benefit from the deductibility of the interest payments ($3,781),
is $422.

A STUNNING DECADE CAPS 200 YEARS OF SLEEPY GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- It is one measure of an astonishing decade of deal
making by Fleet Financial Group: Of the 10 biggest banks in New
England in 1987, Fleet will own eight of them once it acquires
BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston is the biggest prize of them all for Fleet, which has
long had its eye on its cross-town rival. The $16 billion proposed
deal with BankBoston, announced Sunday, caps a string of
acquisitions in which Fleet has grown from a Rhode Island-chartered
bank to a powerful competitor on the national _ and now
international _ stage.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's savvy isn't obvious to many, said L. William Seidman,
who was once the nation's chief bank regulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the best banks, very few people mention
Fleet,'' he said. But, he added, Fleet was quietly ``doing things
one small piece at a time. They weren't in an exciting area, and
they didn't make any blockbuster deals.''
</P>
<P>
   If the acquisition of BankBoston is completed, Fleet, under
chief executive officer J. Terrence Murray, would become the
nation's eighth-largest banking company.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's scorching trail of acquisitions ranges from a 1986
takeover of tiny Hartford Merrill Bankshares in Bangor, Maine, to
two larger deals in rapid succession _ Shawmut National Corp. and
NatWest Bancorp. _ that doubled Fleet's size in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Of banks that ranked in the top 10 in New England a decade ago,
only State Street Corp., US Trust, and Fleet have remained
independent. The rest were acquired by either Fleet or BankBoston,
and if the pending deal is approved, they will be combined into one
company: Fleet Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet says its lineage reaches back to 1791, when merchant John
Brown formed Providence Bank to help underwrite the expansion of
American manufacturing. By 1954, Fleet had merged with another
Rhode Island bank to become Industrial National Bank, which a
young, scrappy Terry Murray would join in the 1960s. By the end of
that decade, the bank _ now called Industrial Bancorp _ had become
one of the first US bank holding firms listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company signaled its intention to make sweeping changes in
1982, when it hired consultants to develop a new name that conveyed
a more sophisticated image. They chose Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murray has had a very clear vision for his company since the
early 1980s,'' said Nancy Bush, senior vice president of Ryan, Beck
&AMP; Co. in Livingston, N.J. He was ``interrupted by the real estate
debacle in the late 1980s,'' Bush said, ``but in the midst of all
this, he has known where he wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, another deal set the stage for expansion throughout New
England. In its first bank acquisition outside Rhode Island, Fleet
agreed to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping deregulation of banking threw open the doors to
interstate banking in the mid-1980s, Fleet expanded its franchise
across New England. That led to purchases of smaller Maine and
Connecticut banks and creation of one of the nation's top 20
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's deals grew in size. In 1988, Fleet Financial merged with
New York-based Norstar Bancorp, transforming the newly named
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group into a $25 billion bank. By 1990,
Fleet was 14th in US bank rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Fleet's blockbuster deals was its 1991 acquisition of
the failed Bank of New England, then the region's second-biggest
banking company. Fleet bid aggressively, in partnership with the
savvy Wall Street investment firm Kohlberg Kravis &AMP; Roberts. The
deal gave Fleet a huge presence in Massachusetts _ and showed it
could outbid the premier bank in Boston, then called Bank of Boston
Corp. It would not be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Fleet purchased Massachusetts' largest savings bank,
NBB Bancorp, for $437 million.
</P>
<P>
   As it has grown, Fleet also acquired a reputation for being
tough _ some would say cold-hearted. In 1994, the company launched
a program _ called Fleet Focus _ to slash costs and cut more than
3,000 jobs in the name of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Fleet again moved aggressively to block BankBoston from
another attempted merger _ this time with Shawmut National Corp.
After merger talks between BankBoston and Shawmut fell apart, Fleet
stepped in and acquired Shawmut for $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Shawmut, Fleet inherited a number of high-profile
sports franchises in Boston _ getting its name on the new Boston
Garden and becoming banker to the Boston Celtics and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet established itself as a true Boston institution when it
moved its headquarters to Boston from Providence after acquiring
Shawmut. It soon had $80 billion in financial muscle behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Fleet acquired New Jersey-based Natwest, expanding its
reach south to New Jersey and bulking up Natwest's upstart New York
operations. The combination of Fleet, Shawmut, and Natwest put it
in league with other super-regional US banks.

NEXT CHALLENGE: GETTING THE DEAL PAST THE GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The combination of Fleet Financial Group and
BankBoston Corp. will create an 800-pound gorilla in New England
banking.
</P>
<P>
   The gorilla, however, will have to lose some weight before the
deal is done.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks now operate about 1,500 branches throughout the
Northeast, with deposits of about $110 billion. Sources familiar
with the negotiations said the combined entity will have to sell
about $13 billion worth of deposits to other banks to satisfy
regulators. The regulatory concern is a basic one: The government
doesn't want one bank dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management of these companies are not pursuing this deal
with the intention of the Feds blocking it,'' said Gerard Cassidy,
a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony. Cassidy, as well as other bank
specialists, expressed confidence that a good-size sale would allow
the merger to pass regulatory muster.
</P>
<P>
   If history is a guide, the merging banks will sell off deposits
and branches in areas where their combined market share is above
the level regulators are willing to tolerate. The banks will also
have to sell loans, including thousands of commercial loans. By the
time the deal is concluded, a large number of local bank customers
will wake up to find they are doing business with a new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have a complicated index that measures market
share and sets limits on what percentage of the market one bank may
control. Analysts Sunday speculated that sell-offs would be
necessary in Providence, Hartford, and around Boston, where the
overlap between the two banks is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Under Massachusetts law, no bank may control more than 30
percent of deposits statewide. At the moment the two banks have an
estimated $40 billion in deposits, or nearly 40 percent of the
statewide total, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Danielson, a bank consultant based in Rockville, Md.,
estimated the banks would have to sell $8 billion to $10 billion
worth of deposits in Greater Boston alone. ``That's going to be a
big bite for some other banks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just who will get those deposits was a matter of considerable
speculation Sunday. Under one scenario, some large national bank
could buy the deposits as a way of establishing a foothold in New
England. The names mentioned most often were First Union Corp. and
BankAmerica Corp., both of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said, however, that Fleet would probably do anything
it could to prevent another big bank from entering New England. He
said it was more likely that Fleet would sell deposits to smaller,
local competitors such as Citizens Financial Group, based in
Providence; UST Corp. in Boston; or People's Heritage Financial
Group of Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gallagher, a New Hampshire lawyer who handles banking
matters, agreed any sales are likely to be local ones. ``This could
be a chance for some medium-sized banks to expand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is quite a bit of precedent for such divestitures. In
1996, after it purchased BayBanks Inc., BankBoston sold a large
number of branches to UST Corp., a deal that allowed the smaller
bank to beef up its presence. In that case regulators insisted the
sale be made to one bank that could become a legitimate competitor
in the Boston market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust guys will dictate who the winner is here,'' said
one local banker Sunday, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When Fleet bought Shawmut National Corp. in 1995 it spun off
some Rhode Island branches into a new bank called the Bank of Rhode
Island. A Fleet sell-off to seal the deal with BankBoston would be
far greater in size than any of those previous deals, analysts
said.

OPPOSITES JOIN IN UNCERTAIN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They are talked about on a first-name basis in every
part of town, the last of Boston's banking giants. Terry and Chad.
Intensely competitive and occasionally combative, they exchanged
public smiles that were hard to really believe.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Financial Group's blockbuster agreement to acquire
BankBoston Corp. is very much a story of Fleet chief Terry Murray
and BankBoston chief executive Chad Gifford. They were the people
who made the deal happen, but Murray and Gifford also personify
corporate cultures that are miles apart and may prove hard to
blend.
</P>
<P>
   Murray built Fleet and its culture from the ground up:
hard-nosed and sometimes ruthless. But more than anything else,
they are opportunistic and creative. Murray and Fleet were thinking
outside the box years before the concept ever filtered into the
banking world.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford spent most of his career inside BankBoston, where a
culture was firmly in place long before his arrival. Powerful and
patrician, with deep Yankee roots, it had a blue-chip reputation
but slow reflexes that were becoming a dangerous limitation in
modern banking. Gifford, by the time he took over as chief
executive in 1995, tried to balance BankBoston's heritage with a
faster pace. Results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   About town, Gifford and BankBoston seemed at home in the civic
role of an important city institution, almost hammy at times.
Murray and Fleet made their appearances, but seem much more
interested in sticking to business. That was what they were there
to do.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, Sunday's news was a gracious compromise on the
important issues. But was it?
</P>
<P>
   The new name promoted Sunday, Fleet Boston Corp., is a blend of
their corporate identities (memo to Chad: Remember when you told
Bill Crozier his merger would result in BayBanks of Boston? Not for
long, after the ``consultants'' worked it over.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the magnanimous arrangement for Murray to step
down in two years and let Gifford run the firm (another memo to
Chad: Don't forget that BankAmerica chief David Coulter had the
same kind of deal with NationsBank and was pushed out within a
year).
</P>
<P>
   The question remains today: Can these guys get along and can
their companies be put together without punches flying?
</P>
<P>
   Murray started his business career at a small and obscure bank,
Industrial National Bank, after a Providence competitor, Rhode
Island Hospital Trust, turned him down for a job. As the story
goes, the bad news at RIHT came from Clarence Gifford, Chad's
father and the head of Hospital Trust for nine years (no hard
feelings: Murray sent flowers to Clarence Gifford when he was
recently hospitalized).
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to overstate the preeminance of what was called Bank
of Boston in those early days. It ruled New England like no other
banking company: the biggest, the most profitable, and
unquestionably the best. That is what makes the deal announced
Sunday the leading and perhaps ultimate triumph of the Fleet
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial National had changed its name to Fleet before it
struck a series of innovative deals that would build the bank into
a giant. Murray bought Norstar Bancorp of Albany, N.Y., in 1988 and
agreed to give up the top job temporarily. In the dawn of
interstate banking, New England institutions trembled at the
prospect of buyers from New York too big to fend off. No one had
ever considered going the other way, buying a bank outside the
region.
</P>
<P>
   When the failed Bank of New England Corp. was put up for
auction, BankAmerica Corp. and Bank of Boston Corp. rustled up
offers.
</P>
<P>
   The third bidder, Murray, understood the desperation of
regulators to inject outside capital into a staggered banking
system and found a way to engage them. He brought the famous
private investment firm Kolhberg Kravis &AMP; Roberts to the table as
his money partner and scored the coup that truly put Fleet on the
map.
</P>
<P>
   Later still, Murray stepped in the moment merger negotiations
between BankBoston and Shawmut National Corp.'s Joel Alvord
faltered. What was nearly a big victory turned into a grating
setback for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the events that helped propel Gifford into the top
job at BankBoston, succeeding Ira Stepanian. Right or wrong, the
perception of BankBoston was becoming one of an institution that
was stuck in the mud. Serious suitors called on BankBoston but
those deals fell apart too.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford made his mark quickly by striking a deal to acquire
BayBanks Inc., an important purchase that improved the company's
retail business.
</P>
<P>
   But other moves, like the purchase of investment banking firm
Robertson Stephens Inc., proved to be too expensive to justify, at
least in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter, at least through much of 1998. BankBoston's
strong Latin American business was a story that drove the company's
stock to new heights. But the stock slumped when the world's
emerging markets, including Brazil, took a tumble. BankBoston was
becoming dangerously vulnerable to an unwanted takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to join Fleet instead is surely the biggest of
Gifford's career. But making it work, and ending up on top of
Boston's surviving banking giant, is still a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Count Sunday as a victory for the culture of Terry Murray and
Fleet.

THOUSANDS IN REGION ARE EXPECTED TO LOSE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The joining of Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston
Corp. will result in the layoffs of 4,000 to 5,000 employees across
the region, one of the biggest hits to the local banking industry
in years, sources close to the deal say.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 60,000 people now work for the two banks worldwide, many
of them employed at BankBoston's 427 branches or at one of the
1,150 branches Fleet operates across the Northeast. Senior company
executives said the banks would close about 24 branches, and many
other locations would be sold off to satisfy antitrust regulators
concerned about preserving competition in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks have been shedding jobs for years, as a wave of
consolidations and mergers has swept through the industry
nationally. Fleet laid off nearly 6,000 people between 1993 and
1996 after it absorbed the failed Bank of New England and other
banks, and instituted a cost-saving program. The 1996 merger of
BayBanks Inc. and BankBoston resulted in the elimination of 2,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts said the banks can avoid panic among their
staffs by providing specifics on job-cutting early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should definitely try to dispel excessive fears within
the two organizations, but people must also know that cuts are
coming,'' said Laurent Jacque, a professor of international finance
and banking at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second smart thing to do would be to make the
announcement, and make sure that the people they really want to
keep will know quickly that they are part of the merger no matter
what happens,'' Jacque said. ``Some banks do that very well. They
are smart, and they are swift in their approach to senior managers
and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has been criticized in the past for its heavy-handed
approach to layoffs. By contrast, the job cuts that BankBoston
instituted after the BayBanks merger were praised for their
sensitivity. Workers received extra pay based on years of service
and salary levels, and retirement and financial counseling were
made available. Both banks also agreed to help employees establish
businesses on their own. In addition, the two banks provided
six-month stipends to allow some former employees to participate in
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Among the employees mostly likely to be affected by layoffs are
workers in Boston, Hartford, and Providence, cities with the
highest concentration of BankBoston and Fleet employees and the
most overlap. Analysts said cuts would come from branch
consolidations, and the combination of back-office operations, with
a focus on human resources, accounting, advertising, marketing,
processing, mortgage loans, and account deposits.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, ATM machines, and electronic transfers
playing a greater role in banking, the two banks probably will
reduce brick-and-mortar operations. At the same time, the combined
institution is likely to hire more information technology workers
as its reliance on new technology increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within five years, in fact, a more significant percentage of
banking will be done on the Internet,'' Jacque said. Fleet and
BankBoston, he said, ``will be looking at cutting fixed costs, and
a big chunk of those costs will be branches.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which comes a year after an attempt to reach a
similar deal failed, combines New England's two largest financial
institutions into one megafirm that will be required to divest a
significant portion of its holdings in order to satisfy antitrust
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the merger enables BankBoston and Fleet to become stronger
competitors in the financial market, it could ultimately mean more
jobs and better jobs,'' said former US Secretary of Labor Robert
Reich, a professor of economic and social policy at Brandeis
Universtiy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news,'' Reich added, ``is that in the short term,
there is likely to be hardship for some people. Undoubtedly, some
will be let go, including a number of middle-level managers. They
are the ones who are often seen as most redundant when mergers take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This continues the trend of mergers that we have seen over the
past year of very, very big bank deals,'' said Lisa Lynch, a
professor of international economics at the Fletcher School. ``We
can expect that there will be a lot of anxiety within Fleet and
BankBoston about what this merger will mean to employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet-BankBoston merger is part of a string of marriages
that have swept through the industry in an ongoing push to create
large national and international banks that can compete worldwide.
As a result, bank layoffs have been widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp., for example, the nation's third-largest
bank, has announced the layoff of 4,500 workers, or 6.5 percent of
its employees, since a 1996 merger with Chemical Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanhwile, the marriage of Bank One Corp. and First Chicago NBD
Corp., announced nearly a year ago, has reduced the companies'
combined work force of 100,000 by about 1,000 employees. More
layoffs are expected.
</P>
<P>
   At BankAmerica Corp., which confirmed earlier this year that it
will eliminate and restructure jobs, as many as 18,000 positions,
or 10 percent of the work force, will be laid off or transferred in
the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   For anxious workers at both banks, the health of the American
economy provides some comfort. ``The good news (for Fleet and
BankBoston employees) is that the economy is so strong that if you
lose a job, there is always the possibility of finding five
others,'' noted Jacque. ``So, if you are loan officer in your 30s,
no big deal. If, however, you are in your 50s, there could be
difficulties.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A hostile takeover in France? And not of one company but two?
And in the banking industry at that, where deals are made over long
lunches after a nod from the finance ministry? Something is going
on.
</P>
<P>
   BNP, which, on March 10, bid for Paribas and Societe Generale to
create a bank that would be worth FFr340 billion ($56 billion),
would have you believe that this something is a restructuring of
the French banking system.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is the transaction the market has been waiting for,'' said
the bank. No it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   There will be many who say that the simple fact of a hostile bid
is remarkable in itself in a country where such things are as rare
as a bottle of 1928 Chateau Petrus.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore, for a moment, that hostile takeovers in banking are
unlikely to work, and that attempting two at once is, shall we say,
ambitious. This is a hostile takeover with little rationale, and
even less hostility.
</P>
<P>
   BNP promises to sack nobody (costs will cut through natural
attrition), close no branches, and keep all the banks' brands
intact. So what is the point?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps BNP felt left out: it courted Societe Generale
unsuccessfully for two years only to see the bank fall into the
arms of Paribas. Perhaps it felt desperate: its investment-banking
business has been poor; with Paribas and SocGen on board it might
rise to mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspicion is that BNP wants to be too big to be taken
over, and that it would relish the title of national champion of
French banking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this deal fails to come off (and it is still a long way
from succeeding), it will lead to talk of the long-overdue
consolidation in European banking now that the euro is here.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is certainly needed. Europe has too many
unprofitable banks with too many branches _ as it happens, twice as
many branches per head as in America. Sadly, however, what this bid
tells you is not how much consolidation there will be, but how
little.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for a start, hard for European banks to merge. Germany
and to a lesser extent France and Italy are dominated by mutually
owned and state-owned institutions. In Germany, three-quarters of

<P>
   A hostile takeover in France? And not of one company but two?
And in the banking industry at that, where deals are made over long
lunches after a nod from the finance ministry? Something is going
on.
</P>
<P>
   BNP, which, on March 10, bid for Paribas and Societe Generale to
create a bank that would be worth FFr340 billion ($56 billion),
would have you believe that this something is a restructuring of
the French banking system.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is the transaction the market has been waiting for,'' said
the bank. No it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   There will be many who say that the simple fact of a hostile bid
is remarkable in itself in a country where such things are as rare
as a bottle of 1928 Chateau Petrus.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore, for a moment, that hostile takeovers in banking are
unlikely to work, and that attempting two at once is, shall we say,
ambitious. This is a hostile takeover with little rationale, and
even less hostility.
</P>
<P>
   BNP promises to sack nobody (costs will cut through natural
attrition), close no branches, and keep all the banks' brands
intact. So what is the point?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps BNP felt left out: it courted Societe Generale
unsuccessfully for two years only to see the bank fall into the
arms of Paribas. Perhaps it felt desperate: its investment-banking
business has been poor; with Paribas and SocGen on board it might
rise to mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   But the suspicion is that BNP wants to be too big to be taken
over, and that it would relish the title of national champion of
French banking.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this deal fails to come off (and it is still a long way
from succeeding), it will lead to talk of the long-overdue
consolidation in European banking now that the euro is here.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation is certainly needed. Europe has too many
unprofitable banks with too many branches _ as it happens, twice as
many branches per head as in America. Sadly, however, what this bid
tells you is not how much consolidation there will be, but how
little.
</P>
<P>
   It is, for a start, hard for European banks to merge. Germany
and to a lesser extent France and Italy are dominated by mutually
owned and state-owned institutions. In Germany, three-quarters of
the banking market is in the hands of such banks.
</P>
<P>
   Unless countries privatize and mutuals convert into stockholding
companies, the scope for consolidation is limited.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a European, the agenda for this year's Ides of March
should make you gulp.
</P>
<P>
   This coming Monday, March 15, is the day when a committee of
investigators will say whether it thinks that members of the
European Commission have been culpably careless with the taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
   More worryingly, in the wider world, it is also the day when the
Kosovo negotiations begin again, and Europeans will have to decide
whether they are ready to be as tough as Americans with Slobodan
Milosevic in order to get Serbia off the Kosovars' backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, to rub home the transatlantic point, the World Trade
Organization will on Monday be expecting both Europe and America to
show some sign of willingness to settle the blush-making banana
war, which Europe started but the Americans have now made sharply
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the Ides, indeed. It is not surprising that on both sides
of the Atlantic the glummer sort of ``realist'' _ the sort whose
``realism'' is based on looking backward rather than forward _ is
predicting the end of the Euro-American partnership that repeatedly
saved the 20th century from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold-War solitary American superpower, say many
Europeans, has to be held in check, lest it create an unacceptably
Americanized world.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty dollar needs to be balanced by the gallant young
euro. The spread of American popular culture must be slowed, even
if it is popular outside America too.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should be discouraged from demonizing Iran (here
America's critics may be right, if last month's local elections in
Iran further strengthen President Khatami's liberalizing hand).
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should also stop bombing the armory of Saddam
Hussein's praetorian guard (but here the critics are wrong, unless
they can come up with a better way of bringing a
germ-warfare-capable Iraq back under sane leadership).
</P>
<P>
   What many of these Europeans do not realize is that their
grumblings are drowned by the growlings of frustrated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Bosnia's agonies were prolonged by the
Europeans' unwillingness to recognize that a just peace required
the serious threat of force (and that the same thing could yet go
wrong in Kosovo); or that the banana war began with Europe's
reluctance to respect the rules of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritic economy of continental Europe, say angry
Americans, leaves it to them to bear most of the burden of helping
recession-hit Asia and Latin America, by buying more imports from
these regions and thereby making their own trade deficit even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, though richer than the United States,
provides a tiny and diminishing proportion of the high-tech
military equipment that NATO depends on if it is to be able to
fight wars without an intolerable number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Europe no longer has to worry about Hitler's Germany or
a communist Russia, conclude these exasperated Americans, Europe
can be left to its own devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep structural forces,'' says Stephen Walt in the current
issue of the National Interest, are ``beginning to pull Europe and
America apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sky is not quite that black: a few gleams of
sunshine peer through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of NATO goes ahead this spring without any of the
awful consequences _ an uncontrollably furious Russia, a sharp
increase in the democracies' defense budgets _ that the pessimists
had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The continued American and British bombing of Iraq has not been
supported by other Europeans but neither have they (or most Arabs,
be it noted) strongly objected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the gloomsters could yet prove right. The Atlantic
alliance may indeed collapse, unless both Europeans and Americans
look forward rather than backward: unless they base their plans not
on memories of the past 50 years but on a reasonable calculation of
what the next 50 years will bring.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were indeed going to remain the world's
only great power as far ahead as the eye can see, people who like
this newspaper believe in the danger of monopoly and the need for
competition would draw the necessary conclusion: Europe should
provide a counterbalance to this overwhelming American power.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not in fact what the future really holds. If the
European part of NATO raises its eyes beyond its own borders, and
sees what will probably happen out there in the next generation or
so, it will understand why it still needs America and _ even more
important _ why America increasingly needs Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The one-superpower world will not last. Within the next couple
of decades a China with up to 1 billion people, a strongly growing
economy and probably a still-authoritarian government will almost
certainly be trying to push its interests eastward into the Pacific
and westward into Central Asia, whose oil and gas this energy-poor
China will badly need.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later some strong and honest man will pull
post-Yeltsin Russia together, and another contender for global
influence will have reappeared on the scene (unless fear of China
sends a horrified Russia running into NATO's arms).
</P>
<P>
   The Islamist superpower that nervous people predicted a few
years ago will probably never come into being, but the Muslim world
will certainly continue to produce localized explosions of
ideological wrath and geopolitical envy.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the alliance of the democracies needs not only new
members but also a new purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance can no longer be just a protective American arm
around Europe's shoulder; it also has to be a way for Europe and
America to work together in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And those who hope to construct a politically united Europe
should recognize that this must be done _ if it can be done at all
_ in partnership with America, not to separate Europe from America.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO was what NATO seems to Cold-War nostalgics, how soon
we'd drop her. But, as Kipling would be the first to explain, it
ain't.
</P>
<P>
   A new Atlantic partnership will be more than the Cold-War NATO.
Through the squabbling about bananas and the head-scratching about
Kosovo, the shape of a 21st-century alliance of the democracies at
last begins to emerge. &QL;

Kosovo negotiations begin again, and Europeans will have to decide
whether they are ready to be as tough as Americans with Slobodan
Milosevic in order to get Serbia off the Kosovars' backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, to rub home the transatlantic point, the World Trade
Organization will on Monday be expecting both Europe and America to
show some sign of willingness to settle the blush-making banana
war, which Europe started but the Americans have now made sharply
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Beware the Ides, indeed. It is not surprising that on both sides
of the Atlantic the glummer sort of ``realist'' _ the sort whose
``realism'' is based on looking backward rather than forward _ is
predicting the end of the Euro-American partnership that repeatedly
saved the 20th century from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Cold-War solitary American superpower, say many
Europeans, has to be held in check, lest it create an unacceptably
Americanized world.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty dollar needs to be balanced by the gallant young
euro. The spread of American popular culture must be slowed, even
if it is popular outside America too.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should be discouraged from demonizing Iran (here
America's critics may be right, if last month's local elections in
Iran further strengthen President Khatami's liberalizing hand).
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should also stop bombing the armory of Saddam
Hussein's praetorian guard (but here the critics are wrong, unless
they can come up with a better way of bringing a
germ-warfare-capable Iraq back under sane leadership).
</P>
<P>
   What many of these Europeans do not realize is that their
grumblings are drowned by the growlings of frustrated Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that Bosnia's agonies were prolonged by the
Europeans' unwillingness to recognize that a just peace required
the serious threat of force (and that the same thing could yet go
wrong in Kosovo); or that the banana war began with Europe's
reluctance to respect the rules of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritic economy of continental Europe, say angry
Americans, leaves it to them to bear most of the burden of helping
recession-hit Asia and Latin America, by buying more imports from
these regions and thereby making their own trade deficit even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, though richer than the United States,
provides a tiny and diminishing proportion of the high-tech
military equipment that NATO depends on if it is to be able to
fight wars without an intolerable number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Europe no longer has to worry about Hitler's Germany or
a communist Russia, conclude these exasperated Americans, Europe
can be left to its own devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep structural forces,'' says Stephen Walt in the current
issue of the National Interest, are ``beginning to pull Europe and
America apart.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sky is not quite that black: a few gleams of
sunshine peer through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of NATO goes ahead this spring without any of the
awful consequences _ an uncontrollably furious Russia, a sharp
increase in the democracies' defense budgets _ that the pessimists
had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The continued American and British bombing of Iraq has not been
supported by other Europeans but neither have they (or most Arabs,
be it noted) strongly objected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the gloomsters could yet prove right. The Atlantic
alliance may indeed collapse, unless both Europeans and Americans
look forward rather than backward: unless they base their plans not
on memories of the past 50 years but on a reasonable calculation of
what the next 50 years will bring.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were indeed going to remain the world's
only great power as far ahead as the eye can see, people who like
this newspaper believe in the danger of monopoly and the need for
competition would draw the necessary conclusion: Europe should
provide a counterbalance to this overwhelming American power.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not in fact what the future really holds. If the
European part of NATO raises its eyes beyond its own borders, and
sees what will probably happen out there in the next generation or
so, it will understand why it still needs America and _ even more
important _ why America increasingly needs Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The one-superpower world will not last. Within the next couple
of decades a China with up to 1 billion people, a strongly growing
economy and probably a still-authoritarian government will almost
certainly be trying to push its interests eastward into the Pacific
and westward into Central Asia, whose oil and gas this energy-poor
China will badly need.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later some strong and honest man will pull
post-Yeltsin Russia together, and another contender for global
influence will have reappeared on the scene (unless fear of China
sends a horrified Russia running into NATO's arms).
</P>
<P>
   The Islamist superpower that nervous people predicted a few
years ago will probably never come into being, but the Muslim world
will certainly continue to produce localized explosions of
ideological wrath and geopolitical envy.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the alliance of the democracies needs not only new
members but also a new purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance can no longer be just a protective American arm
around Europe's shoulder; it also has to be a way for Europe and
America to work together in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And those who hope to construct a politically united Europe
should recognize that this must be done _ if it can be done at all
_ in partnership with America, not to separate Europe from America.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO was what NATO seems to Cold-War nostalgics, how soon
we'd drop her. But, as Kipling would be the first to explain, it
ain't.
</P>
<P>
   A new Atlantic partnership will be more than the Cold-War NATO.
Through the squabbling about bananas and the head-scratching about
Kosovo, the shape of a 21st-century alliance of the democracies at
last begins to emerge. &QL;

   LITTLE ROCK, ARK. _ At the end of February, a group of Canadian
hemophiliacs infected with HIV and hepatitis C descended on
Washington. They want an inquiry into why the United States,
particularly the federal Food and Drug Administration, allowed the
export of tainted prison plasma from Arkansas and Louisiana to
Canada in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, and the FDA
had already ruled that prison plasma was too unsafe to be used for
the manufacture of blood products inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the same group filed a $1 billion suit against the
Canadian government and companies involved in the plasma
production.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it plans to bring lawsuits in the $5 billion range
which will name the FDA, the states of Arkansas and Louisiana,
their prison systems and various medical-care providers for the
prison inmates, including Health Management Associates (HMA), which
ran the Arkansas prison plasma program from 1978 to 1994 and also
bought prison plasma from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The suit may also name the president, if evidence is found that
Clinton knew about repeated FDA violations and yet did not shut
down the plasma industry in his state's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission, set up by the Canadian government in 1995
to look into contaminated blood issues, found that the tainted
plasma often came from Cummins Prison in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins is a vast farm-based penitentiary that sits in bleak
countryside, strewn with shanties and burned-out churches, 70 miles
southeast of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates' blood was sold by the Arkansas Department of
Correction to HMA which, in turn, sold it to North American
Biologics, a subsidiary of Continental Pharma Cryosan, a
blood-broker based in Montreal. From there, it was shipped all
through Canada and across the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arkansans seemed unaware of the plasma program in their
state prisons until last summer, when Michael Galster, a prison
doctor, wrote a fictionalized account that exposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In past news reports, prison officials had denied knowledge of
what was going on. Yet not only did the prisons run such a program
from 1969 on, they were often in trouble for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Cummins, even when the existence of AIDS and hepatitis C was
recognized and tests for these diseases became available, they were
not always used; the FDA discovered that one hepatitis-testing
laboratory was out of action for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Needles were often dirty, so that many inmates now claim to have
been infected as they gave blood. (People caught in homosexual acts
were, however, removed from the list of suitable donors.)
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the FDA accused the center of numerous
violations and even ordered a temporary shutdown. It didn't matter.
Arkansas police investigations have shown that HMA continued to try
to find ways to sell inmates' blood, especially to Connaught, a
Canadian company that may have sold the plasma worldwide (the
matter is under investigation).
</P>
<P>
   The Krever Commission found that Connaught decided it was
``impracticable'' to inspect all the plasma-collection sites
itself, and decided to rely instead on FDA reports which it did
not, in fact, review.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Arkansas prison blood products found their way to
Europe and Japan, and in at least one instance were sent back to
the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever trouble appeared, HMA asked for Clinton's help. The
group invited a friend of the governor's, Leonard Dunn (now chief
of staff to the lieutenant-governor), to come on board as HMA's
president in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   When the prison's plasma license was revoked, HMA simply applied
for a new one under a different name.
</P>
<P>
   Prison administrators wanted to keep the program, and prisoners
liked it for the pocket money it provided: $7 a pint, with which
they could buy soap and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Henderson, the creator of HMA and chairman of its board,
maintains that AIDS cases simply did not exist in the South during
the 1980s, and that prison plasma was no riskier than other kinds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Art Lockhart, then director of the Arkansas Department
of Correction, contributed in 1984 to an information bulletin about
prison plasma centers published by the American Correctional
Association, in which prison populations were said to be at high
risk, and concerns were raised about ``quality control'' in taking
blood from them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Arkansas Department of Correction went on
running its plasma program for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks the Canadian hemophiliacs will go to
Cummins itself, seeking answers from a state that has long and
steadily denied even having a prison plasma program.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether they will get an invitation to the
prison where, in effect, they received a death sentence. &QL;

   RICHMOND, VA. _ As America's black farmers see it, they are not
much better off than the slaves and sharecroppers from whom many of
them are descended.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, whose numbers have dwindled from about 925,000 in
1920 to fewer than 20,000 today _ about 1 percent of all American
farmers _ have long claimed that, because of the color of their
skin, they have been denied loans, disaster relief and other aid
from the federal Agriculture Department (USDA).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, several thousand black farmers joined a $2.5 billion
lawsuit alleging discrimination by the agriculture agency _ derided
by some as the ``last plantation'' _ between 1983 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Brown, a 72-year-old tobacco farmer in Brunswick County,
Va., claimed that blacks usually had difficulty getting
appointments at the local Farmers Home Administration Office, and
that his local agent would delay co-signing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was going out of his way to put me out of
the farming business,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Another black farmer in Virginia, who abandoned farming and is
now a counsellor at a federal prison, alleged that Farmers Home
would never lend him enough to expand his small farm.
</P>
<P>
   But, said James Beverly of Nottoway County: ``They'd give
Caucasian farmers operating loan and operating loan, year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has acknowledged problems in its dealings with black
farmers. Dan Glickman, the agriculture secretary, has heard their
concerns at firsthand at more than a dozen town hall meetings
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report for the agency concluded that ``minority farmers
have lost significant amounts of land and potential income as a
result of discrimination'' in USDA programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration suggests that much of the blame
lies with Ronald Reagan, under whom, in 1983, the department closed
down the investigative wing of its civil-rights office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the farmers and the Clinton administration settled
the lawsuit just before a scheduled trial in February. But now the
deal, worth $400 million, is in jeopardy from the very farmers who
wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is not enough, and they want Paul Friedman, a
federal district court judge in Washington, to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, between 2,000 and 4,000 farmers would have
received damage awards of $50,000 from the department, most of it
tax-free. The USDA would also have forgiven their outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But ``$50,000 is a drop in the bucket for a lifetime of
losses,'' says John Boyd, the president of the National Black
Farmers Association and a point man in negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   How inadequate is the payout? According to Vernon Breckenridge
of Hennessey, Okla., one of the 400 farmers who jammed Judge
Friedman's courtroom in protest on March 2, ``It won't even buy a
mid-sized tractor, much less the equipment to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more satisfied. J.L. Chesnut, a prominent
civil-rights lawyer from Alabama who represented the farmers,
argued that the deal, while certainly not perfect, was a
``watershed for justice'' which would quickly pump cash into a
large number of farms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawsuit has been about discrimination as much as about
sums of money, and other plaintiff lawyers say it does nothing to
erase racism inside the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd is attempting to highlight the problems of racism with a
$10 million lawsuit, filed a week before the hearing in Judge
Friedman's courtroom, which alleges that a top aide in the USDA
called him a ``nigger.'' The official denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   There is little Judge Friedman can do at this point. He can
formally reject or approve the deal, to which he gave his
preliminary blessing in January, but he cannot sweeten it. The
settlement includes a proviso allowing some farmers to argue for
bigger damage payments before an independent arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers may derive some solace, however, from Judge

   RICHMOND, VA. _ As America's black farmers see it, they are not
much better off than the slaves and sharecroppers from whom many of
them are descended.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, whose numbers have dwindled from about 925,000 in
1920 to fewer than 20,000 today _ about 1 percent of all American
farmers _ have long claimed that, because of the color of their
skin, they have been denied loans, disaster relief and other aid
from the federal Agriculture Department (USDA).
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, several thousand black farmers joined a $2.5 billion
lawsuit alleging discrimination by the agriculture agency _ derided
by some as the ``last plantation'' _ between 1983 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Brown, a 72-year-old tobacco farmer in Brunswick County,
Va., claimed that blacks usually had difficulty getting
appointments at the local Farmers Home Administration Office, and
that his local agent would delay co-signing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was going out of his way to put me out of
the farming business,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Another black farmer in Virginia, who abandoned farming and is
now a counsellor at a federal prison, alleged that Farmers Home
would never lend him enough to expand his small farm.
</P>
<P>
   But, said James Beverly of Nottoway County: ``They'd give
Caucasian farmers operating loan and operating loan, year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA has acknowledged problems in its dealings with black
farmers. Dan Glickman, the agriculture secretary, has heard their
concerns at firsthand at more than a dozen town hall meetings
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report for the agency concluded that ``minority farmers
have lost significant amounts of land and potential income as a
result of discrimination'' in USDA programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration suggests that much of the blame
lies with Ronald Reagan, under whom, in 1983, the department closed
down the investigative wing of its civil-rights office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the farmers and the Clinton administration settled
the lawsuit just before a scheduled trial in February. But now the
deal, worth $400 million, is in jeopardy from the very farmers who
wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is not enough, and they want Paul Friedman, a
federal district court judge in Washington, to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, between 2,000 and 4,000 farmers would have
received damage awards of $50,000 from the department, most of it
tax-free. The USDA would also have forgiven their outstanding
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But ``$50,000 is a drop in the bucket for a lifetime of
losses,'' says John Boyd, the president of the National Black
Farmers Association and a point man in negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   How inadequate is the payout? According to Vernon Breckenridge
of Hennessey, Okla., one of the 400 farmers who jammed Judge
Friedman's courtroom in protest on March 2, ``It won't even buy a
mid-sized tractor, much less the equipment to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more satisfied. J.L. Chesnut, a prominent
civil-rights lawyer from Alabama who represented the farmers,
argued that the deal, while certainly not perfect, was a
``watershed for justice'' which would quickly pump cash into a
large number of farms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawsuit has been about discrimination as much as about
sums of money, and other plaintiff lawyers say it does nothing to
erase racism inside the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd is attempting to highlight the problems of racism with a
$10 million lawsuit, filed a week before the hearing in Judge
Friedman's courtroom, which alleges that a top aide in the USDA
called him a ``nigger.'' The official denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   There is little Judge Friedman can do at this point. He can
formally reject or approve the deal, to which he gave his
preliminary blessing in January, but he cannot sweeten it. The
settlement includes a proviso allowing some farmers to argue for
bigger damage payments before an independent arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers may derive some solace, however, from Judge
Friedman's strong criticism of the USDA. ``We ought,'' he said,
``to be ashamed.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN DIEGO, CALIF. _ Three years ago, it seemed that opponents of
huge sports stadiums had won. Such stadiums, they argued, did not
bring economic salvation to cities. The taxpayers believed them,
and in city after city referendums proposing new stadiums were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tide has turned. Voters in San Diego, Denver and, most
recently, Pittsburgh have all approved new stadiums, to be paid for
largely with public money.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change of heart? After all, even the smoothest
politician hesitates to justify handouts to profitable sports
monopolies owned by millionaires. And nobody has refuted the
blizzard of studies showing that such stadiums have considerably
less economic impact than their supporters suggest.
</P>
<P>
   One such study, by Andrew Zimbalist and Roger Noll, economists
at Smith College and Stanford respectively, in the 1997 ``Brookings
Review,'' showed that Baltimore got only $3 million a year net, in
new jobs and extra tax revenues, from its $200 million Camden Yards
baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the promoters' patter has got better. In the past, the
critics argued that, at the very least, stadium projects needed to
include more than stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   If they did not offer broader benefits to city-dwellers, they
were doing no more, in effect, than transferring wealth from
taxpayers to sports-franchise owners. Enterprising stadium backers
have taken this criticism to heart. Now they promise to spread the
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problems remain. Take the new $411 million ballpark for
the San Diego Padres, which was approved in a referendum in
November. The project's promoters _ chief among them the city's
mayor, Susan Golding _ argue that the ballpark is merely one piece
of a billion-dollar downtown rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 26 blocks of the city's core will be refurbished
with 600,000 square feet of office space, 150,000 square feet of
retail space and 850 new hotel rooms, as well as the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This is a complex project, one that requires cooperation among
lots of private and public organizations, and it has already missed
some of its early deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable, no doubt; but at least some of the financing
comes from revenues that are projected to pour into the city's
coffers from a tax on new hotel rooms. These hotels, of course, are
not yet built.
</P>
<P>
   The city also estimates that hotel-room tax revenues will grow
by 8 percent a year, a level reached only in the present boom.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems to be expecting an office-space bonanza of
the sort that caused many American cities to come a cropper in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   More problems are on display in the Pittsburgh project. In
January Pennsylvania's legislature approved a $650 million increase
in the state's debt ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   This is enough to float a bond issue from which $320 million is
earmarked to subsidize four new professional sports stadiums; the
rest is aimed at a hodgepodge of other projects, such as building
an aquarium in Erie and a convention center in Altoona.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters maintain that there are tight financial controls on
project overruns, and call the additional expenditures in
Pittsburgh the economic link that has been missing in past
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the financial controls are lax, and call the
extra money pork-barrel politics _ obvious (and successful)
attempts to buy votes for initiatives that were otherwise unpopular
with Pennsylvania's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College, a frequent critic of stadium
subsidies, draws an analogy between the complex, interlocking
Pittsburgh projects and omnibus trade bills, and suggests that
voters need what many presidents covet, a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   In all these projects, a fundamental question remains. Will the
net revenues be positive? In other words, will success hurt the
city's existing retailers, or will people come from elsewhere to
swell the total number of money-spenders?
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 paper by Mark Rosentraub, an economist at Indiana
University, argued that stadium-driven downtown developments, such
as one he studied in Indianapolis, had little economic benefit _ so
little, in fact, that Indianapolis would probably have done better
to spend its money on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest variations on the stadium game have managed to
divide the opposition. Back in 1996, George Will, a conservative
columnist, wrote a scathing column criticizing stadium subsidies as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, there was Will in the pages of San Diego's Union
Tribune making an exception for the San Diego Padres (of which he
is a director).
</P>
<P>
   Even economists have been caught in the cross fire. Rosentraub
has written a consulting report that supports the
stadium-cum-downtown-development project in San Diego, despite his
earlier study arguing that such developments did no good.
</P>
<P>
   Team owners in Pittsburgh, Denver and San Diego are
understandably elated. After all, despite the cities' claims of
tight budgets, wealthy owners have still gained access to the
public purse while other needy institutions go wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the critics should have been more careful in saying what
they wished for. Having been asked to make more wide-ranging
economic promises, stadium supporters have obligingly delivered _
with riskier projects and even more nebulous benefits. &QL;

project overruns, and call the additional expenditures in
Pittsburgh the economic link that has been missing in past
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the financial controls are lax, and call the
extra money pork-barrel politics _ obvious (and successful)
attempts to buy votes for initiatives that were otherwise unpopular
with Pennsylvania's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College, a frequent critic of stadium
subsidies, draws an analogy between the complex, interlocking
Pittsburgh projects and omnibus trade bills, and suggests that
voters need what many presidents covet, a line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   In all these projects, a fundamental question remains. Will the
net revenues be positive? In other words, will success hurt the
city's existing retailers, or will people come from elsewhere to
swell the total number of money-spenders?
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 paper by Mark Rosentraub, an economist at Indiana
University, argued that stadium-driven downtown developments, such
as one he studied in Indianapolis, had little economic benefit _ so
little, in fact, that Indianapolis would probably have done better
to spend its money on something else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest variations on the stadium game have managed to
divide the opposition. Back in 1996, George Will, a conservative
columnist, wrote a scathing column criticizing stadium subsidies as
corporate welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, there was Will in the pages of San Diego's Union
Tribune making an exception for the San Diego Padres (of which he
is a director).
</P>
<P>
   Even economists have been caught in the cross fire. Rosentraub
has written a consulting report that supports the
stadium-cum-downtown-development project in San Diego, despite his
earlier study arguing that such developments did no good.
</P>
<P>
   Team owners in Pittsburgh, Denver and San Diego are
understandably elated. After all, despite the cities' claims of
tight budgets, wealthy owners have still gained access to the
public purse while other needy institutions go wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the critics should have been more careful in saying what
they wished for. Having been asked to make more wide-ranging
economic promises, stadium supporters have obligingly delivered _
with riskier projects and even more nebulous benefits. &QL;

   TOKYO _ It is hard to believe that the streets of San'ya, a
Tokyo neighborhood of liquor shops and cheap hotels, could once be
controlled only by riot police.
</P>
<P>
   The police are still there, holed up in the ``Mammoth,'' a
multi-story police box that overlooks the biggest of San'ya's
flophouses. But they get no trouble these days.
</P>
<P>
   San'ya has aged with its residents, old men with creased faces
and missing teeth who squat and smoke on the pavements, drift from
bar to bar, or sleep it off in the winter sun on cardboard and
plastic matting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will spend the night on the street, too. San'ya has
more than 1,500 homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness is rising fast in Japan's big cities. Most Japanese
blame the recession. Everyone has a story to tell about the
white-collar ``sarariman'' who lost his job and then his family,
and who now lives in a cardboard box on the station concourse,
still reading the financial pages every day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of Japan's homeless have never set foot inside an
office, let alone read the Nikkei newspaper. However, the recession
has played its part in the recent surge in vagrancy in Japanese
cities, especially with the collapse in demand for day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   San'ya is one of Japan's biggest ``yoseba,'' a neighborhood
where day laborers gather early in the morning to pick up work on
construction sites. At its most prosperous, during the construction
boom in the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, San'ya was home to
15,000 day laborers. There are now only about 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The state pension begins at 65, but after a day laborer turns
55, says Takao Yamauchi, who runs a local welfare center, his
chances of picking up work are slim. The average age of San'ya's
day laborers is 56.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have exhausted their savings, says Yamauchi, they are
out on the street. Some have stayed in the neighborhood. Others
live in train stations and under the blue-sheet tents that are
spreading through Tokyo's public parks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Tokyo city government, 60
percent of the city's homeless say their last job was as a day
laborer.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s San'ya was enjoying a second construction
boom, thanks to soaring land and stock prices. The most skilled
workers, the athletic ``tobi'' who handle the scaffolding for
high-rise buildings, were then able to earn several hundred dollars
a day.
</P>
<P>
   But like the economy, it was a bubble that only masked the
long-term decline of this way of life.
</P>
<P>
   More and more construction companies are now hiring cheaper
foreign workers, both legitimate and illegal, who come from
Southeast Asia and the Asian subcontinent. They are also
mechanizing more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As the day laborers bear the brunt of the job cuts, San'ya's
community has collapsed. Yamauchi says that only a couple of
hundred workers turn up for the morning labor markets, compared
with several thousand a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing a bit of food, temporary shelter and medical
care, the Tokyo government has started a new job scheme for
San'ya's workers, employing them to clean government property, weed
the parks and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this, some of the homeless earn enough to sleep in a
flophouse at least one night a week, though not enough to qualify
for unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   When they were younger, these men took to the streets to fight
their exploitation by the ``yakuza,'' the organized crime
syndicates which still run the local labor-broking and gambling
rackets. But the old men of San'ya have no fight left in them. &QL;

LOVE GIVES TROUBLED MOTHER A FRESH START 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A joyful noise fills this home in late afternoon.
It's the music of Arlene Perez's children at play, their voices a
symphony of yelling, laughing and crying. It's the sweetest sound
to the 28-year-old mother of four; a sound she's just getting
familiar with because, she admits, until now, she wasn't much of a
mother to them.
</P>
<P>
   She left their care to others while she was adrift in the white
storm of cocaine and heroin abuse and a whirlwind of partying. But
in the end, it was her love for the children she'd abandoned that
pulled her back to the shore of sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, because of her drug problem and neglect, Child
Protective Services (CPS) took custody of Perez's children. In
September 1998, they were returned to her and on Feb. 4, CPS
dismissed custody of them, meaning Perez has sole custody of the
children, are ages 13, 3, 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the transformation of her life, she's an example of the power
of redemption and the gift of a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of glad CPS got involved and took my children,''
Perez said. ``Because I think if they didn't, I'd probably still be
on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   CPS got involved in August 1996 when her third child, a boy, was
born addicted to cocaine. After his birth, Perez began using
heroin. She stole the drugs from her husband, a drug dealer, who
was the father of her three youngest children.
</P>
<P>
   She failed at treatment programs. Her parents were raising her
children and she'd go months without checking on them, preferring
the blizzard of her addiction to the shelter of her family.
</P>
<P>
   It was when the state took custody that she stepped out of her
drug-induced fog. The murder of her husband last March made her see
even clearer. ``I started thinking, I lost my husband, I lost my
kids. I needed to do something,'' she remembers. ``My main focus
was my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She's been sober for two years and works as a home health-care
provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done a wonderful job,'' said Lupe Salas, Perez' CPS
caseworker. ``She chose to make the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressed is Associate Judge Peter Sakai who presided
over Perez's case. ``She's a reminder to all of us that people have
the ability to change and do right,'' Sakai said. ``Especially for
her children.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the changes is getting closer to her oldest child. The
seventh-grader spent a year in the Children's Shelter and in a
foster home. ``It was bad,'' the 13-year-old said. ``I didn't get
to see or talk to nobody. I was mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she respects her mother. ``I'm proud of the way she is
because she fought for her kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's partying days are over, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to sleep at 9 'o clock,'' she said as her teen-ager
winces.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is actively involved in her daughter's education and
attends all parent-teacher conferences.
</P>
<P>
   She believes her evolution from a drugged-out and neglectful
mother to a caring and attentive one is testament to people's
ability to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can change if they put their minds to it,'' she said.
``I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of children, all children, she said: ``They need love and for
you to take care of them. They need 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses and listens to the joyful noise outside. ``Children
need their parents. Nobody can love children more than their
parents.''

DREAM BARBIE: FASHIONABLE AND REALISTIC

   SAN ANTONIO _ You wouldn't know Barbie was hitting middle age
were it not for the hoopla last week over her official 40th
birthday. She doesn't look a day over 18 and the doll's most
popular model miraculously has retained impossible 38-18-34
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a hint Mattel is starting to understand the
influence it can have on little girls. No, there aren't any big
changes coming down the pike for Barbie. Fantasy is still her
thing. Mattel, the company that manufactures the doll, instead is
putting money toward issues where Barbie's image could be a greater
force: supporting programs that teach girls about technology, money
and finance, math and science, life skills and career planning, the
media and sports.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel is donating $1.5 million to Girls Inc., the organization
that formerly was the Girls Club of America. One of their
collaborative efforts includes developing a Web site with stories
of successful women that both groups hope will enrich girls.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution is significant but Mattel still misses the mark
as Barbie remains little more than a glamour doll. When I railed on
Barbie more than a year ago, a few female readers complained that I
was bashing the dreams of little girls. Not so. I merely wanted
Mattel to give girls something more substantive to dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Most little girls probably don't clamor for Barbies that
symbolize anything more than a glamorous fantasy world. That is,
after all, the doll's principal attraction, as the readers pointed
out. But Mattel has seen fit to give girls a meatier dream with
their Soccer and WNBA Barbies. There's even a NASCAR Barbie!
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the company introduced Barbies that had more
active lifestyles. The official Barbie Internet site notes that the
doll took on more athletic roles. She also made a breakthrough as a
``credit-card carrying executive.'' In the 1990s, Barbie even was a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Why not president? For that matter, why not Barbie, the chief
executive?
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie Web site includes a section that allows a buyer to
design her own doll. You can give the doll a name, select her look,
even her personality.
</P>
<P>
   Mine would be the ``You-Go-Girl'' Barbie and she'd look like
this: (Mattel, take notes.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd opt for the Barbie model with the athletic body. It's closer
to, ahem, reality.
</P>
<P>
   She would wear a fresh-looking suit, nothing too severe. And she
wouldn't wear those gravity-defying, bunion-busting heels the
Mattel designers are so fond of. My Barbie would wear fashionable,
but comfortable, shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Her personality? Assertive and fair, thoughtful and empathetic.
Above all, confident.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is no Masquerade Gala or Hollywood Legends Barbie. This
Barbie is a real-world dream to which little girls can aspire.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Betty Friedan brands her as antiwoman. Erica Jong
insults her as ``so ignorant.'' And withering e-mails call her
names and trash her ideas in terms too nasty to repeat. But
Danielle Crittenden, the cause celebre, only rolls her eyes and
gives a so-what shrug as she revels in her new status as belle of
the antifeminist ball.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden, 35, is the author of ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell
Us,'' a provocative new book that lays the blame for everything
that makes women unhappy _ in their sex lives, their marriages,
their mothering, their jobs _ on 30 years of feminist orthodoxy
that tricked a generation of females into thinking equality with
men would be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems originate not in our oppression, but in our new
freedom,'' writes Crittenden, a Toronto-born journalist
transplanted three years ago to Washington. ``Pretending that we
are the same as men _ with similar needs and desires _ has only led
many of us to find out, brutally, how different we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Her argument is old, but by being the polar opposite of the
scowling Phyllis Schlafly, the stylish, socially connected
Crittenden aims her appeal at 20-somethings who take women's rights
for granted but are not sure their stressed-out working mothers
were right when they said women could have it all.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden, moreover, is part of a new cadre of media-savvy,
``nonfeminist'' conservatives who are telling women they can
embrace more-traditional values, find contentment, and even have
some fun without donning a dowdy housedress and becoming June
Cleaver. Prenuptial abstinence, early marriages, children cared for
by nonworking moms, and midlife careers for women is their advice
for correcting what is wrong with the culture; what makes women
guilty, tired, and depressed; and what makes men irresponsible and
confused.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue,'' Wendy
Shalit, a 23-year-old recent Williams College graduate, makes the
argument for giving up co-ed bathrooms and one-night hookups, and
finding a new chastity. Women lost the sexual revolution, along
with romance, she says, and will be empowered only if they hold
back and wait for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Schiffren, a New York writer and former aide to Vice
President Dan Quayle, says women must mind their biological clocks
and set a goal of being married by 25. Melinda Ledden Sidak, once a
Washington lawyer in a high-power firm and now a stay-at-home
mother and writer, suggests women can be fulfilled only by putting
their careers on hold to nurture children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminists shout, `How dare you say mothers stay home with
their kids? The women's movement is all about choices!' ''
Crittenden said in a feminist falsetto. ``Well, we all know their
ideology is empty and out of touch with reality. Women can make
good choices and bad choices, the right choices and wrong choices,
and the consequences affect their husbands and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nibbling at a club sandwich, Crittenden said she knows this
because she has met countless confused young women and studied 30
years of magazines such as Glamour, Vogue, and Cosmopolitan that
portray today's female as ``even more miserable and insecure, more
thwarted and obsessed with men, than the most depressed,
Lithium-popping suburban readers of the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is getting attention and making Crittenden the darling
of Washington's conservative cognoscenti. She was already on her
way to its inner circle as the wife of David Frum, a leading
conservative thinker who writes for Weekly Standard magazine. Until
recently, she was editor of Women's Quarterly, a cutting-edge
journal of antifeminism published by the Independent Women's Forum,
a private policy group formed in 1991 to challenge Washington
conventional liberal wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden is also a charter member of the Censorious Matrons, a
conservative quasi-salon of well-heeled, nonworking Washington
mothers who have pungent political views but try not to take
themselves too seriously, said Sidak, another of the matrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danielle not only has written an important book, but she also
is witty and attractive, and that is an enormous advantage when it
comes to getting these ideas into the mainstream,'' said Kate
O'Beirne, Washington editor of the conservative National Review
magazine. ``It's far more difficult for feminists to portray her as
a traitor to women when she comes across as so bright and hip.''
</P>
<P>
   This antifeminist wave also is breaking at an auspicious time:
The yearlong Monica S. Lewinsky scandal has made a virtue of sexual
restraint, and feminist leaders who staunchly defended President
Clinton in spite of his bad behavior have looked bewildered and not
very credible, particularly on issues such as sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this climate, calling ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell
Us'' contrarian is an understatement. In it, Crittenden is nothing
if not blunt:
</P>
<P>
   --On casual sex: ``So long as there is no readily understood and
accepted way for women to say `no' to men they like or hope to see
again, women lose their power to demand commitment from men.''
</P>
<P>
   --On delaying marriage: ``If a woman remains single past 30, she
may find herself tapping at her watch and staring down the
mysteriously empty tunnel. When a train finally does pull in, it is
filled with misfits and crazy men, like a New York City subway car
after hours.''
</P>
<P>
   --On feminist wives: ``A woman who is accustomed to viewing
herself as an entirely liberated creature will be entirely
unprepared to take full charge of traditional chores like cooking
or the laundry, no matter how helpful and diligent her husband may
be. Marriage is not as good a deal for men as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   --On motherhood: ``No one compels us to have babies. The local
humane society will not let you adopt a puppy if you work full
time. Why should our standards for children be any less?''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan, whose ``Feminine Mystique'' launched the women's
movement in the early 1960s, said Crittenden is competely off base.
Research shows that women are mentally, physically, and financially
healthier today than they were 25 years ago; children raised by
working parents are as well off as those with stay-at-home mothers;
and girls identify with the goals of the women's movement as
strongly as their mothers did, Friedan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more attention being an enfant terrible, going
against the grain, and saying shocking things,'' Friedan said.
``But let's face it: these women are products and beneficiaries of
the women's movement, and now they are biting the hand that has fed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Crittenden looks suspiciously like a liberated woman.
She said her mother, a divorced journalist, taught her to be
independent, and her stepfather, a newspaper columnist, trained her
``by osmosis'' to be conservative. She skipped college _ ``it
seemed pointless,'' Crittenden said. She wrote for her stepfather's
newspaper and then went headstrong at age 25 into a marriage of
brainy equals that became a battleground over who did the dishes
and took out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden said she did not come to her senses about feminism's
bad bargain for women until three years later, when her first child
was born. ``To me, it was a no-brainer,'' Crittenden said. ``Babies
had to come before writing books.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds it outrageous that so many other women see staying
home with young children as a privilege rather than a right. Not
all women, of course, have what Crittenden's got: A helpmate
husband who is adoring and very rich. Children, ages 7 and 5, in
private school. A maid to do housework. A novel in the works, which
she writes when she is not appearing on TV, doing a book interview,
or watching her youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to dismiss me,'' Crittenden said, acknowledging she
is awfully judgmental about feminism for a woman who seems to reap
its fruits. ``I want to make it clear this is not a personal
book.''

CORKSCREWS COME IN MANY VINTAGES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Early wines in ancient Egypt and Rome were stored
in animal skins, wooden barrels and earthenware jars. Sometimes
hides were used to cover jar openings, and even large pieces of
cork.
</P>
<P>
   As bottles grew longer and stored horizontally for aging wine,
they had tighter corking, which required compression of the cork.
This also made them harder to extract. As a result, the bottle
screw was born in late 17th-century England, and some of them
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The first patent for a corkscrew was taken out in 1795 by the
Rev. Samuel Henshall in Oxford, England. Since then, there have
been hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   It evolved from the worm or screw on a ramrod, or cleaning rod,
that functioned as a method to remove a gun's charge from firearms.
Go to any household or wine store and you'll find a variety of
corkscrews from under $5 to more than $130 for a gourmet type that
both removes and replaces the cork in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But for some, corkscrews are as personal as a fountain pen,
where you never let anyone else write with your nib.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s the auction house Sotheby's re-released its
coffee-table book ``Collectible Corkscrews.'' There are literally
thousands of variations out there.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Rousset-Rouard, owner of the Domaine de la Citadelle winery
in Menerbes, France, has a collection of more than 1,700 corkscrews
in his museum.
</P>
<P>
   A corkscrew comprises a shaft and helix (spiral), or worm.
Usually the helix goes just so far down into the cork before
halting. At this point it can also turn the cork in the bottle's
neck, thus loosening it and making it easier to extract.
</P>
<P>
   Some corkscrews require the strength of Arnold Schwarzenegger to
use, while others make removing a wine cork as simple as taking a
cotton ball out of the top of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Corkscrews use levers, gears and screws. Some feature
combinations of the aforementioned, as well as a knife for cutting
the foil seal and a brush for cleaning the cork and sediment away
from the mouth of the bottle. They come table size and pocket size.
</P>
<P>
   Materials are also as diverse as the mechanism itself. The
handles of antique corkscrews have been made from porcelain, gold,
bone, horn, ivory or silver.
</P>
<P>
   Before you throw out that old corkscrew in favor of a new
high-tech model, know that since the 1970s, corkscrews have become
collectible items in their own right. People often have one or more
corkscrews. It can take a while to find one that you personally
like to use.

HER SONG: DON'T CRY FOR ME, AFRIKANER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ It took centuries of violent struggle to bring
the vote to all South Africans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the country heads toward its second democratic election
on June 2, it is taking a man in a dress to bring all South
Africans to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Evita Bezuidenhout, the sharp-tongued alter ego of satirist
Pieter-Dirk Uys, once lampooned white prejudice during apartheid's
darkest years. Now Uys's caricature is on the road with an upbeat,
nothing-is-sacred show, to stir slumbering voters and to ``remind
people what fun an election can be.''
</P>
<P>
   A shameless racist, Evita jabs at politicians and people of all
hues and creeds. And the multiracial audiences seem to love it.
They often walk in nervously, whites sitting among themselves,
blacks not quite convinced there's a man balanced on those
stilettos. By the end of the show Uys has them all mixed up,
laughing at one another and with one another.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason behind the fun. Unlike the first elections,
when voters lined up for hours at polling stations, there is little
excitement this time around. The government has no money for voter
education. Barely 60 percent of eligible voters have registered.
Forty-one parties have candidates, but the only suspense is whether
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress will win an unopposable
two-thirds majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I mean to do with this is underscore optimism,'' Uys
said after one performance, still dressed in sequins and false
lashes. ``My job is to enthuse people about things they don't want
to talk about. The laughter is all, because there is very little
reason to laugh in politics today. If you can entertain people
about something they're not looking forward to, then maybe they'll
remember the laugh and go to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a story in the name. In the late 1970s, Uys _ a prolific
playwright, actor, and social commentator _ wrote a weekly
political column, and found himself constrained by government
paranoia. P.W. Botha had just become prime minister. Censorship
muzzled the media.
</P>
<P>
   So Uys created a voice, a mystery female he later described as
``on the fringes of power but elbow deep in the catering,'' to
speculate publicly about the hushed and rampant rumors of official
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery voice appeared in Uys's columns once a month for
three years. Along the way someone dubbed her ``the Evita of
Pretoria.'' In 1981, Uys brought her out of the shadows and onto
the stage. He called her Evita Bezuidenhout, taking the last name
of a martyr and legend among the Afrikaner Volk _ a peasant hanged
by the British for rebelling against the Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The caricature of a racially insensitive suburban ``madam,''
Evita egged the stone-gray edifice of Afrikanerdom. She mocked
white privilege by putting its ugliness on display. Because she was
fictional, she was untouchable. Because she was portrayed by a gay
man in flamboyant gowns, the Volk were shocked beyond response.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing Evita is harder now that apartheid is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was such a target . . . one target: the culture of
death,'' Uys said. ``Now it's a democracy. I can't perform. I have
to listen to the audience. I've got to adapt everything according
to where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But adapt he has. Evita was recently honored in parliament. A
few years ago, Uys did a show called ``Truth Omissions,'' a satire
on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which
Evita apologized for her role in apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Evita walks on stage in an ethnic two-piece and
headdress, and quips: ``It was made for Winnie Mandela, but the
designer sold it to me when Winnie refused to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief, politically incorrect review of South African
history, Evita invites supporters of various parties to summarize
their views. And if some listeners still aren't stirred to vote,
she has this final touch: ``We Afrikaners know how important the
vote is. That's why we denied it to all of you for so long.''

COMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU: A GOOD HAIR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Are the mysteries of the universe explained in
the new 2 1/2-minute trailer for the new ``Star Wars'' prequel? No.
Does Liam Neeson's hair deliver the best performance of its career?
Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The new trailer is, in fact, a virtual hair derby in which three
people compete: Neeson, whose flowing, fanned-out, shoulder-length
tresses befit the noble carriage of a Jedi warrior; Ewan McGregor,
as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose buzz cut is punctuated by a
harsh stump of a ponytail; and Natalie Portman, whose stern young
queen sports a modified-geisha coiffure of breathtaking size,
complexity and, one assumes, mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Carrie Fisher's cinnamon-bun hairdo from the first
``Star Wars.'' Now picture it twice as big, with cooking
implements.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this new trailer (the second to hit theaters,
following the ``teaser'' trailer released Nov. 20) is one bang-up
piece of advertising and a good quick fix for fans who won't be
breathing until ``Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' is released on
May 19. The trailer was unveiled earlier on http://www.starwars.com
but made its big-screen debut last week, running before screenings
of the new film ``Wing Commander.''
</P>
<P>
   Critiquing a rapid-fire, 150-second pastiche is no easy task,
but here's the lowdown: Good. Evil. A giant fish. Charging
mammalian creatures with kangaroo legs. Armies of walking-stick
robots. A city made of giant pin cushions. Weird curly robots that
roll out of somersaults and shoot. An alien with anteater lineage.
Light sabers. Derring-do. Philosophizing. War.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Star Wars.'' Unlike the teaser trailer, which
focused on a young, pre-Darth Vader Anakin Skywalker, this one
gives us a peek at the scope of the film. We catch glimpses of
familiar characters (R2-D2, a skeletal C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt,
Yoda), as well as new ones (Portman's queen, Leeson's Jedi), all of
them engaged in a mythic struggle against ``the dark side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the course of an entire civilization is at stake. Just
as clearly, a good bit of swashbuckling is required on the way to
salvation. (Check out McGregor's 360-degree spin with a light
saber.) You know the score.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of scores, John Williams' familiar, rousing brass
motifs pierce the action, announcing the arrival of a
brand-spanking-new ``Star Wars'' with ringing conviction. ``Always
two there are a master and an apprentice,'' mulls Yoda (looking
less rubbery than he did in Trailer No. 1), and you want to give
him a bear hug: Welcome home, squish-face.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 22 years since the first film, 19 years since the
second and a mere 16 since the third. Now it's two months until the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we're counting.

US, REBELS REGRET CIVIL WAR ROLES; GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO SPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ After enduring decades of conflict that have
shattered families and destroyed communities, the people of this
war-ravaged country are finally being asked for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The first apology was issued on Wednesday, when President
Clinton, in a four-day trip through Central America, acknowledged
that the United States had made a ``mistake'' in supporting a
repressive, right-wing government during its 36-year civil war,
which claimed 200,000 victims.
</P>
<P>
   The second was made on Friday, when the Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unity, the leftist rebels who had fought the
government, issued a statement asking for forgiveness ``from the
memory of victims, their families and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, residents say, they want to hear from their own government
and from the military, which carried out the most brutal attacks
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the US government can recognize what they did, then the
army they supported should recognize what they did, too,'' said
Helen Mack, a Guatemalan human rights activist who runs a
foundation named for her sister, Myrna, an anthropologist who was
killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hector Mauricio Lopez Bonilla, a retired army lieutenant
colonel, said an apology from the military would be an important
step toward healing the country's wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it must come from someone high up, someone who was
involved in what happened,'' said Lopez Bonilla, who helped
negotiate the peace accords that were signed in 1996 and now works
for a political consulting firm. ``It would be a great act of
maturity by the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new openness being heard in this country about the
conflict is a result of the findings from a national truth
commission report released last month. The report, which was
sponsored by the United Nations, accused both sides of committing
atrocities during the war, but it blamed the US-backed government
and military for 90 percent of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has no authority to bring those responsible for
the killings to trial, but it urged the government to begin a
formal investigation and remove those army officers who were
responsible for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   President Alvaro Arzu has not released a formal reponse to the
report, but observers said a reply could come this week.
</P>
<P>
   Many here, however, say that a full recovery will require more
than just official expressions of regret.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its support for the peace accords, the Clinton
administration will provide $25 million this year for literacy
training and for local government projects that promote citizen
participation.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's statement, however, some activists and residents
called for reparations to be made to the victims' families, and
they have called for a class-action lawsuit against the US
government.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials say that despite years of peace, human rights
abuses have not disappeared in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable recent example they cite is last year's slaying
of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi Condera, who was bludgeoned
two days after he presented a similar report. Although the
investigation continues, church officials have blamed the military
for Girardi's death.
</P>
<P>
   For Alma Monterojas, the loss of her cousin 15 years ago in the
war is a burden she still carries. Every day, she said while
selling roses on the Avenida La Reforma, is a battle to make ends
meet, to care for her family, to try to make sense of the madness
that had gripped her country for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 15 years but I still wonder why,'' Monterojas said
of her lost cousin. ``He was not a political person, but he died in
a political war.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was pleased by Clinton's apology, but wondered how
_ or if _ it would help her daily struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, some leaders say Guatemala's biggest challenge today
is to rebuild the country's government institutions to better serve
its diverse communities of indigenous people who descend from the
legendary Maya civilization.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil war, the Maya were targeted by the military. Since,
they have generally languished at the bottom of the economic heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights abuses have changed from being active violations
by groups to more hidden forms of neglect by government,'' said
Marta Altolaguirre, a member of the presidential rights commission.
``We have many communities that haven't had adequate government
services for three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Arnault, the UN's special representative in Guatemala, said
the country's growing crime rate was another threat to building a
lasting democracy. This threat, Arnault said, could be solved only
by a rebuilt criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expected peace to deliver peace,'' Arnault said.
``Recovery will always be an uphill battle so long as public safety
remains remains a top issue.''

DEMOGRAPHERS CAUGHT LOOKING ON U.S. TRENDS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When World War II ended and Americans refocused on
home life, the nation's population experts failed to predict that
they would have so many babies for so many years. When women
started streaming into the work force, the experts took decades to
understand the magnitude of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having bungled the two most important demographic changes
in postwar America _ the baby boom and the rise of working women _
population specialists are making crucial forecasts that will shape
the debate over how to shore up Social Security and Medicare. And
this time, even they say that they are not sure they can produce
the accurate numbers lawmakers need.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering major changes to the two massive
programs for the elderly. Some lawmakers have called for cuts in
benefits, others for tax increases. President Clinton has proposed
diverting $3.4 trillion in additional cash to the programs during
the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals are driven by demography, the study of
population. The nation's 76 million baby boomers will hit
retirement age early in the next century, forcing huge payouts by
Social Security and Medicare. But no one knows how many retirees
there will be, how many workers will pay taxes to support them, or
how badly the programs will be squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone who can challenge economists for making bad
predictions, it's demographers,'' said Patrick Burns, a population
expert at the National Council of Senior Citizens. ``I believe in
my profession. I believe they'll be right for the next few years.
But beyond that? They've never been right before.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Census Bureau, looking ahead 50 years, cannot even give a
firm population estimate. Its highest- and lowest-case guesses
differ by 236 million people. Put another way, its margin of error
is almost equal to the population of the United States today (about
272 million).
</P>
<P>
   And yet Congess must look beyond 50 years in attempting to
repair the financial problems facing Social Security. The program's
nonpartisan actuaries, who evaluate proposed solutions, are seeking
one that works for at least 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Looking that far ahead with accuracy is almost impossible,
demographers say, because human behavior is too unpredictable. But
forecasters have also missed important signs that could have
improved their chances of accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, for example, demographers expected a baby
boom as servicemen returned home. But they said it wouldn't last.
Fertility rates had been declining for many decades as America
became urbanized and less reliant on agriculture. Experts such as
P.K. Whelpton, who made projections for the Census Bureau, said the
falling fertility rates would resume.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the baby boom lasted for two decades and became one of
the defining events of postwar America. ``Whelpton's projections
were abysmally low,'' said Gregory Spencer, who makes projections
for the Census Bureau today. ``This man was one of the trailblazers
of my profession. If a man as great as that can make mistakes, then
it can happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miscalculating another change in behavior, demographers in the
late 1970s saw that the number of high school graduates was falling
sharply. In well-publicized predictions, many concluded that
colleges would soon run short of students, forcing as many as 30
percent of them to close or merge. That would have been a
catastrophe for New England, home to a large cluster of schools.
</P>
<P>
   What actually happened? As predicted, a ``baby bust'' cut the
number of high school graduates. But the fraction of them going on
to college skyrocketed. The demographers failed to see that with
blue-collar wages falling, a college education became far more
important, said Paul Harrington of Northeastern University's Center
for Labor Market Studies. ``You couldn't have gotten this story
more wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, demographers were slow to understand the movement of
women into the work force. From the 1950s through the 1980s, they
constantly understated the number of working women and the big
increases in their hours on the job. As a result, government
forecasts for the size of the US work force were too low, said
Andrew Sum of Northeastern's labor studies center.
</P>
<P>
   No one says that these mistakes should dissuade politicians from
trying to fix Medicare, which is projected to see its trust fund
run dry in 2008, or Social Security, which in 2013 is expected to
start paying out more in benefits than it raises each year in
taxes. Lawmakers do not need dead-on figures in order to strengthen
the programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture that demographers draw of the future can have a
major effect on politics today.
</P>
<P>
   That is because people who favor radical changes to Social
Security and Medicare tend to portray the programs as facing a
demographic nightmare _ a crisis even greater than government
officials expect. Those who want only modest changes say the
programs face only modest challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Cato Institute, an influential libertarian
think tank in Washington, says that tinkering cannot fix the Social
Security program. It wants wholesale change. Instead of paying
taxes to the government, it says, workers should put money into
their own stock and bond accounts and retire on the nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its argument, Cato says that Social Security is in
more trouble than it acknowledges. The reason: People will live
longer than forecasters at the Social Security Administration
predict, so future costs will be higher than estimated. And worker
paychecks will rise more slowly than Social Security forecasts, so
its future tax revenues will be lower than estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Making the opposite argument for Medicare, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy says the future will be kinder to the health-care program
than most people expect. Scientific advances will bring new medical
treatments that save Medicare millions of dollars. It would be
imprudent to make radical changes to Medicare today, he says,
because we don't know what the future will hold.
</P>
<P>
   To paint a vision of the future, demographers make assumptions
about three key factors: life span, birthrates, and immigration.
Small changes in each one can have a big effect on government
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Consider life span. The Social Security Administration says that
by 2075, Americans on average might live as few as 78 years or as
many as 85, up from about 76 today. Longer lives might be
desirable, but they also mean more Americans will draw more Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   If life span rises to 78 years, a payroll tax increase of 1.6
percentage points, or equivalent program cuts, would be needed to
fix Social Security for the next 75 years. That would bring the
current 12.4 percent Social Security tax to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But if Americans live to age 85, Social Security would need a
far larger tax increase of 3 percentage points today to remain
stable.
</P>
<P>
   It might cost even more. Many demographers think that advances
in medicine, better diets, and other factors will allow people to
live into their 90s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Birthrates are even trickier to predict. They have risen and
fallen in recent years among American women, and nobody is sure
why.
</P>
<P>
   In their worst-case scenario, Social Security actuaries say US
birthrates could fall to 1.6 children per woman, down from a little
above 2 children today. At that rate, it would take an immediate
tax increase of nearly 2.6 percentage points _ or program changes
worth an equal amount of money _ to fix Social Security for the
next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor _ immigration _ is highly dependent on political
changes. And all manner of economic trends, from wages to
productivity, could have a big effect on government finances.

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WITH NEW ERA OF CONSUMERISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JASON LLOREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The full title is ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' but most fans call it EP1 or TPM. When the flick
finally hits the big screen on May 19, it might as well be Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the mania was bad in 1977, when moviegoers lined up
by the block to see the original ``Star Wars.'' That was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years has given my generation plenty of time to
anticipate TPM. It's bigger than the Second Coming of Christ _ it's
the Fourth Coming of Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Fanaticism will grow exponentially as the opening approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Campers will crowd theater parking lots. Credit card sales will
surge as people scarf up movie tickets days in advance. Fans will
swamp toy stores to snag the newest action figures.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts, jackets, anything slapped with a ``Star Wars'' logo
will pile up on shelves. Collectors will stock up on multiple
copies of mint-condition memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not immune to any of this, especially the merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977, I became a 7-year-old Jedi
zombie. I managed to convince my dad I needed every new Kenner
action figure or toy vehicle. Collector cards, bed sheets _ you
name it, I had those, too.
</P>
<P>
   A baby boomer co-worker once told me how he had to have a Davy
Crockett coonskin cap because the other boys did. For me, and for
my friends, the light saber was our coonskin cap. On Halloween, my
pal Tim Partain dressed up like Luke Skywalker and had a customized
saber consisting of a flashlight and a long glass tube. I'm still
jealous.
</P>
<P>
   But the light saber just whetted my appetite. I bought ``Star
Wars'' stuff like it was junk food. I owned dozens of action
figures, which I kept at the ready next to my bed in a cardboard
box. I had the battery-operated Stormtrooper Blaster with folding
rifle stock. My favorite item: a multilevel Death Star set,
complete with exploding laser cannon, tractor beam tower and even a
garbage compactor room (to re-enact that crushing-wall scene).
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Empire Strikes Back'' hit the theaters, the Force
continued to feed my frenzy. I bought the Hoth Battle Playset. I
was about 10, so scrounging the six or seven bucks to buy it was
tough.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Return of the Jedi'' came out in 1983, I had eased
up a bit. I was about to enter high school and set my sights on
more important matters: girls and cars. I put the toys and my inner
sci-fi geek in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   There they stayed until the digitally enhanced ``Star Wars''
trilogy was released a few years ago. Out came Luke, Leia and the
rest of the bunch. I found myself back on the sidewalk, lining up,
waiting for hours to relive that magic. Eventually, the dark side
of the Force drew me in: I started to buy up more toys.
</P>
<P>
   This time they were much better _ the craftsmanship had
improved, the detail was finer and, hey, even the large Han Solo
action figure looked like Harrison Ford. They were also more
expensive. My wallet began to leak.
</P>
<P>
   I gobbled up the goods one at a time: Luke Skywalker, Princess
Leia and R2D2 action figures, at about $6 a pop. Then the
variations: Luke with the cut-off hand a la ``Empire,'' Darth Vader
with removable helmet, the 9-inch Luke with real clothing (Hey, now
he can date Barbie!).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I couldn't pass up getting a saber. Several ads in
the back of sci-fi magazines were selling unofficial all-metal
replicas that looked exactly like the ones Obi-Wan and Vader wield.
Some of these cost $250.
</P>
<P>
   I resisted and settled for the licensed kiddie, all-plastic
version, which was extendible, lighted up at a push of the button,
and hummed as it moved, in the films. I bought one in Vader red,
another in Luke green: about $30 for the pair.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to upgrade. The Millennium Falcon with blinking
lights, rotating laser turrets and sound effects, and the
four-legged AT-AT _ that set me back about $120. I forked over
another $40 for the ``Star Wars'' edition of Monopoly, then shelled
out $20 for the Vader coin bank that lights up his red saber and
plays his ``Imperial March'' theme song. Another $70 and I owned a
copy of Luke's beige jacket from ``Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   After acquiring maybe 50 action figures and countless other new
items, I was forced to cut back _ my cash flow and storage space
couldn't keep pace with the flood of new stuff. Nowadays I pick up
an action figure every month or so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad I slowed down when did. I recently picked up the latest
``Star Wars Insider'' magazine, the official fans' rag, and found
an ad for a life-sized R2D2 and C3PO (with light-up parts), for
$7,000 and $7,500, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   I'll stick to my $5 5-inch versions, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we now have the Internet, the latest pusher to feed
my addiction. I stumbled onto the on-line ``Star Wars''
marketplace, Mos Espa, at www.mosespa.com (conveniently linked from
the official www.starwars.com). With just a few clicks, I placed a
pre-order for the long-awaited Lego TIE Fighter &AMP; Y-Wing Fighter
set ($55), and snagged a deal on a Luke doll in Hoth Gear (half
off, for just $15).
</P>
<P>
   As long as they make it this simple, I'm never gonna quit.

PRIVATE LIVES 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The private life of a presidential candidate may
seem like the last thing to become an issue in Campaign 2000, given
the public's attitude toward the impeachment trial and tribulations
of President Clinton. But the opposite may prove true: The public
may want more assurance than ever that candidates don't have a
problem in their past that will lead to Lewinsky redux.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is surely suffering from Monica fatigue. The last
thing voters want is to have their next president installed in the
Oval Office only to discover some past indiscretion that sets
partisans talking impeachment again.
</P>
<P>
   Better, some say, to vet the field now, before any electoral
commitments have been made.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean for campaign 2000? A few clues are beginning
to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The asking of the adultery question _ the ``Big A'' as it is
known _ remains one of the controversial issues in politics. But
its possible relevance was underscored last week by George
Stephanopoulos, who in 1992 was Governor Bill Clinton's chief
defender against allegations that the he had had an affair with
Gennifer Flowers. Stephanopoulos, in promoting his new book, ``All
Too Human,'' suggested that he wouldn't have gone to work for
Clinton if he knew then what he knows now.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the aide who urged the press not to delve into
Clinton's personal life now wishes he had known more about it.
``Maybe I just did not want to know,'' Stephanopoulos told
Newsweek. ``If I knew everything then that I know now, of course I
wouldn't'' go to work for him. And, perhaps, a more fully informed
electorate might not have voted Clinton into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from now on, most candidates for office are likely to
meet greater skepticism than ever. In addition to questions about
adultery, they may be asked questions about drug use or business
activities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an academic issue for the current crop of
presidential hopefuls. Last month, when CNN's Bernard Shaw
questioned Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, about his
aspirations, the veteran anchorman bluntly stated: ``You had an
affair (during) your first marriage,'' and then asked whether
private acts should be publicly discussed in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was surprised at the question, but also carefully
prepared for it. ``Let me say that I am responsible for the breakup
of my first marriage. I will not discuss or talk about that any
more than that.'' He said it will be up to the American people to
judge his morality.
</P>
<P>
   It may be easier for McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran who was
a prisoner of war, to handle such questions than it was for
Clinton, who was under attack in 1992 for dodging the draft at the
same time he was addressing questions of marital fidelity. If past
campaigns are a guide, the better McCain does, the more that
questions will be asked about his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush also has tried to dodge questions
about his private life, uttering what has become the best-known
quote of the nascent campaign. ``When I was young and
irresponsible,'' he says, ``I was young and irresponsible.'' When
Bush was asked if he had used marijuana or cocaine, he declined to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But can such dodges stand up in the age of Internet gossips and
paid exposes in publications such as Hustler magazine? After all,
it was none other than George the younger who felt compelled in
1987 to take the lead in denying rumors that his father, Vice
President George Bush, had committed adultery. ``The answer to the
`Big A' question is `N-O,' '' George W. told Newsweek as his father
was preparing to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the theme of Campaign 2000 could be ``Won't Get Fooled
Again.'' Clinton, who famously said he smoked marijuana but didn't
inhale, went on argue in his impeachment trial over the meaning of
sexual relations, and the definition of the word ``is.'' So if
candidates offer vague responses to questions or seems prone to
obfuscation, it will be understandable if reporters and the public
insist on more refined answers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some GOP nomination candidates such as Patrick
Buchanan have made morality a platform of their campaigns.
Meanwhile, various political operatives with plenty of vested
interests are already at work urging news organizations to launch
investigations of certain presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns are certain to hire ``opposition research'' teams to
investigate opponents, and, in some cases, may investigate their
own candidate as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle, who is still trying to
recover from a 1988 investigation of his personal background,
pledged last week that he would not raise personal questions about
an opponent's past. ``What happened 15, 20 years ago is really
irrelevant,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 12 years ago that former Washington Post reporter Paul
Taylor inaugurated this reportorial tack when he famously asked
Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart, a former US senator from
Colorado, if he committed adultery. ``I don't have to answer that
question,'' Hart said, setting in motion a chain of events that
doomed his campaign. Reporters followed him around and discovered
Hart had a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Today Taylor is executive director of the Alliance for Better
Campaigns, a Washington organization that is pushing for changes
that lead to better dissemination of campaign information on the
television airwaves. He still believes he was right to have asked
Hart the adultery question because of the unique circumstances of
the time, but he said it should not be an automatic query.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggests his own caveat-filled guideline:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is a threshold question that ought to be
asked,'' he said, referring to adultery. ``If, on the other hand,
there is a pattern of reckless philandering, then maybe it does. I
would tend to suggest that probing of matters of health, wealth,
and illegal activity is in bounds, matters of sex are out of
bounds. But these are not hard and fast rules, and you have to take
every situation as it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it depends.
</P>
<P>
   It may depend, for example, on what happens within the
Republican Party. In December, after Hustler magazine was preparing
to expose an affair by the presumptive speaker of the US House of
Representatives, Robert Livingston, Republicans pressured the
Louisiana congressman out of the job. That led some observers to
suggest that a presidential candidate must be adultery-free, while
others said that the public distaste for impeachment meant there
should be such a standard.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the pattern of the 1992 campaign will be followed, only
in more condensed form. In that race, when few people had heard of
the Internet and cable news was still perceived by many as an
interloper, much of the mainstream media refrained from reporting
the Flowers-Clinton story. It was only after the tabloid Star paid
for the story that it became big news. This time around, skepticism
is higher, anyone with Internet access is a publisher, and cable
news has turned into a highly competitive 24-hour phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest pressure on the candidates may come from those
who aspire to the Stephanopoulos role in the 2000 campaign. The
candidates' top aides may be the ones who ask the adultery question
that Taylor posed to Hart, seeking reassurance that the campaign _
or the presidency _ they're trying to fuel will not self-destruct
down the road.

NEW `STAR WARS' COMES WITH ARMY OF TOYS, PROMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store
and Taco Bell near you.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the
long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to
the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd., which is producing the movie, has licensed
Hasbro Inc., Galoob Toys Inc. and Lego Group to make the toys.
Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging. The company, which
has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects
of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its
merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie,
industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second
``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film
merchandising attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single
biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of
The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to
``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest
single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein
estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of
toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'')
didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales
generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks,
most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars''
films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie
series.
</P>
<P>
   They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King'';
the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to
guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products. ``With `Star
Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane
Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an
industry trade association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the
film merchandising industry. As a result, Lucasfilm knows this
segment of the industry like no other film studio.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,''
Brochstein said. Lucas retained the licensing rights to products
that used the ``Star Wars'' name. ``Before that, licensing was
considered ancillary income. But now in major films, particularly
those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom''
merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public
interest for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what
they're doing,'' Brochstein said. ``They've let things out in dribs
and drabs. They make it a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed retailers to begin selling
three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of
Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L. Jackson, the actor
who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle
Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but
Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full
range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two
product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I
_ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star
Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a
``Phantom'' soundtrack in May. Video games from Nintendo and Lucas
Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and
Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins
with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans
plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters. The cans featuring
Yoda will have prizes. Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the Louisville, Ky., parent of
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk
about its promotions.

GOP ATTEMPTS BROAD APPEAL TO PRESERVE HOUSE MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinging to the slimmest House majority in 45
years, Republican leaders are waging a crucial struggle to avoid a
do-nothing image that could threaten their tenuous grip on power in
the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   With only six votes needed to shift the balance of power between
the parties, House GOP leaders have broken with former speaker Newt
Gingrich's strategy and are reaching out across the Democratic
spectrum _ from conservative lawmakers to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican goal remains far from fulfilled, and with the
GOP's slender majority, any one of a panoply of House factions
could tilt the outcome of the most important debates in the 106th
Congress. Moderate Republicans, conservative Democrats, and a range
of interparty interest groups all see the potential to exert their
power.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who unexpectedly lost five seats in the 1998
elections, outnumber Democrats by only 222-211, with an additional
seat held by an independent. Another seat is vacant after the
recent retirement of the former speaker-designate, Robert L.
Livingston, a Louisiana Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in fat city,'' said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert
of New York, a senior member of a coalition of moderate
Republicans. ``This could be our moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate and conservative Democrats feel equally empowered.
Regularly invited by Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois to lobby
for their legislative priorities, several Democrats issued an
appraisal of the speaker's leadership that is likely to clash with
their party's election plans to portray House Republicans as
partisan extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker is really interested in being inclusive,'' said
Representative Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat who has met twice
with Hastert on budget and education issues. ``He has reached out
to moderate and conservative Democrats in a genuine way.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the House has yet to take up the most contentious
issues on the GOP agenda, the stakes in the struggle are enormous.
After deferring major action last year on issues such as Social
Security and health care, Republican leaders are dogged by polls
that show the public yearns for Congress to shed its image as an
investigative body that has focused on President Clinton at the
expense of vital legislative business.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert, burdened with the thinnest majority since Speaker
Joseph Martin, a Massachusetts Republican, presided over the 83d
Congress in 1954, is given little chance, even among his
supporters, of posting major achievements in the run-up to the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers said the GOP's slender majority increases the
need for Republican leaders to focus on a centrist agenda that
could foster a possible bipartisan consensus. But Hastert faces a
number of obstacles, ranging from powerful competing interests
within the GOP ranks and lingering acrimony between the parties
over the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be extraordinarily difficult for Denny Hastert
to hold this group together,'' said Representative Charles F. Bass,
a New Hampshire Republican who is a potential swing vote on social
issues. ``We're not going to change the world in 1999 and 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP moderates already have forced Republican leaders to abandon
one of their top priorities, a 10 percent across-the-board
income-tax cut. The moderate group of 40 to 50 Republicans also has
warned GOP leaders that it will fight plans to finance tax cuts by
cutting some domestic programs substantially.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that our influence has expanded,''
Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Republican leaders may have to settle for modest
accomplishments, such as a minor tax cut, a measure granting local
communities greater control of federal education funds, and
incremental progress in protecting patients' rights and making
health insurance more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, finding common ground is pivotal to House Republicans,
who have lost seats in each election since the GOP seized control
of Congress in 1994. If they lose six or more seats in 2000, they
will return to the minority status they had endured since they last
lost power in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the risks, Republican leaders have gone to unusual
lengths to prevent surprise legislative setbacks, even appealing to
GOP lawmakers to inform them if they plan to miss a vote for any
reason.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, forsaking Gingrich's more confrontational approach,
also have taken the rare step of holding a series of meetings with
one of their most powerful foes, organized labor. Although union
leaders have shown little interest in supporting the Republican
agenda, the meetings reflect a strategy that Livingston espoused
last year before he abandoned his prospective speakership following
revelations of his extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have slim margins, you can't do everything you
want,'' Livingston said. ``With a margin of only six votes, I'm
going to have to work with people who don't believe the same way I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has tried to create a conciliatory climate in part by
scheduling a bipartisan retreat next weekend in Hershey, Pa. But
leaders in both parties have struggled to sell rank-and-file
members on the notion of sacrificing a weekend at home to bond with
their political adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said
divisions between the parties run too deep to address in a weekend
getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet dealt with the underlying pathology that
affects this institution,'' Markey said. ``That will require
lancing the boil of bitterness and acrimony that characterizes the
relationship between Republicans and Democrats. It needs to happen
here, day by day, not in Hershey.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans such as Boehlert also see little merit in
approaching the retreat as the gateway to a happier, more
productive House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intentions are very sincere, but the results inevitably
are very short-lived,'' he said. ``We can talk all we want about
the Red Sox and the Yankees and Roger Clemens, but what good is it
if we come back on Monday and everyone starts blasting each other
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the divisions, Clinton's quest to diminish the taint of his
impeachment with a major legislative achievement might contribute
to bipartisan action. Both parties also want to demonstrate a
desire to address the nation's problems, which could provide more
impetus for consensus.
</P>
<P>
   But the polarizing force of a pivotal election looms. ``If
everything works out,'' Roemer said, ``we could have a few months
or so of bipartisanship, but then it could all blow up.''

NEW `STAR WARS' COMES WITH ARMY OF TOYS, PROMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store
and Taco Bell near you.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the
long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to
the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd., which is producing the movie, has licensed
Hasbro Inc., Galoob Toys Inc. and Lego Group to make the toys.
Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging. The company, which
has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects
of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its
merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie,
industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second
``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film
merchandising attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single
biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of
The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to
``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest
single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein
estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of
toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'')
didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales
generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks,
most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars''
films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie
series.
</P>
<P>
   They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King'';
the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to
guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products. ``With `Star
Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane
Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an
industry trade association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the
film merchandising industry. As a result, Lucasfilm knows this
segment of the industry like no other film studio.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,''
Brochstein said. Lucas retained the licensing rights to products
that used the ``Star Wars'' name. ``Before that, licensing was
considered ancillary income. But now in major films, particularly
those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom''
merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public
interest for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what
they're doing,'' Brochstein said. ``They've let things out in dribs
and drabs. They make it a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed retailers to begin selling
three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of
Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L. Jackson, the actor
who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle
Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but
Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full
range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two
product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I
_ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star
Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a
``Phantom'' soundtrack in May. Video games from Nintendo and Lucas
Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and
Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins
with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans
plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters. The cans featuring
Yoda will have prizes. Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the Louisville, Ky., parent of
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk
about its promotions.

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   MANASSAS, Va. _ When the end came, on a winter's day, in the
klieg lights of a galloping sex scandal, the Army left him for
dead, Gene McKinney says.
</P>
<P>
   It was a thousand times worse than friendly fire, he says,
because no one tried to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I equate this to a battlefield,'' the former sergeant major of
the Army said in an interview, his first in the year since his
court martial on sex charges ended in acquittal on all but one
count. ``You ask me to go out on a battlefield and perform a
mission and I get wounded and get left out there.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, still deeply wounded, is now preparing to fire back
with an explosive legal claim of his own: that military prosecutors
concealed evidence and covered up lies by some of the witnesses
against him, women soldiers who accused him of sexual
improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, during the court martial ordeal, all he could
think about was the nearly 100 years of combined military service
McKinney men had given to Uncle Sam. He and his brothers saw
soldiers swooping up Route 90, which runs through their hometown of
Monticello, Fla., during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when Fidel
Castro and the Russians were scaring everyone.
</P>
<P>
   That sold the McKinneys on the service. They'd raise rifles,
too. They'd crunch through the weeds of Vietnam, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then it came down to the scandal, the gnawing mess of it all.
His daddy down there in Florida, out on the sun porch, cursing the
military, losing faith. It came down to his sister Essie swearing
she'd never send one of her boys into the military. It came down to
James, his twin brother, leaving the military after three decades,
saying blood was thicker than his love of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Gene McKinney says his woes grew out of his style of leadership,
the way he'd open his heart and soul and home to soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural for me to help people who need help,'' he said.
``Mom would not allow us to have an evil spirit in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Army prosecutors, however, said Gene McKinney had a touch of
evil. They said he was a sexual predator. They gave him credit,
sure enough, for being charming. But they also said he was
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year ago today that McKinney, now retired as the Army's
highest-ranking noncommissioned officer, emerged relatively
victorious from a court martial that saw him acquitted of a
sweeping set of sexual harassment charges that included adultery.
But he was convicted on a single obstruction count.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week trial at Virginia's Fort Belvoir sent slivers of
raw emotion out across the country. And there were those who felt
that the old witches' brew _ race and sex _ was at work again.
McKinney is black; five of his six accusers are white.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six women, five have gone on with their military careers;
one resigned before the court martial began. The waters of Army v.
McKinney remain muddied, the accusations still ricochet as the case
proceeds on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenness of McKinney's fall obscured the astonishing
trajectory of his Army career. Long before the hourglass stopped on
Feb. 10, 1997 _ the day McKinney was suspended from the Army _ his
was no ordinary soldier's life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, a Negro teen and his twin brother left the Deep South.
They took what Elizabeth and Henry McKinney could give them _ the
country upbringing, the family dignity, ``a sense of right and
wrong,'' says Gene McKinney _ and joined the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Pulled on Army khakis.
</P>
<P>
   Laced up Army boots.
</P>
<P>
   And, amid thousands and thousands of other soldiers, became Army
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, `Watch the McKinney boys.' That's how we
were referred to: `the McKinney boys,' '' said James McKinney, the
identical twin who, in a touch of the surreal, stepped in as
interim sergeant major of the Army when the earth began to crack
beneath the shiny shoes of the man who looked just like him.
</P>
<P>
   Gene McKinney had an office at the Pentagon. He had a good wife
in Wilhemina. Met her in Florida when they were just children.
Their only son, Zuberi, was away at college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you my job,'' McKinney is saying. It's early
morning and he's seated on a sofa in his Manassas home. The voice
is deep, rich. ``My job was to represent every enlisted person in
the Army _ over a million people when you talk about the National
Guard, the Reserves. My job was to go out and talk _ to do more
listening than talking . . . I briefed the secretary of the Army. I
would testify before Congress. I traveled with the secretary of
defense every three months.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew a soldier's sweat, the hundred little agonies that can
nag any soldier. He'd been a grunt himself.
</P>
<P>
   Once he marched into a roach-infested dining hall and closed it.
His soldiers _ as sergeant major they were all his soldiers _ were
complaining about the food.
</P>
<P>
   Too many soldiers, he'd tell the brass, lived in crime-infested
areas, lived in homes with mice scooting across the kitchen floor.
``Living paycheck to paycheck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He loved, more than anything, rising from his office, hopping a
plane, going to a training field. He loved getting his shoes muddy,
marching right up to a foxhole, looking down at a startled soldier,
then stopping the soldier from getting up out of the foxhole to
greet him. ``I'd say, `No, no, let me come down to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His door was always open. That's what he'd tell soldiers.
``Busloads of soldiers would come up to my house. They would say,
`Sergeant Major, can we take a picture with you?' Back in their
hometown, that's bragging rights for them. They'd go home and say,
`Guess what? We went to the sergeant major house and he let us in.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Women soldiers would phone him at home as often as men. They'd
be seeking advice, words of comfort. ``It became a way of life,''
said Wilhemina, his wife. ``It was nothing unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we both admired about each other,'' said James McKinney,
himself breaking his yearlong silence on the scandal, ``is we took
care of our people. Those that needed a kick in the butt, we kicked
in the butt. Those that needed our arms put around them, we did
that. I even sometimes loaned my soldiers money. I let them borrow
my car.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Of course, it was illegal to do that,'' Gene added. ``But there
are two types of leaders. One who does things right. And one who
does the right thing. One . . . follows the rules all the time. The
other does what is right to help the family of a soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to be very well known for honoring our commitment to
our soldiers,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we used to do when we got young black
lieutenants in,'' Gene said, ``is we'd pull them aside and tell
them things to be aware of: You can't be in parties anymore. Can't
walk around like you're at some toga party. Because once they nick
you, it's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   In November of 1996, one of the most explosive sex scandals in
the history of the United States military erupted at the Aberdeen
Proving Ground military installation near Baltimore. Accusations of
forced sex with young female enlistees stunned the command. There
would be courts martial and prison sentences. The US military was
staring down the barrel of a sexual apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, three months after the Aberdeen scandal, Gene
McKinney was accused by a former aide of having tried to coerce her
into having sex. Six days later he was suspended. ``I went back to
my office,'' he recalled. ``Told my soldiers. They started
crying.''

SOARING JET TRAFFIC LINKED TO GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Virginia, Maryland, California)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An explosion in commercial air traffic may be
triggering formation of high-altitude clouds that trap heat and
could worsen global warming.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem could grow: Global aircraft emissions should
increase sixfold by the time today's college students are ready for
retirement, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The menace comes in a beautiful form, the cirrus clouds that
resemble silver, windblown beards and float at 20,000- to
50,000-feet.
</P>
<P>
   The jets emit tiny particles that serve as ``condensation
nuclei.'' High-altitude water vapor collects on these particles,
crystallizes, and forms the icy clouds. Research shows that some
contrails expand into huge, natural-looking cirrus clouds that
cover thousands of square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that cirrus clouds usually block the
escape of Earth's infrared radiation, heating the planet. Increased
cirrus cover might, therefore, hasten global warming.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, researchers began intensely studying the
possible threat of jet-bred cirrus clouds, and now, just as they're
beginning to gather useful data, Congress is eliminating the
project as of Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working furiously trying to turn (the cancellation)
around,'' said Don Anderson, scientific leader of the program, the
Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Project at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The program was budgeted for $7 million in the current fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scrambling trying to find other funding,'' said Patrick
Minnis, a NASA atmospheric scientist who is a leading figure in
contrails research. So far, that quest has been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the researchers say the scientific data are becoming
ominous:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cirrus cloud cover has increased an average of 5 percent over
three National Weather Service stations in Northern California
since 1971, said Minnis, who is based at NASA's Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nation as a whole has experienced about a 5 percent
increase in cirrus cloud cover since 1971, Minnis' data show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Very clear evidence exists of increased cirrus cloudiness over
the Northeastern United States, which swarms with air traffic,
since the early 1980s, French researcher Olivier Boucher reported
in the Jan. 7 issue of the British journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   By analyzing cloud observations made from 1982 to 1991 by
observers at U.S. weather stations, Boucher found ``a clear
signal'' of increased cirrus cloudiness over the Northeast United
States. ``Over the Western United States, the signal is not so
clear,'' he said in response to an e-mail query.
</P>
<P>
   If the contrail risk is real, it could lead to warmer weather in
regions where air travel is high.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, important early findings were uncovered by NASA's
SUCCESS project (Subsonic Aircraft: Contrail and Cloud Effects
Special Study). In the project, scientists used aircraft to form
contrails, then studied them close up.
</P>
<P>
   They flew through the contrails to capture and analyze their
content of ``aerosols,'' which are very small particles on which
ice crystals might form, producing cirrus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   They also formed contrails into easily noticeable shapes, ovals,
and tracked them by satellites for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Cirrus clouds typically form between 20,000 and 50,000 feet
above sea level. The wispier cirrus clouds form close to the
50,000- foot range, while the more overcast cirrus _ broad, dense
sheets called cirrostratus _ form at around 20,000 feet.
Contrail-bred cirrostratus are the biggest worry, because they
cover the largest area of sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We documented several cases where contrails evolved into
things that looked like natural cirrus,'' said Eric Jensen, a
specialist on cloud microphysics at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of global aircraft emissions is expected to increase
by up to six times by 2050. Passenger miles in air travel soared in
the United States alone to 605 million in 1997 from 404 million in
1987, according to the Air Transport Association in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The link between aviation and the increase in cirrus clouds is
``not an absolute truth,'' Anderson said, but some researchers
believe the data ``strongly suggest that.''

Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried
Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging. The company, which
has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects
of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its
merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie,
industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second
``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film
merchandising attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single
biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of
The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to
``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest
single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King.'' Brochstein
estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of
toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'')
didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales
generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks,
most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars''
films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie
series.
</P>
<P>
   They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King'';
the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to
guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products. ``With `Star
Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane
Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an
industry trade association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the
film merchandising industry. As a result, Lucasfilm knows this
segment of the industry like no other film studio.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,''
Brochstein said. Lucas retained the licensing rights to products
that used the ``Star Wars'' name. ``Before that, licensing was
considered ancillary income. But now in major films, particularly
those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom''
merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public
interest for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what
they're doing,'' Brochstein said. ``They've let things out in dribs
and drabs. They make it a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd. allowed retailers to begin selling
three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of
Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L. Jackson, the actor
who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle
Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but
Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full
range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two
product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I
_ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star
Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a
``Phantom'' soundtrack in May. Video games from Nintendo and Lucas
Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and
Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken
and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins
with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans
plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters. The cans featuring
Yoda will have prizes. Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., the Louisville, Ky., parent of
Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk
about its promotions.

<P>
   By the time the grounds at his military base had thawed from
winter, five more women had come forward claiming sexual harassment
by McKinney. The Army launched an exhaustive investigation, and
upon its completion, announced that there was sufficient evidence
to proceed with a court martial.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney denied all charges. He says he was a victim of the
convulsions that followed Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   Husband and wife sequestered themselves. A stoic Gene McKinney
told his family members down in Florida that it would all blow
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gene thought the cavalry was coming to save him,''
said Essie Rollins, his sister.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, the world wanted to know, ``Who's Gene
McKinney?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The home was at 905 4th Street in Monticello, near Florida's
northern border. ``Just a little two-room shack, to tell you the
truth,'' Elizabeth McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth raised the kids and sweated in the kitchen. Henry
sweated in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   It was inching toward noon on Nov. 3, 1950, when Elizabeth
McKinney summoned her midwife. Later that day she delivered two
boys. James arrived first, and 30 minutes later Gene. It was a
difficult birth. They were breech babies, born feet first.
Elizabeth's daddy looked down over them. ``They'll be special
boys,'' he said. ``They'll be brave.''
</P>
<P>
   The twins were dutiful children. ``They worked in the fields,''
their father said. ``They worked in watermelon patches. They saved
their money and bought their own school clothes. Never had to worry
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   They graduated from high school in 1968. James McKinney signed
up for the Army right away. Gene wanted a taste of the world. He
went north. Detroit was far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, smoke got in his eyes. ``They were killing people,''
Gene McKinney said of the Detroit riots. ``I used to tell people,
`I can get paid for doing this.' So I joined the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, he was fingering his orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked God to give me a sign he'd come back,'' Elizabeth
McKinney said of the day when her son Gene told her he was on his
way overseas.
</P>
<P>
   A violent thunderstorm woke her from sleep just before he left.
``That was my sign. I knew he'd be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   He landed in Vietnam with the 173d Airborne. ``A lot of blacks
in that unit,'' Gene McKinney said. ``A lot of blacks in Vietnam,
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Marching through jungle, seeing what wasn't there in the inky
nights, breathing bad dreams and death, sleeping with eyes open,
everything about living and dying started to blur.
</P>
<P>
   Gene McKinney celebrated his 19th birthday hauling grenades and
looking over his shoulder for Charley and under his feet for booby
traps.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home to Florida in 1971. Best job he could find was
installing air conditioners. He hated it. And so, 38 days out, Gene
McKinney marched right back into the Army.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Benning in 1971 Gene McKinney was named Soldier of the
Year. He stayed four years in Germany. Wonderful reviews and
promotions followed.
</P>
<P>
   As Gene was promoted, James was never far behind. ``There was no
one else out there,'' James said, ``who I thought could compete
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   On leave, the McKinney sons returned home to Florida. They'd
slip their mother some money. ``Build you a new bathroom, Momma,''
Gene told her.
</P>
<P>
   Essie would sit at the dinner table and listen to Gene and James
talk about the Army, the racial harmony. ``I didn't think they were
living in reality,'' Essie said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rumors had started that the McKinney brothers were sergeant
major of the Army material.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the same Army _ enlisted and officers _ but it's a
different river for each. Officers have clubs, make policy, hang
among themselves. You come into the Army off the streets, a buck
private, like Gene and James McKinney, you might not have any grand
dreams. You might just wish to be a solid soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But if you did have dreams, you might set your sights on the
position of sergeant major of the Army. That's the highest an
enlisted man can go. It'd take a hundred little miracles. It might
even take a mother's belief in thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1995, Gene McKinney became the 10th sergeant major of
the United States Army.
</P>
<P>
   James and Henry Jr., another brother, made Gene's ceremony in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Florida boys.
</P>
<P>
   Henry was beside himself.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Germany, Henry Jr. pulled Gene aside. Just some
brotherly advice. ``We talked about women, about the need to never
be one-on-one with a woman now, to always be seen in a crowd.
Things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did with those women was no different than what I did
with male soldiers,'' McKinney said. ``One female said she was at
my house. Said we had sex on my couch in the sun room. Had she ever
been in my house? Well, she came by my house to make assignments
for my trips. Anytime a soldier rings my doorbell _ male or female
_ they get invited in.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you say, `Gene, why would you invite soldiers into your
home?' . . . Can you imagine the most senior guy in the Army
denying soldiers the right to know how he lives?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never touched any of them in any kind of manner other than a
handshake,'' McKinney said of his accusers. ``I may have had my
hands on Brenda's shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was always as a show of support, like comforting
her,'' Wilhemina said.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, the first black sergeant major of the Army, refused to
blame race for his downfall. But it seeped out into the open soon
enough.
</P>
<P>
   A black retired general asked McKinney to meet him in a park,
for a talk. The general begged McKinney to take a plea bargain,
said the court martial was bad for Army morale, that it was harming
black soldiers. Then the general started weeping.
</P>
<P>
   No such show of sympathy, however, came from Togo West, the
secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `I reported to Togo West, a black man. He put his tail between
his butt and ran,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen ``Not guilty'' verdicts echoed through the courtroom.
The sole guilty conviction, on an obstruction count, concerned a
phone call McKinney had made to one of his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Barnes, lawyer for Brenda Hoster, McKinney's first
accuser, says the Army chose to prosecute the case with
well-meaning _ but inexperienced _ prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Army very reluctantly brought this to
prosecution,'' said Barnes, a Denver-based attorney who works with
women who have military discrimination claims. ``We never asked for
any criminal charge. We just asked the Army to treat it like other
sex harassment cases. But given his prominence, they couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes says she still fervently believes in McKinney's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney's lawyer, Charles Gittins, says he thinks he can prove
the case against the sergeant major was built on untruthful
testimony by key witnesses. As part of McKinney's appeal, Gittins
is pressing a freedom of information claim for documents he said
were illegally concealed from the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In private interviews with Army prosecutors, witnesses were
cross-examined and caught in lies and still sent to the witness
stand,'' Gittins said. ``When Army prosecutors violate the law to
obtain a conviction, they need to be held accountable. Since the
Army won't do it, I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Army prosecutors, citing McKinney's appeal, refuse to comment on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gene and Wilhemina McKinney live in a fine home in
Manassas. They've only got each other now. Zuberi died from
injuries suffered in a car accident three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gene McKinney hasn't hung one Army picture on the wall. He says
he won't. Let it all die. Let it all go away.
</P>
<P>
   He's only 48 years old. He's job hunting. He might get into
communications work.
</P>
<P>
   Some mornings he goes for walks. There are woods in back of his
home. He loves it when it's raining out. He says it reminds him of
marching across Army fields, going to meet his soldiers.

FROM THE MELTING POT TO THE JACKPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Joe DiMaggio took the field in Yankee Stadium, a
shy, 22-year-old boy-hero who spoke with his bat, Frank Sinatra, a
year younger, had already talked his way across the river from
Hoboken and was crooning for the big bands, ambition glinting off
his toothy smile.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades that followed _ indeed, for all of mid-century
America _ Sinatra and DiMaggio shared an important credential: They
were among the first celebrities minted in urban, immigrant
America, and thus were competing role models for neighborhood boys
with downtown dreams.
</P>
<P>
   They existed in parallel universes, and sent out sharply
opposing messages.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are both gone, the sheer power of their images
attests to something bigger than baseball and more enduring than
gold records. It is the strength of celebrity, the ability to lead
by gesture, and the enormous influence that accrues to those with
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If DiMaggio was the good boy, Sinatra was the bad boy,''
explained historian Thomas O'Connor. ``Sinatra was tough. Rumors
had it he was tied in with the mob. That was part of his appeal.
There was surface polish, but, underneath, the almost sinister
element of suppressed violence. . . . DiMaggio was soft-spoken,
polite. If he wasn't the kids' model of appeal, he probably was for
their mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The aspirations of millions seemed to exist in the vast distance
between them. For the sons of immigrants looking for a stake in
America, they were two fables, two choices, two models for success.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra wore his class resentments on his gold cufflinks. His
triumph was that of the street kid who achieved power without
dimming the crude force of his personality. As a singer he was
famous for his enunciation, but between songs, he spoke with a
thick, almost thuggish, Jersey accent. It advertised his ascent in
the world, reminding listeners exactly where he came from and where
he had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was a born ballplayer, a natural, and thus represented
success without politics: His was the triumph of God-given talent
in America's emerging meritocracy. Like many heroes, he sprang from
nowhere _ actually, the fishing village of Martinez, Calif., near
San Francisco _ and was propelled by unseen strength. He never
pushed his way onstage; even while patrolling centerfield in 10
World Series, he hardly seemed to work up a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   When his baseball feats elevated him in New York social circles,
he exuded a gentlemanly grace; his manners were pristine, almost
virginal. He was, in the parlance of the times, ``well brought
up.'' His mother and father, who had nine children, taught him that
modesty and respect were calling cards in any society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a story about Joe DiMaggio that I saw in a magazine
that once said, `Joe DiMaggio, unlike other Italians, doesn't put
oil in his hair, he slicks it back with water,' '' said former
Boston City Councilor Lawrence DiCara. ``I never forgot that.''
</P>
<P>
   By showing restraint, DiMaggio projected strength of character.
He was twice divorced, and estranged from his only son, but
nonetheless famous for his romantic fidelity. His kindness to his
troubled ex-wife Marilyn Monroe, who was exploited by almost every
other man in her life, burnished his legend. The single rose he
would place beside her grave for long after her death was an
enduring symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiMaggio basically swore off women after Marilyn Monroe,''
whom he divorced, after a marriage of less than a year, when he was
39, noted DiCara, ``so he and Sinatra were just very different
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if DiMaggio signaled the importance of resisting one's
appetites to achieve a deeper moral satisfaction, Sinatra urged
indulgence as the reward for success. Though he maintained
turbulent, but loving, relationships with his three children,
ex-wives, and an entourage of male buddies, he seemed to relish
promiscuity, discarding ``dames'' like burned-out cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his drinking buddy Dean Martin wilted beside him,
Sinatra defied dissipation: He acknowledged no dark side in his
good life.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sinatra's unvarnished confidence and DiMaggio's easy
grace were carefully crafted images that, well into later life,
they struggled to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   When photographers were around, the elderly DiMaggio would
frantically discard his drink; he seemed to believe that legends
should not indulge themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra, by contrast, ordered up album covers of himself
dragging on cigarettes and sipping highball glasses long after
smoking and drinking had lost their glamour; he was still swinging
in the age of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both defied the usual degradation of celebrities in their
twilight years, the threadbare look of self-delusion. Sinatra and
DiMaggio understood they were icons, and that their kind of magic
didn't fade; death would only enhance their profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the morning after DiMaggio's death Monday, Philadelphia
Inquirer sportswriter Bill Lyon, like millions of men who grew up
in the 1930s and '40s, recalled his first ballgame. ``More than a
half-century later, this is what I remember: The outfield grass _
it was perfect and took my breath away. And my grandfather, the
gentlest man I've ever known, whispering the instruction in my ear.
`Watch the centerfielder. See how he carries himself. It is very
important, how a man carries himself.' ''

DOUBLE STANDARDS, LEFT AND RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news out of Guatemala has been causing me twinges of
self-reproach. Not because what I have written about Guatemala has
proved to be wrong. But because I have never written about
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Last month an independent truth commission released a
nine-volume report on the massive human-rights violations that
bloodied Guatemala during its decades-long civil war. The death
toll on all sides is estimated at more than 200,000, but of the
killings that the commission was able to document, more than 90
percent, it said, were committed by the government and the
military. And to much of this bloodshed, the United States was an
accessory. The report notes that Washington turned a blind eye to
the government's slaughter of the Marxist rebels and their presumed
supporters. Worse, the United States helped fund and train the
Guatemalan military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not wish to say that the US government bears direct
responsibility for any act of genocide,'' the commission's chairman
said. But ``the United States knew perfectly well what was going
on. It raised no objection and it continued its support for the
Guatemalan Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I have occasionally been challenged by readers to
write about Guatemala and the atrocities of its right-wing
government. I never did. The subject never interested me. I never
started a ``Guatemala'' file to go along with my bulging
``Nicaragua,'' ``El Salvador,'' and ``Cuba'' files. Of course no
columnist writes about everything. But in more than 11 years of
opining in print, I've taken up subjects ranging from Dean Martin
to bankruptcy law to slavery in Sudan. Yet, I never felt the urge
to take up Guatemala, where hundreds of thousands of people were
dying in a brutal civil war.
</P>
<P>
   I think I was not atypical of the conservative commentariat. I'm
sure some pundits and journals on the right wrote about Guatemala's
agony, but offhand I don't recall any. Certainly, it was not a
subject that triggered in conservatives the passion that the crises
in Nicaragua or Afghanistan did.
</P>
<P>
   Why was that? Could it be _ here are those reproachful twinges _
that journalists and opinionizers who tilt rightward are as guilty
of double standards as our ideological opponents on the left?
(itals)They(unitals) could generally be relied on to downplay or
ignore the crimes of Fidel Castro or the Sandinistas _ or, for that
matter, of the Khmer Rouge or the Kremlin. Have we conservatives, I
have been wondering, been similarly guilty of overlooking the evils
committed by anticommunist regimes like the ones in Guatemala or
Chile?
</P>
<P>
   My tentative answer:
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are not immune to mortal failings and temptations,
including the failing of being inconsistent and the temptation to
go easy on the enemy of one's enemy. If one regards armed Marxist
insurgents as a dire threat to human life, liberty, and happiness,
one is likely to make allowances for a government under siege by
Marxists guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A double standard? Yes, but all double standards are not created
equal. During World War II, the United States addressed one
totalitarian empire _ Nazi Germany _ as a mortal enemy, while
making another _ Soviet Russia _ our ally. Who wants to argue that
we should have treated them the same? The USSR was ruled by a
monster who slaughtered innocents mercilessly. So was Germany. But
Germany, at that hour, represented a danger to Western civilization
itself.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of flesh and blood, every torture victim is equal,
a human being in agony. At the level of geostrategy, however, it
matters greatly whether the torturer is a Soviet proxy in a
Sandinista uniform or a Hutu thug in Rwanda. During the Cold War,
policymakers and analysts on the right engaged in a kind of triage,
focusing attention on places where the Soviets were trying to brew
revolution and plant the Leninist flag. Conservatives paid scant
attention to Afghanistan, for example, until the Red Army invaded
in 1979. Then they paid enormous attention _ because the stakes
were no longer the welfare of individual Afghans, but whether the
world's most formidable enemy of freedom would advance or recede.
Likewise Latin America. Cuba, Nicaragua, and El Salvador were
priorities in the '70s and '80s. Guatemala wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true that CIA officers were in the room as Guatemalan
operatives planned illegal killings, or that US agencies knew of
wholesale massacres of Mayan villages but said nothing,
condemnation should have come as forcefully from the right as from
the left. Yet, if conservatives failed to condemn such crimes, at
least they never denied them, never covered them up, and never made
the criminals out to be heroes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a small point. The worst that can be said of most
conservatives is that they were not aggressive enough in denouncing
right-wing villains _ the Argentinian junta, Chile's Augusto
Pinochet, or the Guatemalan strongman, General Efrain Rios Montt.
By contrast, leftists openly cheered the Sandinista junta and the
FMLN, El Salvador's Marxist rebels. To this day, many liberals
regard Castro _ a cruel tyrant _ with admiration.
</P>
<P>
   There was a story to tell in Guatemala, and conservative
journalists were not zealous enough in telling it. That was a sin
of omission _ less grave than the sins of commission perpetrated by
journalists on the left, but a sin nonetheless. I still won't be
able to write about every topic readers suggest. But my
``Guatemala'' file is now open.

APPLES AND ORANGES 
My Journey Through Sexual Identity 
By Jan Clausen 
Houghton Mifflin, 253 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout most of history, identity was, and still is in most
of the world, something one is born with and cannot change. One is
a Serb or a Tutsi, a peasant or a noble, a man or a woman. Only in
the West in modern times, and perhaps nowhere else as much as in
America, identity is just the reverse: It is something one seeks,
chooses, adopts, and this adoption is always momentous. Americans
have the glorious freedom to decide who and what they are, but
sometimes we see, as most poignantly in this remarkable memoir,
what a painful and difficult passage this freedom requires.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon-born Jan Clausen is a novelist, poet, left/liberal
activist, and teacher of writing and literature at New York's New
School. For many years she was also a confirmed, committed, and
activist lesbian with a long-term committed partnership complete
with child (her partner's biological daughter). Though she had had
male lovers in her youth, her life in a Portland commune in the
early 1970s (she was born in 1950) exposed her to women as lovers,
and she became openly lesbian some time after she moved to New York
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Settled in Brooklyn, she began a life of writing, demonstrating,
and activism on behalf of social justice, especially for women,
very much in the context of a discrete sisterhood, a lesbian
community, a world in which her identity was clear and her sense of
belonging unquestioned, least of all by herself. With her longtime
partner, Leslie Kaplow (a made-up name), she was in no doubt about
who she was and with whom she belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1987, until she unexpectedly fell in love with a man.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with Kaplow had become troubled. Heavily
involved with the American movement in support of the Sandinista
revolution, Clausen went to Nicaragua on a fact-finding trip. The
group she traveled with included an activist lawyer named Benjamin
(no last name is given), who was born in Grenada and educated in
Britain. He became intensely interested in her, and to her
surprise, she was also attracted to him. When they returned to New
York, while Kaplow was away, Clausen and Benjamin became sexually
involved, with explosive consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstantial outcome was simple enough: Kaplow was
outraged, Clausen moved out, and she began a committed,
home-sharing relationship with Benjamin that still exists. Nothing
unusual _ happens all the time. But because the new lover was a
man, for Clausen the emotional and social consequences were
unusually painful and complicated. Though some lesbian friends were
understanding and supportive of her choice and change of life, she
drew rage and ostracism from many others, and experienced the loss
of her settled identity within the sisterhood.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to permit her own desire, she writes, ``required
giving up that sense of being among the elect that my lesbian
feminist identity furnished in return for its exorbitant demands on
my sense of political duty. . . . I was struck by how often
lesbians inquired what I planned to call myself, almost as though
the absence of a name for my condition were more upsetting than my
actual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When she granted permission for one of her lesbian poems to
appear in a gay anthology, the editor, a friend who had accepted
her new situation, ``soon was harshly reproved by a self-appointed
member of the identity police who thought I'd forfeited my rights
to any further association with dyke culture.''
</P>
<P>
   However, after she published an article in 1990 about her
experience, ``My Interesting Condition,'' in Out/
</P>
<P>
   Look magazine, she received besides outraged letters some from
women who had had similar experiences, who had unexpectedly found
themselves in a new closet. ``Apparently,'' she writes, ``ours had
become the latest edition of the love that dare not speak its
name.''
</P>
<P>
   She is no less committed to social justice than she ever was,
and does not reject or denounce her former life or loves. But she
does reject the premise that in order to make the world a better
place, one has to buy into, wholly, a complete
sexual/social/political identity. ``Beyond identity categories,''
she writes, ``we all face the puzzle of how best to foster justice
in a complicated world in which `shared oppression' is less than
ever a simple mechanical binding force.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a deeply and sometimes tortuously introspective book.
Clausen is a gifted writer, with impressive eloquence and clarity,
even though her ideas are sometimes wrought with the sort of poetic
idiom that requires careful, slow reading. Many of her sentences
are of Jamesian length, with parenthetical asides that give the
sentences themselves an aspect of self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is sure of who she is and where she stands, her
position no longer represents a definition out of a catalog. ``Now
I want a life,'' she writes, ``that can't be paraphrased _ my own,
with all its imperfections and surprises. Its lack of romantic
certainty. Its failure, precisely, to be some other story, to be
justified by anything external to itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she wants to be that other American curiosity:
an individual.

IN PURSUIT OF CROOKS, DNA COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts _ now the only state now unable to collect blood
samples from inmates to go into a statewide DNA database _ is
falling behind the rest of the nation in an area of law enforcement
that, say some experts, could dramatically reduce violent crime and
make serial rape non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   The court-ordered ban on DNA collection here has put
Massachusetts well behind states such as Florida, where the state
has a DNA database of some 55,000 people convicted of any of six
serious crimes. State officials there have been able to identify
100 suspects in serious crimes that investigators never would have
considered unless their DNA matched that at a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation last year launched a
nationwide DNA database system, known as CODIS, that allows state
and local law enforcement agencies to exchange and compare DNA
offender profiles and crime scene profiles electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But while Massachusetts can request that a sample from a crime
scene be run against the national database, it cannot submit its
offenders' DNA for matches.
</P>
<P>
   Why the restrictions? Massachusetts is home to the nation's only
successful legal challenge to a DNA collection law. Superior Court
Judge Isaac Borenstein ruled last summer that the Bay State's
program _ which would take blood samples from inmates convicted of
one of 33 serious crimes as well as those on parole or probation _
was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the state constitution
because it was an unlawful search, one without probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments
on whether to uphold Borenstein's ruling. A decision could come
anytime, but most likely not until summer.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether collecting DNA samples and using them in a
database is like 21st century fingerprinting _ a legitimate tool
used to help solve violent crimes _ or whether it represents a
government-sanctioned invasion of privacy against inmates, even
when there is no specific evidence linking them to any unsolved
crime.
</P>
<P>
   While that debate is being aired in the courts, there is little
dispute over DNA's effectiveness fighting crime. ``It will greatly
cut down on the number of crimes . . . people commit,'' says Walter
Rowe, a forensic sciences professor at George Washington
University. In many of the cases, it was highly unlikely law
enforcment would have identified the individual involved without
the DNA database.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Danny Keith Hooks, who last September was
convicted of killing five women in Oklahoma in 1992. The only lead
investigators had was some blood at the scene. The DNA in the blood
went into the DNA database and in 1997 California officials matched
it to that of Hooks, a prisoner who had been convicted of rape in
California and who, before being released in 1995, had been forced
to give a DNA sample. Once identified, Hooks was arrested and
returned to Oklahoma to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the case of Gerald Parker, whose identification was
California's first so-called ``cold hit.'' Officials found that the
DNA database linked Parker, a convicted murderer, to the 1979
murders of a woman and her baby in Orange County. As a result,
Kevin Lee Green _ who had served 17 years for the murders _ was set
free.
</P>
<P>
   DNA matching has even proved useful even here in Massachusetts
where _ despite the court ban _ samples can still be collected from
people who authorities have reason to believe commited a crime.
Thus, when Edmund Burke was arrested for the murder 75-year-old
Irene Kennedy in a Walpole park in December, and bite marks found
on the victim matched his dental charts, he was forced to give a
DNA sample. It worked to his advantage: samples taken from saliva
on the victim did not match Burke's and he was freed.
</P>
<P>
   If the state was able to build a large database _ about 1,100
samples were taken from prisoners when the DNA database law was
enacted, but an injunction issued over a year ago halted the
practice _ it is conceivable that it might one day contain a match
to the saliva left on Kennedy's body.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, say that while DNA can be a useful law
enforcement tool _ and suspects with ``probable cause'' should be
forced to give samples _ the Massachusetts law is poorly written,
encompasses too many types of crime, and could permit the samples
to be used for research, not just identification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts ought to start over'' and rewrite the law, says
Dr. Paul Billings, a medical geneticist and director of the Council
for Responsible Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   If the SJC upholds Borenstein's ruling against the current law,
then Massachusetts could fall even further behind the rest of the
nation. Earlier this month, at the request of Attorney General
Janet Reno, the National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence
began considering whether authorities should take samples from
indivudals at the time of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to consider if it is constitutional, to what
extent it might be an unlawful search and seizure, and we need to
look at fingerprinting for some guidance,'' says Christopher H.
Asplen, executive director of the National Commission on the Future
of DNA Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next class of consideration is the societal privacy
issues. Do we want to do it? What needs to be done to make it a
pure private system? Is the benefit to society worth the cost of
perceived infringement of society?
</P>
<P>
   ``And the third category, from a practical standpoint, is what
does this mean? The big database issue right now is, nationally we
have backlog of more than 450,000 samples. There are more than
450,000 blood samples or swabs (taken from inside the mouth) that
sit untested and not put into the database.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was the rush by state legislatures,
including Massachusetts, to enact DNA database legislation to
ensure that they continued to receive federal funding for law
enforcement. State labs were not prepared for the immediate
avalanche of samples.
</P>
<P>
   Asplen said if nothing is done to speed up data entry _ such as
hiring private labs to do much more of the work (which could
increase the liklihood of abuses of the data for research) _ it
will take between four and six years to enter all the existing
samples, as well as new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a guy convicted of one of the enumerated crimes,
convicted, say, of rape, and his blood is drawn on release, but it
sits in storage for two years and he re-offends,'' says Asplen.
``Let's say you get a good sample from the crime scene, it is
entered into the database and nothing happens. Now, if he does it
again, when you get to victim number two, that would have been a
completely preventable crime. The guy would have been stopped after
the first one. We are in a position where we will have to say to
the victim, we are sorry this guy got to you, or your daughter,
because of the backlog.''
</P>
<P>
   Further compounding the backlog, the FBI system uses a DNA
analysis method that provides less information than the one now
favored. So much of the data entered under the initial system must
be redone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about privacy and constitutionality, taking
samples at the time of arrest is gaining supporters around the
country. It's already done in Louisiana, and in New York police
commissioner Howard Safir created a furor late last year when he
suggested doing the same thing in an effort to continue to bring
down the city's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   There is no data to suggest that DNA databases act as a
deterrent to crime _ other than to get a criminal off the streets,
so he can't repeat his offense _ but their effectiveness as a tool
in investigations is considerable. Even in Massachusetts, where the
offender database is so limited, the separate data base collected
from crime scenes provided evidence linking five murder-rapes in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues here, supporters point to the example of
England, which has the oldest and largest DNA database in the
world. There are some 475,000 profiles in the database in England
and around 700 matches are made each week, with, on average, a 40
percent chance a stain found at a crime scene will match a name in
the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science is there, if you can maintain the integrity of the
database,'' says Essex County District Attorney Kevin Burke, who
turned to DNA analysis to find who raped a comatose woman in a
Lawrence nursing home. ``It makes all the sense in the world,
especially with sexual offenders. If you did nothing but limit it
those convicted of sexual offenses, you would be doing the
Commonwealth a big favor.''

SENATORS LEAN ON OLYMPICS TO REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the International Olympic Committee gathers this week in
Switzerland to expel wrongdoers and repair its reputation, it will
do so under threat of action by members of Congress poised to force
fundamental changes in how the Olympics does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant (IOC) dependency on the United States
that gives the United States significant interests,'' said Senator
John McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential ambitions.
``We're not asking for the United States to control the Olympics.
But I think American interests should beneficially impress upon
them the need to clean up the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That dependency, as McCain sees it, results from simple
economics: 60 percent of the money that fuels the Olympics comes
from US sources. IOC officials called that figure exaggerated but
would not elaborate. United States Olympic Committee officials,
however, said the amount is closer to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC jealously guards its finances _ a source of irritation
among investigators examining vote-selling allegations _ but there
is general agreement that the Olympics would essentially cease to
function without the roughly $450 million paid every four years by
US-based corporations that are nine of the IOC's 11 chief sponsors,
and the $3.5 billion in television rights fees paid by NBC to
broadcast the Games through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   New concerns about where that money goes, and what the United
States gets in return, have arisen as an outgrowth of the scandal
involving alleged bribery of IOC members by Salt Lake City
organizers and other would-be Olympic hosts. In response, McCain,
as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, has scheduled an
April 14 hearing on the Olympics and plans to invite IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the question he wants answered is whether the IOC
has proven itself so inept at controlling itself and the Games that
Congress should seek to redirect some portion of the American
money, most likely away from the IOC and toward its US affiliate,
the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain and Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who is
the chief author of federal laws governing amateur athletics, are
insisting that the IOC _ starting with its meeting this week _ take
what McCain called ``appropriate steps'' toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   By their definition, that means adopting the proposals outlined
in a report two weeks ago by former Maine senator George Mitchell,
which include major changes in the way IOC members are chosen, term
limits, greater financial accountability, and strict enforcement of
rules on gift-giving and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This week, at least, Mitchell's report is not on the IOC's
agenda, which focuses primarily on dealing with six IOC members
facing expulsion, changing the way host cities are chosen, and
creating a commission to consider ethical and other reform issues,
possibly including Henry Kissinger as a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used diplomatic language to warn of consequences if the
Mitchell report is not addressed. ``I would deeply regret that, and
I would urge them to seriously consider every recommendation of the
(Mitchell) commission,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to limit his options, but the Senate committee's
staff director, Mark Buse, said failure by the IOC to act
decisively might prompt the senators to consider legislation that
would remove the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States,
depriving it of millions of dollars in tax breaks on the
sponsorship deals with US-based corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do anything that would damage or hurt the
Olympic movement,'' Buse said last week. ``We're trying to use our
leverage to force them to clean up their act so the Olympics will
survive and continue to prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential move by Congress would be to redirect the
money paid by NBC for Olympic television rights. Rather than have
that money paid to the IOC, the US Amateur Sports Act could be
amended to put that money under the control of the USOC, which now
receives 10 percent. If Congress altered that balance of power, the
USOC would be in a position to determine how much to give to the
IOC, how much to keep for American athletes, and how much to share
with other national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, that would greatly diminish the IOC's
power by putting the USOC on almost equal financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their image has been badly tarnished by this scandal,'' McCain
said. ``They should understand that the United States, because of
our funding, might not be more equal to others, but they shouldn't
do anything that would put that funding in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments underscore an undisputed fact of life for the
Olympics: While no nation is supposed to have preference over any
other _ nationalism is anathema to what the IOC calls ``Olympism''
_ the United States is first among equals, particularly where
finances are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials grudgingly acknowledge that fact, but also
maintain there is widespread misunderstanding about what the IOC
does with the money it receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do recognize the special nature of the United
States in the Olympic movement,'' said IOC vice president Richard
Pound. ``But if it's perceived as a US creature you lose the
international flavor and possibly the universality.''
</P>
<P>
   Added IOC marketing director Michael Payne: ``Without question,
America is the single most important market of the 200 countries''
that participate in the Olympics. However, he stressed, ``The IOC
and the Olympic Games are not supported by one dollar of taxpayer
money. It is totally privately funded. It is not like any other
international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Payne said, the IOC keeps only about 10 percent of the
money in takes in, redistributing the rest to the cities that host
the Games and to national Olympic committees, with the biggest
share already going to the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money is going to all of the countries to support their
teams,'' Payne said. ``If somebody is wanting to cut that back,
quite simply the Games won't take place because there won't be the
financial mechanisms to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no other Olympic committee gets a direct share of the
television rights, while the USOC gets 10 percent, rising to 12.5
percent in 2004, as well as millions more in IOC support. In 1988,
the USOC's share of the US television rights was $37.5 million;
that is expected to rise to $112 million in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress delves into the IOC's finances, it will find an
organization that during the current four-year period probably will
collect more than $3.6 billion in revenues. Of that, about 10
percent will remain with the IOC, and the USOC gets by far the
biggest cut of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the USOC receives its 10 percent share of the US
television rights. It also receives 20 percent of the estimated
$500 million in revenue from the 11 chief corporate sponsors. By
some estimates, the combination should give the USOC about $200
million during the current four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Other national Olympic committees complain that the United
States already gets more than its share, but from the USOC's
perspective it does not get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're resented. . . . But 70 percent of the IOC's revenue
comes from the US,'' said Richard Schultz, USOC executive director.
</P>
<P>
   It also rankles the USOC that the United States, with two IOC
representatives, has the same number of seats as countries such as
Belgium, Sweden, and Morocco, and is outgunned by Italy with four
and Switzerland with three.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy financial reliance on US-based corporations and
broadcasters can be traced to the early 1980s, the dawn of
Samaranch's reign as IOC president, when the Olympics were nearly
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the worst, Samaranch turned to his old friend, Adidas
heir Horst Dassler. Dassler had a deceptively simple solution,
translated roughly as: Go West, young man. ``To get at the big
money nowadays, one has to go international, to the big
multinationals,'' Dassler said at a 1982 meeting of an Olympic
finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was sound fiscal advice, and Samaranch followed it
religiously and successfully through the 1980s and '90s, selling
sponsorships and television rights that attracted billions of
dollars, which turned the International Olympic Committee into a
financial juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic historian John Lucas, a retired Penn State professor,
cautioned that any change in the financial balance between the IOC
and national Olympic committees, including the USOC, could have a
dangerous ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things the IOC does with its vast fortune is to
subsidize athletes. The people that would suffer the most would not
be the IOC, but the 3,500 to 4,500 male and female Olympic athletes
from the poorest countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate sponsors, meanwhile, are hoping that the IOC does
whatever is necessary to protect their mutual interest: restoring
the luster on the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what anyone is expecting from this week, but the
last thing we're expecting and the last thing we need is any more
drama,'' said Susan Rosenberg, spokeswoman for UPS, one of the
chief Olympic sponsors. ``The Olympics has been a very valuable
program for us. Whatever the IOC does, whatever Congress does, we
just don't want to see that change.''

   An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading
researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are
safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.
</P>
<P>
   In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful
of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could
point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their
poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
</P>
<P>
   With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust,
many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from
work going on at a frantic pace _ and amid much secrecy _ in
biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the
body's weight control system.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of
genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty
foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in
weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is
going to work'' to stem the soaring obesity epidemic, says David
West, a genetics researcher at Parke-Davis Laboratories in
Alamedia, Calif. ``We've been trying to change peoples' dietary
habits for years and years, but we all like high-fat food, and our
work style is such that many of us have sedentary jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping
people lose weight and keep it off. What's more promising, say West
and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic
switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and
energy in balance.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the
investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily
invested in obesity gene research.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a
mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when
eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
</P>
<P>
   The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's
involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much
fat the body stores. The discovery brings to over a dozen the
number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years
that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects
the mice against diet-induced obesity. But researchers are
confident they will in time be able to trace the different
biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be
able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be
the important regulatory devices in this system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene
is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity
drug development,'' Dr. Karen Moore, Millennium's director of
genetic systems said when making the announcement last week. ``In
developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function
rather than to try to increase it,
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the
obesity research field. Not only does it suggest that similar genes
in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay
thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide
clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require
the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
</P>
<P>
   Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that
simple to pick apart the human weight control system. ``The
majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would
explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large
number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in
combination with environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's
health _ some 55 percent, or 97 million _ of Americans are
overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was
touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New
York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a
gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to
be obese.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food
intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th
person. Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps
many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their
brains fail to signal them to stop eating. So, the reasoning went,
give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and
cause them to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc., in California,
was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical
trials. Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although
the compound has worked for some of the volunteers. Moreover, it's
been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin:
it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting
to the right receiving station.
</P>
<P>
   Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number
of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight
and energy balance. Each of these gene alterations provide clues to
how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough,
because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says
Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the
University of California in Davis.
</P>
<P>
   How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the
market is anybody's guess. ``We don't know the final chapter _
we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the
genes _ we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy
group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make
obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields
dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease
of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of
compassion'' for the overweight.

WHY IS SALT BAD FOR SOME PEOPLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why after a holiday dinner of baked ham am I so thirsty a few
hours later?
</P>
<P>
   Why is salt so bad for some people?
</P>
<P>
   C.P., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For something once so rare that Roman soldiers were paid in
units of salt, giving us the word salary, salt's gotten a pretty
bad reputation recently. The fact is, salt is not only good for
you, it's absolutely vital for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt does two things in the body. It helps us keep the right
water levels inside our cells, and out in our bloodstream,'' says
Dr. Robert Stanton, Chief of Nephrology (the study of the kidney)
at The Joslin Diabetes Center. ``Cells somehow know how big they
want to be, and our body knows what blood pressure it wants. Salt
helps us maintain both.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt is one of several kinds of particles that float around in
our bodies' fluids. If the concentration of those particles in our
bloodstream is the same as in the fluid inside our cells,
everything is fine. But when the particle concentration, known as
osmolarity, is higher on one side or the other, the extra particles
act like little magnets that pull water molecules toward them.
</P>
<P>
   When the osmolarity is higher out in the blood, for example,
salt particles pull water out of the cells and into the bloodstream
through the permeable cell membrane. If the cells lose enough water
they shrivel up and die. (Drinking salt water kills you by
dehydrating your brain cells. That's why saltwater-drinking
shipwrecked sailors go mad before they die.)
</P>
<P>
   Our cells can recognize internal and external osmolarity. When a
ham dinner raises the concentration of salt particles in the
bloodstream, the cells sense that the extra salt outside is pulling
some of its water away. They fight back. They produce organic
particles with names like taurine and betaine that hold onto water
and keep it from leaving. They also send chemical signals to the
brain that say ``Hey, the blood is too salty for us! We're drying
out! Water things down out there and get the salt levels down, will
ya?'' That signal makes us thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking fluid gets the osmolarity _ salt concentration _ in the
blood back to what the cells prefer. (Bartenders may not realize it
but they're actually serving those free salty snacks to alter your
osmolarity.)
</P>
<P>
   High blood osmolarity also triggers the brain to release an
anti-diuretic hormone. We urinate less. The body holds onto liquid,
and gradually salt concentration in the bloodstream drops back to
normal levels, about eight grams per liter. (Sea water is about
three times as salty.)
</P>
<P>
   But let's say instead of eating a salty meal, you are exercising
and sweating. You're losing water and salt. The loss of all that
water drops your blood pressure, which sends signals to the brain
that make you want to drink to replace the missing fluid. ``But
you'd better drink sweat, or something chemically like it,'' Dr.
Stanton warns. ``Something with salt in it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you only drink water, you're watering down your blood
osmolarity.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually things get saltier inside the cells. The extra salt
particles inside the cells draw water out of the bloodstream and
begin to swell. Since they don't like that either, they signal the
brain that the blood stream needs salt.
</P>
<P>
   We don't rush to find the closest bag of potato chips. Instead,
the brain tells the kidney, our body's filtration plant, to get rid
of water, but hold onto salt. Within an hour, this can start to
raise the salt concentration in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   By influencing how much water stays inside our cells, and how
much stays in the bloodstream, salt is vital for controlling
healthy cell size and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If we have all these sensitive systems for regulating the right
amount of salt, why do some scientists say salt is bad for us?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are more salt-sensitive, some are less,'' Dr.
Stanton says. ``Some of us have differing abilities to dilate our
blood vessels and regulate our blood pressure. Some of us have
differences in our hormone systems, which affect how well we can
respond to changes in salt levels.''
</P>
<P>
   So is salt the bad guy some think?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no smoking gun that's popped out,'' Dr. Stanton says.
``Some studies show salt contributes to essential hypertension,
which is high blood pressure without any secondary causes. Some
studies show it doesn't. The best thing is try higher or lower salt
levels on yourself, cautiously, and see how it affects your own
blood pressure and find the level that's right for you.''

WHY HOUND STEPHANOPOULOS FOR HIS MEA CULPA? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For sharing some of what he saw during his five
years in Bill Clinton's inner circle, George Stephanopoulos is
being called a weasel and a Judas.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe worst of all, while his former friends and colleagues ask,
``Et tu, Brute?'' longtime Clinton haters (people Stephanopoulos
presumably can't stand) are crowing, ``Welcome aboard! What took
you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   The former White House aide is hardly the first defector from
the Clinton administration. But with his book, ``All Too Human: A
Political Education,'' Stephanopoulos has become the most public
and detailed of the disgruntled alums. Until Hillary Rodham Clinton
or James Carville decide to spill their guts, he likely will own
the award for falling the furthest out of love.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply smitten with the Democratic presidential candidate in
1991, Stephanopoulos giddily jumped onto ``the Clinton roller
coaster,'' rode into the White House and stayed there until the
president's reelection in 1996. Now he says he knows that his
former boss is a bigger liar than he ever dreamed and, though he
has been ``a good president,'' he doesn't think the country should
ever have elected him.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens when a once-trusted intimate breaks rank and
hangs dirty laundry on the public line, many folks seem more
concerned with Stephanopoulos' ``betrayal'' or ``bad timing'' than
with his actual revelations. Condemnation runs from the blanket to
the remarkably petty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kennedy and Johnson aide Richard Goodwin groused:
``Who is George Stephanopoulos but another kid on the make? ... Who
would care about (him) if not for Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the scale, Philadelphia Daily News
columnist Sandy Grady felt compelled to cheap-shot Stephanopoulos
for his choice of anti-depressant: ``Zoloft (the celebrity pill
that doesn't seem to help Mike Tyson's rage).''
</P>
<P>
   What causes a person to do a 180 on someone he or she once
adored?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a matter of growing up and seeking revenge for
what is perceived of as a ``Mommy Dearest'' childhood. Sometimes
it's retaliation for being personally screwed over. (Mia Farrow and
Claire Bloom's dismembering of their famous exes come to mind.)
Sometimes it's a classic shedding of scales from the eyes, often
made easier by a stay in prison, as so many of Nixon's minions
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephanopoulos' case, the motive _ along with a $2.75 million
book advance, of course _ appears to be a kind of cathartic purge.
He isn't just disgusted with Clinton for having feet, legs and
maybe a soul of clay; he's disgusted with himself for being such a
sucker for the guy.
</P>
<P>
   For all the unattractive vignettes that Stephanopoulos has
shared of late about Clinton, he beats on himself pretty good, too.
Whether he admits to the unmacho act of bursting into tears after a
confrontation with the first lady or refers to himself as an
``enabler'' of Clinton's habitual mendacity, Stephanopoulos seems
less a cocky, self-righteous avenger than a man chanting ``mea
culpa'' and dutifully smacking himself with a cat o'nine tails.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most common criticism of Stephanopoulos has been his
timing: Why didn't he honor the unwritten code of political
aide-olotry and wait until Clinton was at least out of office?
</P>
<P>
   Why on Earth should he have waited? Out of gratitude because
Clinton plucked him from obscurity and rewarded his hard work with
a high-profile staff position?
</P>
<P>
   Out of allegiance to the noble end that he and departed staffers
like Dee Dee Myers, Robert Reich and Mike McCurry must once have
believed justified any means?
</P>
<P>
   Because his former boss has set such a potent example of
trustworthiness and straight shooting among his inner circle?
</P>
<P>
   Because negative revelations will threaten the pristine image of
``The Presidency'' that eight or nine Americans might still harbor?
</P>
<P>
   Those who would condemn Stephanopoulos ought to remember a
couple of things.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine loyalty is like faith: You can't buy or coerce it. You
have to build, maintain and guard it so that it can be relied on
when the sun disappears and the going gets brutal.
</P>
<P>
   Even in modern politics, you get what you sow.
</P>

BLACK HOLE IS HOME FOR OLD TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Nothing on Edward Grothus's property is
radioactive, but all of it is nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot of his aptly named Black Hole warehouse looks
like a post-nuclear junkyard _ as if the atomic bomb had been
dropped on the very laboratories where it was first developed.
</P>
<P>
   There are fireproof, waterproof, no doubt blastproof, filing
cabinets. There are computer desks and office chairs and exercise
bicycles for scientists who had so much highly classified material
to read that they couldn't pedal outdoors. Inside is even worse,
17,000 square feet of alphabetized castoffs, from alarms to motors
and meters to xyz plotters, whatever those are.
</P>
<P>
   All of it was bought for pennies on the dollar from Los Alamos
National Laboratory, where computers considered cutting edge on
Jan. 1 are past their prime by Dec. 31. And all of it is for sale.
The cheapest item, a tiny electrical component called a resistor,
goes for one cent. The crogenic dewar, a large thingamajig for
storing liquid nitrogen, tops the price list at $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's stuff is out this year, so they get rid of it,''
said Grothus, 75, a former machinist who put in 20 years at the
lab. ``So I made a business out of buying last year's technology
and finding homes for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his customers, he said, are colleges and universities
worldwide. Set designers have made their way to the Black Hole,
whose merchandise has appeared as props in ``Silkwood,'' ``The
Manhattan Project,'' and other movies. Collectors looking for a
'50s-style drafting table or the perfect high-voltage vacuum relay
have found them here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the city of Los Alamos, which this year celebrates its 50th
anniversary, Grothus has been filling the Black Hole for half a
century. The Iowa native moved to the Jemez Mountains 35 miles
northwest of Santa Fe in 1949, drawn like thousands of others by
the chance to help make H-bomb history. Ten years later, while
keeping his day job measuring the hydrodynamics of nuclear
implosions, he realized that there was profit to be made from
another kind of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more artifacts than the Bradbury Museum downtown,''
said Grothus, opening a door into a room filled with the choicest
collectibles. ``I have the real museum. All this time I've been
stashing away the artifacts of the nuclear age.''
</P>
<P>
   To put the years in perspective, Grothus mentioned that when he
started at the Lab, as it's known around the one-company town, the
bombs being built were as big as Volkswagens. By the time he quit,
a half-dozen could fit on his desk. But by then, he wanted nothing
to do with nuclear proliferation. Even before a Lab employee was
fired last week on suspicion of selling nuclear secrets to the
Chinese, Grothus had decided that the entire operation was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Grothus prides himself on being an outspoken antinuke
activist, making him something of a rarity, if not a pariah, in a
city where almost every other adult is connected to the Lab. To
mark the anniversaries of the two bombs dropped on Japan, he holds
a demonstration at the pond in the center of town every Aug. 6 and
9. He also jokes that every Sunday, he holds an ``anticritical
mass'' in a former church he owns nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost all my faith in the schemes and dreams of nuclear
weapons and nuclear power,'' said Grothus, who wears a button on
his flannel shirt asking people to speak up because he is hard of
hearing. ``First, only a madman would use a bomb, because what
would he gain? Second, nuclear plants have waste, and there's no
good place to put it. And the power plant itself has a limited
lifetime. Where are we supposed to put that when we're done with
it?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grothus, of course, is happy to take the safe stuff himself,
although the Lab recently began using an Albuquerque auction house
to sell equipment it no longer wants. All that's left for him to
buy nowadays is used office furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Grothus said he expects to be around to hassle pronuclear
administrations for years to come. Turning on a Geiger counter, he
noted that the low click-clicks indicated everyday background
radiation. It's not dangerous, he said. Then he said he used to
handle depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lab raised thousands of generations of mice, proving a
little radiation is good for you,'' Grothus said. ``So I'm shooting
for 110 because of what I've handled.''

PRESCRIPTIONS: A MEDICAL DRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Mrs. G.L. died last month in a central Massachusetts
nursing home, attendants gathered her unused stockpile of
prescription medicines _ $142.30 worth, nearly all still sealed in
sterile bubble-packs _ and literally flushed it down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every day in nursing homes across the nation.
Millions of dollars' worth of costly medication goes down the drain
daily. By one estimate, the waste in Massachusetts exceeds $27,000
a day, $10 million a year. Nobody really knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown away antibiotic pills worth $75 apiece,'' says
Francoise Levesque, a Whitinsville nurse who is trying to change
the current throwaway system and allow unused prescription drugs to
be recycled.
</P>
<P>
   The trillion-dollar-a-year US health system is notorious for its
inequities. But the contrast between waste and want couldn't be
more stark than it is right now, as thousands of Bay State elders
struggle to pay escalating pharmacy bills with sharply reduced
assistance from HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Other coverage plans, they're finding, are either restricted to
the poorest elders or are financially out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross-Blue Shield officials agree that's the reason why
consumer inquiries about its Medex Gold unlimited drug coverage _
the annual open enrollment period ends on March 31 _ are up only
five to seven percent this year, despite the fact that 60,000 HMO
``senior plan'' subscribers lost similar coverage on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   The annual premium for Blue Cross-Blue Shield's Medex Gold Went
up March 15 from $3,126 to $3,435. Not surprisingly, the number of
elders buying nongroup Medex Gold coverage dropped by 20 percent
between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So while nursing homes routinely throw away medicine worth
thousands of dollars, Bernice Speliotis of Lynn is struggling to
pay her monthly $400 prescription costs on a pharmacy allowance
from Tufts Health Plan's Secure Horizons, her HMO, of $41.67 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some elders who have never touched a gun are wondering if they
should join the National Rifle Association so they might qualify
for a new medigap drug plan from Allianz Life Insurance Co. that
costs $2,664 a year, which is available to NRA members.
</P>
<P>
   And Victor Pelletier, an 88-year-old Marlborough, Mass. man, is
watching his Visa bill swell with pharmacy charges no longer
covered by Fallon Community Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fallon used to pay part of it but now I have to pay out of my
own pocket,'' he says, referring to $4,000 in annual drug costs for
himself and his wife Lucille. ``I can't afford to keep up with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pelletiers' $22,000-a-year income is just $300 above the
eligibility limit for a makeshift, one-year assistance program for
low-income elders put into place this year when Fallon and other
Massachusetts HMOs abruptly cancelled unlimited drug coverage. Such
programs take only income into account, not pharmacy bills or other
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Massachusetts HMOs were compelled to offer such
generous pharmacy benefits. But the HMOs cancelled unlimited drug
coverage in January after Congress and a federal judge overturned
the state law.
</P>
<P>
   While terminating unlimited drug coverage, the HMOs extended
modest new pharmacy benefits to all 180,000 Medicare beneficiaries
enrolled in senior plans, only about one-third of whom had paid
$840 to $1,000 a year for the now-defunct full drug benefits. HMOs
point out that the new zero-premium drug benefits makes most of
their senior plan members better off than they were, elder
advocates and state officials say they're being overwhelmed by
people in urgent need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $600 to $800 a year that HMOs allow doesn't begin to cover
many people's medication needs,'' reports Jackie Anthony, a nurse
at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center who works fulltime to
help the most desperate patients qualify for drug manufacturers'
little-known drug giveaway programs. ``People can't afford these
medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the SHINE program, a state counselling service whose
name stands for Serving Health Information Needs of Elders, have
quadrupled since January. ``Some of our centers are serving more
people in one month than they did in all of last year,'' says
Marion Aspinall, a SHINE program manager.
</P>
<P>
   SHINE counsellors around the state say they can search out
partway solutions for some elders. One such partial-success story
illustrates the hit-or-miss nature of the current patchwork. An
anonymous man volunteered last Friday to help Constance Rubin of
Framingham with her crushing $2,840-a-month medication bills after
he saw a television report on her plight.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly any way to deal with the larger problem. But the
alternatives are spotty, at least until Beacon Hill lawmakers craft
whatever reforms are possible at the state level while Congress
begins the lengthy debate about adding some drug coverage to the
financially shaky Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   That task is daunting. State legislators, who will consider at
least seven reform proposals at a March 30 Statehouse hearing, are
still uncertain how ambitious they'll dare to be. ``It's hard to
say exactly where it will come out,'' says state Senator Mark
Montigny, a New Bedford Democrat who heads the powerful Senate Ways
and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the prospects are even murkier. A 17-member
special commission on Medicare reform is reportedly near deadlock,
and a key issue is whether to add drug benefits to the program.
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians grapple with the issue, advocates can only
steer elders with low incomes to little-known sources of help, such
as the state's under-used Senior Pharmacy program, or last-resort
drug company giveaway plans. The Senior Pharmacy plan, funded with
$30 million in state tobacco tax money, offers up to $750 a year in
support, but only to those with incomes under 150 percent of the
poverty level ($12,078 for singles, $16,290 for couples).
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pharmacy rules out assistance for anyone with any other
drug coverage, however inadequate. But state officials said last
week that elders who have a current Senior Pharmacy card may use
it, even if they now qualify for the HMOs' new capped drug coverage
that began January 1. And in July, when current Senior Pharmacy
cards expire, ``our expectation is that current members will be
able to reenroll,'' said Derrek Shulman, a spokesman for the
Executive Office of Elder Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many elders' incomes are too high to qualify them
for Senior Pharmacy, Medicaid, or other existing programs _ but not
high enough to afford comprehensive medigap policies or thousands
of dollars in annual pharmacy bills. Even five years ago, before a
spate of new drugs inflated pharmacy costs sharply, US elders with
incomes under $16,104 ($21,720 for couples) were spending
one-quarter of their income on out-of-pocket medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, patients, doctors, nurses, social workers, and
advocates can look forward to more scrambling _ and maybe to such
creative partial solutions as a way to recapture those pills now
going down nursing home toilets, although that too is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run around to our medicine cabinets'' for free samples,
says Mary Abate, a patient advocate at East Boston Neighborhood
Health Center, where staffers even dig into their own pockets for
emergency pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could name a half-dozen people, and I'm sure there are many
more, who say, `I'm only taking one pill a day instead of two and I
cut that one in half.' I beg them not to do that,'' Abate says.
``Just the other day one woman said to me, `I beg you to help me.'
It tears me apart that people have to beg for medicine.''

SHAHEEN'S SENSIBLE APPROACH TO N.H.'S SCHOOL FUNDING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen was
patiently explaining her sensible proposal to reform public school
funding the other day when a fellow of libertarian bent asked if
``none of the above'' could be a choice for voters should they get
the issue in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have you been?'' the governor shot back with more
amazement than pique. ``That is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, in a policy conundrum that has national
attention, that is both accurate and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that because of last year's state Supreme Court
decision declaring unconstitutional the property tax-based method
of paying for schools, doing nothing is incompatible with getting
right with the law. But it's also true that schemes are being
floated to evade the state's duty in whole or in part, in deference
to New Hampshire's infamous tax theology. That theology is clashing
with a deeper commitment to the state's future, in which education
is center-stage. And the clash has created a golden opportunity for
centrist leaders like Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the cliche rules that the devil is in the details of
major policy proposals. In her case, it's the virtue. Ever since
the court decision last year that New Hampshire's nearly complete
reliance on the property tax creates disparities among cities and
towns that illegally mock any pretense of equal opportunity,
Shaheen has tried to offer solutions that correct the inequity
without breaking the state's tradition and her campaign pledges to
go without sales and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As the court's April 1 deadline for compliance nears, the only
viable alternative to the governor's proposal of a mixture of new
revenue sources turns out to be an income tax. And, amazingly, that
is what barely slipped past the the lower house of the Legislature
this month via Democratic and moderate Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the subject of local and national astonishment, but the
reaction missed the point that as legislation, Shaheen will veto
it, which makes its passage by the newly Democratic state senate
doubtful and irrelvant.
</P>
<P>
   However, as one alternative that rises to the Supreme Court's
challenge, the income tax more than qualifies as a choice for the
voters in a referendum, which Shaheen would like to arrange to
decide this momentous question. For the moment, the big question is
whether the court will permit the people to make that judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The other alternative, if the judges permit, would be Shaheen's,
which seeks to spread the mild pain around the state without
dipping directly into workers' paychecks. To date, what the
governor has done is show that this can be done fairly _ no mean
feat.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaheen notes, what is required by the court's decision is
the replacement by state funds of the current reliance on widely
disparate local property tax revenues for education _ not extra
spending per se. Using a commission's expertise, the money needed
to finance adequate schooling was found to be slightly less than
$900 million, or about 4550 per pupil. And since the state is
already spending roughly $100 million on education, that leaves
nearly $800 million to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of money, almost as much as the amount of purely
state money now in the overall New Hampshire budget. But Shaheen
shows it can be done in ways that would have less impact on working
families than direct income taxes. Half, for example, would come
from a statewide property tax of $6 per thousand in assessed value
that would actually slash taxes for people and businesses in more
than 80 percent of the state's communities. Even many Republicans
are for this.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy appears to flow from three ideas that
legitimately raise concerns, except when compared to the
alternative:
</P>
<P>
   --$145 million from putting nearly 3,800 slot machines at the
state's four racetracks. From the reaction in some hyperventilated
quarters, you'd think Shaheen wanted a casino in every garage.
</P>
<P>
   --$91 million from replacing existing business levies with a
single tax based on value. It's efficient (as several other states
have discovered), permits a higher threshhold for taxation that
exempts thousands more small businesses, and its net burden is
considerably reduced by the property tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   --$73 million from the addition of a capital-gains tax to the
existing 5 percent levies on interest and dividends. But with
higher personal, elderly, and disabled exemptions, it will be
possible to raise the earnings threshhold for all three taxes
signficantly, which will be deductible on federal returns, with
sales of primary residences totally exempt.
</P>
<P>
   You could argue that an income tax is simpler, but you would
have trouble arguing it is more fair. What is undeniable is that
these are the responsible choices and the people deserve the
ultimate power.
</P>
<P>
   As for the right, they can continue to erect roadblocks and
offer nonsolutions. But the remarkable history of Shaheen's success
teaches that they will do so at their peril.

 LOCAL POLITICS, LOCAL CARES
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is conventional wisdom: At century's end, Americans have
soured on politics. In our brokers, we place our trust. In the
market, we secure our future.
</P>
<P>
   But someone forgot to tell Becky Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   In her kitchen on a recent weekday morning, a half-dozen jittery
candidates were discussing campaign strategy. In her sunroom, a
dozen animated strangers were stuffing prestamped envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   Around her dining room table, women were bent over voter
registration lists, addressing postcards to their neighbors to
solicit support for would-be members of the School Committee, the
Library Board, the Recreation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, a frenetic campaign manager had a cell phone
to his ear and a pen in his hand, hustling an endorsement from the
local state rep for one of the candidates on his slate.
</P>
<P>
   This is political activism, suburban style.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be dulled by postimpeachment malaise. New
Hampshire may be numbed by ever earlier prepresidential primary
visitors. But, in community after community where voters will
assemble in Town Meeting this month and next to make decisions
about everything from library construction to tree maintenance,
there is no shortage of political energy.
</P>
<P>
   In one suburb west of Boston, Becky Epstein's home has served
for weeks as campaign central for several of the 15 candidates
vying for six open seats on various boards in town.
</P>
<P>
   People _ women, mostly _ sat on the floor around the coffee
table in her family room, pasting address labels on campaign fliers
with a dispatch that would be the envy of most assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein did not know many of her house guests, but she knew why
all of them were there: the need to build new classrooms in a
well-regarded public school system that is beginning to strain at
the seams. Electing like-minded neighbors to related committees in
town could mean the difference between a son or a daughter learning
to read alongside 20 classmates instead of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Try mobilizing a similarly motivated campaign staff around
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The political cynicism that has characterized Washington in the
wake of l'affaire Lewinsky is, in large measure, a Beltway
phenomenon. The public's disgust with the president's recklessness
and its even greater dismay with the partisan reaction of the
Republican Congress has not caused the much-heralded death of
politics in America.
</P>
<P>
   At home, in our communities, we are still turning to politics as
the single most effective tool to bind us in common cause. Should
we build a new library or expand the old? Should we rely on private
concerns to provide recreational facilities for our teenagers or
construct public community centers? Should we restrict development
to preserve open space or build critically needed low-cost housing
units instead? Should we raise taxes to build a new school or use
modular classrooms until the baby boomlet passes through?
</P>
<P>
   That every woman in Becky Epstein's home kept one eye on her
watch was a measure of how personal she considered the political
stakes in one town's election. It was an early release day at the
elementary schools. The minivans and Range Rovers would be backing
out of Becky's driveway by noon, campaign workers transformed back
into mothers, deserting her kitchen for their own to prepare lunch
for the returning grade school hordes.
</P>
<P>
   The women would be back the next morning and the next, writing
campaign ads, soliciting contributions, building signs, and
delivering them to neighbors willing to stake them on their front
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   It was deceptively sunny on Election Day. Campaign veterans
turned up for their one- and two-hour shifts as sign holders at
polling places, supermarkets, and the town dump in down parkas, fur
hats, woolen mittens, and fleece-lined boots.
</P>
<P>
   At Precinct F, the pros cringed at the sight of a bare-headed
political novice in patent-leather flats and thin gloves, frozen
despite the coffee being dispensed regularly by other volunteers
from the back of Land Cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first political campaign?'' they sighed. ``First rule of
sign-holding: mittens, not gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 29 percent of the town's 15,400 registered voters cast
ballots that day. But that's up from 24 percent in the last
townwide election two years ago. It just might be that Becky
Epstein's kitchen campaign operation accounts for the increase. And
all her candidates won.

GOP MODERATES GAIN IN APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to thanking President Clinton and his Democratic
colleagues in Congress, Vice President Albert Arnold Gore Jr. can
also thank the ultra-right-wing Republicans for further enhancing
his chances to be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his potential chief rival, Texas Governor George W.
Bush, can also thank the ultra-right-wing Republicans for
self-destructing over the impeachment process and enabling both
himself and his moderate-to-conservative colleagues in the party to
gain more control over the GOP's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is likely to end up the chief beneficiary, because the
Republicans' failed effort to nullify an election by removing
Clinton from office is likely to bring a larger number of Democrats
to the polls in 2000 to vent their anger. This not only bodes well
for Gore, the party's probable nominee, it may also bode well for
Democrats in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ who lost five House seats in November _ can expect
to lose more seats in 2000 because of their continued efforts to
remove Clinton, despite the strong objections of the majority
electorate. Some pundits bluntly predict that voter anger at the
GOP will result in the Democrats regaining control of both chambers
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Bush's status as a moderate will prevent voters from
voting Democratic. Even if Bush wins the presidency, some pundits
predict, the GOP will still lose the House and Senate, because it
was the right-wing element in the House and Senate, not Bush, that
was responsible for the impeachment debacle.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, there was one vote during the impeachment process
that may prove to be of enormous help in his bid to succeed
Clinton. That vote, which came after the GOP fell short of a
majority on the perjury charge, was the 50-to-50 vote that also
fell far short of the two-thirds necessary to convict Clinton on
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped for at least least one more vote so that
they could claim that at least a majority of 51 senators had voted
for conviction _ a fact they could then use against Democrats in
2000. But they fell short of the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat sapped the political strength from the ultra- right
wing, fragmented the Republican Party, and gave the moderates a new
opportunity to regain control and elect one of its own as the next
president.
</P>
<P>
   Also helped by the self-destruction of the GOP right is
Elizabeth Dole, who hopes to become the nation's first woman
president. She, like Bush, is not expected to be actively supported
by the party's right-wing element.
</P>
<P>
   Polls are showing them to be considered serious contenders,
suggesting that voters who once may have supported right-wing
Republicans are now looking to more moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While some pundits suggest a Dole-Bush ticket could be the
combination for victory in 2000, even more believe a Bush-Dole
ticket could pose an even stronger challenge to Gore, regardless of
who he chooses to be his running mate, unless it is a woman whose
political profile is equal to Dole's.
</P>
<P>
   If he is to win the presidency, Gore knows he must continue the
policies that worked for Clinton, even in the lowest period of his
political life. While the other announced Democratic hopeful,
former US Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, is not expected to
seriously threaten Gore's bid for the nomination, there is another
man he cannot afford to ignore: Jesse L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The loyal black support that Clinton has enjoyed during his
tenure could go to Gore, depending on how well he can work with
Jackson, regardless of whether Jackson becomes a candidate himself,
or remains an activist during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows that he will need black support to help counter the
strong Latino vote Bush is expected to receive if he becomes the
GOP nominee. Such support could be decisive in a close election.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing members of the GOP can thank themselves for
giving blacks and Latinos plenty of reasons to vote for a Gore or
Bush presidency next year, and against any candidate that espouses
ultra-right-wing views.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Gore wins the Democratic nomination, and Bush wins the
Republican nomination, they might consider a joint statement
thanking the ultra-right wing for helping to make it happen.

`RESCUE' NEEDS MORE THAN AN IV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RESCUE 77 
Starring: Marjorie Monaghan, Christian Kane, Victor Browne, Richard
Roundtree 
On: WB 
Time: Premieres Monday, then moves to Tuesdays at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rescue 77'' is the latest pretty-people series from Aaron
Spelling, producer of hits like ``Melrose Place'' and ``Beverly
Hills 90210'' and misses like ``Malibu Shores'' and ``Sunset
Beach.'' Without any melodramatic sizzle, camp splash, or engaging
medical drama, ``Rescue 77'' promises to land in the misses pile
with a big fat thud.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to reinvent the 1970s action series ``Emergency''
for the 1990s, tracking the daily life-saving adventures of a team
of paramedics in LA. The three young do-gooders of ``Rescue 77''
are the quirky and handsome Wick Lobo, the heroic and handsome
Michael Bell, and the emotional and pretty Kathryn Ryan. Looked
down upon by the firefighters with whom they share the fire
station, they are defensive about their role in emergency response
and like to go off on self-righteous tirades ending with ``We
always come.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio sleep in the same room at the fire station, which may
come in handy for Michael and Kathryn, who may have a budding
attraction. Kathryn is the most interesting character, just back
from a nervous breakdown after a disaster involving the death of
children.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene typical of the show's shoddy scripting, the station
captain has Ryan read her own psychological history out loud,
obviously for the sake of the viewer. He needn't have bothered.

DIANE WARREN KNOWS THE SCORE FOR REALSONGS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes Warren Hit List sidebar)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The coffee-stained Baldwin piano, on which Diane
Warren writes her many hits, sits in a cramped room that she calls
``the Cave.'' Cassette tapes are stacked everywhere. Tattered
curtains cover the windows. It looks like a disheveled college
dorm, rather than what it really is: the epicenter of a
multimillion-dollar empire that has forged hits for Aerosmith,
Celine Dion, Toni Braxton, Brandy, Cher, Gloria Estefan, and others
too numerous to mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a magic in here,'' says Warren, an engaging workaholic
who spends 12 to 14 hours six days a week in the Cave, cranking out
hits that have earned her every accolade _ and some backlash _ from
a music community that views her as the queen of radio pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane is America's top songwriter _ wonderfully talented,
creatively inspired, and endearingly neurotic,'' says Clive Davis,
president of Arista Records, for which she wrote a No. 1 hit,
``Unbreak My Heart,'' sung by Toni Braxton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane is beyond neurotic,'' says Tommy Mottola, president of
Sony Records, for which she wrote ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing''
for Aerosmith. And he means this as a compliment: ``She's the kind
of person who, after she plays you a song, will still play it five
more times. And when you tell her it's going to be a No. 1 smash,
she'll say, `But do you really love it? Do you want to hear it
again?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Warren first pitched ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' to Mottola
over the phone. The two of them speak four to five times a week to
discuss what she's writing at her music-publishing company,
Realsongs, which she operates from an eighth-floor office on Sunset
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the song and put it on hold,'' says Mottola. Then the
opportunity to land it on the ``Armageddon'' soundtrack emerged,
and Mottola thought of various artists who might record it, before
settling on Aerosmith. The song became Aerosmith's first No. 1 hit
and was nominated for a Grammy for song of the year (losing to ``My
Heart Will Go On'' from ``Titanic''), plus just received an Oscar
nomination for best song in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she tailored the song for Aerosmith, Warren answers no.
``I like to write the song first. I don't like to tie it to
anyone,'' says the 42-year-old California native. ``It's the idea
that if you build it, they will come. Someone will make it their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with the Aerosmith hit. ``Steven Tyler
really made the song his own,'' she says, noting that he was in
tears after recording it.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as a surprise when she hears that Tyler, during a
recent backstage press conference at the Grammys, said that
Aerosmith didn't plan to do any more of her songs. ``We've already
sold out enough,'' Tyler said, illustrating the backlash that
Warren has sometimes faced in being America's most mainstream,
pop-ballad songwriter. While many extol her talent, other critics
label her songs schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not new. That was happening 10 years ago,'' says
Warren, whose first hit was ``Solitaire,'' for Laura Branigan, in
1981, followed by ``Rhythm of the Night,'' for DeBarge. ``I prefer
someone to like what I do if they're going to record it. I don't
want anyone to be forced to sing one of my songs.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Aerosmith: ``If selling out is having the greatest hit of
your career, and selling out more concerts than ever, then that's a
strange thing for him to say. I don't mean to go off, but I'm just
reacting. I would think that people should be more appreciative.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, who is known for sometimes blurting things out, did admit
that Warren's tune ``was the right song for the right movie at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand where Steven's frustration comes from,'' says
Warren. ``I understand that it's probably weird for him. It's their
first No. 1 record, and it probably got more attention than they
wanted it to. But it's a fact that it's their biggest hit, though
people out there in the world don't really care who wrote it. Most
fans probably think Aerosmith wrote it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Healthy bank account &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warren adds that Tyler's bank account was no doubt helped by the
song. And she doesn't have to add that so was hers. A worldwide hit
can, for the writer, generate $2 million to $3 million in record
royalties and radio, TV, and live performance fees. And Warren has
had many of them, including ``Because You Loved Me,'' for Celine
Dion (from the ``Up Close and Personal'' soundtrack), ``How Do I
Live,'' for both Trisha Yearwood and LeAnn Rimes, and the latest,
``Have You Ever,'' for Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Warren controls all of her own publishing, her efforts
have made Realsongs the most successful female-owned business in
the music industry, according to The Los Angeles Times. Her company
occupies an entire floor of a high-rise building, and she's
assisted by a staff of 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being successful means I'm good at what I do,'' says Warren,
who may be eccentric but is driven to excel. ``I've always wanted
to be successful. I've always wanted people to hear my songs. I
don't write in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane is unfairly maligned sometimes by people with snobbish
attitudes,'' says Roy Lott, president of Capitol Records. ``She's a
classic pop-radio songwriter whose lyrics impact regular folks.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any elitist critics taking shots at her, Mottola says,
``Good, I hope they continue to do that and she gives us more
songs. This is a hit-driven business _ and Diane Warren writes
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren grew up in Van Nuys, Calif., wanting to be a songwriter
from as early as she can remember. ``I was also a rebel,' she says.
``I got kicked out of some schools. I never liked school very much.
I went to four years of college, but I never graduated. My dad said
he'd support me financially if I went to college. I just took film
classes and watched movies while I sat in the back writing lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had only one music-theory class in my life _ one little
semester, which I didn't pay much attention to,'' she adds. ``I'm
basically self-taught. I taught myself piano and guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she studied the Beatles and Motown artists,
especially Stevie Wonder. ``I had older sisters in the house and
they always had records. And I'd always see who wrote the records.
I was fascinated by the person writing the songs.''

<P>
   She's also fascinated by hard work. The only time she takes off
is on Sundays, when she leaves her home in the Hollywood Hills to
go to her Malibu condo and walk the beach. Otherwise, she's working
(``I'd go crazy if I took much time off'') and confesses that she's
sacrificed a social life in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can focus on is songwriting,'' says Warren,
who also wrote three songs for Whitney Houston's new album, another
two for Deborah Cox's new disc, and one for Kiss's upcoming
soundtrack to the film ``Detroit Rock City,'' two for Latin star
Ricky Martin's next album, and an undetermined number for 'N Sync's
next CD.
</P>
<P>
   Her reach is extraordinary, since she's notched hits on the pop,
country, R&AMP;B, adult-contemporary, and Latin charts. ``I've also
done stuff on CeCe Winans's record and Jennifer Holliday's gospel
record,'' Warren says. ``And I was up for a Dove award (for gospel)
a few years ago for something I did with Michael W. Smith. I was
probably the only Jew in the place.''
</P>
<P>
   As for technique, she writes one song at a time and typically
writes melody and lyrics simultaneously, rather than one or the
other first. Some songs take a long time _ she took two weeks on
just a single verse for ``Rhythm of the Night'' _ but others, like
``Because You Loved Me,'' for Dion, went quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A song has a life of its own. It's going to take as long as it
takes. There's no set time,'' she says. ``Sometimes they're
stubborn little creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, she excuses herself from the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird. I'm restless. I'm getting restless right now,''
she concludes. ``I'm writing a song that's really cool and part of
me wants to be in there finishing it.''

`WATERBOY' ALL OLD GAGS; `BULWORTH' HAS WIT, STYLE

   NEW RELEASES: ``The Waterboy'' _ Adam Sandler fans made this
comedy a huge hit in theaters. And they will probably make this
silly story of a football nerd a bigger hit on home video. But I
think it's more for pre-teens and teens than for adults. We've seen
all these gags before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' _ Director-star Warren Beatty had the bad luck to
produce a political satire during a period when no satire could
compete with the real thing. It's a marvelous movie with great wit
and style.
</P>
<P>
   ``101 Dalmatians'' _ The 1961 animated film, not the recent and
disappointing live-action remake, ranks with Disney's best
feature-length cartoons. Cruella De Vil, the dog-stealing,
fur-coat-wearing, most-wanted poster girl for PETA, is one of
Disney's most heinous villains. And the dogs are adorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Man on Campus'' _ Dead movie at box office. For those who
believe that no comedy is too moronic to make money, I offer this
corpse as proof that moviegoers aren't as dumb as Hollywood thinks.
Don't get me wrong: Even suicide can be played for comedy if it's
funny. This isn't.

CONTROL FREAK KUBRICK LEFT A REMARKABLE BODY OF WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's life ended with an ironic neatness that I like
to think would have made the old controlmeister smile. He lived
just long enough to ship off to Hollywood the finally completed
print of his long-gestating and several-times-reshot ``Eyes Wide
Shut.'' We'll see it July 16, and we can decide then whether it's
of a piece with the rest of his films. Kubrick wasn't prolific. He
made only 13 full-length films in 45 years. More than 10 years have
elapsed since his penultimate one, ``Full Metal Jacket.'' But
although they contain only one out-and-out masterpiece, ``The
Shining,'' Kubrick's films form a singular and remarkable body of
work.
</P>
<P>
   His major films remind us, in an age blinded by the notion of
success, of winners and losers, that in art you can fail, as I
believe most of Kubrick's films did, and nevertheless achieve
greatness. Although he was celebrated as a great stylist, it was
style, too much technical fussing, that detracted from Kubrick's
films. What makes them great is the size and span of his overriding
and obsessively continuing theme, a view that violence, and the
irrationality that breeds it, are intrinsic to our makeup. He
expressed it in film after film, image after image.
</P>
<P>
   Literally and figuratively, his films assert, we are meat
eaters, not that far out of the caves, despite our hardware. It is
a vision he bracketed grandly in ``2001: A Space Odyssey,''
beginning the film with a scene featuring a bone being tossed in
the air by prehistoric men, ending it with mankind having extended
its killer instinct into its tools, namely the murderous computer,
HAL. In ``Full Metal Jacket,'' he strikingly crystallized mankind's
schizoid tug when he suddenly filled a frame with Marine Corps
grunt Matthew Modine wearing a peace button on his flak jacket and
a helmet with ``Born to Kill'' lettered on it.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick has never been a friend of the military. His
breakthrough film, ``Paths of Glory,'' starring Kirk Douglas,
attacked military pathology and coverups, making the point that
French soldiers in World War I were as likely to die from the
stupidity of their own officers as from German bullets. Its sheer
intensity and conviction make it a riveting antiwar film to this
day. After replacing Anthony Mann as director of Douglas's
large-scale but largely conventional Roman slave-rebellion epic
``Spartacus,'' Kubrick made his sulfurous comedy of nuclear
holocaust, ``Dr. Strangelove.''
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,''
it forever etched on our collective consciousness the image of Slim
Pickens as America's ultimate cowboy of war, riding the bomb to
Armageddon, tall in the saddle and high on the suicidal jingoistic
rush of it all. As the violence persisted throughout Kubrick's
films, the insanity attached to it emerged ever more clearly.
Kubrick was too innately American, which is to say too innately
puritanical, to be comfortable with the sexual subversiveness in
Vladimir Nabokov's ``Lolita,'' but its distanced aesthetic at least
stayed out of the way of the flamboyant performances that carried
it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' Kubrick got away with
ponderousness because of the way the film asked you to give
yourself over to the psychedelic effects and floaty atmosphere that
turned it into a late-'60s hit as a head film. In fact, it backed
away from its view of man the savage by conveniently having Keir
Dullea's astronaut be reborn as an angel. Kubrick reverted to form
in the pessimistic ``A Clockwork Orange,'' taken from Anthony
Burgess's novel about a violent, amoral futureworld. But it
sentimentalizes and glamorizes Malcolm McDowell's sadistic thug by
making his traditional violence seem somehow more human than the
government-ordered lobotomies in place to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``2001'' and ``A Clockwork Orange'' Kubrick seemed to
surrender to technical indulgence and sophomoric philosophizing at
the expense of narrative drive and flesh-and-blood characters. His
films seemed more and more engineering projects populated by the
very robots whose ever-increasing presence he thought he was
decrying. In ``A Clockwork Orange,'' Kubrick seemed to pass from
moral outrage, from engagement with the world, to reactionary
retreat from it. This chilly detachment lent itself perfectly,
however, to the icy madness simmering away and finally exploding in
his ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   It represents a perfect fusion of novelist and filmmaker.
Stephen King, veteran of long house-bound winters in Maine, took a
wickedly funny look at the perils of being married to a writer and
cooped up too long with him. Kubrick, riding a brilliant
performance by Jack Nicholson as a satanic loose cannon, turned the
ancient burial ground into a minefield of primal rage, climaxing in
an orgy of would-be infanticide in a mythic maze. Nicholson's
monster, recycling his own baggage of violence in a labyrinth,
stands as Kubrick's ultimate personification of man locked into a
kill-crazy pattern beneath the reach of anything so tame as reason.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimism, detachment, cerebral distancing. Each became more
pronounced as Kubrick's literal retreat into his own English
fortress progressed. It was as if he had seen ``A Clockwork
Orange'' too many times and been scared by it into a prison of his
own making. In the end, Kubrick's films seemed as alienated and
detached as their protagonists. Just as ``Saving Private Ryan'' is
now inevitably being pitted against ``The Thin Red Line, so ``Full
Metal Jacket'' was pitted in its time against the far more popular
``Platoon.'' There are parallels.
</P>
<P>
   The visceral ``Platoon'' convinced us it was grounded in
authentic Vietnam experience. ``Full Metal Jacket'' seemed grounded
in nothing more than an idea in Kubrick's head. For this it paid a
price in power and moral force, even though no film more
unforgettably evokes the nightmarish pulping of human volition as
the recruits are pounded into ambulatory conditioned reflexes in
the first half of ``Full Metal Jacket.'' You can't help remembering
the way the recruits allow themselves to be terrorized and
brutalized just to avoid detonating their maniac drill sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   But the main structural failing of ``Full Metal Jacket'' lies in
its ushering us to the edge of nightmare, then drawing back to the
much less compelling level of mere irony. Instead of sending the
boot-camp sequences into a more intense orbit, the second half
deflates by never summoning a truly reverberant, visceral kind of
horror. One of the big film questions of 1999 will be whether
``Eyes Wide Shut'' can muster a sense of fateful moral entrapment,
whether it will represent a renewal of the venturesomeness that
made Kubrick able to fail at big, ambitious films worth failing at,
or whether it will revert, as so many of his more recent films
have, to a case of humanity in retreat. Did he evolve from social
critic to despairing misanthrope? Or is there yet another Kubrick
to be revealed? Perhaps ``Eyes Wide Shut'' will point to an answer.

GOVERNMENT TRAMPLES ON CONSTITUTION WITH PROPERTY SEIZURES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In America, no one can take your property except
through a legal process involving a finding of guilt. So says the
Constitution of the United States in Articles IV, V and XIV.
</P>
<P>
   But don't kid yourself. Today these words all too often ring
hollow as the federal government, the states, counties and cities
across the land avail themselves of the opportunity to sequester
private property _ cash, houses, boats _ under laws enacted by the
Congress in the 1980s as a way to combat the power of major drug
lords.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a good idea at the time to deny the chieftains of the
drug trade the weaponry of their ill-gotten wealth to keep them out
of the laws' clutches. The Supreme Court has upheld the legality of
these forfeiture laws, which also had precedent in English common
law, even though the Constitution's language would have you believe
that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening is that administrative actions, based on
nothing more than allegations of criminality, and not court trials
are taking property from people who many times are set free and not
even prosecuted for offenses under which their possessions were
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the forfeiture has become attractive to law
enforcement ostensibly because it helps to discourage crime by
showing potential lawbreakers the kind of personal penalties they
face. At the same time, the police and municipal authorities have
enriched their operations with the forfeited money. As a result,
the police have been provided with an incentive to find excuses to
seize property.
</P>
<P>
   One sheriff went so far at to use such money to buy himself a
camouflage shirt. Others acquire state-of-the-art crime-fighting
equipment that they don't need and which no right-minded municipal
authority would agree to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   But even when abuses are not apparent, there are few
accountability procedures in place anywhere to monitor how the
forfeited money is spent. Horror stories abound across the expanse
of the nation of how people falsely accused or tangentially
involved in alleged crimes are deprived of their property without
ever having been charged, or tried, never mind convicted of a
crime. The net of forfeiture has ensnared a lot more people than
the intended mobster drug kingpins.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the Omaha, Neb., World Herald, a
Californian's 200-acre scenic estate in Malibu was raided in 1992
by the police on the theory that he was growing marijuana.
``Brandishing a gun to stave off what he thought were criminal
intruders,'' the owner was shot to death. The account went on to
say that investigation showed ``the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to seize
and forfeit the ranch for the government,'' which was coveted by
the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   These days, forfeiture laws are being extended to apply to those
accused, but not tried and convicted, of drunken driving. The
rationale is that an auto in the control of a drunken driver is as
much an illegal weapon as a gun used in a holdup. Never mind that
the car might not be the property of the person behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, even if drivers are found innocent, their cars
won't necessarily be returned to them. And this appears to be
legal, under the reasoning that civil forfeiture is governed by
different rules than apply in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   The spreading of the practice and the piling up of evidence of
abuses and injustices has coalesced civil rights advocates and
politicians such as Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who are pushing for
reforms of the forfeiture laws, mainly by mandating that government
has to show ``clear and convincing evidence'' for taking the
property and providing legal assistance to those deprived of
property who can't afford lawyers to represent their interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court itself, in a recent decision, limited the
scope of its approval of the laws, declaring that the forfeiture
must not be ``grossly disproportional'' to whatever law is alleged
to have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   As compelling as is the need to quash the drug trade and drunken
driving, surrendering precious civil rights is not the way to do
it. Constitutional strictures exist precisely to constrain
government from wielding arbitrary powers.

Y2K PHOBIA GETS ITS MONTHLY DUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people at the 1-800-THERAPIST network have designated the
first day of each month Y2K Anxiety Day. Those afflicted are
invited to call 1-800-843-7274 and vent, for free. A
psychotherapist will be standing by, donating time to ``help
relieve fear and calm hysteria,'' according to a press release.
</P>
<P>
   Is this really necessary? It is, insists Dr. Kevin Grold of the
San Diego-based nationwide therapists network. Those who view the
turn of the millennium as just another day, even a cause for
celebration, may find it difficult to credit the scope and
intensity of some people's Y2K-related fears. But these fears are
real, says Grold, and Y2K Anxiety Day is not a publicity gimmick
but a public service.
</P>
<P>
   Grold faxed a few remarks from callers to the Y2K anxiety-line:
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents won't move with me to Montana. I am trying to
explain that Montana has the only safe place left. I tell them
every day, but they won't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The end is coming. What's the sense in working or doing
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day the paper lists the number of days until the end . .
. time is ticking away . . . it's harder and harder to sleep . . .
it's even difficult to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that you can hardly pick up a publication or turn on
the TV or radio without finding a story seemingly designed to whip
you into a Y2K-related frenzy. Even a person not inclined to worry
might, after digesting too many Y2K panic pieces, find herself
wondering if maybe it's time to start stockpiling canned goods,
bottled water, and that all-important item, cat food. (On half a
minute's further reflection, I think not.) It's understandable how
a person of fearful disposition might succumb to Y2K terror.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-800-THERAPIST network is a nationwide referral service for
people seeking a therapist in their area. In Greater Boston,
callers might be referred to Dr. Shel Jay Miller in Brookline.
Miller said that so far no one has consulted him specifically about
Y2K fears. Miller thinks Y2K anxiety may surface among his clients
as a part of larger issues, with ``people who tend to be
worriers.'' He adds, ``In people prone to catastrophic fantasies,
(Y2K anxiety) could really take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another network therapist, Linda Lawless of Melrose, doubts that
Y2K anxiety, per se, will motivate anyone to contact her. ``My
intuition is that people will not be calling about this specific
issue,'' she says. However, like Miller, she doesn't discount the
possibility that Y2K fears might come up in the course of therapy,
in people vulnerable to anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Grold says specific fears surfaced on the first two Y2K Anxiety
Days, Feb. 1 and March 1. The line fielded calls from people who
worried that on Jan. 1, 2000, utilities won't work, food
distribution systems will be in chaos, air travel won't be safe,
banks will collapse. He expects more people to call on Y2K Anxiety
Days as the year 2000 draws near. ``We deal with a stressed
population to begin with,'' he says, ``and then they see headlines
about Y2K, it's the end of the world, and it compounds their
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Grold has compiled a list of 10 steps aimed at helping people
manage Y2K anxiety. The list is available on the network's Web site
(www.1-800-therapist.com).
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: ``Separate `real concerns' about computer operation
problems and Y2K issues from catastrophic thinking. Decide if your
fears are `reality based.' Challenge and question dire predictions
about Y2K. Where is the information coming from? Is there a factual
basis to the information?''
</P>
<P>
   That's good advice, but if no one is sure what will happen Jan.
1, how do you know which concerns are ``real'' and which aren't?
Ask your therapist?

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
!!! ``The Corruptor'' In a pulp-fiction Chinatown, an inexperienced
white cop is paired with a veteran Chinese cop with ties to the
neighborhood mob. Chow Yun-fat is riveting as the charming,
enigmatic rogue. Mark Wahlberg, as the newcomer, has good chemistry
with Chow as the two forge a friendship. Ric Young is a
scene-stealer as an elegant mobster. The movie's strength is its
depiction of the pressure-cooker mix of cops, feds, old-style
mobsters, and ruthless gang members. (R) (Betsy Sherman) 
 
!! 1/2 ``Deep End of the Ocean'' Nice gnarly take on the dynamics
of a family whose young son is kidnapped, then returned nine years
later. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding as the guilt-ridden
anguished mom. Stephen Schiff's intelligent screenplay mostly
avoids conventional Hollywood responses, though there are
compromises in this jaggedly paced and tonally uneven film. 
 
!!! ``God Said Ha!'' Julia Sweeney turns her own family's nightmare
into art, transforming her brother's cancer and her own into a
stageful of black humor that begins with their parents, whom both
kids had fled, descending upon them in LA for the duration. There's
more sweet, poignant absurdity than actual gallows humor in
Sweeney's spunky and very funny one-woman show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
!!! ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' Entertainingly
propulsive crime caper set in London's East End, where the
theatrical side of criminality is savored and celebrated as four
Cockney wiseguys work their way up and down the criminal food
chain, trying to get out from under a crushing debt incurred at a
crooked card game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' Lots of red paint here. You wonder if this
silly attempt to update and replicate Brian De Palma's original
shouldn't be called ``The Rouge.'' Emily Bergl, making her film
debut as the successor to Sissy Spacek's dispenser of telekinetic
fireworks, seems promising, but this film is too focused on blood
and not enough on the characterizations that made the original. &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Tango'' Nobody has put dance on film more often or more
masterfully than Spain's Carlos Saura. But he stumbles a bit here
in framing _ and freighting _ Argentina's national dance with a
balletic distillation of the tango rather than the tango itself,
and sinking his movie with a clumsily melodramatic and
anticlimactic plot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! ``Telling You'' This story of recent college grads working in
their hometown pizza parlor could have been ``The Little Chill''
for twentysomethings discovering adulthood isn't always all it's
cracked up to be. But the screenwriters don't know what story they
want to tell; in the end, they don't say a whole lot about
anything. (R) (Renee Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``20 Dates'' Myles Berkowitz combines his professional and
personal failures into an occasionally funny, sometimes
mean-spirited film about a would-be filmmaker's quest for love.
Where he should be sympathetic, he often comes across as cruel and
manipulative as he secretly videotapes his dates. (R) (Renee
Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Wing Commander'' One shouldn't expect much from a movie
based on a video game. This trifle certainly manages to be
everything we expect it to be, and less. Freddie Prinze Jr. does
nothing to forward his film career in this boring exercise in
cynical cross-marketing. (PG-13) (Renee Graham)

WHOSE LIFETIME WARRANTY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting 18 years of life out of a backpack would be enough for
most people, but not David Chalfin.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham, Mass. man loves his Jansport backpack, which he
thinks he purchased in 1981. So, when a seam started to split
recently, he decided to take advantage of the company's lifetime
warranty. In the process, he learned that a lifetime warranty isn't
what he thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   Chalfin shipped his backpack to Jansport's warranty center in
Everett, Wash. The company fixed the seam and returned the pack,
adding a notation, ``The product has seen its lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   While pleased that his pack was repaired, Chalfin was puzzled by
the message. He called Jansport and was told that the life of the
pack had expired and that the warranty would no longer be valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is defining what the lifetime is, and I don't
think that's a lifetime warranty,'' Chalfin said. ``That means that
if a product lasts just two days, the company could say its
lifetime is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Delorey, the president of Jansport in Appleton, Wis., said
there is a lot of confusion about lifetime warranties. Most
consumers mistakenly think the lifetime warranty applies to their
life, not the product's life, Delorey said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such confusion, he said, most European countries
don't allow lifetime warranties and instead require companies to
specify warranty length in years.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts advertising regulations aren't that specific, but
they do require that the meaning of lifetime be explained if a
product is represented as having a lifetime guarantee or warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Jansport's warranty doesn't do that. The warranty states:
``Jansport equipment is warranted to be free from defects in
materials and workmanship for the life of the product. Our warranty
applies when the product is used for the purpose intended under
normal conditions and does not apply to damages caused by typical
wear and tear, unreasonable use, or neglect.''
</P>

   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. offers a stronger lifetime warranty on its
Craftsman hand tools. The warranty allows return of a defective
tool at any time for repair or replacement, said Jan Drummond, a
Sears spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a lifetime warranty, mail-order giant L. L. Bean
offers a satisfaction guarantee. It states: ``Our products are
guaranteed to give 100 percent satisfaction in every way. Return
anything purchased from us at any time if it proves otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalfin acknowledged that his pack's seam probably started to
split because of wear and tear, but he said his pack still has a
lot of life in it. The quality of his pack and the lifetime
warranty were two reasons he bought another Jansport pack last fall
for his 9-year-old nephew Sam, who lives in Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Delorey said Jansport tries to honor warranty requests because
they are a direct link to customers and allow the company to assess
a product's weaknesses and how it is being used. Last year,
Jansport sold more than 10 million packs and processed 200,000
warranty claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to use our best judgment on warranty work,'' Delorey
said, ``but eventually a pack is going to wear out.''

The case of the double label
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Brookline, Mass. woman said she's not a fanatic about apparel
brand names, but she did notice that a $22 wool blazer she bought
recently from Marshall's had a ``Larry Levine'' label.
</P>
<P>
   After a closer look, she realized that the ``Larry Levine''
label was glued over an ``Eddie Bauer'' label. What is the blazer's
true name? She wanted our help to solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   After phone calls to Larry Levine apparel company in New York,
and Eddie Bauer in Redmond, Wash., we learned how garments can
collect different identities as they're recycled by the same
company.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Levine is a division of S. Rothchild, a Manhattan apparel
maker. Rothchild has other ``private label'' divisions that produce
special garments for a particular company, such as a line of Eddie
Bauer wool blazers, said Elizabeth Ferraro, executive vice
president for sales at Larry Levine.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Eddie Bauer rejects any shipment for whatever
reason, S. Rothchild is allowed to resell the garments as long as
they don't use the Eddie Bauer label. She said her company can
remove the old label or cross out the name. She said nothing stops
the company from adding the Larry Levine label, though ``it's not
our practice'' to stick a new label over an old one.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro asked us not to rule out the chance that this one jacket
got two labels as part of a bizarre sewing mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Lurma Rackley, spokeswoman for Eddie Bauer, wasn't happy to hear
about the blazer. She said manufacturers who take back Eddie Bauer
garments must ``physically remove'' the old tag. Eddie Bauer has
contracts with hundreds of factories in 50 countries to make its
brand-name products, and they all agree to remove the Eddie Bauer
tag before reselling the garments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the agreements, Larry Levine's sales staff doesn't
think consumers should get worked up over the double labels.
Ferraro insisted the two brands are of ``equal quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we sold a Kmart jacket that had the Larry Levine
label,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) political categories
 &HT;    With COX-FORBES
 &HT;    With COX-INTERNET-SITE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON ``Jesse Ventura for president (in) 2000?'' the
maverick Minnesota governor's official political Web site asks --
before dispensing the answer: ``Sorry folks, it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, other candidates seeking the presidency
in 2000 -- ranging from heavyweights to virtual unknowns -- plan
large-scale campaign efforts on the Internet. In doing so, they are
responding to the lessons learned from Ventura's surprisingly
successful bid for office in 1998. ``Through his site, while not
dynamic, Ventura activated and energized people to become involved
and vote. And in politics, that's the bottom line,'' says Phillip
Noble, who hosts a Web site that examines online politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Ventura campaign, political handlers and
scholars say, the Internet is finally emerging as a potent mass
market arena. Its appeal to politicians is heightened because
voters tend to be cyber-savvy and because the cost of reaching them
is far lower than by such traditional methods as TV ads. Some
experts predict the Internet could do much to level the political
playing field now tilted in favor of the best financed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Says Gary Selnow, a professor of computing systems at San
Francisco State University and a leading scholar on the advent of
political activity on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some 50 years ago, the political whistle-stop tour was so
named because trains blew their whistles twice when making
unscheduled stops in backwater towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like its distant cousin, the electronic whistle-stop brings
the candidate's message directly to the people, but with one
outstanding difference: the new whistle-stop offers politicians an
accuracy, efficiency, and success at voter persuasion unimaginable
to earlier whistle-stoppers such as (President) Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates who learn how to ``successfully inform,
persuade, enlighten, and even confuse voters will win votes,''
Selnow concludes. To do so, he says, they need to sponsor
state-of-the-art ``home pages'' while also offering extensive
electronic bulletin boards and access to their data libraries.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear to Selnow and others that presidential-level
politicians can no longer ignore cyberspace. That, in turn,
requires them to hire Internet advisers to show the candidates how
to appeal to the ever-larger numbers of voters who go online. But
just how this process will evolve remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually everything of consequence in the political sphere
that has occurred on the Internet has been unintended and
unexpected,'' says Carl Wagner, a Washington-based consultant who
has managed several presidential campaigns for Democratic hopefuls,
including Sen. Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example: In counter-point to traditional 30-second TV
spots, cyber-ready candidates offer voters direct access to
detailed issue papers.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also have discovered the Ventura-style political
rewards of using e-mail to build lists of volunteers and
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   These electronic political lists can spark spirited two-way
messages and even one-on-one chat room ``debates'' with the
candidate that others are able to monitor. (In the Ventura
campaign, supporters would log on, chat, and then regularly turn
out at campaign events.)
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, about one-half of the voters were regular Internet
users,'' Wagner notes. ``Next year, that's expected to climb to 75
percent. Consequently, I think you'll see in 2000, information
technology for the first time bring interactive communication fully
into the political process, all in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even non-candidate Ventura, whose techniques are serving as a
model for 2000, has gotten into the act. A blurb on Ventura's site
spells out what's afoot:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse is providing national organizing assistance to help draw
a viable Reform Party candidate into the year-2000 presidential
race. Using his Web site, Jesse is providing a place where citizens
can register to demonstrate their willingness to support such a
candidate. By building a large national list, and making it
available for presidential campaign use, Jesse is providing a
strong incentive for a viable candidate to rise and run for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current crop of 2000 presidential political Web
sites offer fast access, good navigation tools, thumbnail
biographies, photos of candidates and their families, and a heavy
diet of issues-based content.
</P>
<P>
   As surfers drill into these contents, they are often invited to
volunteer their time or contribute money, usually via a printed
form that must be mailed in.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   While the complexity of the federal election laws discourages
candidates from seeking funds directly online, programming experts
report that compliant software, featuring individualized ``bank
accounts,'' will soon be widely available. That will protect
candidates from co-mingling funds and potentially violating donor
caps.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hockaday, a Republican consultant who worked for New York's
Gov. George Pataki re-election effort last year, has pioneered the
use of political ``banner'' ads that he buys for candidates ``at a
very attractive cost'' on Internet portals or news-oriented Web
sites. ``Visitors can click through, get more information or even
become instant volunteers,'' Hockaday notes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hockaday feels that full political promise of the
Internet has yet to be achieved. ``It's still emerging,'' he says.
``There are lot of politicians below the presidential level who
still haven't quite got it. When it comes to the effective use of
the Internet, the political world is still two to five years behind
the business world.''
</P>
<P>
   In citing a recent study of 20 GOP 1998 campaigns, underwritten
by GOPAC and his own firm, Campaign Solutions Inc., Hockaday
concludes that ``any future Republican candidate, anywhere, is
going to have to integrate the Internet into their campaign
strategy to reach the increasingly active 'netizens.'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's key findings: More than 90 percent of Internet
volunteers signed up to help without being recruited by a campaign.
And some 55 percent said they never had volunteered for a political
campaign before they found a chance to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Users that went to political Web sites stayed online 4 to 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine someone watching a four-minute television spot
or listening to a four-minute telemarketing call?'' says Martin
Edlund, who supervised the research project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology offers voters direct access to candidates at
virtually no cost to either voters or candidates,'' says the
Democrats' Wagner. ``It's a sure winner. And it's time has finally
come.''

 &HT;    WHEN EAST MET WEST AND FELL IN LOVE
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the time she fell in love with the cowboy, Sara
Davidson had completed an Ivy League education, written four books,
borne two children, survived two failed marriages and was a
producer and screenwriter on the CBS-TV series ``Dr. Quinn:
Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   On a fateful night of fiddles and guitars, she was struck by the
cowboy's ``intense green'' eyes _ not to mention his baby blue
boots _ when he asked her to two-step across a dance floor in Elko,
Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson had flown in from Los Angeles to research a piece for
the New York Times Magazine on cowboy poetry. It eventually ran
under the headline, ``Git Along Little Doggerel.''
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy had driven up from Arizona to sell bridles and reins
and gewgaws that he braided from rawhide. He tried unsuccessfully
to sell a $200 flyswatter with hair from the tails of three horses
_ sorrel, palomino, and black _ to the tall woman with a blondish
mane and a badge that said, ``New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Their chance meeting came in 1993 and rather quickly led to an
unlikely but steamy affair that still continues. The relationship
is the centerpiece of Davidson's fifth book, ``Cowboy: A Love
Story'' (Harper-Collins, $24), published Monday (March 15).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's fool, the cowboy asked right off _ on page 14, even
before the first sexual encounter _ ``Is this research, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir,'' declared Davidson _ both then, and in an interview
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he got very used to my taking notes,'' she conceded.
``We'd be riding in the car or sitting in the house and he'd say
something that was so amazing and bizarre and unexpected that I'd
say, 'I have to write this down,' and I always keep a notebook with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon realized a book would emerge from this sexy yarn of a
writer with degrees from the University of California at Berkeley
and Columbia University and a cowpoke who barely finished high
school and had never heard of Anne Frank. Practically every other
word in his love letters was misspelled. But he had ``magic
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often that God drops material like this into your
life,'' said Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   The cowboy is called ``Zack'' in the book, although that is not
his real name, and the episodes involving her now teen-aged
children and her ex-husbands are fictionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writer in me simply wanted to tell the truth. But as a
mother, I felt an obligation to the kids,'' she explained. ``They
were just growing up _ not expecting to find some of their most
painful moments or embarrassing moments in a book that anyone could
read.''
</P>
<P>
   The family conflicts described in the book are real, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Omigod, just imagine a couple of upper-middle-class,
trying-to-be-cool California kids who are already troubled by their
parents' divorce. Then mom brings home this cowboy who smokes and
wears a belt buckle the size of a Frisbee and won't leave the house
without a huge Stetson. And mom, like, brings him to your soccer
games.
</P>
<P>
   The 50ish Davidson is about a decade older than the cowboy. Her
previous books include ``Loose Change,'' a semi-autobiographical
novel about three women growing up in the Sixties. Writing for
``Dr. Quinn,'' she again noticed her life and craft co-habitating.
</P>
<P>
   On the television series, Dr. Quinn is a well-educated woman who
goes west and ends up in a relationship with Sully, an uneducated
mountain man reared by Cheyenne Indians. Both Sully and Zack have
an innate backwoods wisdom and a steady moral compass, said
Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hit me until two or three years into the
relationship that I was actually having the same experience
off-camera as the one I was writing for the screen,'' she said.
``Then comes the question: Is my life imitating what I'm writing,
or am I writing from my life? ... There are lot of things from my
life that ended up on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Once when Zack had come to visit, she was in a bad mood, so the
cowboy massaged her feet. Sully did the same thing for a tired and
troubled Dr. Quinn in one episode.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the screenwriter's cowboy boyfriend had moved to
California was riding horses as an extra on the series. So both
were hit hard when the show was canceled. In addition to promoting
her book, Davidson is working on a Lifetime cable movie _ ``kind of
a female 'Deliverance'.'' Zack has taken a course in shiatsu
massage to try to cash in on his talents.
</P>
<P>
   The live near each other but not together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us wants to get married,'' she said. ``We both
crave solitude. I love being alone in my house one or two nights a
week, when the kids are with their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this wonderful place where we look forward to getting
together,'' she said. ``I don't think I would have had this
relationship when I was looking for a husband and a father of
children, because Zack doesn't have the means to support them. ...
``We often joke that if we had met at different points in our
lives, we wouldn't have had anything to do with each other. Our
needs were different.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone understands their relationship now.
</P>
<P>
   Some women say, `` 'How could you? I could never have a
relationship with such a person. It's too big of a gap,' `` said
Davidson. ``I've had men who are intellectuals who feel very
offended by it. They say 'You're romanticizing the blue-collar guy
_ (writing) that he has a more primal and elemental and powerful
sexuality than the intellectual'.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ``a friend of mine who works at the New Yorker loved
it,'' she said. ``He said that as a young boy, he wanted to be a
cowboy,'' and the book touched those memories.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that the Marlboro Man always turned her on a
bit, Davidson said she loves the cowboy for a deeper reason: ``Zack
was the first man who said, 'I'll take you just the way you are.'
``

SENATORS LEAN ON OLYMPICS TO REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the International Olympic Committee gathers this week in
Switzerland to expel wrongdoers and repair its reputation, it will
do so under threat of action by members of Congress poised to force
fundamental changes in how the Olympics does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant (IOC) dependency on the United States
that gives the United States significant interests,'' said Senator
John McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential ambitions.
``We're not asking for the United States to control the Olympics.
But I think American interests should beneficially impress upon
them the need to clean up the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That dependency, as McCain sees it, results from simple
economics: 60 percent of the money that fuels the Olympics comes
from US sources. IOC officials called that figure exaggerated but
would not elaborate. United States Olympic Committee officials,
however, said the amount is closer to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC jealously guards its finances _ a source of irritation
among investigators examining vote-selling allegations _ but there
is general agreement that the Olympics would essentially cease to
function without the roughly $450 million paid every four years by
US-based corporations that are nine of the IOC's 11 chief sponsors,
and the $3.5 billion in television rights fees paid by NBC to
broadcast the Games through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   New concerns about where that money goes, and what the United
States gets in return, have arisen as an outgrowth of the scandal
involving alleged bribery of IOC members by Salt Lake City
organizers and other would-be Olympic hosts. In response, McCain,
as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, has scheduled an
April 14 hearing on the Olympics and plans to invite IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the question he wants answered is whether the IOC
has proven itself so inept at controlling itself and the Games that
Congress should seek to redirect some portion of the American
money, most likely away from the IOC and toward its US affiliate,
the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain and Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who is
the chief author of federal laws governing amateur athletics, are
insisting that the IOC _ starting with its meeting this week _ take
what McCain called ``appropriate steps'' toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   By their definition, that means adopting the proposals outlined
in a report two weeks ago by former Maine senator George Mitchell,
which include major changes in the way IOC members are chosen, term
limits, greater financial accountability, and strict enforcement of
rules on gift-giving and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This week, at least, Mitchell's report is not on the IOC's
agenda, which focuses primarily on dealing with six IOC members
facing expulsion, changing the way host cities are chosen, and
creating a commission to consider ethical and other reform issues,
possibly including Henry Kissinger as a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used diplomatic language to warn of consequences if the
Mitchell report is not addressed. ``I would deeply regret that, and
I would urge them to seriously consider every recommendation of the
(Mitchell) commission,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to limit his options, but the Senate committee's
staff director, Mark Buse, said failure by the IOC to act
decisively might prompt the senators to consider legislation that
would remove the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States,
depriving it of millions of dollars in tax breaks on the
sponsorship deals with US-based corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do anything that would damage or hurt the
Olympic movement,'' Buse said last week. ``We're trying to use our
leverage to force them to clean up their act so the Olympics will
survive and continue to prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential move by Congress would be to redirect the
money paid by NBC for Olympic television rights. Rather than have
that money paid to the IOC, the US Amateur Sports Act could be
amended to put that money under the control of the USOC, which now
receives 10 percent. If Congress altered that balance of power, the
USOC would be in a position to determine how much to give to the
IOC, how much to keep for American athletes, and how much to share
with other national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, that would greatly diminish the IOC's
power by putting the USOC on almost equal financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their image has been badly tarnished by this scandal,'' McCain
said. ``They should understand that the United States, because of
our funding, might not be more equal to others, but they shouldn't
do anything that would put that funding in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments underscore an undisputed fact of life for the
Olympics: While no nation is supposed to have preference over any
other _ nationalism is anathema to what the IOC calls ``Olympism''
_ the United States is first among equals, particularly where
finances are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials grudgingly acknowledge that fact, but also
maintain there is widespread misunderstanding about what the IOC
does with the money it receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do recognize the special nature of the United
States in the Olympic movement,'' said IOC vice president Richard
Pound. ``But if it's perceived as a US creature you lose the
international flavor and possibly the universality.''
</P>
<P>
   Added IOC marketing director Michael Payne: ``Without question,
America is the single most important market of the 200 countries''
that participate in the Olympics. However, he stressed, ``The IOC
and the Olympic Games are not supported by one dollar of taxpayer
money. It is totally privately funded. It is not like any other
international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Payne said, the IOC keeps only about 10 percent of the
money in takes in, redistributing the rest to the cities that host
the Games and to national Olympic committees, with the biggest
share already going to the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money is going to all of the countries to support their
teams,'' Payne said. ``If somebody is wanting to cut that back,
quite simply the Games won't take place because there won't be the
financial mechanisms to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no other Olympic committee gets a direct share of the
television rights, while the USOC gets 10 percent, rising to 12.5
percent in 2004, as well as millions more in IOC support. In 1988,
the USOC's share of the US television rights was $37.5 million;
that is expected to rise to $112 million in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress delves into the IOC's finances, it will find an
organization that during the current four-year period probably will
collect more than $3.6 billion in revenues. Of that, about 10
percent will remain with the IOC, and the USOC gets by far the
biggest cut of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the USOC receives its 10 percent share of the US
television rights. It also receives 20 percent of the estimated
$500 million in revenue from the 11 chief corporate sponsors. By
some estimates, the combination should give the USOC about $200
million during the current four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Other national Olympic committees complain that the United
States already gets more than its share, but from the USOC's
perspective it does not get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're resented. . . . But 70 percent of the IOC's revenue
comes from the US,'' said Richard Schultz, USOC executive director.
</P>
<P>
   It also rankles the USOC that the United States, with two IOC
representatives, has the same number of seats as countries such as
Belgium, Sweden, and Morocco, and is outgunned by Italy with four
and Switzerland with three.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy financial reliance on US-based corporations and
broadcasters can be traced to the early 1980s, the dawn of
Samaranch's reign as IOC president, when the Olympics were nearly
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the worst, Samaranch turned to his old friend, Adidas
heir Horst Dassler. Dassler had a deceptively simple solution,
translated roughly as: Go West, young man. ``To get at the big
money nowadays, one has to go international, to the big
multinationals,'' Dassler said at a 1982 meeting of an Olympic
finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was sound fiscal advice, and Samaranch followed it
religiously and successfully through the 1980s and '90s, selling
sponsorships and television rights that attracted billions of
dollars, which turned the International Olympic Committee into a
financial juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic historian John Lucas, a retired Penn State professor,
cautioned that any change in the financial balance between the IOC
and national Olympic committees, including the USOC, could have a
dangerous ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things the IOC does with its vast fortune is to
subsidize athletes. The people that would suffer the most would not
be the IOC, but the 3,500 to 4,500 male and female Olympic athletes
from the poorest countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate sponsors, meanwhile, are hoping that the IOC does
whatever is necessary to protect their mutual interest: restoring
the luster on the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what anyone is expecting from this week, but the
last thing we're expecting and the last thing we need is any more
drama,'' said Susan Rosenberg, spokeswoman for UPS, one of the
chief Olympic sponsors. ``The Olympics has been a very valuable
program for us. Whatever the IOC does, whatever Congress does, we
just don't want to see that change.''

WHOSE LIFETIME WARRANTY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting 18 years of life out of a backpack would be enough for
most people, but not David Chalfin.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham, Mass. man loves his Jansport backpack, which he
thinks he purchased in 1981. So, when a seam started to split
recently, he decided to take advantage of the company's lifetime
warranty. In the process, he learned that a lifetime warranty isn't
what he thought it was.
</P>
<P>
   Chalfin shipped his backpack to Jansport's warranty center in
Everett, Wash. The company fixed the seam and returned the pack,
adding a notation, ``The product has seen its lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   While pleased that his pack was repaired, Chalfin was puzzled by
the message. He called Jansport and was told that the life of the
pack had expired and that the warranty would no longer be valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is defining what the lifetime is, and I don't
think that's a lifetime warranty,'' Chalfin said. ``That means that
if a product lasts just two days, the company could say its
lifetime is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Delorey, the president of Jansport in Appleton, Wis., said
there is a lot of confusion about lifetime warranties. Most
consumers mistakenly think the lifetime warranty applies to their
life, not the product's life, Delorey said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such confusion, he said, most European countries
don't allow lifetime warranties and instead require companies to
specify warranty length in years.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts advertising regulations aren't that specific, but
they do require that the meaning of lifetime be explained if a
product is represented as having a lifetime guarantee or warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Jansport's warranty doesn't do that. The warranty states:
``Jansport equipment is warranted to be free from defects in
materials and workmanship for the life of the product. Our warranty
applies when the product is used for the purpose intended under
normal conditions and does not apply to damages caused by typical
wear and tear, unreasonable use, or neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. offers a stronger lifetime warranty on its
Craftsman hand tools. The warranty allows return of a defective
tool at any time for repair or replacement, said Jan Drummond, a
Sears spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a lifetime warranty, mail-order giant L. L. Bean
offers a satisfaction guarantee. It states: ``Our products are
guaranteed to give 100 percent satisfaction in every way. Return
anything purchased from us at any time if it proves otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalfin acknowledged that his pack's seam probably started to
split because of wear and tear, but he said his pack still has a
lot of life in it. The quality of his pack and the lifetime
warranty were two reasons he bought another Jansport pack last fall
for his 9-year-old nephew Sam, who lives in Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Delorey said Jansport tries to honor warranty requests because
they are a direct link to customers and allow the company to assess
a product's weaknesses and how it is being used. Last year,
Jansport sold more than 10 million packs and processed 200,000
warranty claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to use our best judgment on warranty work,'' Delorey
said, ``but eventually a pack is going to wear out.''
</P>
<P>

The case of the double label
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Brookline, Mass. woman said she's not a fanatic about apparel
brand names, but she did notice that a $22 wool blazer she bought
recently from Marshall's had a ``Larry Levine'' label.
</P>
<P>
   After a closer look, she realized that the ``Larry Levine''
label was glued over an ``Eddie Bauer'' label. What is the blazer's
true name? She wanted our help to solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   After phone calls to Larry Levine apparel company in New York,
and Eddie Bauer in Redmond, Wash., we learned how garments can
collect different identities as they're recycled by the same
company.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Levine is a division of S. Rothchild, a Manhattan apparel
maker. Rothchild has other ``private label'' divisions that produce
special garments for a particular company, such as a line of Eddie
Bauer wool blazers, said Elizabeth Ferraro, executive vice
president for sales at Larry Levine.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Eddie Bauer rejects any shipment for whatever
reason, S. Rothchild is allowed to resell the garments as long as
they don't use the Eddie Bauer label. She said her company can
remove the old label or cross out the name. She said nothing stops
the company from adding the Larry Levine label, though ``it's not
our practice'' to stick a new label over an old one.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro asked us not to rule out the chance that this one jacket
got two labels as part of a bizarre sewing mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Lurma Rackley, spokeswoman for Eddie Bauer, wasn't happy to hear
about the blazer. She said manufacturers who take back Eddie Bauer
garments must ``physically remove'' the old tag. Eddie Bauer has
contracts with hundreds of factories in 50 countries to make its
brand-name products, and they all agree to remove the Eddie Bauer
tag before reselling the garments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the agreements, Larry Levine's sales staff doesn't
think consumers should get worked up over the double labels.
Ferraro insisted the two brands are of ``equal quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we sold a Kmart jacket that had the Larry Levine
label,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Mom was right to insist on all that hand washing,
but a parental obsession with eradicating germs may be giving
bacteria the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   According to the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, middle class mommies' and daddies' insistence on
unnecessary drugs to treat junior's sore throat played a
significant role in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains
of bacteria, ``superbugs'' that shrug off drugs that used to be
hailed as a medical miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The next bacterial battleground: America's kitchens and
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of new antibacterial cleaning products, soaps and
hand lotions that hit grocery-store shelves in recent years are
cashing in on America's germ worries.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say the new products are, at best, as effective
and brutal as pruning a rose bush with a chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, they could lead to the evolution of new superbugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overkill,'' said Patricia Lieberman, a staff scientist
with the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the
Public Interest (CSPI). ``For most healthy individuals, killing all
the bacteria shouldn't be the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Pegues, an infectious-disease expert and professor at
UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no clear benefit for using (antibacterial products)
over plain old soap and water,'' he said. ``It's not quite as
serious a transgression as misusing antibiotics, but it does remain
a theoretical concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, scientists and physicians have watched bacteria
grow stronger as their once mighty antibiotics arsenal became
increasingly less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Most strains of bacteria that cause ear infections and
meningitis in children had developed almost a complete resistance
to penicillin by the 1970s _ only 40 years since the discovery of
the so-called ``miracle drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three Americans in different locations were infected
with a staph infection that was immune to vancomycin, medicine's
last line of antibiotic defense against the potentially deadly
bacteria. The patients survived, but the close call gave doctors a
genuine scare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had antibiotics for less than 60 years,'' Pegues said.
``Bacteria have been evolving for a millenia. So, the reality is we
were unduly optimistic we could win the war against drug-resistant
bacteria simply by synthesizing and developing new antibacterial
compounds. We will never win that battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The blame for this crisis falls to doctors for overprescribing
the drugs; consumers for overuse and misuse; and to beef, poultry
and pork manufacturers for using antibiotics to accelerate the
growth of livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, CSPI called on the FDA to ban the use of antibiotics
to fatten livestock because several studies show that people who
eat the meat also are ingesting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The industries use more than a third of all antibiotics sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is reason to be alarmed,'' said CSPI's Lieberman. ``Does
it make sense to use these precious drugs to make animals grow
faster? No. And you may be sicker because of it. Some pathogens _
like E. coli and salmonella _ have gotten stronger and sometimes
more deadly. Consumers should get safe, clean, wholesome food. They
shouldn't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and the World Health Organization have echoed the
center's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One study found the prevalence of salmonella typhimurium food
poisioning infections resistant to antibiotics soared from 1
percent in 1979 to 34 percent in 1996. And, in Denmark, a 1995 ban
on the use of an antibiotic to promote growth in chickens resulted
in a 70 percent decline in antibiotic-resistant enterococci in only
a few years, the CSPI reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, these superbugs and highly publicized maladies such
as flesh-eating bacteria or mad cow disease are a driving force
behind the marketing of antibacterial soaps and lotions. Most of
the products contain chemicals such as triclosan or triclocarbon,
which kill bacteria instead of simply washing it off like regular
soaps. Unlike antibiotics, which target a specific bacteria, agents
like triclosan kill everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an atom bomb _ it kills indiscriminately,'' said Dr.
Arleen Rockoff, chief of medicine at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential casualties: millions of ``good'' bacteria
that keep away bad germs through healthy competition for living
space.
</P>
<P>
   This heavy-handed approach to housecleaning also leads to some
domestic Darwinism _ only the strongest germs survive. And since
bacteria have the remarkable ability to absorb useful parts of
other bacteria, if the survivors are from the bad minority, it's
possible the organisms will pass on an immunity to the next
generation. Bacteria are very sharing organisms.
</P>
<P>
   That's still a theory. But the possibility drew concern from Dr.
Stuart Levy, a leading authority on antibiotic-resistant bacteria
at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston. In a recent article
in Scientific American magazine, Levy called the antibacterial fad
in home cleaning products ``a new threat.''
</P>
<P>
   His advice: Save the heavy-duty antibacterial cleaners for
emergencies, such as when a person is coming home from the hospital
or to clean homes where someone has a compromised immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees the best way to beat bad bacteria is to wash
your hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we emphasize hand washing thoroughly,
which means 15 to 20 seconds on a regular basis,'' said Janet
Donohue, a spokeswoman for the New York-based Soap and Detergent
Association. ``The particular soap you use is really consumer
choice. When it comes to antibacterial handwash products, we think
they provide a certain level of comfort to the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say plain old soap and warm water work just as well. In
hospitals, antibacterial soaps are used only in the most sterile
environments _ surgical suites and the neonatal intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soap actually physically removes contaminants. It lifts them
so they can be rinsed off,'' said UCLA's Pegues. ``It's as
effective as these disinfectant and antiseptic products, which kill
the micro-organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Just rinsing won't work, though. Hands should be thoroughly
lathered for at least 15 seconds _ about the time it takes to sing
one verse of ``Rub a dub dub,'' Pegues said. Then the germs will
just slide off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common sense.''

THE WAR ON BACTERIA

_  Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming accidentally discovers
penicillin in 1928. This ``miracle'' drug saves countless lives
from bacterial infections. There are now 160 antibiotics and 13 in
development.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; After widespread use in the 1940s, physicians begin to
notice bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics. But rapid
development of new drugs eliminates any concern. During the next
four decades, America's production of antibiotics swells from 2
million to 50 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1970s, scientists find strains of bacteria that have
developed an almost complete resistance to penicillin.
</P>
<P>
   _ As drug companies divert antibiotic research resources to
battle HIV and other health threats in the early 1980s, Harvard
scientists link an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella in
humans to beef cattle fed with chlortetracycline to increase their
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1995, the CDC begins a national campaign to curb antibiotic
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two years after the FDA approves the use of flouroquinolone
antibiotics to prevent E. coli infection in poultry _ despite
objections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention _ a
preliminary 1997 report finds growing resistance to the antibiotic
in chickens, turkeys and humans.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 1997 Center for Science in the Public Interest study finds
as many as 40 percent of pneumococcus bacteria strains are
resistant to common antibiotics _ compared to none a decade
earlier. Meanwhile, manufacturers introduce antibacterial soaps and
lotions, prompting concern that kitchens and bathrooms could be the
next breeding ground for mutated bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, three Americans infected with hospital-acquired staph
infections are found to be resistant to vancomycin, the last line
of defense against the potentially lethal infection. Scientists
hail the cases as more proof that antibiotic abuses are one step
closer to breeding an unstoppable killer bacteria strain.

DEMOGRAPHERS CAUGHT LOOKING ON U.S. TRENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When World War II ended and Americans refocused on
home life, the nation's population experts failed to predict that
they would have so many babies for so many years. When women
started streaming into the work force, the experts took decades to
understand the magnitude of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having bungled the two most important demographic changes
in postwar America _ the baby boom and the rise of working women _
population specialists are making crucial forecasts that will shape
the debate over how to shore up Social Security and Medicare. And
this time, even they say that they are not sure they can produce
the accurate numbers lawmakers need.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering major changes to the two massive
programs for the elderly. Some lawmakers have called for cuts in
benefits, others for tax increases. President Clinton has proposed
diverting $3.4 trillion in additional cash to the programs during
the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   These proposals are driven by demography, the study of
population. The nation's 76 million baby boomers will hit
retirement age early in the next century, forcing huge payouts by
Social Security and Medicare. But no one knows how many retirees
there will be, how many workers will pay taxes to support them, or
how badly the programs will be squeezed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anyone who can challenge economists for making bad
predictions, it's demographers,'' said Patrick Burns, a population
expert at the National Council of Senior Citizens. ``I believe in
my profession. I believe they'll be right for the next few years.
But beyond that? They've never been right before.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Census Bureau, looking ahead 50 years, cannot even give a
firm population estimate. Its highest- and lowest-case guesses
differ by 236 million people. Put another way, its margin of error
is almost equal to the population of the United States today (about
272 million).
</P>
<P>
   And yet Congess must look beyond 50 years in attempting to
repair the financial problems facing Social Security. The program's
nonpartisan actuaries, who evaluate proposed solutions, are seeking
one that works for at least 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Looking that far ahead with accuracy is almost impossible,
demographers say, because human behavior is too unpredictable. But
forecasters have also missed important signs that could have
improved their chances of accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, for example, demographers expected a baby
boom as servicemen returned home. But they said it wouldn't last.
Fertility rates had been declining for many decades as America
became urbanized and less reliant on agriculture. Experts such as
P.K. Whelpton, who made projections for the Census Bureau, said the
falling fertility rates would resume.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the baby boom lasted for two decades and became one of
the defining events of postwar America. ``Whelpton's projections
were abysmally low,'' said Gregory Spencer, who makes projections
for the Census Bureau today. ``This man was one of the trailblazers
of my profession. If a man as great as that can make mistakes, then
it can happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miscalculating another change in behavior, demographers in the
late 1970s saw that the number of high school graduates was falling
sharply. In well-publicized predictions, many concluded that
colleges would soon run short of students, forcing as many as 30
percent of them to close or merge. That would have been a
catastrophe for New England, home to a large cluster of schools.
</P>
<P>
   What actually happened? As predicted, a ``baby bust'' cut the
number of high school graduates. But the fraction of them going on
to college skyrocketed. The demographers failed to see that with
blue-collar wages falling, a college education became far more
important, said Paul Harrington of Northeastern University's Center
for Labor Market Studies. ``You couldn't have gotten this story
more wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, demographers were slow to understand the movement of
women into the work force. From the 1950s through the 1980s, they
constantly understated the number of working women and the big
increases in their hours on the job. As a result, government
forecasts for the size of the US work force were too low, said
Andrew Sum of Northeastern's labor studies center.
</P>
<P>
   No one says that these mistakes should dissuade politicians from
trying to fix Medicare, which is projected to see its trust fund
run dry in 2008, or Social Security, which in 2013 is expected to
start paying out more in benefits than it raises each year in
taxes. Lawmakers do not need dead-on figures in order to strengthen
the programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture that demographers draw of the future can have a
major effect on politics today.
</P>
<P>
   That is because people who favor radical changes to Social
Security and Medicare tend to portray the programs as facing a
demographic nightmare _ a crisis even greater than government
officials expect. Those who want only modest changes say the
programs face only modest challenges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Cato Institute, an influential libertarian
think tank in Washington, says that tinkering cannot fix the Social
Security program. It wants wholesale change. Instead of paying
taxes to the government, it says, workers should put money into
their own stock and bond accounts and retire on the nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its argument, Cato says that Social Security is in
more trouble than it acknowledges. The reason: People will live
longer than forecasters at the Social Security Administration
predict, so future costs will be higher than estimated. And worker
paychecks will rise more slowly than Social Security forecasts, so
its future tax revenues will be lower than estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Making the opposite argument for Medicare, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy says the future will be kinder to the health-care program
than most people expect. Scientific advances will bring new medical
treatments that save Medicare millions of dollars. It would be
imprudent to make radical changes to Medicare today, he says,
because we don't know what the future will hold.
</P>
<P>
   To paint a vision of the future, demographers make assumptions
about three key factors: life span, birthrates, and immigration.
Small changes in each one can have a big effect on government
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Consider life span. The Social Security Administration says that
by 2075, Americans on average might live as few as 78 years or as
many as 85, up from about 76 today. Longer lives might be
desirable, but they also mean more Americans will draw more Social
Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   If life span rises to 78 years, a payroll tax increase of 1.6
percentage points, or equivalent program cuts, would be needed to
fix Social Security for the next 75 years. That would bring the
current 12.4 percent Social Security tax to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But if Americans live to age 85, Social Security would need a
far larger tax increase of 3 percentage points today to remain
stable.
</P>
<P>
   It might cost even more. Many demographers think that advances
in medicine, better diets, and other factors will allow people to
live into their 90s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Birthrates are even trickier to predict. They have risen and
fallen in recent years among American women, and nobody is sure
why.
</P>
<P>
   In their worst-case scenario, Social Security actuaries say US
birthrates could fall to 1.6 children per woman, down from a little
above 2 children today. At that rate, it would take an immediate
tax increase of nearly 2.6 percentage points _ or program changes
worth an equal amount of money _ to fix Social Security for the
next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor _ immigration _ is highly dependent on political
changes. And all manner of economic trends, from wages to
productivity, could have a big effect on government finances.

SENATORS LEAN ON OLYMPICS TO REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the International Olympic Committee gathers this week in
Switzerland to expel wrongdoers and repair its reputation, it will
do so under threat of action by members of Congress poised to force
fundamental changes in how the Olympics does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant (IOC) dependency on the United States
that gives the United States significant interests,'' said Senator
John McCain, an Arizona Republican with presidential ambitions.
``We're not asking for the United States to control the Olympics.
But I think American interests should beneficially impress upon
them the need to clean up the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That dependency, as McCain sees it, results from simple
economics: 60 percent of the money that fuels the Olympics comes
from US sources. IOC officials called that figure exaggerated but
would not elaborate. United States Olympic Committee officials,
however, said the amount is closer to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC jealously guards its finances _ a source of irritation
among investigators examining vote-selling allegations _ but there
is general agreement that the Olympics would essentially cease to
function without the roughly $450 million paid every four years by
US-based corporations that are nine of the IOC's 11 chief sponsors,
and the $3.5 billion in television rights fees paid by NBC to
broadcast the Games through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   New concerns about where that money goes, and what the United
States gets in return, have arisen as an outgrowth of the scandal
involving alleged bribery of IOC members by Salt Lake City
organizers and other would-be Olympic hosts. In response, McCain,
as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, has scheduled an
April 14 hearing on the Olympics and plans to invite IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the question he wants answered is whether the IOC
has proven itself so inept at controlling itself and the Games that
Congress should seek to redirect some portion of the American
money, most likely away from the IOC and toward its US affiliate,
the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain and Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who is
the chief author of federal laws governing amateur athletics, are
insisting that the IOC _ starting with its meeting this week _ take
what McCain called ``appropriate steps'' toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   By their definition, that mans adopting the proposals outlined
in a report two weeks ago by former Maine senator George Mitchell,
which include major changes in the way IOC members are chosen, term
limits, greater financial accountability, and strict enforcement of
rules on gift-giving and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   This week, at least, Mitchell's report is not on the IOC's
agenda, which focuses primarily on dealing with six IOC members
facing expulsion, changing the way host cities are chosen, and
creating a commission to consider ethical and other reform issues,
possibly including Henry Kissinger as a panel member.
</P>
<P>
   McCain used diplomatic language to warn of consequences if the
Mitchell report is not addressed. ``I would deeply regret that, and
I would urge them to seriously consider every recommendation of the
(Mitchell) commission,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain declined to limit his options, but the Senate committee's
staff director, Mark Buse, said failure by the IOC to act
decisively might prompt the senators to consider legislation that
would remove the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States,
depriving it of millions of dollars in tax breaks on the
sponsorship deals with US-based corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do anything that would damage or hurt the
Olympic movement,'' Buse said last week. ``We're trying to use our
leverage to force them to clean up their act so the Olympics will
survive and continue to prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential move by Congress would be to redirect the
money paid by NBC for Olympic television rights. Rather than have
that money paid to the IOC, the US Amateur Sports Act could be
amended to put that money under the control of the USOC, which now
receives 10 percent. If Congress altered that balance of power, the
USOC would be in a position to determine how much to give to the
IOC, how much to keep for American athletes, and how much to share
with other national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense, that would greatly diminish the IOC's
power by putting the USOC on almost equal financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their image has been badly tarnished by this scandal,'' McCain
said. ``They should understand that the United States, because of
our funding, might not be more equal to others, but they shouldn't
do anything that would put that funding in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments underscore an undisputed fact of life for the
Olympics: While no nation is supposed to have preference over any
other _ nationalism is anathema to what the IOC calls ``Olympism''
_ the United States is first among equals, particularly where
finances are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials grudgingly acknowledge that fact, but also
maintain there is widespread misunderstanding about what the IOC
does with the money it receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do recognize the special nature of the United
States in the Olympic movement,'' said IOC vice president Richard
Pound. ``But if it's perceived as a US creature you lose the
international flavor and possibly the universality.''
</P>
<P>
   Added IOC marketing director Michael Payne: ``Without question,
America is the single most important market of the 200 countries''
that participate in the Olympics. However, he stressed, ``The IOC
and the Olympic Games are not supported by one dollar of taxpayer
money. It is totally privately funded. It is not like any other
international organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Payne said, the IOC keeps only about 10 percent of the
money in takes in, redistributing the rest to the cities that host
the Games and to national Olympic committees, with the biggest
share already going to the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money is going to all of the countries to support their
teams,'' Payne said. ``If somebody is wanting to cut that back,
quite simply the Games won't take place because there won't be the
financial mechanisms to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no other Olympic committee gets a direct share of the
television rights, while the USOC gets 10 percent, rising to 12.5
percent in 2004, as well as millions more in IOC support. In 1988,
the USOC's share of the US television rights was $37.5 million;
that is expected to rise to $112 million in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress delves into the IOC's finances, it will find an
organization that during the current four-year period probably will
collect more than $3.6 billion in revenues. Of that, about 10
percent will remain with the IOC, and the USOC gets by far the
biggest cut of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the USOC receives its 10 percent share of the US
television rights. It also receives 20 percent of the estimated
$500 million in revenue from the 11 chief corporate sponsors. By
some estimates, the combination should give the USOC about $200
million during the current four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Other national Olympic committees complain that the United
States already gets more than its share, but from the USOC's
perspective it does not get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're resented. . . . But 70 percent of the IOC's revenue
comes from the US,'' said Richard Schultz, USOC executive director.
</P>
<P>
   It also rankles the USOC that the United States, with two IOC
representatives, has the same number of seats as countries such as
Belgium, Sweden, and Morocco, and is outgunned by Italy with four
and Switzerland with three.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy financial reliance on US-based corporations and
broadcasters can be traced to the early 1980s, the dawn of
Samaranch's reign as IOC president, when the Olympics were nearly
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the worst, Samaranch turned to his old friend, Adidas
heir Horst Dassler. Dassler had a deceptively simple solution,
translated roughly as: Go West, young man. ``To get at the big
money nowadays, one has to go international, to the big
multinationals,'' Dassler said at a 1982 meeting of an Olympic
finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was sound fiscal advice, and Samaranch followed it
religiously and successfully through the 1980s and '90s, selling
sponsorships and television rights that attracted billions of
dollars, which turned the International Olympic Committee into a
financial juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic historian John Lucas, a retired Penn State professor,
cautioned that any change in the financial balance between the IOC
and national Olympic committees, including the USOC, could have a
dangerous ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things the IOC does with its vast fortune is to
subsidize athletes. The people that would suffer the most would not
be the IOC, but the 3,500 to 4,500 male and female Olympic athletes
from the poorest countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporate sponsors, meanwhile, are hoping that the IOC does
whatever is necessary to protect their mutual interest: restoring
the luster on the Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what anyone is expecting from this week, but the
last thing we're expecting and the last thing we need is any more
drama,'' said Susan Rosenberg, spokeswoman for UPS, one of the
chief Olympic sponsors. ``The Olympics has been a very valuable
program for us. Whatever the IOC does, whatever Congress does, we
just don't want to see that change.''

PRIVATE LIVES 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The private life of a presidential candidate may
seem like the last thing to become an issue in Campaign 2000, given
the public's attitude toward the impeachment trial and tribulations
of President Clinton. But the opposite may prove true: The public
may want more assurance than ever that candidates don't have a
problem in their past that will lead to Lewinsky redux.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is surely suffering from Monica fatigue. The last
thing voters want is to have their next president installed in the
Oval Office only to discover some past indiscretion that sets
partisans talking impeachment again.
</P>
<P>
   Better, some say, to vet the field now, before any electoral
commitments have been made.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean for campaign 2000? A few clues are beginning
to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The asking of the adultery question _ the ``Big A'' as it is
known _ remains one of the controversial issues in politics. But
its possible relevance was underscored last week by George
Stephanopoulos, who in 1992 was Governor Bill Clinton's chief
defender against allegations that the he had had an affair with
Gennifer Flowers. Stephanopoulos, in promoting his new book, ``All
Too Human,'' suggested that he wouldn't have gone to work for
Clinton if he knew then what he knows now.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the aide who urged the press not to delve into
Clinton's personal life now wishes he had known more about it.
``Maybe I just did not want to know,'' Stephanopoulos told
Newsweek. ``If I knew everything then that I know now, of course I
wouldn't'' go to work for him. And, perhaps, a more fully informed
electorate might not have voted Clinton into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from now on, most candidates for office are likely to
meet greater skepticism than ever. In addition to questions about
adultery, they may be asked questions about drug use or business
activities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an academic issue for the current crop of
presidential hopefuls. Last month, when CNN's Bernard Shaw
questioned Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, about his
aspirations, the veteran anchorman bluntly stated: ``You had an
affair (during) your first marriage,'' and then asked whether
private acts should be publicly discussed in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was surprised at the question, but also carefully
prepared for it. ``Let me say that I am responsible for the breakup
of my first marriage. I will not discuss or talk about that any
more than that.'' He said it will be up to the American people to
judge his morality.
</P>
<P>
   It may be easier for McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran who was
a prisoner of war, to handle such questions than it was for
Clinton, who was under attack in 1992 for dodging the draft at the
same time he was addressing questions of marital fidelity. If past
campaigns are a guide, the better McCain does, the more that
questions will be asked about his private life.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush also has tried to dodge questions
about his private life, uttering what has become the best-known
quote of the nascent campaign. ``When I was young and
irresponsible,'' he says, ``I was young and irresponsible.'' When
Bush was asked if he had used marijuana or cocaine, he declined to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But can such dodges stand up in the age of Internet gossips and
paid exposes in publications such as Hustler magazine? After all,
it was none other than George the younger who felt compelled in
1987 to take the lead in denying rumors that his father, Vice
President George Bush, had committed adultery. ``The answer to the
`Big A' question is `N-O,' '' George W. told Newsweek as his father
was preparing to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the theme of Campaign 2000 could be ``Won't Get Fooled
Again.'' Clinton, who famously said he smoked marijuana but didn't
inhale, went on argue in his impeachment trial over the meaning of
sexual relations, and the definition of the word ``is.'' So if
candidates offer vague responses to questions or seems prone to
obfuscation, it will be understandable if reporters and the public
insist on more refined answers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some GOP nomination candidates such as Patrick
Buchanan have made morality a platform of their campaigns.
Meanwhile, various political operatives with plenty of vested
interests are already at work urging news organizations to launch
investigations of certain presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns are certain to hire ``opposition research'' teams to
investigate opponents, and, in some cases, may investigate their
own candidate as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle, who is still trying to
recover from a 1988 investigation of his personal background,
pledged last week that he would not raise personal questions about
an opponent's past. ``What happened 15, 20 years ago is really
irrelevant,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   It was 12 years ago that former Washington Post reporter Paul
Taylor inaugurated this reportorial tack when he famously asked
Democratic presidential hopeful Gary Hart, a former US senator from
Colorado, if he committed adultery. ``I don't have to answer that
question,'' Hart said, setting in motion a chain of events that
doomed his campaign. Reporters followed him around and discovered
Hart had a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Today Taylor is executive director of the Alliance for Better
Campaigns, a Washington organization that is pushing for changes
that lead to better dissemination of campaign information on the
television airwaves. He still believes he was right to have asked
Hart the adultery question because of the unique circumstances of
the time, but he said it should not be an automatic query.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggests his own caveat-filled guideline:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is a threshold question that ought to be
asked,'' he said, referring to adultery. ``If, on the other hand,
there is a pattern of reckless philandering, then maybe it does. I
would tend to suggest that probing of matters of health, wealth,
and illegal activity is in bounds, matters of sex are out of
bounds. But these are not hard and fast rules, and you have to take
every situation as it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it depends.
</P>
<P>
   It may depend, for example, on what happens within the
Republican Party. In December, after Hustler magazine was preparing
to expose an affair by the presumptive speaker of the US House of
Representatives, Robert Livingston, Republicans pressured the
Louisiana congressman out of the job. That led some observers to
suggest that a presidential candidate must be adultery-free, while
others said that the public distaste for impeachment meant there
should be such a standard.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the pattern of the 1992 campaign will be followed, only
in more condensed form. In that race, when few people had heard of
the Internet and cable news was still perceived by many as an
interloper, much of the mainstream media refrained from reporting
the Flowers-Clinton story. It was only after the tabloid Star paid
for the story that it became big news. This time around, skepticism
is higher, anyone with Internet access is a publisher, and cable
news has turned into a highly competitive 24-hour phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest pressure on the candidates may come from those
who aspire to the Stephanopoulos role in the 2000 campaign. The
candidates' top aides may be the ones who ask the adultery question
that Taylor posed to Hart, seeking reassurance that the campaign _
or the presidency _ they're trying to fuel will not self-destruct
down the road.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Betty Friedan brands her as antiwoman. Erica Jong
insults her as ``so ignorant.'' And withering e-mails call her
names and trash her ideas in terms too nasty to repeat. But
Danielle Crittenden, the cause celebre, only rolls her eyes and
gives a so-what shrug as she revels in her new status as belle of
the antifeminist ball.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden, 35, is the author of ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell
Us,'' a provocative new book that lays the blame for everything
that makes women unhappy _ in their sex lives, their marriages,
their mothering, their jobs _ on 30 years of feminist orthodoxy
that tricked a generation of females into thinking equality with
men would be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems originate not in our oppression, but in our new
freedom,'' writes Crittenden, a Toronto-born journalist
transplanted three years ago to Washington. ``Pretending that we
are the same as men _ with similar needs and desires _ has only led
many of us to find out, brutally, how different we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Her argument is old, but by being the polar opposite of the
scowling Phyllis Schlafly, the stylish, socially connected
Crittenden aims her appeal at 20-somethings who take women's rights
for granted but are not sure their stressed-out working mothers
were right when they said women could have it all.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden, moreover, is part of a new cadre of media-savvy,
``nonfeminist'' conservatives who are telling women they can
embrace more-traditional values, find contentment, and even have
some fun without donning a dowdy housedress and becoming June
Cleaver. Prenuptial abstinence, early marriages, children cared for
by nonworking moms, and midlife careers for women is their advice
for correcting what is wrong with the culture; what makes women
guilty, tired, and depressed; and what makes men irresponsible and
confused.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue,'' Wendy
Shalit, a 23-year-old recent Williams College graduate, makes the
argument for giving up co-ed bathrooms and one-night hookups, and
finding a new chastity. Women lost the sexual revolution, along
with romance, she says, and will be empowered only if they hold
back and wait for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Schiffren, a New York writer and former aide to Vice
President Dan Quayle, says women must mind their biological clocks
and set a goal of being married by 25. Melinda Ledden Sidak, once a
Washington lawyer in a high-power firm and now a stay-at-home
mother and writer, suggests women can be fulfilled only by putting
their careers on hold to nurture children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminists shout, `How dare you say mothers stay home with
their kids? The women's movement is all about choices!' ''
Crittenden said in a feminist falsetto. ``Well, we all know their
ideology is empty and out of touch with reality. Women can make
good choices and bad choices, the right choices and wrong choices,
and the consequences affect their husbands and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nibbling at a club sandwich, Crittenden said she knows this
because she has met countless confused young women and studied 30
years of magazines such as Glamour, Vogue, and Cosmopolitan that
portray today's female as ``even more miserable and insecure, more
thwarted and obsessed with men, than the most depressed,
Lithium-popping suburban readers of the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is getting attention and making Crittenden the darling
of Washington's conservative cognoscenti. She was already on her
way to its inner circle as the wife of David Frum, a leading
conservative thinker who writes for Weekly Standard magazine. Until
recently, she was editor of Women's Quarterly, a cutting-edge
journal of antifeminism published by the Independent Women's Forum,
a private policy group formed in 1991 to challenge Washington
conventional liberal wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden is also a charter member of the Censorious Matrons, a
conservative quasi-salon of well-heeled, nonworking Washington
mothers who have pungent political views but try not to take
themselves too seriously, said Sidak, another of the matrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danielle not only has written an important book, but she also
is witty and attractive, and that is an enormous advantage when it
comes to getting these ideas into the mainstream,'' said Kate
O'Beirne, Washington editor of the conservative National Review
magazine. ``It's far more difficult for feminists to portray her as
a traitor to women when she comes across as so bright and hip.''
</P>
<P>
   This antifeminist wave also is breaking at an auspicious time:
The yearlong Monica S. Lewinsky scandal has made a virtue of sexual
restraint, and feminist leaders who staunchly defended President
Clinton in spite of his bad behavior have looked bewildered and not
very credible, particularly on issues such as sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this climate, calling ``What Our Mothers Didn't Tell
Us'' contrarian is an understatement. In it, Crittenden is nothing
if not blunt:
</P>
<P>
   --On casual sex: ``So long as there is no readily understood and
accepted way for women to say `no' to men they like or hope to see
again, women lose their power to demand commitment from men.''
</P>
<P>
   --On delaying marriage: ``If a woman remains single past 30, she
may find herself tapping at her watch and staring down the
mysteriously empty tunnel. When a train finally does pull in, it is
filled with misfits and crazy men, like a New York City subway car
after hours.''
</P>
<P>
   --On feminist wives: ``A woman who is accustomed to viewing
herself as an entirely liberated creature will be entirely
unprepared to take full charge of traditional chores like cooking
or the laundry, no matter how helpful and diligent her husband may
be. Marriage is not as good a deal for men as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   --On motherhood: ``No one compels us to have babies. The local
humane society will not let you adopt a puppy if you work full
time. Why should our standards for children be any less?''
</P>
<P>
   Friedan, whose ``Feminine Mystique'' launched the women's
movement in the early 1960s, said Crittenden is competely off base.
Research shows that women are mentally, physically, and financially
healthier today than they were 25 years ago; children raised by
working parents are as well off as those with stay-at-home mothers;
and girls identify with the goals of the women's movement as
strongly as their mothers did, Friedan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more attention being an enfant terrible, going
against the grain, and saying shocking things,'' Friedan said.
``But let's face it: these women are products and beneficiaries of
the women's movement, and now they are biting the hand that has fed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Crittenden looks suspiciously like a liberated woman.
She said her mother, a divorced journalist, taught her to be
independent, and her stepfather, a newspaper columnist, trained her
``by osmosis'' to be conservative. She skipped college _ ``it
seemed pointless,'' Crittenden said. She wrote for her stepfather's
newspaper and then went headstrong at age 25 into a marriage of
brainy equals that became a battleground over who did the dishes
and took out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Crittenden said she did not come to her senses about feminism's
bad bargain for women until three years later, when her first child
was born. ``To me, it was a no-brainer,'' Crittenden said. ``Babies
had to come before writing books.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds it outrageous that so many other women see staying
home with young children as a privilege rather than a right. Not
all women, of course, have what Crittenden's got: A helpmate
husband who is adoring and very rich. Children, ages 7 and 5, in
private school. A maid to do housework. A novel in the works, which
she writes when she is not appearing on TV, doing a book interview,
or watching her youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to dismiss me,'' Crittenden said, acknowledging she
is awfully judgmental about feminism for a woman who seems to reap
its fruits. ``I want to make it clear this is not a personal
book.''

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUMAN-DNA (Undated) _ Analyzing the DNA of people living
now, biologists exploring the history of the earliest human
populations say they have evidence of a genetic split in human
ancestors some 200,000 years ago. This date, 70,000 years before
the oldest known fossils of modern man, is much earlier than
previous estimates based on other genetic samples. By Nicholas
Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SINKING-FREIGHTERS (Undated) _ Over the years, the sinking
in 1980 of the Derbyshire, a British bulk carrier three football
fields long, has turned into an epic of scientific debate and
sleuthing, a high-stakes detective story that is still unfolding.
The goal is to stem widespread tragedy. Since the Derbyshire went
down, the sea has claimed 180 ships of similar design and 1,465
lives, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. The vessels go at
a rate of nearly one a month, often mysteriously, like a fleet of
Titanics quietly disappearing from view. By William J. Broad. (2300
words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TREATING-SYNDROMES (Undated) _ For syndromes like Gulf War
and chronic fatigue, the professional debate is not over whether
the symptoms are real. Those affected are definitely sick, experts
say. Instead, it focuses on whether there is any point in
continuing a thus far fruitless search for specific causes. A more
productive approach, they say, would be to treat these syndromes as
one and the same and provide effective treatment regardless of the
cause. By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANGIOGENESIS-CANCER (Undated) _ Researchers are reporting
new insights into understanding angiogenesis, the body's process of
forming new blood vessels, and how it might be blocked as a therapy
against cancer. One team of biologists says it has isolated a new
kind of angiogenesis inhibitor from human cartilage. The powerful
inhibitor may explain why cartilage is a tissue that has no blood
vessels. As with other angiogenesis inhibitors, biologists hope
that it can be used to cut off the blood supply on which tumors
depend. By Nicholas Wade. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FOAM-TERRORISTS (Undated) _ By combining ingredients of
hair-conditioning creams and toothpaste, government chemists have
created a foam they say could neutralize many of the chemical
poisons and disease-causing microbes that might be spread by
terrorists in confined spaces. By Malcolm W. Browne. (580 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEEP-SEA (Undated) _ Human explorers of the eternal darkness
surrounding deep sea hot springs may inadvertently be blinding
swarms of shrimp whose eyes are exquisitely adapted for life in a
world of eternal darkness. By William J. Broad. (550 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-APE-RIGHTS (Undated) _ Animal activists in New Zealand, in a
largely symbolic gesture, are pushing a plan that would give basic
human rights to apes. By Allan Coukell. (475 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EXTINCTION (Undated) _ Scientists now are virtually helpless
as they observe and record the final days of a variety of species
that becoming extinct, particularly in the isolated Mascarene
Islands. By Carol K. Yoon. (826 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WRIGHT-FLIGHT (Undated) _ In a giant NASA wind tunnel used
to test components of advanced airplanes and spacecraft sits a
fragile looking biplane of wood and cloth: a replica of the Wright
brothers' aircraft that began the age of powered flight. Experts
now are trying to figure out just how it did fly and then to
restage the events for the centennial of the first flight, which
occurred in 1903. By Warren E. Leary. (890 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Short items on science: cooking oil for
diesel engines, supercharged rice and carbon dioxide in the ice
ages. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: A
practical guide to deciding the issue of circumcision, in the face
of little guidance from scientific studies. While there are no
clear-cut answers, there are clear issues. A parent's guide. By
Jane E. Brody. (1220 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RABIES (Undated) _ Worldwide, some 30,000 people a year die
from rabies, mostly in developing countries where dogs are not
vaccinated and treatment is not available for people who are
bitten. In the United States, the disease has become extremely rare
in humans, but recent examples show people can be bitten by rabid
bats and not even know it. By Denise Grady. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SLEEP-CAFFEINE (Undated) _ Sleep researchers now believe the
best way to remain alert through the night is to nap in the
afternoon, drink coffee around midnight _ and avoid any catnapping.
By John O'Neil. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NURSING (Undated) _ An essay: Nurses are alarmed that in
medical cost-cutting nursing staffs were cut. And now, they say,
patient care is suffering. By Claire M. Fagin. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-MINIPOOLS (Undated) _ Swimming pools as small as
sport utility vehicles are now the rage in at-home fitness. Current
keep the swimmer in place, like the tread on a treadmill. But the
mini-pools also are playing an increasingly important role in
training world class athletes, whose performance can be closely
monitored in the tanks. By Alex Frankel. (580 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Can a supplement that promises to reduce cellulite actually
work? (365 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A study shows that pregnant women who also have cancer can
successfully be treated with chemotherapy during the final two
trimesters, with no apparent harm to their babies. (330 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Engaging in high-impact exercise or strenuous weight lifting
while taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics, commonly used to treat
urinary tract, bronchopulmonary or intestinal infections, may lead
to tendon ruptures, injuries that can require surgery and months of
rehabilitation. (440 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Is there a fungus that helps trees absorb
water? Yes, it is called mycorrhizae. (300 words)

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How has San Francisco changed since Joe, Dom and
Vince DiMaggio were lads? There are too many ways to count, but one
street scene tells the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while the press, old-timers and younger people with
souls were saying goodbye to Joe, the block in front of his boyhood
home on Taylor Street was blocked off for a film crew.
</P>
<P>
   What were they shooting? No, not a film about Joe. It was a
Peugeot commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The house that was home to 11 DiMaggios is now a ritzy backdrop
for a yuppie French car, pronounced ``Pooh Joe,'' as the carmaker
once said in its ads.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not sorry I restarted the old San Francisco Rename Game
by doing the hackneyed column on what to name for Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you hear a lot of obvious stuff like putting DiMaggio's
name on the new Giants ballpark, the airport, various schools or
the Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants may not want to be disconnected from the Pac Bell
stadium and the $50 million it paid for naming rights. Besides,
DiMaggio played for the Yankees, as many Giants fans and Yankee
fans pointed out _ Yankee fans with characteristic rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the San Francisco International Airport becoming
SFJoe is alluring, but I have a feeling that Mayor Willie Brown has
that one staked out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Joe's name on a school doesn't seem appropriate. He
didn't spend much of his time in that kind of building.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bay Bridge, it would be nice to have DiMaggio's name
on something that's completed within our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   I did get some cute ideas. John Schutz said that DiMaggio's
church in North Beach should be renamed SS Peter, Paul &AMP; Joe
Church. Just a joke, fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dodds, who lives on Clipper Street, suggested renaming
it Yankee Clipper Street. Just add street-sign extender.
</P>
<P>
   Serious ideas include renaming the North Beach Playground,
Funston Playground, Big Rec in Golden Gate Park, or the field near
the site of the old Seals Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stephans, of El Granada, has an idea that could help
DiMaggio's sport. He'd like to see an annual baseball award to
``the player that best represents the spirit of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa would have won the Joe DiMaggio Award hands down last
year.
</P>
<P>
   People take their DiMaggio and their San Francisco very
seriously. That's the wonderful thing I learned from their letters,
faxes and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   City Supervisor Gavin Newsom is reviewing all the proposals that
have poured into his office, and enjoys reading them so much he
carries them wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous ``captive in Colorado Springs'' argues against
renaming anything: ``I was born and raised in the Mission District
and San Francisco still and always is my home, and let it be as it
has been.''
</P>
<P>
   That gets to the heart of the issue. It's impossible to let San
Francisco be as it has been. The city is changing faster than
usual, and in some ways for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is one fitting tribute to Joe DiMaggio that would
make San Francisco a better place, and not just a place with one
more plaque on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Myslewski writes to say that his baseball-loving son says,
``How can you learn to play when all the baseball fields suck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you been to any of the fields that San Francisco Youth
Baseball leagues are forced to play on in this city?'' Myslewski
says. ``Outfields full of potholes and `extract of dog,' torn-up
infields _ and don't even get me started on the condition of the
base paths.''
</P>
<P>
   A fitting memorial to Joe DiMaggio, he says, would be fields for
kids to learn to play ball without fear of torn ligaments or ``bad
hops so ludicrous that they at best turn a game into a farce, and
at worst can break a jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing an existing field would be a great way to start, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Several other readers echoed Myslewski's thoughts. Dr. Glenn Lew
suggests building new ballparks for kids, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lew says the Little League of San Francisco is small but
growing, and needs a new home. ``San Francisco has no room for
these teams of kids 8 to 14 years of age to play, so they must play
a number of their games in Sausalito.''
</P>
<P>
   That's shameful. When San Francisco kids go out of town to play
in tournaments, they realize they are growing up as second-class
citizens in sports.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio brought America together. There could be no better
tribute than to make his city sparkle with neighborhood Joe
DiMaggio Diamonds.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

   &UR; By CYNTHIA BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

TECH WORLD TWEAKS CORPORATE TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Traditional corporations should emulate the
informality, flat organizational structures and quick
decision-making prowess of Silicon Valley companies if they plan to
succeed in the future.
</P>
<P>
   So says Karen Southwick in her book, ``Silicon Gold Rush: The
Next Generation of High-Tech Stars Rewrites the Rules of Business''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc., March 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Southwick, who is managing editor of Forbes ASAP, the business
magazine's bimonthly technology supplement, spoke recently about
the pros (mostly) and cons of valley corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   Question: How are tech firms rewriting the rules of business?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: They are totally different from traditional companies in
their structure and the way they deal with people.
</P>
<P>
   They empower people. They share knowledge instead of hoarding
knowledge. They move very quickly. They'd rather move and make a
mistake than not move at all. The industries they're competing in
are moving so quickly, they'd rather just refine things later.
</P>
<P>
   Another main difference is that at (high-tech) companies, the
boundaries are very blurred. They interact with customers and
suppliers in different ways. Customers help design products. These
are small companies, at least initially, so they out-source a lot
of things and have to work very closely with their vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can old-guard corporate America actually apply high-tech
business methods?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think they're going to have to to survive. The fundamental
business model is changing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is part of that. It's sped up the pace of change so
much. It's also the globalization of business. The companies that
don't adapt are going to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   I still think there's quite a bit traditional industry has to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they've embraced the technology, but my impression is that
they haven't changed their underlying culture. Stock options are
still reserved at the executive level in traditional companies.
They still hoard information. But if everyone has e-mail, it's
going to make it hard to keep secrets anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there examples of traditional companies that have
incorporated aspects of high-tech corporate culture or used
technology to make their businesses run more smoothly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Certainly, traditional companies are moving to become less
hierarchical. They've gotten rid of a lot of middle management.
</P>
<P>
   A good example would be Fed Ex. You can on-line track your
packages now, so it becomes more of an information services
company.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is going to be an increasingly important influence in
the way we do business. Even mom-and-pop retail ventures have a Web
site. Eventually, they're going to do e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since there are now some very mature Silicon Valley
companies, such as Hewlett-Packard, is there a fear these
businesses will become more traditional?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true, as companies grow they have to put more structure
in place. On the other hand, these companies have to keep an
entrepreneurial edge and empower people. It's too expected now. If
your company doesn't offer stock options, you just go down the
street to a company that does.
</P>
<P>
   I think H-P, which is probably the biggest company in the
valley, has shown you can get big but still have a lot of these
ideals in place.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they just split up (into two companies), says they
know they had to make big changes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the downside of Silicon Valley's business model?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think technology is definitely creating a two-tier society.
It's making the haves and have-nots divide bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's kind of a frat-boy atmosphere for women and some
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear Asians have prospered, but other minority groups,
like African-Americans and Hispanics, have been left out. Some of
that's education. They don't take enough math and science courses.
Really, the way to move to the top of these companies is to be an
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove the technology industry to take more of an
interest in our educational system.
</P>
<P>
   From what I've observed of these companies, they're also
obsessed with youth. If you're over 40, you're washed up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see Silicon Valley in 10 or 20 years? Can it
keep soaring ahead?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't see Silicon Valley losing its leadership role.

now, biologists exploring the history of the earliest human
populations say they have evidence of a genetic split in human
ancestors some 200,000 years ago. This date, 70,000 years before
the oldest known fossils of modern man, is much earlier than

The goal is to stem widespread tragedy. Since the Derbyshire went

the symptoms are real. Those affected are definitely sick, experts
say. Instead, it focuses on whether there is any point in
continuing a thus far fruitless search for specific causes. A more

MOTHER WIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 21)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No, it had nothing to do with ethics,'' said President
Clinton's friend Vernon Jordan, originally from Georgia, explaining
to Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas why he would have no hand in the
destruction of evidence, ``as much as it's just good common sense,
 &UR; mother wit &LR; . You remember that in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   In another answer, Jordan used the phrase in a way that defined
it: ``If you had been sitting where I was ... I think just  &UR; mother
wit &LR; , common sense, judgment would have suggested you would be
interested.'' Hutchinson took the dialect cue and began another
question with ``Let's put it in the realm of  &UR; mother wit &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   These gentlemen were using a phrase unfamiliar to many in
Northern and Eastern linguistic regions but easily understood by
``country'' talkers and especially black Americans; it is deeply
rooted in the usages of some of the great contributors to the
English language.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase was defined by E. Cobham Brewer in the 1894 edition
of his Dictionary of Phrase and Fable as: ``Native wit, a ready
reply; the wit which `our mother gave us.' In ancient authors ...
courteous but not profound.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deliciously scholarly Dictionary of American Regional
English (DARE), this 1973 definition by Alan Dundes can be found:
``A popular term in black speech referring to common sense ... not
necessarily learned from books or in school.  &UR; Mother wit &LR;  with its
connotation of collective wisdom acquired by the experience of
living and from generations past is often expressed in folklore.''
</P>
<P>
   First recorded in 1440, it was attributed to Mother Nature by
Edmund Spenser in his 1596 ``Faerie Queene'': ``For all that nature
by her  &UR; mother wit &LR; /Could frame in earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare picked it up in his ``Taming of the Shrew,'' with
Kate asking mockingly, ``Where did you study all this goodly
speech?'' and Petruchio replying, ``It is extempore, from my
 &UR; mother-wit &LR; .'' In ``Growth of Popery'' (1677), the poet Andrew
Marvell of coy-mistress fame immortalized the phrase in an
apothegm: ``An ounce of  &UR; mother-wit &LR;  is worth a pound of clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   This century, William Butler Yeats gave it a romantic twist: ``I
had the wisdom love brings forth;/I had my share of  &UR; mother wit &LR; .''
More recently, the phrase has been appropriated by black writers.
Ralph Ellison, in ``The Invisible Man'' (1952), has a Harlem blues
singer rhymingly opine that ``all it takes to get along in this
here man's town is a little ... grit, and  &UR; mother-wit &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In her 1969 memoir, ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' the
poet Maya Angelou wrote of advice to be ``intolerant of ignorance
but understanding of illiteracy,'' noting the intelligence of those
unable to go to school: ``She encouraged me to listen carefully to
what country people called  &UR; mother wit &LR; . That in those homely
sayings was couched the collective wisdom of generations.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, several books have used the phrase in the title,
including Ronnie Clayton's `` &UR; Mother Wit &LR; : The Ex-Slave Narratives
of the Louisiana Writers' Project'' and ``Folk Wisdom and  &UR; Mother
Wit &LR; : John Lee, an African-American Herbal Healer,'' by Arvilla
Payne-Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   This raises (but, I regret, does not beg) the question: Are
there any other words, rooted in midmillennium English and
preserved in dialect, that appear in the speech of Southerners,
especially African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Airish &LR;  is one; Chaucer used it in the 14th century to mean
``aerial''; in Scotland, it developed a sense of ``cool, chilly''
and is preserved in a kind of dialectic amber today in the sense of
``haughty, snooty,'' from one who ``puts on airs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way,  &UR; dry &LR;  as a modifier was used by the playwright
Ben Jonson in 1637 to mean ``meager, colorless,'' as he gave us
some good advice: ``As wee should take care, that our style in
writing, be neither dry, nor empty.''
</P>
<P>
   According to DARE, published by the University of Wisconsin,
that sense persists among black speakers today, meaning ``plain,
without accompaniments,'' like `` &UR; dry &LR; , without lemon or milk'' in
tea. Similarly,  &UR; nature &LR;  was used by Chaucer in a sense of ``sexual
vigor,'' and that special sense is retained, but only in regional
dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another Old English phrase much more often used by blacks
than whites today:  &UR; make haste &LR; , first used as `` &UR; Make haist &LR;  (O
Lorde)'' in Coverdale's translation of the Bible's Psalms, and
taken up by the novelist Henry Fielding in ``Tom Jones'' in 1749:
``It was necessary for him to  &UR; make haste &LR;  home.'' Today, DARE
counts it as ``formerly widespread, now especially South and South
Midland, especially frequent among Black speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this preservation in black speech? Says Michael Montgomery,
of the University of South Carolina, now writing a Smoky Mountains
dialect dictionary: ``Popular speech is really quite conservative.
Things hold on in settings of social isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should specific Scots-Irish English dialect usages be the
ones that hold on? ``Most overseers who ran the slave plantations
were not very well-educated white men. We can tell from their
surnames that most were Scots-Irish, or came from places like
Ulster but had a Scottish heritage. The dialect they spoke was not
London English, but was the English language the slaves heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a modicum of  &UR; mother wit &LR;  should know that. If I
were not so overeducated, and had a little  &UR; horse sense &LR;  (1832) or
 &UR; common sense &LR;  (1543, from the 1398  &UR; common wit &LR; ) or  &UR; dry
gumption &LR; , I would have been able to figure that out for myself.

NEW ZEALANDERS PRESS PLAN FOR APES' RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALLAN COUKELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ A group of activists here is pushing a
plan that could make the nation the first in the world to grant
basic ``human'' rights to apes.
</P>
<P>
   The activist group, the Great Ape Project of New Zealand,
advocates that animal welfare legislation currently under review be
amended to guarantee basic rights to chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas
and orang-utans.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guarantees include the right not to be deprived of
life, the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel treatment
and the right not to be used in medical or scientific
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   The group, representing 38 New Zealand scientists,
conservationists and academics, is affiliated with the Great Ape
Project International, which was formed in 1993 to campaign for a
United Nations charter on Great Apes.
</P>
<P>
   In a submission to a parliamentary committee, the New Zealand
group argued that great apes shared many human emotional and
psychological characteristics, including self-awareness, the
ability to reason and the ability to imagine what others are
thinking and feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have little direct effect in New Zealand,
because primates are not used in research here, and the country has
fewer than 50 chimpanzees and orangutans in total.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is important for New Zealand to take the lead
on this issue, said David Penny, scientific spokesman for GAP New
Zealand and professor of theoretical biology at Massey University
in Palmerston North. People from overseas ``are almost begging us
`please, if you go and do it, then we can follow. We need someone
to take the lead,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments can be powerful in New Zealand, where many people
are proud of the country's bold anti-nuclear stance and its past
trailblazing approach to women's suffrage, whaling and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue has yet to catch fire in public opinion and the
proposal does have its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Professor David Mellor, also of Massey University, presented a
submission to the parliamentary committee opposing the suggested
changes. Mellor is an animal ethicist who is respected for his work
in improving animal welfare in New Zealand. He argues that the bill
as written is adequate to protect New Zealand's few great apes.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be inappropriate to introduce major changes of
this kind without further public consultation. He also expressed
concern that in the long term these changes could affect the
nation's legal and moral relationships with other animals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it may be arguments about process, rather than
ethics, that prevent the proposed changes from going through. But
even Mellor acknowledged that changes in attitudes toward the great
apes and other ``higher'' animals were coming, in New Zealand and
elsewhere: ``The necessary thinking is wide ranging and
multidimensional. It will take time. It will occur. We will be
affected by it.''

FORMER OLYMPIAN DROPS IN TO `GREASE ON ICE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Tonight refers to Tuesday, March 16.)  
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember poodle skirts, ducktails, leather
jackets, sock hops, drag racing?
</P>
<P>
   The stage show (before it was a movie) that memorialized those
'50s icons, opens tonight in a new, really cool adaptation _
``Grease on Ice'' _ at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And hand-jivin' with the rest of the cast will be 22-year-old
Natasha Kuchiki, a lifelong figure skater who (with then-partner
Todd Sand) placed sixth in the 1992 Winter Olympics. Kuchiki, who's
been balancing on blades since she was a year old, plays Frenchie,
the beauty school dropout who lends a sympathetic ear to Sandy
(played by Olympic silver and bronze medalist Nancy Kerrigan) about
her romance with Danny (played by Canadian Matt Williams).
</P>
<P>
   Although Kuchiki has done a few commercials, she said acting
while skating is a challenge _ and an even harder skill to master
was learning to lip-sync to recorded music while doing both.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not just skating, you're telling a story,'' Kuchiki
said. ``It's fun, but it's a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Frenchie's not hard to spot. She's the one who
lives her life in pink: pink pedal pushers, pink prom dress, pink
hair bows and, of course, a Pink Lady jacket to make her one of the
gang at Rydell High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little bit ditsy, like many other teen-agers in this
world,'' Kuchiki said of her character. ``She doesn't know what she
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   While getting inside the character, learning the dance routines
_ rock 'n' roll on the rocks _ supplied a good workout and a lot of
fun, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer Barry Lather, who's worked with pop stars Janet
Jackson and Paula Abdul, rehearsed the ``Grease on Ice'' cast for
three days on stage in a theater with no skates and no ice so they
could get used to the movements of dances that were popular long
before they were born.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchiki loved the dancing almost better than skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me want to hang up my skates and switch over to just
dancing,'' she said. ``I just love to perform. And dance shoes
don't hurt your feet like skate boots do.''
</P>
<P>
   But skating will always be her first love, Kuchiki said. Her
mother, Denise, was performance director for the Ice Capades and
her father, Sashi, was a principal skater when they first allowed
her and her older sister to wobble out onto the ice with them. The
girls traveled with their parents until Kuchiki was 5 years old,
then the family settled into a house in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   After years of practice, Kuchiki teamed with figure skater Todd
Sand; the pair's first major achievements were in 1990, placing
11th in the 1990 World Championships and second in the U.S.
Nationals. The next year, they took first place in the U.S.
Nationals and went on to place near the top in many other
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   After performances tonight and Wednesday at the Sports Arena,
``Grease on Ice'' will move to the Long Beach Arena, with shows
scheduled Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Additional performances are
scheduled for March 23 and 24 at the Pond of Anaheim. All shows
begin at 7:30 p.m. except for a 1:30 matinee performance Sunday in
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets _ at $13.50, $17.50 and $27.50 _ can be purchased at the
box offices or by calling (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.

ABC, KTLA AND E! BATTLE FOR OSCAR VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're often predictable. They've featured
horrendous production numbers and unfunny jokes. Still, America
loves to watch the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's telecast drew a record 87 million U.S. viewers, many
of them rooting for the box-office favorite, ``Titanic.'' Like the
Super Bowl, the Oscars have become a nearly full-day TV event for
some, with hours of live, specially themed coverage devoted to the
biggest night in Hollywood. E! Entertainment has comedian Joan
Rivers interviewing stars as they arrive; Los Angeles' KTLA
(Channel 5) has a ``limo-cam'' that follows a particular nominee
making his or her way to the event.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Oscarcast promises to be one of the more interesting
in recent years, for a number of reasons. The top races this time
aren't generally considered sure things. An honorary award to Elia
Kazan _ who named names during the McCarthy era _ promises to
invite controversy. This will also be the first year ABC has sewed
up exclusive rights to a half-hour of pre-awards TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has broadcast the awards for more than 20 years. The show
has moved to Sunday from Monday this year for the first time. The
move was made to turn the Oscars into an even bigger TV event:
Sunday is the biggest TV viewing night of the week, and the weekend
time slot will allow more of the East Coast audience to see the end
_ and more of the West Coast audience to see the beginning of the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's deal with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
has other TV outlets buzzing. In the past, channels such as KTLA
have covered star arrivals live up to the moment the doors close;
this year, they'll have to stop broadcasting live at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has hired actress Geena Davis and CNN entertainment reporter
Jim Moret to host its exclusive preshow, ``Sunday at the Oscars.''
Dennis E. Doty, the show's producer, says the half-hour will
include star interviews conducted by Davis inside the hall and on
an outside platform by Moret. In addition, according to Doty,
``Sunday'' will include memorable clips from past shows.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of other outlets that have their own preshows
claim they're not threatened by ABC's half-hour preshow lock. ``In
a way, we sort of regard it as a backhanded compliment (that ABC
went after the half-hour exclusive),'' says Sam Rubin, the ``KTLA
Morning News'' entertainment reporter who co-hosts KTLA's ``Live
From the Academy Awards'' program with former Miss America Leanza
Cornett.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin can't resist a bit of sniping, though. ``I think it's kind
of funny that ABC hired a guy from CNN to do their interviews. It
goes to show that it's a specialized thing _ and there was nobody
at ABC who could interview stars,'' Rubin says. He adds, ``We're
nationally syndicated, and several ABC stations have picked us up
in past years. We've cut into ABC's audience. So now they're
flexing their muscles to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin says the only ``weird'' thing about the situation is ABC's
demand that those from other TV outlets not leave the premises
during this half hour. ``Originally, we were going to go across the
street or something and keep doing live coverage during that
time,'' Rubin says. ``We'll still keep taping coverage, which we
can air later. But it's almost like we're prisoners there,'' he
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   John Rieber, E!'s vice president in charge of live event
coverage, maintains that the cable channel's staggering 11 hours of
pre-awards programming won't be affected by ABC's new deal. ``There
is plenty for everyone,'' Rieber says, ``and it's going to be an
all-day party for us. We'll have been live for eight hours before
ABC even starts.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, ABC and the producers of its preshow say they're
not looking to exclude anyone else, just to make their own
presentation bigger. ``We're taking a page from the Super Bowl.
It's always featured a grand overture to the event,'' says Doty.
</P>
<P>
   Doty called any suggestion that ABC was trying to corner the
market for top star interviews ``absolutely not true ... the Oscars
is a giant story. There's a lot of story to be told by everybody,
and they'll all have their place.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what, if any, coverage ABC may give in its
preshow to the controversy surrounding Elia Kazan's honorary Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protests happen every year, and they're not normally part of
the show,'' an ABC spokesman said this week. He cited examples such
as the academy letting Vanessa Redgrave ramble about ``Zionist
hoodlums'' in 1977 as proof that the show hasn't tried to quash
controversy in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Other outlets are vowing to cover any such fracas. Controversy,
after all, makes for good television. ``We cover everything that
takes place at (the awards) ... Whatever happens there, we will
cover it completely,'' says E!'s Rieber.
</P>
<P>
   The bread and butter of the E! and KTLA preshows, though,
remains celebrity interviews. E! scored a coup five years ago by
getting celebrity comedian/host Joan Rivers to conduct its red
carpet interviews. ``Stars don't tend to know outlets; they know
people. E! gets a lot of attention because of Joan Rivers,'' admits
KTLA's Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   To help grease the wheels, though, both E! and KTLA make sure
they do a little preshow publicity of their own. ``We send
invitations and good-luck gifts to the nominees,'' says Rieber,
``and invite them to call Joan. We contact publicists, and
encourage them to have their people there early. It's easier to
have time to talk if they get there early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin says KTLA also does its own pre-Oscar campaigning. ``We
court the publicists. (At the pre-awards day ``walk-through'') we
have a photographer take their pictures and send them the photos.
It's a good keepsake.''
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling that no publicity is bad publicity is likely to
play in everyone's favor on Oscar day, regardless of ABC's new
preshow. ``When I've had someone who was nominated, we'd always hit
all the stops,'' says veteran publicist Henri Bollinger.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bollinger, ``I don't think there's any pecking order to
doing interviews at the Oscars. The pecking order comes in with the
post-Oscar parties ... but once you're there (at the awards),
that's what you're there for. You go down the whole line, you talk
to everyone.'' &QL;

WINE INDUSTRY MOVES FROM TASTINGS TO HARDBALL LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1934, the Wine Institute was a fledgling
nonprofit organization founded by 48 California wineries to help
the battered wine industry regroup after 14 years under
Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a sedate trade group sponsoring wine tastings and
endorsing cookbooks, the Wine Institute today is a sophisticated
public policy and lobbying organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some 430 dues-paying commercial wineries _ out of 740 in
California _ belong to the Wine Institute. It has become the
leading organizational voice of the $11 billion wine industry in
California, where 90 percent of American wines are made.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover began in 1992, according to Wine Institute
president and chief executive John A. De Luca, when the
organization decided to counter moves by government and
anti-alcohol groups to increasingly tax and control wine.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was to promote and lobby for research on the health
benefits of moderate consumption and position wine as the
time-honored drink of civilized life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being defined by our adversaries as a gateway drug, as
a sin tax industry,'' De Luca said. ``In order to redefine the
debate and get it back to the roots of the Mediterranean diet and
lifestyle, we had bring it to the public policy arena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we redefined ourselves, we would have (had) incredible
restrictions on us, like tobacco,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has staked out positions on the health effects
of drinking wine and on governmental regulation of wine sales.
Moreover, it secured congressional approval of laws encouraging the
Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services to study
the benefits of moderate wine and alcohol consumption. Some 15
independent, taxpayer-funded studies with a price tag of about $10
million have resulted, the institute says.
</P>
<P>
   All this activity keeps De Luca on the move. ``I go to
Washington once a month,'' said De Luca, who became president of
the institute in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca, a former aide to Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, recently
testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about state laws
on the direct shipment of wines from wineries to consumers. The
Wine Institute favors liberalization of regulations that restrict
interstate sales, so that ``the hundreds of small wineries that
don't have access to store shelves can circulate their products,''
De Luca said.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute critics such as George Hacker, director of the
alcohol policies project for the Washington, D.C.-based Center for
Science in the Public Interest _ a nonprofit public policy think
tank _ concede that the organization is a serious player in the
hardball politics of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're able to maneuver on Capitol Hill quite well,'' Hacker
said, ``and they're well-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Koch, the institute's vice president for federal
government regulations, used to be chief of staff for House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., and is married to
former President George Bush's daughter Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca emphasizes the economic importance of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The components of our state economy are agriculture and
tourism,'' De Luca said. Wineries are ``central components of both,
as well as a component in the hospitality industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Major wine producers such as Gallo, Canandaigua and Seagram's
Chateau and Estate Wines belong to the Wine Institute, which
operates with a staff of 41. Thirty-one staffers work in the San
Francisco headquarters, and there are seven U.S. regional offices
and eight offices abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The institute declines to disclose its budget. ``We don't want
our opponents to know what kind of resources we have,'' said
communications manager Gladys Horiuchi.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute retains some features of a traditional trade
association, such as promoting California wines abroad. These
efforts appear to be bearing fruit: In 1998, U.S. wineries racked
up export sales of $532 million, a 28 percent jump from 1997. That
year, California exported $425 million worth of wine, up from just
$25 million in 1987, according to the Wine Institute.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is for political savvy, though, that the Wine Institute has
become known.
</P>
<P>
   When the current version of Dietary Guidelines for Americans was
issued in 1995, the revamped guidelines _ seen as Washington's
nutritional seal of approval _ were heralded in the media as a
triumph for the wine lobby. The reason? For the first time,
``moderate'' consumption of wine was accepted as part of a healthy
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Wine industry consultant Ed Everett, president of New World
Wines, a San Francisco wholesaler and importer, attributes much of
the institute's political success to De Luca.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a very, very bright guy,'' Everett said. ``He
understands the big forces. He's experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the federally funded studies of wine drinking,
Everett added, ``He's good at getting Big Uncle to cough up.''
</P>
<P>
   De Luca said that labeling regulations, the dietary guidelines
(due for a five-year update in 2000) and interstate commerce laws
will continue to occupy the institute's political agenda in the
short term. Long term, he said flatly, ``We're deciding who's going
to define the state of wine in America.''

WHEN SYMPTOMS ARE OBVIOUS, BUT CAUSE IS NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., N.J.)   (af)  
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century ago, physicians encountered a syndrome they
called neurasthenia, characterized by a wide variety of symptoms
that variously included fatigue, weakness, muscle and joint pain,
headache, memory and concentration difficulties, runny nose,
disturbed sleep and palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers expected that a cause would soon be identified _ a
virus, bacterium or toxic agent _ that would account for these
complaints. It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I &LR; nstead, through subsequent decades, a host of disorders with
similar sets of symptoms were identified. They included so-called
``effort syndrome'' that afflicted veterans of the Civil War and
World War I, chronic brucellosis, hypoglycemia, myalgic
encephalomyelitis, chronic candidiasis and chronic mononucleosis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the prevailing ailments go by the names of chronic fatigue
syndrome, fibromyalgia, multiple chemical sensitivities, sick
building syndrome, silicone-associated rheumatic disease (from
breast implants) and gulf war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   People afflicted with one or another of these syndromes are
often extremely debilitated and alarmed by the limitations the
ailments place on their lives. Making matters worse is a widespread
but erroneous view that they are not really sick but are fakers or
hypochondriacs whose symptoms are self induced to gain attention,
sympathy or relief from their usual duties.
</P>
<P>
   But the professional debate is not over whether the symptoms are
real _ those affected are definitely sick, experts say _ but rather
whether there is any point in continuing a thus far fruitless
search for specific causes. A more productive approach, they say,
would be to treat these syndromes as one and the same and provide
effective treatment regardless of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of the journal Epidemiologic Reviews, Capt.
Kenneth C. Hyams, who heads the epidemiology division of the Naval
Medical Research Center in Bethesda, Md., noted the remarkable
similarities in the symptom complexes that are the hallmarks of
these diagnoses. All are characterized by fatigue, headache,
difficulty concentrating, muscle or joint pain, impaired memory and
often depression and/or anxiety, with some individual variations.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying fact of all these disorders is that they are
defined only by their subjective symptoms. No objective criteria or
consistent organic explanation can be found for any of them and,
therefore, they are a challenge to study, diagnose and treat.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hyams explained that some patients might be found
to have an immunological deficit, but many others with the very
same deficit were not sick.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the illness may have been preceded by a cold or flu,
but there is no evidence that the infectious virus still lingers in
any form.
</P>
<P>
   A more probable explanation, Hyams and others suggest, is that a
reaction to some physical or emotional stress triggers the various
symptoms that characterize these syndromes.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a lack of objective diagnostic criteria, the
particular diagnosis a patient receives typically depends upon the
patient's most disturbing symptom, the history of exposures the
patient reports and the type of health professional seen _
allergist, gastroenterologist, rheumatologist, neurologist or
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Simon Wessely, professor of psychological medicine and
director of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome unit at Kings College in
London, pointed out in an interview, ``Each specialty goes its own
way in arriving at a diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, patients who see a neurologist may get a
diagnosis of nerve damage whereas those who see a rheumatologist
may get a diagnosis involving joint or muscle pain.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Doctors have been searching for the Holy Grail to
explain these syndromes for the last 150 years without success.
</P>
<P>
   Neither single organic causes _ viruses, immune defects, toxic
agents _ nor single psychological causes _ childhood sexual abuse,
depression or anxiety _ can account for them.''
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; nn
</P>
<P>
   Wessely said that trying to categorize these ailments as either
organic or psychiatric was a disservice to patients. ``If a patient
is told the problem is due to a permanent deficit in the immune
system or a persistent virus or chronic disability of the nerves or
brain, this just generates helplessness and the patient becomes a
victim,'' he said. ``And if you say the problem is psychological,
this generates anger on the part of patients who don't regard
psychological ills as legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Wessely insisted: ``Looking for any single cause misses
the point. Regardless of how or why they may have started, these
syndromes are multifactorial, like heart disease, and their
treatment need not be based on the knowledge of a particular
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hyams emphasized that the lack of objective
diagnostic criteria ``does not mean that these people don't have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ill,'' he said. ``About that, there's no question.
They are not malingerers.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Wessely said, ``Going to the Persian Gulf
definitely affected the health of servicemen. We showed very
considerable health effects. But that doesn't mean the disease they
contracted is unique to science. They have legitimate health
problems, but there is no single illness or single cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the problems holistically, Hyams said: ``Even if these
illnesses were primarily psychiatric, psychiatric illnesses have an
organic basis in the mind. If a person is sick in any one place, it
affects the whole body. For example, a psychiatric illness can
cause changes in life style that can have profound physiological
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elaine Showalter, professor of humanities at Princeton
University and author of ``Hystories: Hysterical Epidemics and
Modern Media'' (Columbia University Press, 1998), said her analysis
of the history of these disorders demonstrated that they
represented ``a basic human phenomenon _ the way people react to
various stresses, with symptoms that are not organically based.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are genuinely experienced, debilitating and
absolutely real, but a lot of energy and money have been spent
looking for organic explanations and treatments for what is
basically a psychological phenomenon that is not caused by a virus,
nerve gas, immune defect or any other tissue change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyams said, ``You always find high rates of these kinds of
symptoms in any population reported to have been exposed to
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' he added, ``are sensitized by reported health
threats if they think they've been exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The most effective treatment to date for the various syndromes,
Wessely said, is outlined in a report on chronic fatigue syndrome
issued two years ago by the Royal Colleges of Physicians,
Psychiatrists and General Practitioners. It is designed to deal
with the factors that perpetuate illness.
</P>
<P>
   Wessely explains that the profound fatigue and muscle pain that
typifies these syndromes is best treated not by more rest but by a
graded series of exercises that gradually increase a person's
stamina. At the same time, patients are encouraged to shed their
mistaken beliefs (for example, that any activity will make matters
worse) and to restructure their approach to life through 12 weeks
of cognitive behavioral therapy, which seeks to enhance
self-confidence and a belief in a patient's ability to control his
illness instead of having it control him.
</P>
<P>
   If patients are suffering from serious depression or anxiety,
temporary treatment with psychoactive drugs may also be offered,
but as a therapeutic aid, not a cure. &UR;

PUBLIC ACCESS TO HEADWATERS RESERVE BRINGS CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Beginning Monday the first wave of eager
visitors entered the Headwaters forest to see the nation's newest
redwood reserve. The access is being opened even though there are
no marked trails.
</P>
<P>
   When state and federal officials tramped into Headwaters forest
last week, they were enthralled by its unspoiled beauty and careful
to acknowledge a groundswell of public interest in opening the
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But by tour's end, broken branches, sagging ferns and deep and
muddy imprints stomped in the soggy forest floor raised new
questions about just how much public access should be allowed into
a place that until now has been largely untouched by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legitimate issue. We're going to have to look at it
very closely as the state works with federal agencies to develop a
long-term management plan for Headwaters,'' said Steven Glazer, an
aide to state Resources Secretary Mary Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt entered Headwaters
near Fortuna. Targeted to be the primary access for visitors and
their vehicles, the site isn't scheduled to open until June. The
access site that opened Monday is about 6 miles southeast of
Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Government representatives say they're acting in response to
strong public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting lots and lots of calls. I guess it's
because Head-waters has been in the public eye for so long,'' said
Lynda Roush, field manager for the Arcata office of the federal
Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   After years of negotiations that were completed only minutes
before a March 1 deadline, the federal government agreed to pay
$250 million and California $242 million to acquire the 10,000
acres of ancient redwoods from the Pacific Lumber Co. The company
also agreed to forgo logging for at least 50 years on 7,900 acres
in a dozen other old-growth groves.
</P>
<P>
   Because some key federal lawmakers in 1996 feared rugged and
remote Headwaters would remain isolated and inaccessible to
taxpayers, a provision mandating public access was written into a
1996 congressional authorization of $250 million toward the
forest's purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The present push to open a remnant of ancient redwood forest
before a comprehensive management plan can be developed is raising
serious questions among environmentalists, government biologists,
botanists and fishery experts, who worry about the impacts on a
fragile ancient redwood environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ensure that Headwaters remains wild,'' said Kevin
Bundy of the Environmental Protection Information Center, a group
based in Northern California that has waged a decade-long battle to
permanently protect what was then the last large tract of old
redwoods remaining in private ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau of Land Management botanist Jennifer Wheeler is among
state and federal scientists who agree too many visitors could
destroy the very redwood environment that government leaders seek
to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Headwaters provides an opportunity for important scientific
research, but that's hard to do if overrun by visitors,'' Wheeler
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the scientific concerns, Pacific Lumber Co.,
which owns 200,000 acres of industrial timberlands surrounding
Headwaters, has raised safety issues related to the easement it has
granted to allow public access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The access roads are narrow and will still be used by large
trucks and other equipment. We can't have Winnebagos lined up along
the roadway,'' said Pacific Lumber President John Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   After his hike into Headwaters last Tuesday, Babbitt said he was
in awe of the wild state of the 3,000-acre core. Babbitt pledged to
work to protect Headwaters' integrity, and he vowed not to let the
ecological wonder be turned into a ``Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   But scientists say even with limited access, it won't take much
to jeopardize the untouched nature of Headwaters. Larger and older
groves of ancient redwoods exist in nearly 200,000 acres already
protected in state and federal parks. But in general, few protected
areas match the primitive state of Headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Roush said the Bureau of Land Management will work with state
agencies to develop a long-range management plan for Headwaters.
Despite the quick decision to open the preserve to hikers,
government agencies intend to go slow on allowing broader uses, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The process, anticipated to take up to a year and including
public hearings, will begin this fall. Roush said the likely result
would be a trail system within Headwaters and to points that
overlook the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bailey, the Sierra Club's statewide forestry
representative, said she's in favor of placing limits on the number
of people that will be allowed to tramp through Headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening up Headwaters is going to have to be very carefully
done, or we're going to lose what we set out to protect,'' Bailey
said.

BLOOD VESSEL STUDY MAY HAVE LINK TO CANCER THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Mass.)   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers are reporting new insights into understanding
angiogenesis, the body's process of forming new blood vessels, and
how it might be blocked as a therapy against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, one team of biologists says it has isolated a new kind of
angiogenesis inhibitor from human cartilage. The powerful inhibitor
may explain why cartilage is a tissue that has no blood vessels. As
with other angiogenesis inhibitors, biologists hope that it can be
used to cut off the blood supply on which tumors depend.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of researchers describes a revealing discovery
about angiostatin, a powerful angiogenesis inhibitor discovered
recently in the laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman, the pioneer of the
field. Like other chemical signaling systems in the body,
angiostatin seeks out special receptors that stud the surface of
its targets, in this case the cells that form the blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   After five year's work, Dr. Tammy L. Moser and other biologists
at Duke University have now identified binding sites on blood
vessel cells that are probably the angiostatin receptors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Salvatore Pizzo, the head of Moser's laboratory, said that
now that the binding site is known it may be possible to design a
small molecule that will home in on it as accurately as angiostatin
does. That would improve chances of developing an anti-cancer
treatment because angiostatin itself is very hard to manufacture in
active form.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers recently halted its
work on angiostatin, saying it doubted enough could be made to
support clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the angiostatin was inactive because its structure is so
hard to duplicate. Proteins like angiostatin are made by cells in
the form of a long chain that naturally folds itself up into the
right shape. Sometimes the shape is reinforced with internal
cross-links. Proteins with cross-links are hard to make
artificially because, outside of the human cell, the cross-links
often don't form correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin has three or four regions (depending on how it is
prepared) in which its chain is looped in a characteristic pretzel
shape called a kringle after the Danish cookie of the same name.
Each kringle has three internal cross-links. Because of these 9 to
12 cross-links, preparations of angiostatin are typically only 10
percent active.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been skeptical for quite a while that angiostatin could
be used as a drug candidate. Our yields were terrible,'' Pizzo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, who works at Children's Hospital in Boston, said that
people are slowly learning how to make angiostatin but that ``if
someone could bypass it and make a small molecule that's effective,
that would be a major step, that would be wonderful.'' Discovery of
the angiostatin binding site by the Duke University scientists
``provides a glimpse that you could do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another important aspect of the Duke biologists' work lies in
the nature of the angiostatin receptor they have identified. The
molecule to which angiostatin binds is a large protein enzyme which
generates energy for the cell.
</P>
<P>
   ATP synthase, as it is called, is usually an interior protein
and has never before been found on the outside membrane of a cell.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence on the outside of blood vessel cells could explain
how the cells manage to survive in tumors where there is often very
little oxygen. Presumably the ATP synthase can generate energy from
a substance common in the surrounding fluid, and pump the energy
into the blood vessel cells.
</P>
<P>
   That insight, if true, would immediately explain why angiostatin
has the effect it does. By binding to ATP synthase, it closes down
the cell's energy supply and continued viability.
</P>
<P>
   The odd ability of blood vessel cells to survive in low-oxygen
conditions has been described by Dr. Harrison Farber of Boston
University, who has studied the phenomenon in deep sea turtles. The
Duke finding links the field of angiogenesis to Farber's work,
Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The new angiogenesis inhibitor from human cartilage was found by
Marsha A. Moses of Children's Hospital and colleagues. Dr. Moses
said she was following up an observation made by Folkman in the
1980s, that when pieces of raw cartilage were dropped into a
chicken embryo, the blood vessels would move away as if repelled by
some factor in the cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the pursuit of the factor with new methods, Dr.
Moses and her colleagues discovered a substance in the cartilage of
cow shoulder bones that powerfully inhibited blood-vessel growth.
The substance turned out to be a protein well known in another
context.
</P>
<P>
   It is called troponin I, and is a subunit of the protein complex
that controls muscle contraction. The equivalent human protein was
then isolated from rib cartilage and also found also to inhibit
angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moses' research was funded by Boston Life Sciences, a
biotechnology company, which is testing troponin I's usefulness in
treating the spread of melanoma. The company is conducting animal
tests to calculate the best dose to use in future clinical trials,
which will be on head and neck cancer and on preventing cancer
spread in sarcoma patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc E. Lanser, the company's chief scientific officer, said
that in a standard laboratory test troponin I proved to be
considerably more potent than either angiostatin or endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   Could troponin I have anything to do with claims about the
effectiveness of shark cartilage for treating cancer? Probably not.
If there is any troponin I in shark cartilage, it would be
destroyed by stomach acid, could not in any case cross the wall of
the gut, and even if it did so would not reach any tumors in
meaningful doses, Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman remarked that the new finding may also prove of interest
to arthritis specialists. ``At a certain stage, blood vessels
invade and destroy the cartilage and you have the severe pain in
the joint of bone scraping on bone. Arthritis specialists will
probably start to ask if troponin is lost or destroyed in some way
before the blood vessels come in,'' Folkman said.
</P>
<P>
   A curious feature of angiogenesis is the way it is controlled.
The generation of new blood vessels, such as in wound healing or
menstruation, is not a casual matter for the body; the vessels need
to be switched on and off with the same precision as blood
clotting. Yet instead of having a dedicated set of signals to close
down new blood vessels, the body scavenges pieces from other
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Angiostatin is a part of a larger protein called plasminogen,
which plays a vital role in blood clotting. The angiogenesis
inhibitor is generated when certain enzymes cleave it out of its
parent plasminogen molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly endostatin, another angiogenesis inhibitor found in
Folkman's laboratory, is cleaved out of collagen, the main
structural protein of skin. Troponin I is not generated by cleavage
but its angiogenesis effect seems secondary to its other duties.
</P>
<P>
   Several angiogenesis inhibitors are being tested as tumor
suppressors in clinical trials, although angiostatin and endostatin
are not among them. Folkman hopes some will prove effective but
does not expect any dramatic advance in treatment. He believes
physicians will start to use the various inhibitors in conjunction
with conventional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The particular promise of anti-angiogenesis lies in the fact
that the blood vessel cells it targets are normal cells and thus
not expected to develop resistance to agents directed against them.
Cancer cells, by contrast, are genetically unstable and quickly
develop resistance to chemicals and radiation, which is why cancer
is such an intractable disease.

FUTURE IMPERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRETTING ABOUT the state of the English language, at least among
amateur practitioners, tends to concern itself with the sins of the
recent past and the near future. We think in decades, not
centuries; we've already forgotten that a couple of generations
ago, the usage cops were scandalized to see ``awful'' and
``awesome'' -- which once meant ``awe-inspiring'' -- evolve into
everyday hyperbole, used to describe foul weather or a fabulous
pair of shoes. We've moved on to worrying that our children think
``momentarily'' means ``in a moment,'' and that our grandchildren
will speak a nonsensical babble of ``like, anyways, totally, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But the millennium is an invitation to take a longer view -- in
both directions -- of our native tongue. Next year marks the
1,000th birthday of ``Beowulf,'' the most important of the few
recorded works in Old English. In fact, the heroic poem about
Beowulf's victory over the night-stalking, knight-munching Grendel
is even older, but the survival of the sole manuscript copy,
recorded circa 1000, surely warrants a celebration. Wear your
boar's-head helmet and all your gold bracelets, and serve up plenty
of mead.
</P>
<P>
   Your guests won't be toasting one another in Old English,
though, unless they've done their homework. The language of
``Beowulf,'' also sometimes called Anglo-Saxon, is a foreign
language to 20th-century Americans, a Germanic dialect that came to
England with the fifth-century invaders who drove out the native
Celts. Old English remains the backbone of our language, and many
of its words are with us today -- ``freond'' is now ``friend,''
``hwile'' has become ``while'' -- but when you see a line like
``Nalaes hi hine laessan lacum teodan,'' you know you're a long way
from the Gettysburg Address.
</P>
<P>
   A millennium ago, no one could have imagined that this little
dialect, spoken at the edge of the civilized world, would feed on
the languages of England's successive conquerors, engulfing them
and fattening itself till today it threatens to take over the
world. And yet, so it happened: The Vikings came, saw, occupied,
and left English a treasure trove of new words. In 1066, the
Normans landed, and their rule made French the language of the
leisure class; but 150 years later, the French were becoming
English, and again the language of the conquered people was some
10,000 words richer.
</P>
<P>
   By then it was Middle English, the language Chaucer would use,
and recognizably kin to Modern English: ``And smale fowles maken
melodye/That slepen al the nyght with open eye.'' Two centuries
later we got the King James Bible and Shakespeare -- the former
good enough for generations of Bible readers, the latter accessible
enough to furnish Monica Lewinsky with a valentine quotation for
her favorite president. And by 1800, Jane Austen was writing novels
that a book-loving teenager can read with pleasure today.
</P>
<P>
   So what can we expect in the next 1,000 years? Well, all those
little things word people are worrying about will probably happen
within the next century: We'll say ``Everyone brought their own
lunch'' (and even if you don't like the idea, you'll enjoy John
McWhorter's defense of it in his recent book, ``The Word on the
Street.'') We'll accept ``Who did you hire?'' -- as ``whom''s
doomsayers have predicted for decades. But these are trivial
compared with the transformations of the past millennium and the
possibilities of the coming one. In the year 3000, will anyone be
able to read John Updike, or even Jacqueline Susann? Or will
today's English be impenetrable to the non-scholar?
</P>
<P>
   Even the experts don't know, and they know it. ``It's likely
that English will have changed substantially by 2500 or 3000, just
because no language ever stays put for 500 years,'' says Steven
Pinker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, author of
``The Language Instinct'' and ``How the Mind Works.'' But today's
widespread literacy, he notes, 3could be a wild card,'' helping to
slow the pace of change: Just as the invention of printing stuck us
with some odd spellings that happened to be current at the time,
the very ubiquity of the written language could help stabilize it.
</P>
<P>
   History supports his caution, having made fools of many a
confident prognosticator. ``If, in the Middle Ages, you had dared
to predict the death of Latin as the language of education, people
would have laughed in your face,'' notes David Crystal in his 1997
book ``English as a Global Language.'' Closer to home, there have
been warnings since the American Revolution that British and
American English would diverge into mutually unintelligible
dialects. Thomas Jefferson and Noah Webster believed the split was
inevitable; Shaw's Professor Henry Higgins, of course, thought it
had already happened.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Burgess looked into the future in the 1962 novella ``A
Clockwork Orange'' and saw a turn-of-the-century England terrorized
by violent youths speaking a Slavic patois Burgess called
``nadsat.'' (Yes, Burgess was writing fiction, but he was serious:
He once told an interviewer he expected to see tins of human meat
in supermarkets by 2001.) In fact, what we've got is mallspeak and
TV-speak -- a lot more boring, but a lot less scary.
</P>
<P>
   English has not only remained one language, it has extended its
reach, thanks to its dominance in television, movies, computer
technology, and other sciences, and to the sheer economic power of
the United States. Every morning on BBC radio you can hear
statesmen and spokeswomen from Asian, African, and European
countries speaking adequate-to-fluent English. Worldwide, billions
of people have some exposure to the language; depending on what you
mean by speaking English, some 400 million to 1.5 billion people
may qualify as English-speaking. These include the mother-tongue
speakers -- Canadian, British, Australian -- as well as people in
one of the more than 70 countries, such as India and Ghana, that
give English some special recognition. English seems poised to
become the world's second language, the one most people learn
alongside their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like good news for native speakers of English --
especially for Americans, who are mostly monolingual and who enjoy
being citizens of the world's most powerful nation, language aside.
``Americans have never had much reason to speak foreign languages
well,'' says McWhorter, who teaches linguistics at the University
of California, Berkeley. ``The little scene in old Berlitz books
where a family walks around the capitals of Europe using a phrase
book is long obsolete.'' Any tourist who's ever tried to practice
her fractured French on a Parisian, only to get a response in
condescending English, knows how right McWhorter is.
</P>
<P>
   But a life of complacent monolingualism is hardly an ideal. You
may not aspire to read Caesar or Cervantes in the original, but
even a beginner's acquaintance with other languages can be a
revelation. English is not the only language, you find, with
inexplicable idioms and inconsistent spellings. Other languages
have different ways of letting us know where to find the subject
and the verb. Americans can say some things more economically than
Peruvians or Russians or Japanese, other things not at all. In a
first-year German class decades ago, one of my fellow students was
shocked to find that part of the verb came at the end of a
sentence. He raised his hand and asked in astonishment, ``But they
don't really think that way, do they?'' In the 21st century, nobody
should arrive at college in such a state of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   There's another risk to the English takeover: When the language
is spoken everywhere, who says it's ``our'' language? Within a
generation, Crystal predicts, there will be more people speaking
English in India than in Britain. When the world speaks our
language, it will be everyone's language, available to be reshaped
and modified to suit the needs of very different cultures. (Of
course, it has to remain understandable, or it won't be English.
But another nation's ``English'' might be similar enough for
communication, yet different enough to wound Americans' pride, as
our innovations have miffed the British.)
</P>
<P>
   We make fun of the French for trying to ban foreign words, and
congratulate ourselves on the flexibility and expressiveness of our
patchwork tongue. But the growth of a truly global English, added
to the pressures of the US debate over bilingualism, could provoke
a protectionist backlash. Maybe the English Academy dreamed of by
Dryden, Swift, and other 18th-century men of letters -- a body
entrusted with protecting the language -- will become a reality at
last.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the communications technology could make the
globalization of English a bloodless revolution. Crystal imagines a
World Standard Spoken English, a common language that would unite
peoples without displacing local languages or dialects. Just as we
speak different versions of English to our bosses, our children,
and our buddies, the citizens of the world would use one language
at home, another in international life.
</P>
<P>
   Even a peaceful transition to World English, though, would be a
mixed blessing. The spread of English will surely hasten the
extinction of less-used languages, which are already withering
rapidly. At least we, unlike previous generations, have the means
to preserve records of the doomed dialects (assuming our tapes and
CDs will not themselves go extinct). But a language lost is like a
species lost, gone forever, and with it a set of insights into the
way people think.
</P>
<P>
   And it's impossible to guess what the world may be like when
we've taught it to speak, if not to sing, in perfect harmony. If
English, a few centuries hence, is ``part of a rich multilingual
experience for our future newborns, this can only be a good
thing,'' concludes David Crystal. ``If it is by then the only
language left to learn, it will have been the greatest intellectual
disaster that the planet has ever known.''

FOUR VISIONS OF SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
1. THE NEEDIEST 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMETIME THIS MONTH, a child will approach one of her parents
and ask if the family can see a pro hockey or pro basketball game.
The parent will calmly say yes and tinker with that week's family
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 2005, a child will approach one of his parents and
ask if the family can see a pro hockey or pro basketball game. The
parent will calmly say yes, wait for the child to turn away, and
then begin checking funds in 401(k) plans and certificates of
deposit.
</P>
<P>
   I am waiting to see if several million fans will eventually ask
themselves the following question and give themselves a negative
answer: Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   We all know pro sports tickets are expensive. So is parking. And
concessions. And souvenirs. A person who buys a decent seat for a
Celtics game and pays for parking, food, and a T-shirt is going to
spend $100 in a night. Alone. I wish I could tell you prices will
be lower in the future. They won't. But, again, consider the
question: Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   Sony is currently developing a flat-screen, high-definition
television. Watching TV sports will never be the same. You will be
able to see everything from the sweat on a player's face to the
pores from which the sweat originated. Imperfections will be cured
by the completely flat screen. Today, HDTV is not affordable for
the average fan; it will be in the next few years. So if watching
games on TV will never be the same, I wonder if going to them will
change too, especially with the staggering prices.
</P>
<P>
   We also know that sports and entertainment are beyond the
flirting stage and are now dating seriously. Master P, a rapper, is
in the sports agent business. ESPN has pulled a trifecta, combining
news, sports, and entertainment in an awards event called the
ESPYs. Country singer Garth Brooks tried out for the San Diego
Padres. Disney owns the Anaheim Angels. The Los Angeles Dodgers are
owned by Rupert Murdoch, the same man who brings you ``The
X-Files'' and ``The Simpsons,'' via Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans have good reasons to hope for and against the
complete merger of sports and entertainment. If it happens, it will
most certainly give birth to the full-fledged crossover athlete
and, simultaneously, curtail the evolution of the skilled pro
athlete. Your 21st-century pro will be bigger and faster than ever,
but he won't pitch as well, skate as well, or shoot as well. The
good thing about the mix of sports stars and movie stars? The laws
of supply and demand will be in play. The entertainment dollar is
based on what is hot, unlike the sports dollar, which is based on
price the previous year. The Red Sox, for example, lost one of
their best players and were eliminated in the first round of the
playoffs, but they raised their ticket prices 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should hope for the athlete-entertainer. That way,
going to the FleetCenter will cost the same as going to a movie.
Eight dollars for Celtics-Knicks. That would be fair. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. THE GREEDIEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOMEONE TELLS ME the year is 2010. I have to believe them
because I don't know how long I have been in this room. Three
years? Five years? Have I been here since The Problem truly began
to annoy me, back in 1999? I am surrounded by padded walls. There
is a poster in the corner, an action shot of 37-year-old America
Online/New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe. I know it is
him because I can see the back of his jersey, which reads:
``Bledsoe(at)patriots.com.''
</P>
<P>
   I want to rip the poster off the wall, but I can't. I am in a
straitjacket. The rampant marriage of sports teams and corporations
has not priced me out of arenas and stadiums; it has simply cost me
my sanity. You ask me what started this. You ask a good question.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it began with the innocuous Prudential Halftime Report on
one of the television networks. And then there was this guy Phil
Knight from the Pacific Northwest. He ran a sports giant named Nike
which, fittingly, rhymes with psyche. That is appropriate because
the Nike logo became so prevalent back in the '90s that it was
seared on our psyches. Even the Boston Celtics, one of the most
historic sports teams in the world, splashed the Nike swoosh on
their warmup suits.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Day certainly didn't help. It's not that the football
bowl games bothered me. I even became numb to the dreaded swoosh on
all the players' uniforms. It was the games I was watching. The
FedEx Orange Bowl. The Nokia Sugar Bowl. The Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
There was even the Insight.com Bowl. Insight.com?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I believe '99 did it for me. That's when the New York
Yankees merged with the New Jersey Nets. YankeesNets they called
it, or some lunacy. (Perhaps you wonder who am I to question
someone else's sanity, since I am in a straitjacket. Well, it's
them, not me. Please remember that.) YankeesNets now play in a $1
billion arena-stadium called The House That Bill Gates Built.
Around 2004, Bill Gates bought YankeesNets, back when he was still
running Microsoft. He moved them to Redmond, Wash., to be closer to
Microsoft headquarters. As everyone knows now, Bill Gates is
president of the United States. And, as everyone knows, Redmond,
Wash., is now our nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002 the Anaheim Angels, owned by Disney, and the Los Angeles
Dodgers, owned by Rupert Murdoch, met in the World Series. Each
team had a payroll of $250 million. The star of the Angels was an
underpaid, scrappy first baseman named Mo Vaughn. That same year,
after one season in Hartford, Bob Kraft sold the Patriots to Steven
Case, CEO of America Online. Now the Patriots have the AOL symbol
on their helmets. Their coaches no longer use headphones to relay
plays. They simply e-mail their plays to the field. Once, an
assistant coach was fired for e-mailing a joke play and writing the
on-line shorthand for raucous laughter -- LOL -- at the end. But
Bledsoe didn't see that part, ran the unsuccessful play and the
Patriots lost home-field advantage in the Nike/NFL playoffs. The
New York Jets, coached by Bill Parcells's daughter Jill, then went
on to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is my story. I have been wearing this straitjacket since
the day I caused a disturbance at the Downtown Athletic Club in New
York. That's where they presented the Sony Heisman Trophy. I began
cursing about excessive cash and corporations tainting sports. The
so-called sane people put me in this room with padded walls. So now
I am looking at my straitjacket: Even it has the Nike swoosh on it.
</P>

3. THE BIGGEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Who was the greatest NBA center of the late 1950s and
all of the '60s?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Way too easy. Bill Russell. Wilt Chamberlain may
disagree with that, but no one won as often as Russell, who
accumulated 11 championships in 13 seasons with the Celtics. No one
blocked shots like him, either. The blocked shot is usually
considered a defensive art, but Russell brought a ``twoness'' to
it. It was clearly defense when he rejected an errant shot; it was
clearly offense when he transformed that shot into an outlet pass
to his fast-breaking teammates.Q: So Russell was a dominant figure?

THE WE2K PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE LOTH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEN 12 JURORS -- most of them black women -- found O.J. Simpson
not guilty in the most spectacular domestic violence trial of the
century, analysts concluded that the jurors identified more with
being black than with being women. ``Race trumps gender,'' they
declared. A few years later, when it came to judging Bill Clinton,
race and gender trumped everything else.
</P>
<P>
   For taxpayers, the miserly cop-out called cafeteria government
is all the rage. Voters reject the old homily, ``there but for the
grace of God go I,'' and choose a personalized menu for their tax
dollars, approving funds for schools but not welfare; police but
not schools.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy businesses take advantage of technology to narrowcast
their products and services to consumers with increasing
specificity. Thanks to the Internet, everyone can have a personal
shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to ``We the people?''
</P>
<P>
   Much of human history has been driven by the desire for
self-determination, among individuals and communities. The struggle
to be free from slavery is perhaps the most heroic example. But at
the end of the millennium, in a technologically sophisticated
consumer culture, those impulses have been trivialized into a kind
of do-your-own-thing narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   People see every great social event through their own prism: How
does this affect me? Is it good for women? Bad for gays? Good for
business? The center doesn't hold because it has lost its
gravitational pull, leaving us all to spin centrifugally into our
own private orbits.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has been lamented by thinkers of the right and left.
Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. attacks the proliferation of
identity movements in his polemic, ``The Disuniting of America,''
claiming that ``the cult of ethnicity'' threatens assimilation,
integration, the whole American idea. In his study of demographic
change in California, the journalist Dale Maharidge describes ``a
banana-republic society, rife with race-baiting and hatred.''
Harvard professor Robert Putnam notes that the number of people who
bowl for a hobby is up, but the number of bowling leagues is down.
``Bowling alone'' is the symptom; social isolation is the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus.
</P>
<P>
   The first indulgence of a post-scarcity society is the luxury to
define oneself as one chooses. In the days of craft guilds, there
was no tortured adolescent search for self -- indeed, there was no
adolescence. A young man did what his father did, whether
blacksmith, baker, or candlestickmaker. Now we try on and discard
identities as if they were hats.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that our lives are not preordained is the very essence
of modernism. The death of determinism was proclaimed at the end of
the last century by Nietzsche and his friends, but it took about 60
years for the concept to trickle down from the intelligentsia to
the masses. When it did, a generation embraced free will with
alacrity. Thus we had college majors in Sanskrit, organic farming,
and witchcraft. Thus black studies, women's studies, Jewish
studies, gay studies, addiction studies. Different strokes for
different folks.
</P>
<P>
   World War II probably was the last truly unifying event in
American history, if you don't count waiting in line to see
``Titanic.'' In the years just after the war the verities were
clear, beamed into American living rooms with comforting authority
by the three major networks. Everyone watched Jack Benny. Everyone
drove a car with tailfins. Everyone lusted after a house in the
suburbs, a Barbie-doll waist, and two biological children.
</P>
<P>
   But such uniformity is not a natural state. It is fashionable to
support equality of the sexes, but the truth is that some gender
differences are as immutable as color-blindness, and it is futile
to suggest otherwise. And many women took a hard look at what true
equality with men might mean -- early heart attacks, indifferent
relationships with their children -- and said no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   It was only yesterday on the great millennial timeline that
anyone even tried to organize nations with a common lanuage,
currency, and purpose. In the 1600s, before the French Academy was
established to enforce linguistic purity, people in what we now
call France spoke Breton, Gaulish, Provencal, Celtic, Basque, and
Catalan. No wonder Francophones shudder at the idea of ``le
popcorn'' or ``le airbag'' slipping into their beloved language.
One need only look to the Balkans -- or to Boston -- to see the
innate power of tribalism when the thin unifying gloss of
nationalism, or a Red Sox pennant race, is stripped away.
</P>
<P>
   The great accelerant in this cultural crackup has been
technology. Rather than shrink the world, communications advances
have steadily increased the distance between people. From the
invention of the telephone, which obviated the need for a personal
visit, through the answering machine to the fax and the e-mail
message, technology just keeps giving us more and more ways to
disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   That old dinosaur television is still in the act, with its
hundreds of channels, each aimed at an increasingly thin
demographic sliver. The market segments everyone. Last spring you
could hear a popular Mexican beer touted in commercials as ``the
drink-o for Cinco de Mayo.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocooning, cubicles, convenience appliances -- if everyone has
his own snowblower, why get to know the neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   And yet. Viewed from a slightly different angle, identity
movements are not examples of arrogant self-actualization but a
kind of desperate longing for connection, a salve against
loneliness and isolation. We are not solitary hunters by nature but
members of distinct tribes, with a strong need for belonging.
Street gangs like the Crips and Bloods still hold a powerful
attraction for people seeking a ``family,'' even though -- or
perhaps because -- the church, the Elks, and the union hall are no
longer dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm over the disuniting of America, at least as it pertains to
Schlesinger's ``cult of ethnicity,'' may be overstated anyway. It's
true that we are not Japan, where commuters wait serenely in line
for the bullet train wearing identical suits. We are by contrast a
pluralist, polyglot population.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend in this country has always been toward
assimilation; new immigrant groups adjust to America more than
America adjusts to them. Both democracy and capitalism have tended
to heighten the magnetism of the dominant culture. We are rewarded
in the public schools and on the corporate ladder when we decide to
fit in. Even after 30 years of black pride there aren't many who
would try wearing a dashiki to golf with the CEO.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd is that at the end of the millennium, both these
quintessential American ideas -- democracy and capitalism -- have
become forces working against uniformity. Relentless niche
marketing finds a target audience for every product, reducing a
generation's rock anthems into jingles for sneakers, and
community-building institutions like the shops on Main Street or
even newspapers into ``The Daily Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, meanwhile, the democratically-elected power elite
is busy attacking the very concepts that bring us together: public
education, libraries, social security, affirmative action. The
things that for 200 years -- or at least the last 60 -- helped make
America a cohesive nation are being systematically dismantled as
part of the attack on government.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to panic just because some people are
celebrating Kwanzaa or putting salsa on their all-American hot
dogs. But the clustering of America is a concern for one important
reason: when it becomes exclusive and defensive, it can be an
obstacle to people acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing us in the next millennium -- social,
economic, and especially environmental -- will require a
comprehensive national effort. The problems, not to mention the
solutions, are likely to be confusing, expensive, and inconvenient.
Not having a sense of ``we'' makes taking united action
particularly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because it comes only once every thousand years, the
turning of the calendar in December could hold the power to draw
our gaze away from our own reflections, if only for a moment. The
New Year presents an increasingly rare opportunity to get our
crazy-quilt society to focus on a single common purpose. We should
-- to use an expression as old as the millennium -- seize the day.

KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
1900: GOODBYE COUNTRY LIFE 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THERE WAS NO Y2K worry at the turn of the last century, no fear
that the power grid would collapse. That's because there was no
juice in most American houses. The Age of Electricity had barely
begun.
</P>
<P>
   An average family in 1900 -- call them the Joneses -- has only a
primitive icebox. Other than staples, food is bought fresh -- or
harvested or killed. A chicken dinner begins not with a defrosting
but a beheading. Floors are cleaned with brooms and mops. Clothes
are soaked in wash basins, run through wringers, and hung outside
to dry. Manual labor gets most chores done.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Jones rises before dawn and devotes the daylight hours to
work, typically laboring more than 50 hours a week. Mrs. Jones has
a full day of housework. Grandma and Grandpa Jones live in the same
house. Big, multigenerational families are an economic necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's entertainment is a book, a stereoscopic slide
viewer, a wind-up phonograph, a card game. Even silent movies have
yet to arrive. Outside the small circles of light cast by gas or
oil lamps, the Jones house in the evening is dark and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The United States of 1900 is not a very mobile nation. In the
countryside, the Joneses walk, ride in a buggy, or take the train.
But in the cities, electric trolleys and subways are beginning to
speed up life. With its hustle and grime and myriad possibilities,
the city promises something better and more exciting than farm
life. The Jones children will become part of the great migration
that will urbanize America in the first decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
   They will be joined in the next 10 years alone by 9 million
immigrants -- Jews, Italians, Irish, Armenians, Japanese, Latinos
-- who will change the face of the United States, bringing new
ideas, new tastes, and new interests to what at the time is an
Anglo-Saxon-dominated nation.
</P>
<P>
   Change is in the air even on the Jones farm. The Joneses have
seen some of the marvelous inventions that are appearing almost
every day: electrified mass transit, automobiles, the telephone.
The Kodak Brownie is popularizing home photography. There is a Ford
in their future. It is only a few years later, in fact, that the
quest for consumer comforts will become so widespread that it will
inspire a long-running comic strip by Arthur R. ``Pop'' Momand.
</P>
<P>
   He gives his comic a name that becomes synonymous with
20th-century acquisitiveness: ``Keeping up with the Joneses.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
1950: BABY BOOM, BUYING BOOM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FAST FORWARD to mid-century. This Jones family is basking in
good fortune. It owns a Cape Cod-style home in one of the suburbs
springing up around cities like Boston. There are several radios in
the house. There is at least one car in the garage, a refrigerator
and toaster in the kitchen, hot water is heated automatically for a
bath. These Joneses live
</P>
<P>
   better through electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in gray flannel, Mr. Jones works 40 hours a week. He
doesn't notice it at first, but a UNIVAC computer in the office is
a harbinger of the information revolution. Trouble is, it has so
little memory that in order to save room on punch-cards the dates
are programmed in two-digits (``50'') instead of four (``1950'').
The Y2K bug has been born.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Mrs. Jones works in the home, but Madison Avenue, a
newly minted term for the US advertising colossus, is going all out
to sell her ``labor-saving'' devices -- a sewing machine, a washing
machine, an Electrolux vacuum. World War II drew an unprecedented
number of women into the work force. Now, five years after the war
has ended, one-third of all women are employed outside the home.
Most of the good jobs have been taken by men returning from the
war, but women are beginning to itch to get out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma and Grandpa are living on their own back on the Jones
farm, since Social Security has gone far toward eliminating old-age
poverty. The Jones nuclear family is holding together, though in
the decades to come divorce and stepfamilies will explode onto the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Jones is becoming noisier. The year 1950 dawns with only
150,000 American households equipped with a television. A year
later the number has grown tenfold. The TV Age is here, and the
Jones children are lobbying for one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, blacks are still relegated to segregated facilities in
many states, and bias against blacks remains common. But the civil
rights movement is stirring: Racial quotas have been abolished in
the Army, Jackie Robinson is the National League MVP, Ralph Bunche
has won the Nobel Peace Prize. The second half of the century will
be about a struggle for greater freedom, not just for blacks but
for ethnic minorities, women, the disabled, gays, and anyone with a
look and lifestyle that doesn't fit into the white mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones kids are baby boomers. They wear Davy Crockett hats
and play with Barbie dolls, but their fervor and excesses will roil
America in the years to come. The baby boom beat will dominate
taste and consumption over the next 50 years. Right now, they want
their Maypo. Years later, they will want their MTV.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
2000: MATTER, MATTER EVERYWHERE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU DON'T NEED an introduction to the Millennium Joneses. They
are you, your friends, family, and neighbors. Both Jones parents
work outside the home, although both wish the much-touted trend
toward telecommuting would make it possible for them to spend more
time away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   There's a TV in almost every room, a home computer or two hooked
into an on-line service, a couple of cars in the driveway, an
``appliance garage'' in the kitchen jammed with gadgets. Pushed by
Madison Avenue, consumer culture reaches deep into every nook and
cranny of America -- and most of the rest of the world as well. How
did people ever get along without a microwave, a food processor, a
VCR, or satellite TV?
</P>
<P>
   There is only one child in this Jones family. Large families are
not as common as when the parents were young. Mr. Jones is a little
worried about how his company will weather the Y2K problem, but he
doesn't think it will be a show stopper. Mrs. Jones has been
quietly buying canned tuna at Costco. She's a little worried about
the power grid, and has recently unearthed a manual can opener. All
those appliances will be worthless if the juice goes out. Why take
a chance?
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is an apt metaphor for fin de siecle America. While there
has been an incredible run of economic prosperity in the 1990s,
there are lingering worries about how long it might last. Are
things a little too good? Are Internet stocks ridiculously
overpriced? Has credit-card debt gotten out of control? Sure, life
after purchsing an SUV is really no better than before. But how
else are you going to haul all that stuff you bought?
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses have plenty of things, a plethora of amusements,
jammed-packed calendars. What they don't have is much time. And
even what seems solid may not be. Jobs are plentiful, for instance,
but downsizing could come anytime. As for marital relations, Mr.
and Mrs. Jones are still going strong, but the little Jones girl
knows from her playmates that modern marriages may not last
forever. She herself might or might not go the marriage route. Her
hero could be Jennifer Love Hewitt. Or Ellen DeGeneres. You never
know. It's a diverse world, filled with options.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing: The Jones girl has been chatting with her
grandma via AOL's Instant Messenger system. She's learned some
interesting things about the family's geneology. Now she's made a
decision. She is changing her name back to the original spelling:
It was Janowsky in the old country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
2050: NEW CENTURY, NEW TASTES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME TO THE FUTURE. If it was ever acceptable to generalize
about the Joneses, about what the ``typical'' American family looks
like, it is no longer. The 2050 Joneses (or more accurately, the
Ramirez-Joneses) have a divorce or two in their background. And
their name isn't necessarily an indication of their ethnicity. They
could be Asian-Latino or Afro-Irish or plain old English-English.
No single ethnicity is dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramirez-Joneses could be from vastly different religious
backgrounds, or be devoted to one old-time religion, or to none at
all. They could be married or unmarried, same or different sexes.
</P>
<P>
   They could even be extraterrestrials. By the second decade of
the 21st century, NASA had a space station, a permanent moon base,
and had human crews on Mars. Human nature being what it is, by
mid-century a small number people have been born in space.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, by 2050 humans can be cloned. It was only a matter of
time before scientists perfected the technique. But like a lot of
scientific achievements -- nuclear power, videophones,
non-alcoholic beer -- the public still can't quite see the point.
The sperm-egg approach works fine in most instances. It's cheaper
and more fun than cloning. Plus it adds variety to the human race.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles (electric) remain popular. Trucks and buses run on
natural gas. There are even a few old gasoline burners around. But
most business gets done over fiber-optic lines. The Internet is the
vehicle the Joneses use to work, shop, read, and entertain
themselves. It's no big deal. Like the word ``computer,'' which has
fallen into disuse, the Internet is just a background utility.
Every appliance is intelligent, monitors your tastes and needs, and
orders what it thinks you might want.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that by the middle of the new century people like
the Ramirez-Joneses will have tired of material consumption and
will be trying to recapture a quieter, simpler life. Possible, but
not likely. Earn-and-spend has been the core of modern capitalism
almost everywhere in the world. There are always new products, new
ad campaigns, new things to covet.
</P>
<P>
   Take virtual reality. VR has become so good by 2050 that is its
own art form. A few techno-geeks have their own VR ``caves'' at
home, but the best experiences can be had at specially-equipped
theaters not unlike the ``holodeck'' in the ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' TV series of the 1980s. Any scenario can be enacted: a
Shakespearean romp, the D-Day landing, ``The Great Y2K Panic'' of
50 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Like all the changes that the 21st-century Ramirez-Joneses have
experienced over the years, the latest ones will not be the last.
It's a Jones thing: They keep on keeping up.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... dominant figure?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: Are you well, man? Russell was a basketball genius, a player
who performed to a brilliant court rhythm that could be appreciated
but never imitated. If I'm making the Russell highlight film, I'm
using the music of Thelonious Monk for the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Russell's height and weight?
</P>
<P>
   A: 6 feet 9 inches, 220 pounds. He looked good. He could have
called himself Bill Muscle and no one would have wondered if the
surname were legal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could Russell play in the NBA today?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As a small forward. You know I love Russell, right? But
if he played for the Celtics today, he would be the shortest and
lightest center on the team and the smallest in the entire NBA.
People would call talk-radio stations and complain that the Celtics
needed a true center, not an undersized 6'92 guy. Antoine Walker
and Andrew DeClercq outweigh him by 25 pounds and they are both
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who will be the NBA's greatest, post-Y2K-virus center?
</P>
<P>
   A: An 8-foot, 400-pounder from Scandinavia or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Excuse me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Young people have made our references to height and weight
obsolete. They have also rearranged the familiar adolescent mile
markers. One hundred years ago, young women began to menstruate at
16. Today, some are beginning their periods as early as 10. And the
Scandinavians and Dutch? They are the tallest people on the planet;
their males, on average, are 6 feet tall. One 1998 study claims
that height is linked to an overall standard of living. The
wealthier and happier you are, it says, the taller you will become.
This radical study also notes that height is not necessarily linked
to your genes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you believe that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. I am poor, moody, and short.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will this affect the pro sports world in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: The differences in the NBA will be cosmetic. In simplest
terms, you'll see a lot more tall people on the court. Shaquille
O'Neal, a 7-foot-1-inch 300-pounder, will be dwarfed by our 8-foot
man from the Netherlands. There will also be women playing in the
NBA in the next 10 years (have you seen Chamique Holdsclaw of
Tennessee play?), forcing the WNBA and CBA to merge into a farm
system for the NBA. In the NFL, there will be no such thing as the
``sweep'' play, where running backs head for the corners and outrun
slower defensive linemen. Please. There will be no more slow
defensive linemen. Already, many linebackers have the speed of
running backs. Offensive linemen? Huge. The Patriots once had a
Hall of Fame lineman named John ``Hog'' Hannah. He weighed 265
pounds. Five years from now, playing at that size would earn him
the nickname ``Tiny'' Hannah. An offensive tackle from the
University of Wisconsin, Aaron Gibson, is 6'62, 386. After two
years in the NFL, he'll be up to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about baseball?
</P>
<P>
   A: They'll have to change the rules. I hope Mark McGwire is not
too attached to his home run record of 70, which shattered Roger
Maris's 61. It will be broken unless the rules change. Baseball's
strike zone is murky; the game's best pitchers are in their 30s;
and there are more 50-home run hitters now than ever before. Add
those elements toegether and you have another home run record.
McGwire's 70 will be topped before 2010. He may even break it
himself in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Just wondering, but could Bill Russell play in tomorrow's
NBA?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As a point guard.
</P>

4. THE GREATEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE TRUTH, obviously, is that I do not believe in traditional
sports heroes.
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe that the Olympics were ever pure. I do not
believe that the soul of the modern athlete is more, or less,
fractured than it was 50 years ago. Show me an impeccable hero and
I'll show you someone who has escaped the jaws of the media. Show
me a media-savvy fan who has a list of heroes and I'll show you
someone who understands context.
</P>
<P>
   You could say Ty Cobb was a hero. He hit .323 in 1928, when he
was 41. He batted over .400 three times, topping out at .420. He
was a center fielder who played for the love of the game. He was
also a racist.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali becomes more heroic with each breath. The young Ali
was handsome and smart, a man whose wit was almost quicker than his
jab. He was a stylish heavyweight. He was also a married man who
spent lots of time with women who weren't named Mrs. Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments should not be mistaken for admonishments. If I
could select an all-time baseball team, Cobb would have a place on
my roster. If I had to choose the five greatest heavyweights of all
time, Ali would be one of them. I'd even call both men contextual
heroes. Nothing else should be expected. But today something else
is expected, which means when it comes to tomorrow, there will be
no more heroes such as Ali. Mythological heroism is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ali knew how to be himself, while also controlling the media and
getting them to portray the man he wanted to present. That couldn't
happen now. There is a glut of competitive media, who eliminate all
mystery and lore surrounding an athlete. That will become more
intense in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheat on your wife? It probably will be broadcast on a
flat-screen, high-definition TV. People will be able to see your
every twitch, blink, and tear.
</P>
<P>
   You're a racist? Well, somebody will be calling to pick your
brain soon. Could be someone from ESPN's ``Up Close.'' Or Jerry
Springer. Or Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be an athlete who simply does your job and
doesn't say much, sorry. That won't qualify for heroism,
21st-century style. You have to know how to balance sports,
entertainment, and media. And if you're going to stay with the
say-nothing approach, you have to learn to say something while
saying nothing controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The last hero to master that was Michael Jordan. He was a
one-man conglomerate, an advertising star who made more money off
the court than he did on it. He was also apolitical, publicly.
Jordan was a hero, but he was certainly not himself in public.
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe in traditional sports heroes. Traditional
sports heroism is dead. The old heroes controlled the media. Not
today. Not tomorrow. The impact of the new heroes will be
determined by those who operate Internet service providers; by
those who hold cameras; by those who use pens and pads to record
daily history.

PERSONAL HEALTH: A GUIDE FOR PERPLEXED PARENTS WEIGHING
CIRCUMCISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Circumcision of infant boys has alternately been called ``the
unkindest cut'' and the key to good penile health and hygiene.
Which is correct, and how does a parent with a newborn son make the
decision?
</P>
<P>
   Those who have looked to the nation's pediatric authorities for
guidance are no doubt thoroughly confused by now. The American
Academy of Pediatrics has revised its policy on infant circumcision
four times in three decades, with the latest word coming this month
in an eight-page statement published in Pediatrics, the academy's
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with its manual on the care of newborns in 1971 and in
revisions published in 1975 and 1983, the academy stated clearly
that there was ``no absolute medical indication for routine
circumcision.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1989, new research suggested that neonatal circumcision
reduced the risk of certain infections, mainly urinary tract
infections in childhood and sexually transmitted diseases later in
life. That finding prompted the academy to conclude that ``newborn
male circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as
well as disadvantages and risks'' and to recommend that these
benefits and risks be clearly explained to parents before they
consented to having the foreskin surgically sliced from their
newborn sons.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the rare physician who has the time and knowledge
needed to fulfill this mission and, unless parents consider all the
pros and cons of circumcision before childbirth, those with
newborns are rarely able to weigh these factors rationally at a
time of such heightened emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, parents hear frightening facts about the risks of
circumcision or of being uncircumcised without realizing how rare
these hazards are. And they are often misinformed about how to care
for an uncircumcised child. The United States has one of the
world's highest rates of newborn circumcision, but that rate has
dropped considerably in recent decades, from about 90 percent in
the mid-1960s to about 65 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   While the academy's 1971 statement was no doubt a factor in the
decline, other influences included the back-to-nature movement and
widespread publicity about unnecessary surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the removal of a boy's foreskin should not impair
his later sexual ability and enjoyment. Therefore, no authoritative
source has condemned male circumcision that is done for religious
reasons, primarily by Jews and Muslims. But for those making a
secular decision about male circumcision, there are distinct
advantages and disadvantages to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits and Risks
</P>
<P>
   In considering the following facts, it is important to keep in
mind that some of the statistics reflect decades-old hygienic and
sexual practices that have since changed considerably. Thus, the
data may not always be relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   PENILE CANCER: The most clear-cut benefit of circumcision is a
major reduction in the risk of eventually developing cancer of the
penis. Since 1930 about 50,000 cases of penile cancer and 10,000
deaths from this disease have been reported in this country, with
only 10 of those cases among circumcised men.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the academy has pointed out, this is a rare disease, and
the risk to an uncircumcised man is low. This cancer is most
strongly linked to having a nonretractable foreskin. Other risk
factors include contracting genital warts, having more than 30
sexual partners and smoking cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   INFECTIONS: Remaining uncircumcised unquestionably raises a
boy's risk of developing a urinary tract infection during the first
five years of life, with the greatest risk, a three-fold to
seven-fold increase, occurring during infancy. Breast-feeding has
been shown to protect against these infections in uncircumcised
infants, and the absolute risk of an uncircumcised infant's
developing a urinary tract infection is low, at most about 1
percent, the academy stated.
</P>
<P>
   As for sexually transmitted diseases, uncircumcised men may be
more susceptible to developing syphilis, and several studies have
found higher rates of infection by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
among men who are not circumcised. However, the academy noted,
``behavioral factors appear to be far more important risk factors
in the acquisition of HIV infection than circumcision status.''
</P>
<P>
   PENILE PROBLEMS: The overall risk of penile problems to
uncircumcised boys is unclear. The academy cited a New Zealand
study of 500 boys that found higher rates of penile problems in
infants who were circumcised but higher rates in older boys who
were not circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   RISKS OF CIRCUMCISION: No surgery, however minor, is free of
hazards. The risks of newborn circumcision are very low when the
procedure is performed by experienced physicians or mohels, who do
Jewish ritual circumcisions. The most common complications,
occurring in 2 percent of cases, are infections and excessive
bleeding and, less often, improper or excessive cutting of the
foreskin, which impairs penile function. In a few recorded
instances, circumcision has resulted in loss of the penis or death
of the infant.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that circumcision hurts, and every infant who
undergoes it should be given local anesthesia and, if needed,
postoperative pain killers. Those circumcised without anesthesia
often remain hypersensitive to pain.
</P>
<P>
   Care of the Uncircumcised Baby
</P>
<P>
   Last month in an article published in Contemporary Pediatrics,
Dr. Jane E. Anderson, a pediatrician, and Dr. Karl A. Anderson, a
urologist, both of whom practice in San Francisco, emphasized that
``parents of uncircumcised infants should be instructed not to
attempt to retract the foreskin or use cotton swabs to clean
underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreskin does an excellent job of keeping the penis clean.
The doctors point out that very few newborns have retractable
foreskins, and by age 1 only half of boys have partially
retractable foreskins. Not until age 3 is the foreskin retractable
in 80 percent of boys and not until age 17 in 99 percent of boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal bathing maintains cleanliness until the foreskin
becomes easily retractable,'' the doctors wrote. ``Once it does,
the parent, and later the child, can gently pull it back, wash the
glans and replace the foreskin over the glans.'' After age 1, the
doctors suggested that during the baby bath, his caretaker could
gently try to pull back the foreskin, but if this could not be
done, to wait three months before trying again.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors warn against allowing physicians or anyone else to
attempt to free the adhesions between the penile glans and foreskin
that normally occur in infants and small boys. This practice can
cause pain, bleeding and worse adhesions that may ultimately render
the foreskin nonretractable.
</P>
<P>
   Their final word: Having a boy circumcised is a decision made by
parents who should be fully informed about the benefits and risks
of the operation before they sign a consent form.

 UNDATED: ... right direction.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992 David Shipler took off on a cross-country odyssey into
black and white America. He wrote a book, ``A Country of Strangers:
Black and White America.'' A lot of what he saw and heard out there
in America nearly broke his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Shipler, who is white, places much of the blame upon many whites
who have what he calls a skewed view of history. ``This history --
or perception of history -- is one of the big divides between
whites and blacks,'' he says. ``I found that many whites felt that
history was not important to what shapes the present.
African-Americans felt just the opposite. Many whites get upset
when blacks talk about the past. I think the legacy of master to
slave still haunts us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now and then -- many say not often enough -- our racial agonies
find their way to the White House. Race has long befuddled American
presidents. Lincoln grappled with race in word and deed, then paid
a heavy price with a bullet lodged in his skull. Woodrow Wilson
ignored race -- although he once jauntily proclaimed the racist
``Birth of a Nation'' a joyous movie to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington, the former
slave, to the White House. Blunt and cocky, Roosevelt couldn't
imagine why the public was so aghast. Truman was brave, but
dangerously ahead of public sentiment on the question of
integration. Kennedy appeared genuinely moved by the racial unrest
of 1961 and 1962, but he had made too many handshakes with southern
politicians to move a civil rights agenda forward. It was Kennedy,
however -- galled at the beating of black women and children in
Alabama -- who asked a national audience one evening who among them
would be willing to trade places with the black man.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon reacted awkwardly to race; Reagan chose to ignore it. Bush
provided noblisse oblige, and then one afternoon found himself
striding through the rubble of Los Angeles in the aftermath of
rioting over the acquittal of white police officers who had beaten
a black man. Lyndon Johnson achieved huge accomplishments on the
racial front through threats, blackmail, shrewdness, and ingenuity.
Johnson was born poor, had tasted poverty in the pit of his
stomach. Not always, but poverty can often push a soul to
understand racism with a peculiar kind of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 southern-born Bill Clinton entered the White House.
Clinton might have been the first president who felt at ease around
blacks, who had black friends over for dinner, who depended on the
brainpower of political associates who just happened to be black.
Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called him ``our first black
president.'' She meant this: Bill Clinton knows the work of Walter
Moseley and the horn of Coleman Hawkins and the voice of CeCe
Winans and the poetry of Maya Angelou. Bill Clinton has quoted
Fannie Lou Hamer. He knows America.
</P>
<P>
   In time the president would plead with the citizenry to talk
about race. And the country talked, a year of pulling out chairs.
</P>
<P>
   William Winter, a former Mississippi governor, served on
Clinton's Race Initiative. In traveling around the country, Winter,
now a private-practice lawyer in Jackson, Miss., said he was
encouraged by all the groups that have been created, of all the
doors to houses that have swung open and sent husbands, wives, and
teenage sons and daughters down to the library, the recreation
center, the church, to engage in conversations about race. In a
small, small way, to seek a kind of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board recommended to Clinton in its final report
that he create a permanent panel to keep racial dialogue going in
the country. ``It would be a high-profile permanent council on
racial relations that would emulate John Kennedy's Council on
Physical Fitness,'' says Winter. ``That council really transformed
how people thought about themselves as a result of the emphasis put
on physcial fitness. I know I started jogging in 1962 because of
that report.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, right now, in this land of ours, there are two
children at play, one black and one white. They are too young to
know about the color line. Their hearts are as happy as children's
hearts should be. Their lungs are filled with fresh air. They are
allies and comrades and cohorts. They know soft mattresses and
ironed shirts and mother's and grandmother's kisses on their
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   They are years away from walking down the clean hallway of a
dorm room, to shake the hand of a never-before-seen roommate. They
are not yet sick and tired of anything. What they know of this
complicated word -- love -- could fill a teacup, which is how it
should be. So they love each other, too. Time is real, of course.
But let us freeze the frame and wish them well. It will be their
century.

CELEBRITY PLASTIC SURGEON PLACED ON PROBATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dr. Alan Gaynor, a San Francisco dermatologist
nationally known for his glib guest appearances on talk shows, has
been placed on five years probation by the Medical Board of
California, in part for the half-blinding of a woman who suffered a
needle stab to the eye in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement with the state licensing agency, Gaynor is
prohibited from practicing cosmetic surgery until he completes a
yearlong surgical training program. He also promised to enroll in
an ethics course, to limit his cosmetic surgery to certain
procedures, to have another doctor monitor his practice and to
perform at least 96 hours of free community service for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lawyer Anglia Benjamin, who represented one of
Gaynor's former patients in a lawsuit against the doctor, blasted
the medical board settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very rarely do we, as medical malpractice attorneys, consider
doctors as bad doctors. Gaynor is one of them,'' she said. ``The
Medical Board is not policing them. That's what they are supposed
to do, but they aren't. You want to stand on a mountain top and
shout, `How many does he have to maim before he's stopped?'''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin represented Lisa Santoro, a former fashion consultant
who wanted permanent eyeliner tattooed on her eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   She was left half-blinded when her eye was punctured by a
syringe during a 1992 procedure. Santoro ended up settling her
lawsuit against Gaynor, but her complaint became part of the
state's case against the physician alleging gross negligence,
incompetence and dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   According to the board decision, which took effect in November,
Gaynor admitted he had failed to properly monitor the
administration of Valium in Santoro's procedure and that ``he was
responsible for (her) eye injury even if it was caused by a
cosmetologist working in his office, as he contends it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetologist denied Gaynor's allegation that she had caused
the eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding another patient, Gaynor admitted that he had ``failed
to fully appreciate or assess the possible need to have (the
patient) go to an emergency room sooner than actually occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor, who gained fame in several television talk show
appearances, once performed a face lift live on Geraldo Rivera's
show, transferring fat from Rivera's buttocks to his face.
</P>
<P>
   An energetic promoter who dubbed himself ``the best known
cosmetic surgeon in the United States,'' Gaynor has said he's
appeared on more than 400 TV shows, including Larry King and
``Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Gaynor has apparently discontinued his medical
practice; he worked in a California Street clinic. In an interview
last year with the San Francisco Examiner, he said his practice was
``in hibernation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor's 1998 consumer book, ``Everything You Ever Wanted to
Known About Cosmetic Surgery But Couldn't Afford to Ask,'' has sold
out the first printing in hardback edition, said Nancy Clare
Morgan, a publicist with Gaynor's publisher, Broadway Books. Next
month, it is being released nationally in paperback, she said.

STUMBLING AT THE COLOR LINE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE FIRST DAY of my sophomore year at a college tucked in the
southwestern corner of Ohio, I introduced myself to my roommate.
There was a spray of autumn sunlight in the dorm room; I felt giddy
and light on my feet. It was the joy of being back at school, of
having survived my freshman year of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   My roommate and I passed those first couple of days uneventfully
-- talking about classes, wondering what we'd major in. By week's
end, however, my roommate had vanished. The dorm adviser told me
the roommate -- white -- did not wish to room with me -- a black. I
didn't whine then and don't mean to whine now, but I look back and
wonder how two people had managed to drag race onto that campus,
down that hallway, into that dormitory room, into my memory today.
</P>
<P>
   But that is America, and race won't let any of us Americans go.
It's like a wicked moonlight that lays on us. If it did not follow
us daily, haunting us so somberly, race just might ease its
maniacal force upon us and our imagination. But it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fascination surely lies with the rich paradoxes of
race: painful yet redemptive, it is ageless yet newly exotic. It is
hopeful and yet, there are moments -- decades in fact -- when
closing the racial gulf can and has seemed hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, our century still new and not so distant from the Civil
War, a rising social thinker with a Vandyke beard by the name of
W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century would be ``the
problem of the color line.'' As the century unfolded, Du Bois's
prediction was apt: it saw race riots and lynchings and laws
against Negroes and Coloreds. True enough, America soared with its
inventions, its commerce, and brilliance. It became the envy of
other nations. But not for its record on race. The malaise spread.
The color line became the line drawn in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   There have been heroes and martyrs in the struggle, writers
aplenty. Frederick Douglass and Charles Sumner and Booker T.
Washington. Mary McCleod Bethune and Eleanor Roosevelt. Malcolm X
and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. And how we miss James
Baldwin, that sweet and angry man who had eyes deep as the ocean.
They all died with the problems of race disrupting their sleep,
worrying their souls. Now, at century's end, we ask, we wonder:
Will the racial gulf trail us into the next century?
</P>
<P>
   It seems painfully easy to answer.
</P>
<P>
   There are woes coast to coast. A racial murder trial over here;
yet another state legislature chipping away at affirmative action
over there; the ravages of housing discrimination nearly
everywhere. Not to mention those alarming statistics about black
men locked away in prisons. According to Justice Department
numbers, there'll be a million blacks behind bars by next year. It
is estimated that 1 in 7 black males have felony records, keeping
them away from the ballot box in many states. Baldwin's prose would
have erupted at such revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks say they are weary of talking about race. Fannie Lou
Hamer used to say she was ``sick and tired of being sick and
tired.'' Her words weren't poetry, but they are remembered. Hamer
was a buck-an-hour wage earner. She was a Mississippi Freedom
Rider. She was somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Whites are asked to step into the breach. According to a lot of
experts, whites do not come to the table easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, on a reporting assignment, I sat in the basement
of a church in Louisville, Ky. It was a winter's evening and a
group of folk -- bless their hearts -- had gathered, had been
gathering on a volunteer basis, to talk about race, about that
gulf. A white woman, in a voice soft as churchtime, asked a black
man -- actually she had asked the entire group but the black man
bolted to his feet to answer -- if he thought blacks who had been
lopped off welfare would riot. A black woman wondered if whites
were aware how disrespectful it was to her and other blacks when,
she said, white store clerks laid their change from a purchase on
the counter instead of in their hands. A black woman said blacks
shouldn't always cry racism when they've suffered or been fired
from jobs. Someone wondered why yet another white male had dropped
out of the group. A black man wondered if he hadn't gotten a
contracting job in that very church because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   An evening's worth of history. Some anger floated about, but no
one bolted for the door. Maybe that was victory enough.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, everyone grabbed their coats, shared some chitchat,
vowed to return the following week, and headed for the parking lot.
I watched everyone lope through the darkness. For some reason I
felt sorry, and so very hopeful, for the white woman who had asked
the question about welfare. She seemed so sincere -- and yet
frightfully unaware of the pain the question had caused. But she
had shown up. She had opened the door to her house and turned the
key in her car and headed off to that church. I felt if she could
show up -- a Louisville city official -- and share her fears, maybe
others would follow her. Maybe she could enlighten.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, of course, always black and white. The gulf in
America touches other cultures: Hispanics, Asian-Americans,
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the original sin began with trying to put
blacks in one box,'' says Eric Liu, an Asian-American and former
speechwriter for President Clinton. Liu is also a fellow at the New
America Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based, non-partisan
public-policy organization devoted to trying to solve social
problems with new ideas. Liu just argues for a seat at the table in
the discourse. ``The most important thing is not what I say -- but
that I speak.''

   So the black and white blood roils the loudest.

   So Thomas Jefferson, deep in his grave, has his sleep disrupted
over the question of whether he had sex with his female slaves?

   FOR ALL of its currency, its ability to sway groups of people,
racism and the old color line defies common sense. How else to
explain a restaurant chain denying service to a group of black
Secret Service agents and being shamed before a nation? How else to
explain large corporations backed up against the wall, losing
multimillion-dollar discrimination lawsuits?
</P>
<P>
   Once I found myself rolling across the bayous of Louisiana with
David Duke, a perennial candidate in that state. The black man and
the white man with the Nazi and Klan leanings. We had attended one
Duke rally and were on our way to another. He was smiling, joking
-- normal. But at the rally later that evening, the bigot surfaced,
the code words about welfare started flying: them people, our
America. Not a black face, other than mine, was in sight. The sweat
from brows started flying like sideways raindrops. The teeth
flashed in something between a smile and a bite. David Duke had
created his own prison, his jailers everyone around him, defying
common sense. So he lost. Now he's running for another office. A
Huey Long Kingfish in reverse. But the color line does that: sends
warriors and their followers in full flight away from the right
direction.

CHEMISTS CREATE FOAM TO FIGHT NERVE GASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By combining ingredients of hair-conditioning creams and
toothpaste, government chemists have created a foam that they say
could neutralize many of the chemical poisons and disease-causing
microbes that might be spread by terrorists in confined spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Chemists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.,
reported in recent papers that they had developed and tested a foam
that in a matter of minutes rendered harmless a wide variety of
chemical and biological agents, including nerve and mustard gases,
and disease viruses and bacteria, including anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maher E. Tadros of Sandia, who with Dr. Mark Tucker invented
the foam, said in an interview that it would be especially
effective in a building after a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shot of nerve gas or anthrax bacillus on, say, the 22d floor
of the Empire State Building, could be confined to the point of
release and neutralized within an hour,'' Tadros said. Unlike other
protective sprays, he said, the foam would leave no dangerous
residue and would not harm most office materials.
</P>
<P>
   Sandia's foam could be dispensed as a spray or fog in more open
environments. The laboratory said it was working with the New York
and Washington subway systems and several airports as places where
foam dispensers might initially be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   People whose skin was touched by even a droplet of nerve agent
could not be saved by the foam, which would be useful only in
decontaminating spaces or the outer surfaces of protective suits
worn by rescue personnel. Nerve agents penetrate the skin and kill
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The foam has already been tested at Sandia against harmless
chemicals with compositions very similar to those of nerve and
mustard gases, and has been tested against real nerve and mustard
gases at the Illinois Institute of Technology Research in Chicago.
In these tests, the Sandia laboratory reported, the chemical agents
were reduced in quantity by one-half every 2 to 10 minutes. After
one hour, the poisons were reduced to negligible amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the foam against real anthrax microbes will be carried
out soon by the Illinois institute, but meanwhile Sandia has
conducted tests using harmless Bacillus globigii, a spore-forming
bacterium very similar to anthrax. After one hour of exposure to
the foam, only one spore out of 10 million of the anthrax-like test
bacteria remained alive.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredients of the foam are surface-active agents like
the wetting agents in hair conditioners, and oxidizing agents of
the kinds used in toothpaste, including mixtures of sodium
bicarbonate and hydrogen peroxide. A foam is created by forcing a
cocktail of these ingredients through a venturi nozzle that draws
in air to form a myriad of tiny bubbles that support a stiff,
long-lasting foam.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Tadros said, foam dispensers could be combined with a
building's sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the foam on the toxic agents like sarin, soman and
tabun, among others, is to split the chemical bonds constituted in
these substances by phosphates or sulfides, causing the poisonous
molecules to fall apart into harmless fragments, the Sandia report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandia scientists said they had not yet explained the efficient
destruction of bacterial spores by the foam. But they said the foam
might work by breaching the protein walls that ordinarily protect
spores, allowing oxidizing agents to enter and kill them.

TOO FEW JOURNALISTS OF COLOR, SEMINAR TOLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CARLOS BYARS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Newsroom staffing and sensitivity to people of color
got intense scrutiny at a recent seminar on race conducted by
Houston's journalism associations.
</P>
<P>
   The seminar, ``Straight Talk About Race,'' brought together the
heads of national organizations representing Hispanic,
African-American, Asian-American and Native American journalists.
</P>
<P>
   News directors of five local news organizations, the four major
television stations and the Houston Chronicle also took part in a
question-and-answer session Saturday moderated by independent
producer Ed Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   The four organizations represent about 7,000 journalists in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   All members of the panel, representing newspapers in
Albuquerque, N.M.; Dallas; Seattle; and Washington, D.C., agreed
that there are too few journalists of color and their
representation in upper management is too small.
</P>
<P>
   There also was agreement that media organizations tend to
pigeonhole minority reporters, often assigning them to stories
particularly related to the minority community and failing to
obtain minority input on stories of general interest.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, especially the Asian-American community, generally
are thought of as homogeneous and monolithic, said Catalina Camia,
president of the Asian American Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   Camia, a member of the Dallas Morning News' Washington bureau,
said ``Asian-Americans tend to be the invisible minority.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted the organization's 1,900 members make up only 2.5
percent of the newspaper work force, and one-fifth are students or
reporters with less than three years' experience.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Baca, assistant features editor at the Albuquerque News
Journal, said she believes Hispanic journalists suffer from an
image problem and that Hispanic professionals need more
representation in mainstream stories.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Williams, who covers city hall for The Washington Post,
said she expects to see gradual changes over the coming decades as
a result of the country's growing diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Williams noted that if there were more tutoring and mentoring of
minorities by people in management, there would be more minorities
moving upward in news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She also said managers fear that they might make a mistake by
taking a chance and promoting a minority. ``(The candidate) has to
be virtually foolproof before they will make that investment,'' she
said.

MARCH 1999: DEAR TIM, PATRICK AND KATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILELEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUR MOTHER WRITES as an old century is about to end and a new
millennium is about to dawn, with a request that you wait until the
100th anniversary of my birth to read this letter. By then, save
accident or ill-health, you will be reaching retirement age,
beginning to assess the meaning of your lives. I cannot know all
the lessons that adulthood will have taught you. But, if nostalgia
and psychotherapy loom as large in 2052 as they do in 1999, you
will be looking back to the children you were to make some sense of
the men and woman you became. What do I hope you see in the
rearview mirror?
</P>
<P>
   Not my parenting skills, which Dorothy Parker might have said
ran the full gamut from panic to terror. ``Worrying must work for
you,'' your grandmother once told me, ``because 99 percent of the
things you worry about never happen.'' A clever one, your grandma,
with her generation's passive philosophy that children will grow up
if their parents just get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Not my cooking. Your olfactory nerves are not impaired. They
simply stored no childhood aromas of fresh-baked bread. Your hot
chocolate came straight from a Swiss Miss box; your chicken noodle
soup right out of a Campbell's can. Yours was the only house on the
block that had Domino's Pizza on speed-dial, that considered
grilled cheese haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Not your experience in organized sports. You all played on ``A''
teams and ``B'' teams and when you were assigned to one, chances
are you belonged on the other. Youth sports taught you less about
athletics than about arbitrary judgments, adult competitiveness,
and smalltime political influence, lessons better left for later in
life.
</P>
<P>
   Not the experience of late 20th-century education ``reform.''
Too many terrific teachers were held captive to policymakers who
conned the electorate into believing that what children know, that
who they are, can be reduced to a series of multiple-choice
questions on a standardized test. The best teachers taught you
otherwise, but it was hard for you to hear them when the drumbeat
of conventional wisdom was banging so loudly.
</P>
<P>
   If not the hearth, or the playing field, or the schoolhouse,
what is it that your mother hopes you'll remember from your
childhood with unalloyed joy?
</P>
<P>
   I hope you will remember Your Tree.
</P>
<P>
   The perfectly symmetrical sugar maple stood at the edge of our
property and the center of your childhoods. It meant different
things at different times to each one of you, but it held in its
branches the very essence of childhood -- spontaneity, imagination,
improvisation -- the very things devalued by the adult-sized world
at the end of century.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ladder, no swing, no clubhouse in Your Tree. It was
all gangly branches -- all arms and legs, just like you. But even
without plywood floors or old lumber siding, Your Tree was a
playhouse, a room of your own where adults held no sway, where what
rules existed were rules made and enforced, or not, by children.
Your father and I would hand up juice boxes and peanut butter
sandwiches and you would shoo us away, silence prevailing on high
until we were out of earshot, beyond the whispers of grade-school
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Your Tree taught you, Patrick, that not all athletes are found
on the soccer field or the basketball court. It was you who
fashioned the rope that hoisted you and your pals to the bottom
branch, you who climbed straight up in your Birkenstocks and guided
the less sure-footed safely to the higher branches.
</P>
<P>
   Your Tree taught you, Tim, that not all learning takes place in
libraries. You read your first paperback books in Your Tree,
following the exploits of Matt Christopher with the sun on your
face and the bark against your back.
</P>
<P>
   Your Tree made friends with you, Katie, giving you a place to be
alone or to welcome others when you were ready to offer Lily a
flowerpot or Chris a kitchen chair to boost themselves into your
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   For all my warnings against climbing too high or too fast, none
of you ever fell out of Your Tree. Several stitches followed a fall
from a bicycle. A broken leg resulted from the collision of a sled
with another tree. But Your Tree held you all safe and secure.
</P>
<P>
   We first saw Your Tree when we answered a real estate ad for a
fixer-upper ``with the most beautiful tree'' in town in the front
yard. It was 100 years old by then. It would be too much to say
that Your Tree sold the house, but it was certainly true that Your
Tree was the only thing on the lot that could not be improved upon
by human hands.
</P>
<P>
   We did not realize the lack of hyperbole in the real estate
agent's description until our first autumn living alongside Your
Tree. Its even shape had been obvious during the spring and summer,
but when the leaves turned from green to red and gold and orange,
Your Tree looked impossibly, perfectly symmetrical. Cars pulled
alongside the road to photograph it. Neighbors put Your Tree on
their jogging route. Traffic picked up as commuters timed their
drives to experience the variations in color at sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that first fall that you claimed Your Tree for the
children of this neighborhood. Foliage might be pretty, but
millions of fallen leaves could be raked -- by adults, of course --
into enormous piles for jumping and throwing.
</P>
<P>
   We gave up trying to grow anything under Your Tree. Nothing
could compete with its deep roots; nothing but children could grow
in its shadow. Your Tree became the four-season backdrop to
suburban childhood: the annual neighborhood cookout on the last day
of school, snowball fights in winter, and sprinkler runs in summer.
Your Tree was home base for hide and seek and home plate for pickup
baseball games, the most memorable of which took place in 10 inches
of snow.
</P>
<P>
   As this century ends, there are few among us who can recall its
birth, but Your Tree was a silent witness at the dawn of the 20th
century. It is hard to imagine the skinny sapling it must have been
then, undistinguished among the pines and other hardwoods in the
forest.
</P>
<P>
   It sits now at the edge of a quarter-acre lot, its branches
extending across a road that did not exist before the Great
Depression. At the end of the 19th century, Your Tree grew in a
rural village that was home to no more than 6,000 people, many of
them farmers. Three new railway stations built at the end of the
20th century were about to turn that town into the prosperous
Boston suburb of 28,000 that it became.
</P>
<P>
   We always knew it was not really Your Tree, that such a specimen
could not be owned. It belonged as much to the families of
squirrels that lived in its branches and the cardinals who nested
in the Whelan family's front hedge and used it as a regular perch.
It belonged to the fledgling house finches who hatched every year
in the hanging flowerpots on our front porch.
</P>
<P>
   We were just the custodians of Your Tree, spreading mulch over
its roots, watering it through droughts, binding its two main
branches with cable in hopes that some boy or girl 50 years in the
future might be able to experience what you all enjoyed 50 years in
the past -- a summer afternoon in the arms of an old, familiar
friend. Your Tree.

DON'T GO SLEEPLESS WITHOUT THIS ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is going to be a rough night. The beeper is bound to go off
once or twice or the baby will howl on and off until dawn. What's
the best way to make it through the night?
</P>
<P>
   Here is advice gleaned from research focused on two of the most
sleep-stressed professions, soldier and doctor: Take a nap this
afternoon, drink two cups of coffee around midnight and after that,
if you need a clear head, tough it out _ no catnapping!
</P>
<P>
   To those studying an increasingly weary populace, sleep itself
is ``without a doubt, hands down, the best countermeasure to sleep
deprivation,'' said Dr. James Wyatt of Harvard Medical School, one
of a number of researchers who addressed a recent National Academy
of Sciences conference reported last week in The Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Bonnet of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio,
suggests thinking of limited doses of sleep _ that is, a nap _ as a
medication superior in almost every way to the most common
fatigue-fighting drug, caffeine. But every medicine can be misused.
He found in experiments replicating a medical resident's night on
call that taking short naps between tasks can actually lower
alertness levels.
</P>
<P>
   Tired people fall quickly into deep sleep, Dr. Bonnet said, and
waking from that state produces sleep inertia, that terrible,
groggy feeling that can impair responses for up to half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Naps are most effective when the sleeper is not tired, and can
be used to prevent fatigue, a practice researchers call
prophylactic napping.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David F. Dingess, chief of the division of sleep and
chronobiology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center,
said the body recovers from sleep deprivation most rapidly during
the first hour of slumber. ``That's why naps work,'' he said. ``Now
that I'm approaching 50, I'm amazed at how much of a difference 10
minutes makes.''
</P>
<P>
   This miracle cure, however, has a real-world limitation _ the
time it takes to administer. Bonnet recommended two-hour naps for
residents before a night on call, an idea that startled the
director of the medical/pediatrics residency program at his school.
``Two hours?'' Dr. Gary Onady remarked. ``Wow. That's not going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   But when there are no naps, there is caffeine. And the armed
forces, worried about the increasingly common combination of
high-tech weapons, night operations and rapid deployment across
time zones, has become a major sponsor of research in the field.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent conference, psychologists from the Army's Walter
Reed Institute of Research described what happened when soldiers
were kept awake for 48 hours and then given 600 milligrams of
caffeine, the equivalent of six cups of coffee. The drug's effect
on postponing sleep was fleeting, said Col. Greg Belenky. ``But the
effect on performance was more enduring, lasting 10 to 12 hours,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The practical challenge is making caffeine available in combat.
During the 100 hours of ground combat in the Persian Gulf War,
``there was no coffee to be had for love nor money,'' Belenky
recalled. ``Guys had brought little packets of Taster's Choice and
were ripping them open and pouring it in their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Food technologists at the Department of Defense Soldier Center
of Excellence in Natick, Mass., are working on a heavily
caffeinated ``Hoo-ah'' food bar _ ``as in `Let's take that hill!
Hoo-ah!''' Belenky said. But the Walter Reed team prefers Stay
Alert chewing gum, a commercial product that gets 80 percent of its
caffeine into the bloodstream within five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For civilians, the emphasis should be on making the most
effective use of coffee and naps, Dingess said. Nerve cells develop
tolerance to caffeine, so consider going without it for a week
occasionally to restore its punch. And when there is a tough
stretch ahead, he said, avoid alcohol, use coffee strictly as a
``wake promoter _ why do people drink it first thing in the
morning, if they've had a good night's sleep?'' _ and nap
strategically to head off weariness.

<P>
   In spots, the depths of the sea teem with shrimp whose eyes are
exquisitely adapted for life in a world of eternal darkness.
Extraordinarily sensitive, the eyes can apparently see a diffuse
light given off by hot volcanic springs, around which the creatures
feed by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   The light of the hot vents is far too faint to be detected by
human eyes. But very sensitive cameras on occasion have captured
its eerie glow.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it turns out, human explorers of these dark ecosystems,
working in submersibles equipped with banks of strong floodlights,
may inadvertently be blinding swarms of the shrimps.
</P>
<P>
   A team of three oceanographers in the March 11 issue of the
journal Nature report evidence of blinding among deep-sea shrimp of
two types, Rimicaris exoculata and Mirocaris fortunata. Diving in
the French submersible Nautile, the team collected the shrimp from
two vent sites in the deep Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Close examination of the creatures showed eye damage, at times
severe, and at times with a complete breakdown of eye-pigment
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrimp swarm over the vent chimneys and are illuminated by
any vehicle working at the active region,'' the team said. ``There
is at present no means of working at the vents without causing this
damage, so every vent population visited will already have been
exposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team added that eyes were spared only among ``juvenile
specimens taken by trawling in midwater well above the vents.''
These shrimp would have escaped the floodlights down below.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reporting the findings are Peter Herring of the
Southampton Oceanography Center in Britain, and Edward Gaten and
Peter Shelton of the University of Leicester.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lee Van Dover, a deep-sea biologist at the College of
William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., who has studied the shrimp
and documented the vent glow, said in an interview that such damage
had long been suspected and was worth confirming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know that the shrimp use their eyes,'' she added.
``We've never shown they have a visual response to light. But we
think that they're looking at ambient light from the vents,
probably to keep away from very hot water that would cook them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Van Dover said that submersibles with floodlights and
scientific observers had been diving regularly on the Atlantic
vents since 1985, and that the divers had never found any lessening
of the shrimp populations, despite the repeated illuminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrimp are always there,'' she said. ``So the sense is
that the lights haven't blinded them to the point that it's
affecting the population density. Individuals may be having their
eyes damaged, but in terms of the behavior and ecology of the
system, we don't see any effects. If they had all disappeared, we
would have wondered.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent lack of population damage, Dr. Van Dover
said, a move is afoot among deep-sea scientists to protect some
parts of the seabed from further exploration and potential damage
by setting up deep sanctuaries that are off-limits to most
research.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scientists, she added, have a favorite place that
they are eager to protect and preserve.

media event -- visual, immediate, and as short-lived as a
miniseries. We are watchers. The world we watch is one in which war
-- that madness that has swept through the 20th century as no
other, destroying tens of millions of lives -- seems now to involve
only a few brave pilots high in the strato-
</P>
<P>
   sphere, a brace of unmanned cruise missiles, and a lot of
luckless Iraqis out in the darkened city. Real people suffer and
die in Iraq, but the war we watch has almost no effect on our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual war is part of the programming package in a virtual
world, a world where television, telephone, Internet, and computer
create the modern reality, a world where IBM's ``Solutions for a
Small Planet'' ad campaign makes it seem as if everybody -- from
the casbah in Marrakesh to the wilds of Mongolia -- has a cell
phone, a laptop computer, and a 401(k) plan. Where everybody thinks
as we think, does as we do.
</P>
<P>
   It is an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that a definite late-20th-century global
culture is taking shape, so far it is a very thin veneer masking a
world that remains strange and varied. Remote corners of the globe
still brim with a weirdness that you can't fully comprehend by
watching cable TV, surfing the Net, or springing for the
six-day/seven-night package tour of the rain forest. Even a
destination as easy as Europe is another world from ours.
</P>
<P>
   The delightful coincidences of the emerging global culture, of
course, are the stuff of good dinner-party chat -- the Red Sox fan
you ran into in Burkina Faso, the excellent fajitas available in
Dubai. We all have our favorite small-world stories, none more so
than people who have dabbled in the world on business trips,
archeology digs, or as foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Here's mine: During the early 1980s, when the city of Beirut had
been chewed apart in an ugly, all-out conflict between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization, I made my way through the
steaming rubble to the Lebanese foreign ministry. The building was
all but abandoned. Finally, in one small office, I came upon a
jolly man who gave me a card identifying himself as the minister of
protocol for Lebanon. We chatted about the political situation,
about how horrible the conditions in Beirut had become, and as we
parted he pulled out another business card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are ever in Charlotte,'' he said, ``come by.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of protocol also owned a Hickory Farms franchise in
a North Carolina shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Small world, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. Our conversation, after all, took place in Beirut, a
city where until recently people fished with hand grenades and
raised their kids in buildings surmounted by machine-gun nests,
where a pleasant evening at a French restaurant could be
interrupted by a car bomb. Beirut was not the kind of place that
makes you think: small world.
</P>
<P>
   Belfast, Sarajevo, Saigon, Monrovia, Algiers -- at different
moments in the last half of this century, each of these cities and
many others besides have been like Beirut, places where people
tried to carry on with their lives as waves of violence crashed
around them. And that was mild compared with what went on earlier
in the century -- in London during the blitz, Berlin at the Nazi
Gotterdammerung, Hiroshima after the Enola Gay.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there are no new Hiroshimas and very few Beiruts today.
The Lebanese capital is being rebuilt; the streets are once again
safe to walk. Sarajevo and Belfast are recovering as well. Saigon
is peaceful. Berlin is united and tame. Even Russia, with its
mafioso and hookers and general malaise, isn't terribly scary.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the comparatively mild global environment we now
enjoy, it is not advisable for a westerner to wander too far off
the well-guarded path. Tourists at the pharonic monuments in Egypt
know that. So do visitors to the Mayan tombs in Guatemala and the
game reserves in Uganda. Just when it seems to be a small world
after all, a guerrilla army materializes, a fanatic throws a bomb,
a bunch of brigands with AK-47s show up -- and we all realize how
little we really understand the political passions that fester far
from our comfortable homes and well outside the range of CNN's
cameras.

   WE ARE ENDING a century of horrific conflict, including two
world wars and a nuclear standoff so dangerous that a false move in
Washington or Moscow could have extinguished the human race several
times over. So the relegation of war to a minor media event today
is, on balance, a good thing. Understand that I am not arguing for
a return to the good old days of the Ypres or Guadalcanal. Nor
should young men and women have to endure distant conflict as a
rite of passage to adulthood. But you must admit that the century
is closing in a very different way than it began.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, there were five big powers vying for territory: Britain
(which was working to add South Africa to its realm and encroaching
on Turkish areas of the Middle East), France (which wanted Morocco
and the Levant), Austro-Hungary (eyeing the Balkans), Germany
(coveting Alsace-Lorraine), Japan (wanting Korea and Manchuria).
Czarist Russia and the United States both had vast land empires of
their own. War was still considered an extension of diplomacy, a
normal duty for young men, and Europe of the 19th century was used
to fighting wars every 20 years. Such wars were fought on
battlefields far from the eyes of civilians. Returning soliders
told their tales and nursed their wounds, but the war itself was
largely invisible to the outside world.

RING OUT THE NOISE, RING OUT THE FUNK

<P>
   IT IS NO ACCIDENT that two of the movies nominated for Academy
Awards at the end of the millennium look back to Elizabethan times.
As we hurtle toward 2000 (or 2001 if you prefer) with the anxiety
of Stanley Kubrick's about-to-be-reborn astronaut, artists in
almost every genre are finding it necessary to look back in order
to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense throughout the art world that the progress of
the 20th century has been too noisy and chaotic, even too academic
in the sense that art has become severed from the everyday lives of
people. The question in many cases seems to be not where do we go
from here, but where did we go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Thus in classical music we have the repudiation of serialist or
atonal music as classical composers and conductors strive for the
tonality that ruled from Bach to early Stravinsky. Similarly,
Wynton Marsalis has led a whole movement of jazz artists who reject
both free jazz avant-gardism and jazz-rock fusion in order to bring
back to the fore jazz's roots in blues and swing, from Louis
Armstrong to early John Coltrane. Even in the nouveau world of
hip-hop, the ascension of the talented Lauryn Hill doesn't
represent a radical extension of rap, but a fusion of hip-hop
rhythms with more melodic forms like reggae and R&AMP;B. Meanwhile,
Elvis Costello goes knocking on Burt Bacharach's and Tony Bennett's
doors and swing is king among rock stars like Brian Setzer.
``Ragtime'' and Julie Taymor's ``Lion King'' reject the artiness of
Stephen Sondheim and the faux artiness of ``Les Miserables'' to
reconnect to a more tuneful, as well as tonal, form of musical
theater.
</P>
<P>
   All this looking back in music and in other artistic idioms
conjures up the second-dirtiest word in the English language you
can call an artist _ conservative. (The worst? Reactionary.) The
aim, though, isn't to live in the past, but to tap back into it in
order to march ahead with a new spring in one's artistic step.
</P>
<P>
   We even find the same thing going on these days in the worlds of
popular culture and politics. Take the feminist furor with programs
like ``Ally McBeal'' and novels like ``Bridget Jones's Diary,''
which in themselves can be seen as a post-feminist, Camille Paglian
rebellion against '60s dogma. The movie ``Pleasantville'' is widely
seen as a rebuke of 1950s conformity, but the movie also shows the
'90s as having lost touch with the glue that held families and
communities together. ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' yearns for the
family ties of the '50s, while acknowledging that family life is,
and was, more dysfunctional than idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   France, at the moment, is in culture shock over Michel
Houellebecq's slashing look at the excesses of the 1960s in his new
book, ``Les Particules Elementaires'' (``Elementary Particles'').
What is significant is that these criticisms aren't coming from
George Will, but from nonideologues like Houellebecq or liberals
like Robert Hughes, art critic for Time magazine
</P>
<P>
   Looking back in skepticism is nothing new in the world of art _
or the world at large _ at the end of a century. Romanticism
rejected the over-intellectual excesses of classicism early in the
19th century just as modernism in the 20th rejected the
over-emotional excesses of romanticism. Now, it seems, modernism
has gone too far into the seemingly opposite poles of academicism
and triviality. To walk up the slope of the Guggenheim Museum in
New York, for example, which has early-20th-century work at the
bottom and contemporary at the top, is to make a pilgrimage from
genius to junk.
</P>
<P>
   What Hughes says in his conclusion to ``American Visions,'' the
book that accompanied the PBS program about American art, could
apply to all art at the end of the century: ``The sphere of the
visual arts is fatigued, and its model of progress -- the vanguard
myth -- seems played out, hardly even a shell or a parody of its
former self. This, however, only seems unnatural or disappointing
to those whose expectations have been formed by vanguardism.
Cultures do decay; and the visual culture of American modernism,
once so strong, buoyant, and inventive, and now so harassed by its
own sense of defeated expectations, may be no exception to that
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Stephen Albert, a classical composer, used to say that
the modernist giants had stretched things to the breaking point --
James Joyce with stream of consciousness writing, Pablo Picasso
with his various schools of nonrepresentational art, Igor
Stravinsky's and Bela Bartok's dissonant music, along with
Friedrich Nietzsche's and Sigmund Freud's attempts to go beyond
good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tried to go further went so far into abstraction that
they cut off the narrative thread that art had traditionally given
to people's lives. The one constant that seems to prevail among all
the arts today is an attempt to return to a more narrative
structure. Stream of consciousness writing is practiced by very few
writers today; the same goes for serialism among composers. How
many of today's critically-acclaimed filmmakers practice the
surrealism of Federico Fellini or the symbolism of Michelangelo
Antonioni?
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that the influence of modernism doesn't
remain. There are remnants of Joyce or Virginia Woolf's stream of
consciousness in Toni Morrison's ``Beloved,'' to name one example.
Plays like Don DeLillo's ``Valparaiso'' at the American Repertory
Theatre show there's still life left in a rigorously modernist
aesthetic, particularly when -- as if to put bookends on the 20th
century -- it's paired with a fierce contemporization of Henrik
Ibsen's ``Master Builder.'' Ingmar Bergman's bleak Swedish
landscapes are reconfigured in the two films made from Russell
Banks's novels, ``Affliction'' and ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' (even
if Bergman at his bleakest makes those films look like ``Beach
Blanket Bingo'').
</P>
<P>
   Still, the divorce that the severest forms of modernism
engineered between the concerns of average men and women and those
of artists left a void that pop culture has been only too happy to
fill. If Arnold Schoenberg, the father of serialist music, and his
disciples are to be blamed for driving people in search of
contemporary music from classical music halls, artists in rock,
jazz, and world music were welcoming them into their camps.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the question: Should serious 21st-century artists
shun the world of popular culture or make an accommodation with it?
To follow the first path risks the elitism engendered by modernism;
to follow the second risks the triviality that DeLillo skewers in
``White Noise,'' where Elvis studies have the same, or higher
academic cachet as courses on Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the influence of popular culture on the
contemporary arts scene is incontrovertible. The playwright Tom
Stoppard seems like the prototypical 21st-century artist. His play,
``Arcadia,'' looks backward to Lord Byron and ahead to the end of
the world, combines the best of all isms -- a classical narrative
structure, a romantic attitude, and 21st-century concerns. While
``Arcadia'' delights the intellegentsia, ``Shakespeare in Love''
connects both Stoppard and Shakespeare to as wide an audience as
one could hope for -- even if the movie itself is not much more
than a charming diversion. The avant-garde Taymor working for
Disney before going off to film Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus''
is another case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The only ism that seems to hold sway these days is eclecticism.
As Stoppard has one foot in the Royal National Theatre and another
in Hollywood, a classical composer like Christopher Rouse can tip
his hat to Led Zeppelin in one piece and Stephen Albert in another.
There are only six degrees of separation from world music's Caetano
Veloso to rock's David Byrne to minimalist Philip Glass to
classical violinist Gidon Kremer to tango composer Astor Piazzolla
to cellist Yo-Yo Ma to classical composer Richard Danielpour. Do
these categories makes sense anymore? Less and less.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Theater in New York, under George C. Wolfe, has
adopted an all-inclusive aesthetic that has room for virtually any
intelligent playwright or director, be they of the modernist ART
stripe or more classical Huntington Theatre camp. (And that
aesthetic is mirrored in the age and color of its audiences, which
are neither as white nor as old as most theater audiences.)
</P>
<P>
   The culture wars raging today are the inevitable result of new
patterns of immigration in the country as well as a shrinking of
the planet in general. We may debate whether standards are being
lowered to make room at the Eurocentric table for Asian playwrights
or Inuit visual artists, but the international melting pot has
resulted in fascinating hybrids, from Salman Rushdie's novels to
Lou Harrison's music, both an almost seamless incorporation of
Eastern and Western values -- not to mention classical as well as
contemporary values.
</P>
<P>
   Another strain that is apparent as the year 2000 approaches is
religion. Are there ``Angels in America'' as Tony Kushner posits in
Part 1 of that play, ``The Millennium Approaches'' only to answer,
no, in the conclusion, ``Perestroika.'' Still, if the century began
with artists frustrated at the silence of God, if not the absence
of God, it seems to be ending with a striving toward a form of
spirituality that is also basically eclectic in nature. Mysticism
is particularly strong among Eastern European composers like Arvo
Part; new-age composers look to nature; and rock stars like Madonna
and Alanis Morissette head toward Buddhism. And everyone is
``Touched by an Angel,'' from CBS Entertainment to Wim Wenders, the
severe German film director who made two films, ``Wings of Desire''
and ``Faraway, So Close,'' about angelic intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this spirituality results in anything significant
artistically, or if it is merely symptomatic of
end-of-the-millennium anxiety remains to be seen, as does
everything else about the 21st century. We may not be around to see
what ism or isms define the times, but there won't be any shortage
of vantage points from which to watch what looks like a fascinating
competition.

   Barbara Stevens swims 40 minutes every day in a flume, a pool no
bigger than a sport utility vehicle that functions as a kind of
aquatic treadmill. A lifelong swimmer with artificial hip and knee
joints, Mrs. Stevens, 67, bought her flume in 1992 and installed
the 7-by-15-foot pool in the side garden of her home in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are `on' all the time,'' Mrs. Stevens said about swimming
in place against the steady current the flume provides. ``Your mind
gets in the mode of swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   The flume is quietly emerging as a form of home fitness. Health
clubs have installed flumes as a space-saving means to offer both
swimming and physical therapy. Among individual consumers, the
majority are baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association does not
keep sales figures on flumes, Endless Pools, the chief manufacturer
of recreational flumes, has sold more than 2,000 pools since 1988.
The company, in Aston, Pa., sold 520 flumes, varying in size, last
year at an average price of $17,000, and sold 400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water therapy is low impact,'' said Chris Wackman, vice
president for marketing at Endless Pools. ``It doesn't jar the
muscles or create stress on the joints.''
</P>
<P>
   Flumes can also be used as diagnostic tools to improve swimming
strokes. They have been embraced by recreational athletes and elite
competitors alike. For example, the flume at the Riekes Center for
Human Enhancement in Menlo Park, Calif., is specially outfitted
with two propellers to produce currents at speeds that hold
world-class sprinters in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Gerry and Judy Heller, a married couple who work together
as swimming coaches, use the flume to train swimmers of varying
abilities. They use videotape to record their athletes as they swim
in the flume and later analyze their strokes. Seeing the athletes
from all angles allows Gerry to have a complete sense of a
swimmer's movement and to witness what he calls ``the
conversation'' a swimmer has with the water.
</P>
<P>
   John Klimp, a masters swimmer who attended a recent clinic,
added, ``The flume is a very helpful teaching tool, but it's
humbling to watch yourself on video.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite athletes can also benefit from flume training. Coaches and
researchers at the International Center for Aquatic Research in
Colorado Springs use a flume and computer to analyze world-class
swimmers and other aquatic athletes. The 50,000-gallon flume is
enclosed in a chamber that allows altitude adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very tight control of how a swimmer is moving at a
given pace,'' explained Larry Herr, the sports science coordinator
for U.S.A. Swimming, the governing body for competitive swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes of all levels and across sports can use flumes to come
back after an injury. When Leslie Krichko was a member of the 1988
United States Nordic Ski Team, a foot problem that required surgery
led her to use pool running to remain strong without putting weight
on the injury. Since then she discovered flumes, and now, as a
certified aquatic trainer in Ridgefield, Conn., Ms. Krichko said
that flume workouts offered an advantage over traditional pools for
athletes like runners and skiers who might be loath to take up
swimming: ``The flume allows people to feel competitive against a
machine: The current gives them something to compete against.''

 UNDATED: ... outside world.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wars that broke out in 1914 and 1939 surprised everyone by
their brutality. The reason was technology. Machine guns, poison
gas, tanks, airplanes, submarines, ballistic missiles, nuclear
weapons -- all contributed to the carnage. World War I: 9 million
dead. World War II: at least 35 million dead. Had push come to
shove during the Cuban missile crisis hundreds of millions would
have died.
</P>
<P>
   But if technology has produced ever more cunning ways for us to
kill each other during this century, it has also contributed an
important tool for peacekeeping: the spy satellite. From the early
1960s onwards, the United States and other nations have maintained
fleets of satellites in orbit around the Earth. The best of these
can identify objects as small as five inches across. The spy
satellite thus has made the surface of the planet fully scannable.
This is why Iraq and North Korea have been building their nuclear
complexes underground.
</P>
<P>
   It is now extremely difficult for a nation to mass troops
without being detected. In fact, satellite imagery, coupled with
computers, can also analyze the type of exhaust coming out of
factories, indicating whether a country has shifted its industries
from civilian to war footing.
</P>
<P>
   The political term for this is ``transparency.'' When one
country can see what another is doing, and knows that it in turn is
transparent to prying eyes, it is less inclined to toy with the
idea of a surprise attack. Of course, intelligence analysts need to
know what to look for, and how to distinguish a maneuver from an
imminent attack: Iraq surprised the world in 1990 with its invasion
of Kuwait precisely because it had feinted toward the border
several times before.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, with the launching of the French SPOT satellite,
civilians have been able to buy spy time. At least three American
companies are launching private satellites with cameras that can
see objects as small as three feet across. And satellites are not
the only means of transparency. Live TV shots from Baghdad or
Mogadishu are more than TV infotainment. They have the effect of
allowing at least a small part of a battle zone to be visible to
the rest of the world, thus showing how destructive a raid is being
launched.
</P>
<P>
   This continues a pattern that took hold in World War II and the
Korean conflict and grew to maturity in Vietnam. Frank reports from
the front lines -- news dispatches, photos, TV footage -- began to
give the American public a clearer idea of the pain and waste of
war. When Richard Harding Davis and Stephen Crane telegraphed their
stories from the Balkan conflict at the turn of the century, a
romantic view of war still sold newspapers. By the time of Vietnam,
the romance was dead. By the time of the 1991 Gulf War, the
widespread presence of TV cameras beaming live images back to the
civilian world almost certainly helped to constrain the destruction
by making it transparent to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was President Bush's fear of what the scenes of destruction
of Iraqi troops would do in Arab capitals that caused him to shut
down Operation Desert Storm after 100 hours. It was images of Kurds
dying in the highlands of northern Iraq that prompted the former
British prime minister, John Major, to push for a major relief
mission. A few years ago in Shanghai, a Chinese military
strategist, Ding Xinghao, said that the Chinese officers he knew
who watched CNN coverage of the Gulf War were shocked by what they
saw and were rethinking their whole modernization effort.
</P>
<P>
   And during the siege of Sarajevo a few years ago, I talked with
a United Nations military commander who complained that the media
can affect public opinion in an instant, with a few gripping
images, and that the military has ``no command and control systems
that can match their speed of reporting.'' TV has short-circuited
both military thinking and diplomatic maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we can see virtually everything on the Earth, but that
doesn't mean we understand it. The reason for the vicious ethnic
hatred being played out in Kosovo, the story behind perplexing
multisided war now raging in central Africa, the anger that
motivates a Hezbollah suicide bomber or a Colombian rebel -- these
can't be picked up by a remote camera. The world beyond the TV
screen remains a place of great diversity and mystery. Even in our
own very transparent society, where we have a pretty good grip on
the culture, the subcultures, and the many backwaters -- where we
watch the Senate discuss our president's sex life and Oprah discuss
everything -- we still can't fathom the mind of the racist, the
rapist, the assassins in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying that more and more people have one
thing in common: TV. Bad guys, good guys, perpetrators, victims --
everybody watches. And that makes something of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   So take a little comfort in the comfort of your TV crib. The
next time you watch those night-vision images and brace yourself
for what passes for war these days, you are closer to the
battlefield than American civilians have been since the days of the
Civil War. You might not have any better understanding of the
underlying reasons for the conflict, or a true view of what is
going on outside the range of the video cameras, or indeed any
particular interest in watching Baghdad get pummeled again.
</P>
<P>
   But you will be doing what we all now do -- spies, soldiers,
civilians -- after a century in which millions died: You'll be
keeping an eye on the world.

<P>
   In the life of every species that goes extinct, there comes a
moment when things take a final turn for the worse, when a species
that has been teetering on the brink begins its irreversible
descent into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every case, those last hopeless days have gone
unrecorded by humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But as the necrology of the world's species grows ever longer,
more researchers are being provided with the morbid opportunity to
take notes and snap photos as the fate of the organisms they study
becomes sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Such documentation is the subject of a new book by a
wife-husband team, Beverly Peterson Stearns, a free-lance
journalist, and Dr. Stephen C. Stearns, an evolutionary biologist
at the University of Basel in Switzerland. Their book, ``Watching,
From the Edge of Extinction'' (Yale University Press), scheduled to
appear in April, is a recounting of stories of populations and
species driven to extinction before biologists' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the world, the Stearnses report, biodiversity
is losing ground so quickly that it is almost impossible not to see
species going extinct. One such place is off the southeast coast of
Africa on the Mascarene Islands, dubbed islands of the living dead
by Dr. Wendy Strahm, botanist at the World Conservation Union in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   On these volcanic islands, isolation and time conspired to
create a vast diversity of unique species. As with other island
species, many in the Mascarenes became adapted to life without the
predators and diseases of the mainland. In addition, with what are
usually small population sizes, such species become extremely
vulnerable to extinction when humans and the many plants and
animals they bring with them arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Strahm, whose work is described in the Stearnses' book, is
one of few biologists to study the plants of the Mascarenes. She
estimates that some 50 species of plants exist in the form of sole
or nearly sole survivors on these islands, possibly half of all the
plants in the world that are known to be so close to disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the living dead on the island of Mauritius (the Mascarene
island known as the former home of the dodo) is a palm tree, the
world's only known Hyophorbe amaricaulis, a species too rare to
merit a common name. Alone in the world, the tree resourcefully
produces both male and female flowers. The problem is that the palm
produces them at different times, an inconvenient setup if a plant
must fertilize itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even when scientists have saved pollen from the male flowers to
fertilize the female flowers, the hard-won seeds that are produced
die without developing. Tissue from the seeds can be grown in the
laboratory on sterile medium, but when these test-tube plantlets
are placed into soil, they die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute this palm gets blown over,'' said Dr. Strahm,
describing the fate of palms on these cyclone-prone islands,
``that's the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the neighboring island of Rodrigues lives the only known
example of the wild coffee plant, Ramosmania heterophylla, a very
distant relative of coffee. Though this plant blooms vigorously
where it grows by a roadside (where it is surrounded by fences),
the species is counted among the living dead because its flowers
are deformed, making fertilization impossible. Worse still, so many
foreign botanists have come to see the plant that it has gained a
reputation among the local population as a ``magic plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being fenced in, it is constantly being cut for use in
the treatment of venereal disease, hangovers and other maladies for
which it has no established curative effect. Perhaps its extinction
will be all the sadder because it will be its second. Thought to
have been extinct, as it had not been collected by Western
scientists since 1874, the species was rediscovered when, during a
school lesson on extinct species, a boy recognized Ramosmania
heterophylla as this lone plant near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Other species suffer other problems. Elaeocarpus bojeri consists
of a few trees growing on a mountaintop on Mauritius. Crowded by
non-native guava trees, these struggling plants never produce seeds
because their developing fruits are snapped off by non-native
monkeys before the seeds can mature.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they predict a quick end, biologists continue to try
to revive the so-called living dead. And they find reasons to hope
even on that morgue of biodiversity, the island of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauritius kestrel, once the rarest falcon in the world, was
at one point down to just a few pairs of birds. So desperate was
its situation that it became the international poster child for the
new conservation ethic of triage, just the sort of species that
biologists were beginning to argue was so far gone as to merit
neither time nor money. Today, after nearly three decades of
captive breeding and release, the Mauritius kestrel thrives,
numbering in the hundreds in the wild.

TOLL OF ILL-CONSIDERED NURSING CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By CLAIRE M. FAGIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When hospitals and other health care agencies started worrying
about pressures from managed care organizations, they brought in
highly paid consultants to help them restructure. Though they
recommended cutbacks in a number of areas, the quick, cookie-cutter
solution for which many firms earned millions was to cut
direct-care nursing staff.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, families and nurses are alarmed about what these cuts
have meant to quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the American Nurses Association surveyed its
members, 70 percent of all respondents said their employers were
cutting back on staffing by leaving vacant positions unfilled, 66
percent said hospitals had already laid off nurses or were planning
to do so, and 67 percent of registered nurses said the number of
patients assigned to them had increased.
</P>
<P>
   My colleagues and I are hearing from nurses who tell us they are
dealing with ratios of 1 RN to 10 patients on the day shift, 1 to
15 or even 1 to 20 on some shifts. Although designing safe
nurse-patient ratios is complex, these caseloads are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Restructuring plans have also led to substituting lesser-trained
aides for registered nurses. Training these RN replacements is not
regulated by state licensing boards. There are no minimum
requirements governing the amount of training aides or ``cross
trained'' workers must have before they can be reassigned to do
nursing work.
</P>
<P>
   Training periods generally range from a few hours to perhaps six
weeks. One study cited by the Institute of Medicine report found
that 99 percent of hospitals in California reported less than 120
hours of on-the-job training for newly hired ancillary nursing
personnel. Only 20 percent of the hospitals required a high school
diploma.
</P>
<P>
   What some are calling a race to the bottom of hospital staffing
patterns is occurring in the face of vastly reduced lengths of
hospital stays and increases in the severity of conditions for
which patients are hospitalized. These changes call for a higher
intensity of nursing care, not a lower one.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many consultants do not understand the
complexities involved in caring for the sick and the role nurses
play.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I met a man who had worked for one of the major
consulting companies and who had been involved in a great deal of
hospital restructuring. When he heard I was a nurse, he confessed
sheepishly, ``I am one of the bad guys.'' We talked a bit about the
recommendations he had made in what he described as his ``naive and
dangerous period.'' Then he told me he now felt extremely guilty
because of those recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife had a baby, born prematurely with severe
congenital problems. They spent weeks at the hospital, watching
expert nurses monitoring and responding to the subtle shifts that
occurred in the infant's condition.
</P>
<P>
   The baby survived. But the father told me he now thought back on
his professional interventions in restructuring with horror and
shame.
</P>
<P>
   I do not wish that personal experience on anyone. But it
highlights the fact that health care consultants, policy experts
and administrators ought to get close to those who are close to the
patient before they interfere in a relationship that patients
identify as key to hospital care and quality.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of the country, managed care has left nurses
unable to find jobs, but other areas are experiencing cyclical
nursing shortages. An aging and retiring nurse work force,
ill-considered cutbacks in staffing and increased needs for
specialized nurses are some of the reasons cited.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news about employment opportunities and working conditions
in hospitals contributed to a drop in enrollment of bachelor's
degree students in the nation's nursing schools of 5.5 percent in
1998. This problem will be exacerbated if expert nursing becomes
even more invisible and women and men are encouraged to abandon
caring roles in favor of more powerful and economically rewarding
roles.
</P>
<P>
   We all have to ask ourselves if the technological assembly line
of care that market-driven health care is creating can provide the
nuances and safeguards that patients need.
</P>
<P>
   Can physicians expect the treatments they prescribe _ often
complex drug regimens, with serious side effects and potential
adverse interactions _ to be successful without nurses to
administer them and monitor patients responses? Can they expect
unskilled caregivers to provide the care their hospitalized
patients require and on which they have come to depend, often
without awareness?
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Baer, a nurse and historian of nursing; Suzanne Gordon, a
journalist, and I have been studying the increasing burden of care
on nurses, patients and family members that has resulted from the
cutbacks of the 1990s. We've concluded that caregiving by
professionals and by families contains within it the possibility of
immense richness and human connection but also the potential for
crushing burdens.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to eliminate the core of responsibility and
obligation that is embedded within the caregiving relationship. If
the caregiver is not morally, emotionally and educationally
prepared, then caregiving becomes an experience of frustration, and
perhaps an act of control.
</P>
<P>
   When even professional caregivers are stressed by impossible
demands and unable to give the care they believe patients need,
their frustrations are inevitably communicated to patients and
families.
</P>
<P>
   Caregiving is defeated when society views care as an individual
obligation that does not require institutional or societal support,
or as an unaffordable luxury, rather than as a vital social
relationship that demands skill, social support, and education.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the scientific knowledge, professional judgment, and
interpersonal and technical skills integral to nurses' clinical
expertise can lead to dangerous outcomes for patients. The health
of our health care system depends on nurses. To demean, diminish,
or eliminate them puts the entire system in jeopardy.

TREES' PARTNERS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I heard there was a fungus that helps trees absorb
water. What is it?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you heard about is mycorrhizae, complexes formed by
beneficial fungi and plant roots, explained Gerald Posner, an
arborist with Arbor-Cultural Consultants in Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different ones,'' he said, ``and they are
highly plant-specific,'' meaning that particular plant species form
the mutually beneficial relationships with particular species of
fungi.
</P>
<P>
   There are three basic types, Posner said, depending on where the
complex is formed: endomycorrhizae, inside the root hair;
ectomycorrhizae, outside the root hair, and endo-ectomycorrhizae,
both inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus and the plant have a symbiotic relationship, Posner
said, meaning they live together and help each other to thrive.
Fungal cells differ from plant cells and have the ability to take
in certain nutrients and water from the soil more easily, while the
plant provides the fungus with other resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mycorrhizae have been known for many years,'' he continued,
``but only in about the last five years have plant scientists been
able to isolate the strains for certain plants and reproduce them
en masse for application.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial mycorrhizae preparations are available for a wide
range of conifers and broad-leaved trees and for certain annuals
and turf. The association forms only in the fall, and the fungus
normally needs to be injected into the soil.

STOP THAT MILLENNIAL MOPING, AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM. BIG WORD. Big idea. Big event. But this is a tired
country. After Monica and O.J. and the media exploding in all
directions and elections too numerous to mention and the ennui of
it all, bone tired. Tired, too, of being tired. You probably
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   And so maybe this celebration, this burst of introspection, this
toting up of where we have been and this speculation about where we
are going, maybe all of this is coming at precisely the wrong time.
This kind of event requires leisure. Attention. Discipline. We
don't have much of them right now. Hardly any at all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet maybe, just maybe, there is a grand design to all of this.
Maybe, just maybe, we are just alienated enough, just distracted
enough -- yes, just tired enough -- to (itals)need(unitals) the
millennium. Maybe there's a divine poetry to the calendar, maybe
there's an order to the universe, maybe this moment, coming as it
has been for a thousand years, is arriving at just the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is coming just when we need a new beginning the most.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what we have just been through. At its best American
civic life has been concerned with questions like the extension of
freedom, the acceptance of responsibility, the role of a democracy
in a world inhabited by dictators. But for a year the country's
civic life was bogged down in questions about sexual fidelity, DNA
evidence, recordings of gossipy conversations.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year the country was divided over the scandal
growing out of President Clinton's relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky. But the split that mattered wasn't between those who
thought the president should have been impeached and convicted and
those who did not. The split that counted was over those who
followed the scandal and the trial carefully and those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting history's course may be a fool's hobby, but it's
possible that the things scholars will remember the Clinton scandal
for won't be the blue dress or the definition of the word ``is,''
or the distinction between oral sex and other sex, or even the
public disaffection from it all. It is possible that the Clinton
scandal will be remembered as the end-of-century episode that
placed all the major themes of modern life into the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the end -- and, of course, this is the seed of the new
beginning -- the Clinton scandal was about concerns that were at
once modern and ancient: Values. Truth. Loyalty. Responsibility.
Love. Sex. Duty. Honor.
</P>
<P>
   So many of these questions are unresolved -- have been, now that
you mention it, for a millennium -- that their very presence in
print and on the airwaves is a signal of how much we need a sense
of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago, in 1899, the fin de siecle was an event of
immense spiritual and symbolic meaning, rippling through politics,
religion, fashion, business, and the economy. And a second after
midnight on December 31, 1899, a new century, a new era, began. But
at that moment, when the 19th century -- the century of the
railway, the steamship, nationalism, Beethoven, Dickens, and
Lincoln, the end of slavery in America and the eclipse of serfdom
in Russia -- gave way to the 20th century, only three digits
changed.
</P>
<P>
   This December 31, when the end is tolled for the 20th century --
the century of the motorcar, the airplane, space travel, collective
security, Stravinsky, Hemingway, and Roosevelt, the flowering of
the civil-rights movement and Soviet collective farms -- four
digits will change. In all of recorded history, that has never
happened before.
</P>
<P>
   Life the next morning -- January 1, 2000 -- will feel and look a
lot like it had the day before, barring, of course, some Y2K
catastrophe, a threat that had no equivalent on January 1, 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much will be the same, and there will be some comforting
similarities even with the 19th century. Liberal individualism, a
hallmark of New England in both the 19th and 20th centuries, almost
certainly will survive into the 21st century. The notion of reform,
a strong American impulse with deep New England roots, will almost
certainly be a familiar guidepost of the 21st century as well.
American spirituality, planted in New England, cultivated in every
century of life in this region, is likely to continue to flourish.
And science, which was in its primitive stages during the 18th
century here, moved into its controversial adolescence in the 19th,
and its sturdy maturity in the 20th, will remain a staple of New
England culture, along with its familiar mix of threat and
possibility. The family, which has been weathering storms since the
dawn of the industrial age, will continue to remain central, in the
nation's mythology if not in its reality, honored more in theory
than in practice, as it always has been.
</P>
<P>
   But things will change, day by day.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary commencement address at Milton Academy in
May 1926, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then only 44 years old and not
yet governor of New York nor president, spoke of the breathless
pace of change in his own lifetime. A man born 40 or 50 years
earlier, he told the graduates, had been ``brought up in a
Victorian atmosphere of gloomy religion, of copy-book sentiment, of
life by precept (and) had lived essentially as his fathers before
him.'' Then Roosevelt added, three-quarters of a century ago:
``(T)he lives of the great majority of people are more different
from the lives of 1875 than were our grandfathers' lives from those
of the year 1500.''
</P>
<P>
   That was nothing, as compared with the rate of change today.
</P>
<P>
   Just as transcendentalism and Social Darwinism now seem to be
quaint relics of the 19th century, Nazism and Soviet communism
increasingly will seem to be relics of the 20th century, ever more
distant with each day's sunset. Mass culture, which came of age in
the 20th century, may fade as a force as information and
entertainment, centralized in our own century, increasingly are
decentralized by the liberating potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it is impossible to see too far through the
scratchy window of the future. Though historians and social critics
now routinely offer confident explanations of why the 20th century
turned out the way it did, hardly anyone on the eve of the new
century could have predicted the advent of mass war, genocide, and
terrorism, three of the mainstays of our century. The preconditions
of Nazism and the Great Depression may have been present in 1900,
but they weren't recognized as such.
</P>
<P>
   These words were unknown: (itals)television, e-mail, fax,
modem.(unitals) These phrases were unknown: (itals)designated
hitter, space shuttle, CAT scan, wine cooler, wind chill(unitals).
These words had different meanings: (itals)gay, holocaust, cable,
digital, air bag, aids(unitals). The word (itals)microwave(unitals)
was not conceived as an adjective for the word
(itals)oven,(unitals) and the word (itals)cell(unitals) was never
considered an adjective for the word (itals)phone. (unitals) At the
beginning of the century no one could identify these sets of
letters: VCR, CBS, NHL, VHF, CIA, JFK, CPU, IRS, TVA, and TWA. The
letters USSR have come and gone, along with the USFL. In one
century the word (itals)blitz(unitals) has been transformed from
something the Nazis did to something the Patriots do, at least on
their sharpest Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the advent of a new century and a new
millennium should infuse us with a sense of possibility, and a
sense of the long view. That may sound incongruous on the pages of
a newspaper, which specializes in the short view. But when one of
the publishers of The Boston Globe, William O. Taylor, faced a
severe economic crunch, he summoned the long view in 1932, citing
Romans 8:18: ``For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us.'' That is the spirit that should animate us now, at
the shore of the new century, looking out at the great ocean of
time before us.
</P>
<P>
   But here, more than almost anywhere in the country, the new
century begins on the foundation of the past. Here, reinventing the
way people think about things is a habit, and a habit of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two New Englands,'' the great critic Lewis Mumford
wrote in The New Republic in 1934. ``One is the dead and moth-eaten
New England that flourishes in the gift shoppes, and that
specializes in battered furniture, `ancestors by purchase,'
imitations of hooked rugs, even replicas of Colonial gardens,'' he
said. ``The other New England is the same vital regional culture
that originally helped nurture Emerson, Thoreau and Hawthorne.''
That sounds like 20th-century perspective, and of course it is. But
this was written by Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1869, and the meaning
is identical: ``Full of crooked little streets; but I tell you
Boston has opened, and kept open, more turnpikes that lead straight
to free thought and free speech and free deeds than any other city
of live men or dead men.'' If we put our minds to it, something
very much like that will be written 25 years from now as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium is, to be sure, a historic event. But it is also
a historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It is a chance to start anew. It is a chance to begin over. It
is a chance to think and, more important, to rethink. And the good
thing about a millennium is that there is no need to rush. The new
one will last, after all, a thousand years. We have world enough,
and time.

A BAT'S SWIFT BITE, UNFELT, COULD BRING RABIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Conn.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Dec. 15, when a 29-year-old inmate at the Nottoway
Correctional Center in Virginia became ill with muscle pains,
vomiting and abdominal cramps, he was simply given an aspirin
substitute. But over the next few days his symptoms worsened: Pain
and tremors developed in his right arm, and he began to have
trouble walking.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after visiting the prison clinic, he was taken to a
hospital in Richmond, with a fever of 103 degrees. Within hours, he
began to hallucinate, and he became agitated and disoriented. He
also started to salivate copiously.
</P>
<P>
   After three days, a doctor began to suspect the worst and took a
bit of skin from the nape of the man's neck for a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Dec. 22, the diagnosis was confirmed: The man had
rabies. The biopsy detected it because he was at a late stage in
the illness, when the rabies virus had already advanced into the
brain and followed nerve fibers back out again, into the salivary
glands, cornea and neck.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late to save him. Although a vaccine can prevent the
disease in someone who has been bitten by a rabid animal, it works
only if given before symptoms begin. Once a person becomes ill, the
disease is almost always fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia man died on Dec. 31, becoming the only person in
the nation known to have died of rabies last year. As a precaution,
48 people who might have come in contact with his saliva while he
was ill were given shots of immune globulin and five injections of
rabies vaccine, at a cost of about $1,000 per patient. Such
prophylactic treatment is routinely given to people who might have
been infected by a rabies patient, even though virtually every case
is caused by an animal bite and there has never been a documented
case of human-to-human transmission in this country.
</P>
<P>
   An especially disturbing aspect of the case was that no one knew
how the prisoner had contracted the disease. Even more unnerving,
that mysterious pattern is typical of rabies deaths in the United
States in the past 20 years. A person gets sick, and rabies is not
even suspected until late in the disease or after death. The victim
must have been bitten or scratched by a rabid animal _ almost
invariably a bat _ but nobody, not even the patient, knows how or
when.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 30,000 people a year die from rabies, mostly in
developing countries where dogs are not vaccinated and treatment is
not available for bitten people. Prophylactic treatment is
recommended for travelers to those countries. In this country,
vaccination of pets and preventive treatment in people bitten by
animals have made rabies extremely rare in humans, with no more
than a case or two a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, rabies still has a unique power to terrify. It
conjures up images of mad animals foaming at the mouth and of
people dying horribly in the throes of hydrophobia, tormented by
thirst but prevented by throat spasms from taking a drink.
Recently, the parents of a child bitten by an otter at a Florida
zoo decided she should have prophylactic treatment, even though
none of the otters appeared sick.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing more frightening than the thought of being
attacked by a rabid animal, perhaps, is the notion that a person
can be bitten by an infected bat and not know it.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of rabies virus that killed the man in Virginia was
one found in either of two mouse-size, insect-eating bats that live
all over the United States: the silver-haired bat or the eastern
pipistrelle bat. But when epidemiologists checked medical records
and questioned prison employees and the man's family and friends,
they found no evidence that he had been bitten or scratched by a
bat or any other animal.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of bats inside the prison. Inmates said they
saw bats outside just occasionally, during summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unrecognized bat bite'' was the only explanation
epidemiologists could offer, they wrote in an article last month in
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a publication from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They could not even
pinpoint when the man might have been bitten, because the
incubation period for rabies can range from weeks to months or,
occasionally, even a year. Symptoms may come on fastest when the
bite is close to the head, because then the virus has a shorter
trip up nerve fibers to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 cases since 1981 in which people contracted rabies in
this country, 22 involved strains that could have come only from
bats, and 16 had the silver-haired bat strain found in the Virginia
man. Everyone in those cases died, including several children. But
only one patient was aware of having been bitten. In the rest, the
exposure was described as ``unknown,'' though in many cases family
members or patients themselves recalled that a bat had got into the
house or workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But that means one can be bitten by a bat without knowing it,
something most people would find hard to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   An incident described in the medical journal Lancet in 1997,
however, shows it can happen. A woman in her bathroom in
Connecticut felt something brush against her bottom, and when she
turned on the light, she saw a bat hanging from the ceiling. It
escaped through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the woman did not think she had been bitten, she
called her doctor, who looked at her skin through a magnifier. He
found two pinpoint punctures, about a fifth of an inch apart,
probably made by the teeth or claws of a silver-haired bat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been written that a bat could bite you without
your knowing it, but it was poorly documented, and hard to
believe,'' said Dr. Henry Feder Jr., an author of the report and a
professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of
Connecticut health center in Farmington. Now, Feder said, there is
proof that such bites can occur. He and other researchers point out
that these bats' teeth and claws are tiny and so exceedingly sharp
that they might puncture a person's skin without causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was given the rabies vaccine, and has remained
healthy. Feder said she would have been treated even if her doctor
had not found the puncture marks, simply because the bat had
touched her.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommend that anyone who comes into contact with a bat be
vaccinated, unless the bat is caught and tests show it to be free
of rabies. Most bats are not rabid, but if the bat gets away and
cannot be tested, one cannot afford to take a chance. Even when
people are not aware of any contact, if they have been near a bat
and cannot rule out having touched it _ if they wake up to find a
bat in their room, for instance, or find a bat in a room with a
small child _ vaccination is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it is puzzling that the majority of cases in
people come from silver haired or pipistrelle bats, because other
bats are more common, and thought more likely to carry rabies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all extraordinarily astounded by the finding that a
rare variant has been so predominant in our cases,'' said Dr. James
Childs, epidemiology section chief at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that people simply do not feel the bites and do
not realize they are at risk, and so they go on to develop rabies.
It may also be that the rabies strain in the two bat species is
more likely than other strains to cause disease in people, either
because the bat passes along a great deal of virus, or because the
virus itself is highly invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Childs said that scientists did not even know what proportion of
infected bats died from rabies, or whether some could carry it
without being harmed. ``They can die of rabies, but whether they
all do, I can't tell you,'' he said. ``I think that of any animals,
perhaps bats are least well understood in terms of how they respond
to the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs and other researchers emphasize that although people need
to stay away from bats and seek medical advice if they touch one,
rabies cases are extremely rare. ``Most bats are not rabid,'' said
Dr. Charles Rupprecht, chief of the rabies section at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. ``We'd be in trouble if they
were.''

VEGETABLE OIL FOR DIESEL ENGINES: FROM FRIES TO FUEL  
 FROM JAPAN, SUPERCHARGED RICE  
 GLOBAL TEMPERATURES OR GREENHOUSE GAS: WHICH CAME FIRST? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Idaho, Calif.)  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROM FRIES TO FUEL
</P>
<P>
   Diesel engines are hardly picky eaters. In addition to
petroleum-based fuel, they will run, relatively cleanly, on just
about any kind of vegetable oil. But a driver cannot simply pour a
bottle of Mazola into the tank. A bit of chemistry has to take
place first.
</P>
<P>
   And there, alas, is the rub. Converting vegetable oil into
diesel fuel takes time, can be done only in batches and creates a
waste water problem.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the Idaho National Engineering and
Environmental Laboratory, part of the Energy Department, have
developed a technique that streamlines the process and results in
less waste and what should be less expensive fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Like the older technique, it uses an acid or a base to catalyze
the reaction of the oil and an alcohol, producing the diesel fuel
and a byproduct, glycerol. But the acid or base in the new process
is solid, not liquid, remaining separate from the reaction products
and easy to recover. The new process can also run continuously, and
the high quality glycerol produced is valuable in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   For the researchers, who tested the technique on used vegetable
oil from a local producer of french fried potatoes (this being
Idaho, after all), the next step is to create a pilot project. They
foresee a day when a food producer is able to convert its waste oil
into diesel fuel for its trucks.
</P>
<P>
   FROM JAPAN, SUPERCHARGED RICE
</P>
<P>
   It won't power an engine, but a way to give rice more of a kick
for humans in the form of increased iron content has been figured
out by researchers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Iron deficiency is a serious problem worldwide, particularly for
people whose diet consists mostly of vegetables and grains.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Nature Biotechnology,
re-engineered the rice, transplanting a soybean gene responsible
for producing ferritin, a complex compound that stores thousands of
iron atoms in a central cavity. They also found a way to control
production of the ferritin so that it ended up in the endosperm,
the starchy part of the rice grain. The new rice contains up to
three times the iron of ordinary rice, and a meal-sized portion may
provide 30 to 50 percent of the adult daily requirement.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL TEMPERATURES OR GREENHOUSE GAS: WHICH CAME FIRST?
</P>
<P>
   The transition period at the end of an ice age is something of a
dance, where a rise in world temperatures fox-trots with an
increase in the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The question has
always been, which of the partners is leading?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California at San Diego think they know. Analyzing
the carbon dioxide content in tiny air bubbles trapped in ancient
Antarctic ice, and comparing the results with a temperature record,
they have determined that the warming begins first.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in the journal Science, studied
transition periods of about 10,000 years at the end of the last
three ice ages, 18,000, 135,000 and 240,000 years ago. They found
that during the ice ages, carbon dioxide concentrations were about
180 to 200 parts per million. As the Earth warmed, the
concentrations increased to 280 parts per million, but lagged
behind the temperature rise by about 400 to 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The warming, scientists believe, was touched off by changes in
the earth's position relative to the sun. As the warming proceeded,
organisms flourished, producing carbon dioxide through respiration
and decay. The carbon dioxide trapped more heat in the atmosphere
and amplified what would otherwise have been a relatively small
warming.
</P>
<P>
   When the warmer periods ended and temperatures started cooling
again, higher carbon dioxide levels persisted for a shorter or
longer time, depending on the length of the warmer period.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the warm period, the scientists suggest, the more
organisms flourish, and thus the more carbon dioxide there is to
keep the levels high even as temperatures begin dropping again.

   Pro and Con: Is Fat-Gobbling Pill Too Good to Be True?
</P>
<P>
   Q. The new supplement Cellasene claims to reduce cellulite, the
fatty deposits that make the hips, thighs and buttocks look lumpy.
Can this work?
</P>
<P>
   _ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   A. I do cosmetic surgery for a living, so I see a lot of women
for liposuction. And when I first heard about this I was skeptical.
The four active ingredients _ lipovascolen (TM), borage, fish oil
and soya lecithin _ have been used and studied in Europe for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism appears to work by improving the local
micro-circulation so the trapped globules of fat in the skin can
become metabolized.
</P>
<P>
   Three clinical trials of the product in Italy, including a blind
clinical trial with placebos, and considerable anecdotal experience
show the same results. There was a statistically significant
reduction in the circumference of the hips and thighs, a
significant reduction of subcutaneous fat in the thighs as measured
with a caliber, and a statistically significant increase in blood
flow in the skin of the thighs.
</P>
<P>
   No side effects were reported. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. GEORGE BERAKA, surgery professor at Cornell, attending
plastic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is an intoxicating idea to think that a pill could remove
cellulite and reduce the diameter of your thighs. Perhaps the
sequel will be a pill to remove a bump on your nose? I doubt it,
and I am certain that Cellasene will do nothing to reduce fat in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 minutes of fame this new product is enjoying reminds me
of the frenzy over aminophylline-based creams that were the rage
against cellulite almost five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   None of them have stood the test of time. Furthermore,
``studies'' done by people with a financial interest in a product
should not be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Cellasene's targeting a specific area, anything you
ingest is going to have an effect throughout your entire body, and
as a doctor, I could not in good faith recommend this product
without further evaluation.

   Cancer Regimen Found Safe in Pregnancy
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant women diagnosed with breast cancer once felt they had
to choose either the toxic doses of chemotherapy or a healthy baby,
but never both.
</P>
<P>
   Now they may be able to use a standard chemotherapy to treat
their malignancies, and still look forward to safe deliveries and
healthy infants, a recent study published in the current issue of
the Journal of Clinical Oncology has found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to popular belief,'' said Dr. Richard Theriault, one
of the authors of the study, ``we've found that chemotherapy can be
used in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with minimal
or no complications of labor or delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year, on-going program, undertaken at the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is unusual,
experts say. It monitors 24 patients given identical chemotherapy
from prenatal care to childbirth to the years after.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study gives us more than hope,'' said Dr. Jeanne Petrek,
surgical director of the Lauder Breast Cancer Center at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While the incidence of breast cancer among pregnant women is
about 1 in 3,000, experts expect the number to rise as more women
become pregnant later in life, when breast cancer is more common.
</P>
<P>
   None received radiation and none had chemotherapy during the
first trimester, when the limbs and organs of the fetus form. All
were advised to avoid breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Specialized prenatal care was an important component in the
study: Patients worked throughout with obstetricians experienced in
monitoring high-risk pregnancies. Such extensive, specialized
monitoring is not available to all women, Dr. Petrek pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Theriault is concerned about the future health of the children.
``Right now,'' he said, ``they appear normal. I expect they will
continue normal. But we don't know for sure.'' The children's
median age is 4.5 years.

<P>
   When Dumbbells and Antibiotics Clash
</P>
<P>
   Many drugs carry consumer warnings: Avoid overexposure to the
sun; do not drink alcohol, or take caution when operating
machinery. But physicians may soon be offering a very different
caveat when prescribing fluoroquinolone antibiotics, commonly used
to treat urinary tract, bronchopulmonary or intestinal infections.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging in high-impact exercise or strenuous weightlifting
while taking these drugs may lead to tendon ruptures, injuries that
can require surgery and months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 cases reported in medical literature link the use
of fluoroquinolones with tendinitis and tendon rupture, reported
Dr. Riley Williams, an orthopedic surgeon at New York City's
Hospital for Special Surgery. He presented his data at the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons held
recently in Anaheim, Calif. The study will appear later this year
in The American Journal of Sports Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tendons are in a constant state of remodeling, as tissues break
down and build up again. By exposing canine tendons to
fluoroquinolones, Williams and his colleagues discovered the
weakening of the tendons. He said that he has replicated his
findings on human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Williams speculates that a person taking ciprofloxacin may
rupture a tendon, for example, while exercising. The Achilles
tendon, knee, quadriceps and rotator cuff _ tendons subjected to
heavy stress _ are most at risk. Usually, the injury occurs near
the end of a 7- or 14-day course of treatment, or even after the
course has been completed, said Williams. He added that the
medication's effect is temporary and reversible.
</P>
<P>
   Ciprofloxacin (brand name Cipro), the most commonly prescribed
of this class of antibiotic, is made by Bayer. Robert Kloppenburg,
director of public affairs for Bayer USA, said, ``In the past 10
years there have been over 100 million prescriptions written for
Cipro in the U.S., and this study cites 100 reports of tendon
rupture. That's about one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dr. Jack Andish, an orthopedic surgeon at the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation, who was not involved with the research: ``It is
important to be aware of the possible correlation between taking
fluoroquinolones and tendon injury. But considering how commonly
these antibiotics are prescribed, it is pretty rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agreed. ``I don't want to discourage people from taking
these drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you do take one of the fluoroquinolones and engage in
high-impact exercise or heavy weight-lifting,'' he added, ``don't
try to work through the pain.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were no distress calls or survivors. The sea that brutal
night claimed the lives of 42 men and two women. Six weeks later,
one lifeboat was found afloat, empty and broken, torn from its
davits.
</P>
<P>
   The Derbyshire had been one of the largest and safest ships ever
built, a star of the British merchant fleet. Its great size, nearly
the length of three football fields, was seen as key to her
survival in rough seas. But when the big ore carrier sank in a
typhoon in September 1980, all that meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, interest in the ship's mysterious fate has grown
into an epic of scientific debate and sleuthing, a high-stakes
detective story that is still unfolding. The work is made possible
by robots and other advanced technologies, some kept secret during
the Cold War, that are now allowing investigators to peer deep into
the sea's icy darkness, illuminating much that was once lost or
hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a British-American team lowered robots down 2.6 miles
to view the ship's shattered remains at the bottom of the Pacific
some 500 miles south of Japan. It was the third such foray and cost
nearly $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have prompted London to reopen a formal inquiry on
the Derbyshire, the largest British merchant ship ever lost at sea.
But its implications are wider, involving the whole class of
vessels known as bulk carriers. Since the Derbyshire went down, the
sea has claimed 180 of the ships and 1,465 lives, according to
Lloyd's Register of Shipping, which tracks maritime safety. The
vessels have been sinking, often mysteriously, at a rate of nearly
one a month, fleets of Titanics quietly disappearing from view.
</P>
<P>
   A rogue's gallery of suspects has been proposed to explain the
disasters, including fire, explosion, collision, old age,
navigational error, design flaws, structural failure and even
scuttling by owners so eager for insurance money that they don't
mind murdering their crews.
</P>
<P>
   The Derbyshire probes have identified a surprising culprit _
weak hatches that failed under storm stresses _ and have already
begun to shake up ship design worldwide, leading investigators to
hope that the long string of maritime disasters is at last coming
to an end. Marine authorities ``now have the evidence for the first
time,'' said Richard Pittenger, head of operations at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, which led the recent
Derbyshire probe. ``It will have a big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter thanking President Clinton for American aid, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain called the deep probe ``one of the
greatest feats of underwater detective work ever undertaken.'' The
results, he added, ``were amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings are also bringing some comfort to the families and
friends of sailors lost on the ship, whose pressure and protests,
carried on for years, finally provoked the British authorities to
act. Crew families say their main hope is that the investigations
improve the lot of all seafarers, who are often disregarded,
especially if they come, as many do, from poor countries like
Cyprus and Pakistan, Honduras and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a tanker goes aground, and sea creatures die, everybody
screams,'' said Paul Lambert, whose 19-year-old brother was lost on
the Derbyshire and who now heads the Derbyshire Family Association.
``But a bulk carrier goes down and nobody cares. It took a British
ship with a British crew and British families agitating about it to
highlight the fact that all these bulkers have been sinking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   THE SHIPS: A GLOBAL FLEET FOR RAW TRANSPORT
</P>
<P>
   Bulkers, as ships like the Derbyshire are known, haul dry
cargoes like ore, grain and coal around the globe. The work is
punishing and hazardous, especially for ships weakened by decades
of hard use. Life on oil tankers, freighters and even fishing boats
is safer. Few bulkers fly the American flag or carry American
crews, but thousands of the giant vessels are registered in
countries like Cyprus, Liberia and Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The Derbyshire was only four years old when she went down and
had won Lloyd's highest general rating. The 47-year-old captain,
Geoffrey V. Underhill, was a master mariner who had completed many
voyages. Besides, at 964 feet, the ship was one of the largest
afloat and was viewed as intrinsically very safe. As bulkers go,
she was comfortable _ each crewman had his own cabin and shower.
Wives were welcome, and two had joined what would be its last
voyage.
</P>
<P>
   After a stop in New York, the ship went to Canada and loaded up
thousands of tons of iron ore concentrates bound for Japan, where
they were to be turned into cars, ships and steel girders for
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   A typhoon intervened. Winds of up to 100 miles per hour drove
waves to heights of 60 to 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vessel hove to violent storm,'' the Derbyshire radioed hours
before she disappeared. The signal meant she was moving forward
just enough to maintain steerage way, struggling to keep her bow
into the waves, the safest pose in heavy seas.
</P>
<P>
   THE AGONY: FAMILIES PUSH FOR INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   After the Derbyshire vanished, family pain was especially sharp
for Peter Ridyard, whose son was on board. Ridyard was a ship
surveyor for the Salvage Association, a group based in London that
assesses damaged vessels for such insurance companies as Lloyd's of
London.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say his tireless hunt for the truth helped throw light
on the case. In particular, Ridyard warned that the Derbyshire and
sister ships might have structural flaws at a heavy wall that
separates engine from cargo spaces and lies astern, near the ship's
massive superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness at this spot, called frame 65, would leave the
Derbyshire and her sister ships prone to breaking in two, he
suggested, and that might explain why the ship had vanished so
quickly without any calls for help.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, his hunch strengthened as a sister ship ran aground on
Irish rocks and split in half near frame 65. But an inquiry drew no
firm conclusions, stating in 1989 only that the Derbyshire was
probably lost to rough weather.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point that Lambert of the family association
began saying that the Derbyshire sank twice _ first in bad weather,
then in a bucket of whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   But family members kept up their pressure and the International
Transport Workers' Federation, an umbrella group of labor unions,
hired Oceaneering Technologies, Inc., a Maryland company that has
worked for the American Navy, to find the ship. In 1994, during a
two-week expedition, the company succeeded, its robot surveying a
blur of scattered parts on the ocean floor, evidence of
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The families and union group concluded that the survey bolstered
the frame-65 theory and the evidence prompted British authorities
to step in. London conducted a preliminary survey in 1996 and found
the stern, including a large piece bearing the words ``Derbyshire''
and ``Liverpool.'' The next year, the Woods Hole team aided the
British effort by lowering a pair of robots to thoroughly map and
inspect the wreckage, snapping more than 137,000 pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than we've ever taken'' of any seabed area, said
Andrew Bowen, who led the Woods Hole team during a grueling
expedition that went 49 days and was interrupted by a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the probe was Jason, a seven-foot robot lowered on a
long tether into the deep. Built by Woods Hole and funded by the
Pentagon during the Reagan Administration's military buildup, the
$5 million robot has a mechanical claw, motors and many lights and
cameras that flash signals back to the surface through a long
fiber-optic cable, allowing investigators watching television
monitors to feel like they're flying across the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of strengthening the frame-65 theory, the work found
new evidence that put it asunder.

   MODESTO, Calif. _ After exhaustive searches and investigations
in the vicinity of the Yosemite National Park, FBI officials said
they have no hard evidence of what happened to a trio of sightseers
trio or the red Pontiac they were driving.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe Carole Sund, 42, her daughter, Julie,
15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a friend from Cordoba, Argentina, were
the victims of a violent crime and probably are dead.
</P>
<P>
   The only trace they appear to have left behind is Carole Sund's
wallet, which was found on a street in Modesto, about 80 miles west
of the Yosemite National Park, with the cash missing but credit
cards still inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI said only a miracle could bring them back,'' said
Raquel Pelosso, 43, the mother of Silvina. ``OK, then, I believe in
miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund and the two girls vanished Feb. 15 from the Cedar
Lodge, a restaurant and motel in El Portal on the western edge of
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, dozens of family members and volunteers in
Modesto worked to keep the search efforts alive, organizing a
Sunday vigil to call attention to the many families who have loved
ones who have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the perplexing case of the missing trio has
generated a flood of sympathy and concern from the public in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``People there are very upset,'' said Raul Guastavino, the
deputy Argentine consul in Los Angeles. ``This is a middle-class
family who sent a teen-age daughter to the United States, a place
we in Argentina perceive as being very safe. Now she's disappeared
under mysterious circumstances. It's a big story.''
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund, the husband of the missing woman, caused a media
frenzy on Wednesday, when he said the FBI had told him something
that left him ``devastated.'' Despite speculation about a big break
in the case, FBI agents have said they have no suspects in custody
and have not found the victims' bodies or their car.
</P>
<P>
   The families have offered a $250,000 reward for information
leading to their loved ones' safe return and a $50,000 reward for
information leading to the discovery of the car.

   THE DISCOVERY: WIDE EVIDENCE OF A NEW CULPRIT
</P>
<P>
   Frame 65 had never been a sole suspect. Forensic experts in
London had come up with 13 possible ways to explain the
Derbyshire's loss. Among the other suspects were explosion, fire,
engine failure and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The robot surveys eliminated most of them. Surprisingly and
unambiguously, moreover, the evidence also ruled out frame 65. It
showed that the tragedy had begun at the ship's bow rather than at
frame 65 near the stern.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Derbyshire, the team discovered, had been torn into
thousands of fragments. But not the bow, which after its fall had
plowed deep into the mud.
</P>
<P>
   As revealed by robotic floodlights miles down, the ghostly
intactness meant the bow had flooded slowly, allowing it to hold
its shape while sinking. By contrast, the other structures of the
ship had obviously plunged while full of air, imploding violently
under the crushing pressure of deep water.
</P>
<P>
   Robin A. Williams, a British maritime expert who led the
government assessment, said the team did find flaws in the remains
of frame 65, including alignment errors of more than an inch. In
some situations, he added, such flaws would be enough to cause
deadly fractures. But not in this case. ``It was not a contributory
factor,'' Williams said of frame 65.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible causes were also ruled out. Williams said there
were no signs of fire, explosion, foul play or the like.
</P>
<P>
   But there was wide evidence of other trouble. At the bow, many
ventilator heads were missing, seemingly torn off. And in the
wreckage, giant hatch covers nearly the size of basketball courts
lay shattered, twisted and bent, apparently pummelled by killer
waves. The team concluded that many protective covers at or near
ship's bow had failed, letting the sea in slowly at first, then
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Williams said in an interview, ``She sank because
the hatch covers failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment, written by Williams and his colleague Remo
Torchio, was laid out in an exhaustive report released last year in
London by the Department of Transport.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEATH THROES: A SLOW TIP TO A FAST END
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on all the evidence, the team came up with a
blow-by-blow view of the Derbyshire's final hours and minutes:
</P>
<P>
   As the typhoon raged, an unsecured forward hatch was lost,
letting water into a small bow storage space that filled in less
than an hour. Growing waves then smashed off ventilator heads. Over
12 hours or so, these openings let water flood such larger areas as
ballast tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The tons of added water left the Derbyshire sluggish and down by
the bow. But the ferocious winds and waves hid the peril. From the
pilothouse in the stern it would have been impossible to even see
the bow.
</P>
<P>
   A big wave or series of them then crashed over the ship and
smashed the metal cover of the first cargo hold. In less than a
minute, the report said, the big hold filled with 10,000 tons of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The Derbyshire was now doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The bow pitched down and huge waves pounded the deck, some
approaching the bridge. Masts were torn off and other hatch covers
exploded in succession under a barrage of towering waves, letting
more water rush in.
</P>
<P>
   As the ship sank, unflooded spaces imploded violently one by one
along the length of the vessel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the experts estimated that only two or three minutes
elapsed from the time the first cargo hatch failed to the
disappearance of the ship's stern beneath the waves. But the water
was so deep that Derbyshire's remains probably fell for an hour
before reaching the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATE: MONSTER WAVES AND STRUCTURAL FLAWS
</P>
<P>
   New light on the Derbyshire has not ended debate. Douglas
Faulkner, an expert on the assessor team, resigned in protest,
saying the inquiry had ignored the possibility of a more direct
assault on the bow by rogue waves as high as 115 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And some family members are still said to be suspicious of frame
65 and the possibility of major structural flaws.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the reopened inquiry is to have its first preliminary
meeting Tuesday. But experts say the enormous mass of evidence and
the testimony to come, including that from assessors and families,
will likely push the main proceedings deep into next year.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could have financial repercussions for the families
if serious negligence is found, British experts say. But family
sympathizers note that quick restitution is unlikely in a case
nearly two decades old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has done the right thing,'' said Mark
Dickinson, an official of the International Transport Workers'
Federation. ``Whether justice will be done is a bit more difficult
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   American experts praise the British probe as unique and
important, despite the lingering questions. ``It's a milestone,''
said H. Paul Cojeen, head of naval architecture at U.S. Coast Guard
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, British authorities so admire the American
deep-sea equipment that they want their own, in particular a
deep-diving robot. London is talking to Washington about jointly
developing one whose estimated cost is $2.5 million. The British
see it as vital for probing cargo ships that haul radioactive
waste. The British have a fleet of six such vessels and worry about
public reaction to a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one sank, we want to be capable of investigating it
quickly,'' said James F. Wall, a Department of Transport official.
``We take our responsibilities seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the British success with Derbyshire will prompt
more investigations of modern shipwrecks in deep water, said
William H. Garzke Jr., head of the marine forensics panel at the
Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, a professional
group in Jersey City, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   ``Naval architects can no longer say, `If a ship sinks, it's out
of sight, out of mind,''' he said. ``Now we can find the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of the Derbyshire is already helping bring wide
change in the bulk carrier industry, experts say. Most
significantly, new rules call for stronger hatch covers, especially
those closest to a ship's bow, where waves pound the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   In their assessment, Williams and Torchio called for ``urgent
review'' of many other potential safeguards, including stronger
ventilator heads as well as the use of forecastles or large
breakwaters to fend off waves. The International Maritime
Organization, a safety group chartered by the United Nations, ``is
already making serious moves to implement the recommendations,''
Williams said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert of the family association said the global reaction is
still inadequate. Changes of ship design, he said, are often
voluntary and apply only to new vessels, not the invisible fleets
of older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's looking at them,'' he said. ``They disappear and
nobody seems to care.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It looks eerily out of place. In a giant NASA wind
tunnel used to test components of advanced airplanes and spacecraft
sits a fragile looking biplane of wood and cloth: a replica of the
Wright brothers' aircraft that began the age of powered flight.
</P>
<P>
   Orville and Wilbur Wright's achievement on Dec. 17, 1903, when
their double-winged craft first made a short hop under its own
power at Kitty Hawk, N.C., is legendary. With Orville at the
controls and Wilbur running along side to steady the wing, the
plane rose 12 feet into the air and went about 120 feet on its
12-second flight.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how did this airplane work and why did it fly when
so many others before and after it failed?
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., are trying to answer
these questions while assisting a group of airplane buffs who want
to build and fly another replica of the Wright Flyer to commemorate
the 100th anniversary of the historic event in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Zell, test manager of the world's largest wind tunnel, said
engineers were using the full-scale replica to learn more about the
original plane's stability, control and handling to compile an
aerodynamic database of the flyer. ``I can't think of anything as
exciting as using modern technology to test an aerodynamic replica
of the biplane that Orville and Wilbur Wright flew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wrights were geniuses and did something unusual,'' said
Jack Cherne, an engineer with TRW Corp &UR; . &LR;  and the chairman of the
Wright Flyer Project, the builder of the replicas. ``But there is
little written that details what they accomplished, just their
notes, and they are not too technical. We want to document exactly
what they did and how they made their Flyer work.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is the work of a team of volunteers from the Los
Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, a professional association. Working on weekends for
several years, the volunteers used data on the original plane
supplied by the Smithsonian Institution to create the wind-tunnel
replica. The original Wright Flyer is on display at the
Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With a $20,000 treasury, donated parts and their labor, the
group constructed the 600-pound replica of spruce and fir and piano
wire with cotton covering for the wings. The duplicate is about 21
feet long and 8 feet high, with a wingspan of 40 feet 4 inches and
two spruce propellers, each 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, behind the
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Wind tunnel tests began on March 1 and are to be concluded this
week. To withstand the rigors of the tests, the duplicate has been
reinforced with aluminum spars that add weight to the craft but do
not affect its aerodynamic characteristics, the engineers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The replica is mounted in a section of the tunnel 80 feet wide
and 40 feet high on a pivoting strut that allows changes in its
up-and-down and side to-side headings as it flies at speeds
approaching 30 miles per hour. For safety reasons, the propellers
are turned at different speeds by an electric motor instead of the
internal combustion engine used on the original plane.
</P>
<P>
   Lying across the bottom wing of the open-air model is a
full-sized mannequin called Orville, dressed in a 1900s black suit,
shirt and tie with a hat glued to its head. ``He has to be there,''
said Craig Hange, a NASA wind-tunnel engineer conducting the tests.
``Back then, the man was part of the aerodynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tests are concluded, the replica will be taken to
Hawthorne, Calif., near Los Angeles, and permanently displayed in
the lobby of the Federal Aviation Administration's regional office
there.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Culick, an aeronautics professor at the California
Institute of Technology and a participant in the building project,
said the group would start building a flyable, near-replica later
this year using the wind-tunnel data, the plans for the original
Flyer and the experience of making the first replica. The plane is
to be finished by early 2003 so that it can be tested before
becoming part of the yearlong Wright celebration. Plans call for
the plane to be displayed in Dayton, Ohio, home of the Wright
brothers, in July, and taken to Kitty Hawk for a series of flights
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Culick, who will be the first of about 10 project members
scheduled to fly the plane, said an exact copy of the original
Flyer would be too unstable and dangerous to fly, particularly
multiple times. Although it may upset some purists, he said, the
new plane will have weights added in front to make it more stable,
more efficient controls, a more powerful engine and subtle
aerodynamic changes to make it more flyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to recreate the impression of the first flight
and do it repeatedly with some safety,'' said Culick, who will wear
a crash helmet and safety harness on his flights. ``We're going to
test fly it before going to Kitty Hawk, starting with taxi tests on
wheels. This is great fun, but no one wants to get killed doing
it.''

RESEARCHERS TRY TO CRACK MYSTERIES OF ENCEPHALITIS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dozens of cases of encephalitis are being
examined in depth at the California Department of Health Services,
where a project funded in part by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention is trying to find causes for the many cases
of encephalitis that defy explanation.
</P>
<P>
   There are few effective treatments for most cases of
encephalitis, and attempts to control it depend on knowing the
cause, said Jordan Tappero, epidemiological section chief for the
meningitis and special pathogens branch of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tappero is among the researchers seeking the causes of
unexplained deaths and serious illness that appear to be
infectious. A significant number of those cases are encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're ever going to develop prevention strategies, we're
going to need to know where these are coming from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Glaser, the doctor who runs the state-CDC encephalitis
project, hopes to construct a clearer picture of the puzzling
syndrome, which strikes about 20,000 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients will respond to drugs, and there are more
medications in development that could help future cases _ once
doctors figure how to diagnose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know, you don't know if you're missing something
that is treatable,'' Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis isn't a disease, but a syndrome triggered by brain
inflammation that can lead to headaches and seizures, personality
changes and the destruction of brain cells. It usually strikes
otherwise healthy people, making it especially heartbreaking in
many instances.
</P>
<P>
   While some people recover completely, many end up with permanent
brain damage, and some die.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases are linked to occasional insect-borne outbreaks, but
most are isolated. With few clues to go on, patients are sometimes
thought to be suffering from epilepsy, having a psychotic break or
overdosing on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even once encephalitis is diagnosed, doctors usually won't be
able to say why someone lapsed into a coma or began having
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rarely make a definitive diagnosis,'' said James Homans, a
Los Angeles pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The potential culprits are many, including the herpes virus,
which causes cold sores, genital lesions and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Either by direct infection or by setting off the immune system,
it can trigger one of the most destructive forms of encephalitis
that, untreated, kills 70 percent of its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis also can be brought on by bacteria, a fungus,
parasite or toxic chemical; a reaction to a vaccine; or even a
delayed immune response to an early childhood sickness.
</P>
<P>
   The patients featured in the film ``Awakenings'' were victims of
an epidemic in the 1920s of encephalitis lethargica, which left
tens of thousands of people with permanent brain damage. Its cause
was never definitively identified, and it was thought to have died
out. But a handful of potential new cases have cropped up in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a flu or other kind of virus already has left the body
when the immune system gears up to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it ends up going after the fatty protective sheath
around the nerves and brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparently what happened to Debra Caires' son, Jonathan,
four years ago. Two weeks after a bout with the flu, Jonathan, then
5, fell into a deep sleep and later lapsed into a coma. Once a
tidy, disciplined child, he came home from the hospital full of
uncontrolled impulsiveness. He also lost his ability to control his
bowels, and became the object of teasing at school.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Caires was a hospital employee and aspiring medical
student. She begged doctors for medical journal articles she could
read on encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Debra, there is nothing,''' Caires recalled. ``I
said, `You've got to be kidding.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her response was to form the National Encephalitis Foundation in
San Jose, Calif. The organization gets nearly 50,000 visitors a
month on its Web site from frustrated families worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times I just sit on the phone and cry with them. It's
such a horrible thing to go through,'' she said.

HUMOR COLUMNIST FOR THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, March 17)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 The Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I trust that you will give more weight to my words now that I
have designated myself the Official Humor Columnist of the New
Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   I am not absolutely sure that some other grasping, covetous,
opportunistic humor columnist in some other dismal backwater (I am
thinking specifically of certain disreputable individuals in
Honolulu and Kansas City) has not already proclaimed himself or
herself Official Humor Columnist of the New Millennium, but as is
the case with most things having to do with the millennium,
ignorance is bliss, so I am claiming the title for myself.
</P>
<P>
   As the Official Humor Columnist of the New Millennium, I'll have
lots of responsibilities, the specific nature of which I presume
will become apparent as time goes on. I'm imagining the job as
being something like Dan Quayle's when he was vice president: You
eat fancy dinners, play a lot of golf, give occasional speeches to
trade groups like the Velcro Manufacturers of Samoa or the
Cranberry League and say as many dumb things as you think are
necessary to preserve the indignity of the office.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about being the Official Humor Columnist of the
New Millennium is that it's not an elected office so you can kick
me out and replace me with someone more qualified, like, say, Dan
Quayle. The bad thing about it is that it doesn't come with a big,
fat salary, a fancy house or even Secret Service agents to clear
the road for me when I drive to the 7-Eleven for beer and lottery
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But what the position lacks in perks I trust it will make up for
in endorsements. Manufacturers of whoopee cushions and rubber
chickens will be among those hurling wads of cash in my direction
in exchange for a 15-second infomercial or perhaps a brief
appearance at a novelty store. It's more than an Ed McMahon
fantasy; imagine if Ed had named himself Official Sidekick of the
New Millennium. That's where I see this thing heading.
</P>
<P>
   I hear what you're saying. You're saying, ``Dave, how can I give
myself an absurd millennium-related trademark and subsequently
asphyxiate under the weight of a mountain of cash?''
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is you'd better get with it, and quick. Thousands
of lazy, greedy individuals such as ourselves have already sought
or received registered trademarks containing the word
``Millennium,'' and ``Year 2000'' and every combination and/or
derivation imaginable for a range of products and services that is
unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, for example, has already been trademarked as the
Official World Wide Brand of the Millennium. One might think that
would be enough, but Hugh Hefner was never one to think small, so
Playboy is also The Official Entertainment of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   (I have no idea how Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt
missed out on this. Perhaps he was too busy ratting out
congressional philanderers to think that far ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   You can ponder this, if your taste buds have atrophied, by
sipping the Official Beer of the Millennium (Miller), not to be
confused with the Official Beer of Y2K (Coors). I'm not sure what
the Coors people were thinking here, but if I'm in an airplane
flying at 35,000 feet when the Y2K bug strikes at midnight, Dec.
31, I'm going to want something stronger than beer; perhaps some
Beefeater gin, the Official Martini of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dechert Price &AMP; Rhoads (Official Humongous Law Firm
of the New Millennium), trademarks have been awarded for the Air
Freshener of the Millennium, the Die-Cast Collectibles of the New
Millennium, Fishing Tackle of the New Millennium and Food for the
New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Also be on the lookout for Microwave Popcorn for the New
Millennium, Self-Storage for the Millennium, Family TV for the New
Millennium, the Bedliner of the New Millennium, the Toothbrush for
the New Millennium and, of course, the Personal Injury Law Firm of
the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be the Official Snorer of the New Millennium or
designate your lawn the Crabgrass Capital of the New Millennium,
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Official Lunatic Federal
Bureaucracy of the New Millennium) is the place you want to
contact.
</P>
<P>
   It costs only $245 to apply for a trademark and spelling doesn't
count. (Nearly 90 people or companies have applied for
``millenium'' with only one ``n.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't even think of trying to become Official Humor
Columnist of the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   That baby is mine.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way: If you folks at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office haven't gotten my $245 yet, don't worry. My

A LOW-TECH SCREENING METHOD FOR CERVICAL CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

   Cervical cancer, curable if detected early, kills more women in
the developing world than any other cancer for the lack of a
simple, inexpensive and effective screening method. But researchers
in Zimbabwe believe they have found just that, in vinegar, a
trained eye and a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the current issue of The Lancet, researchers said
they simply swabbed a woman's cervix with acetic acid (vinegar) and
a minute later looked to see if some cells had turned white, an
indication of the presence of precancerous lesions caused by the
human papilloma virus.
</P>
<P>
   The technique itself is not new. Doctors used it before _ and
sometimes even after _ more sophisticated testing became widely
used in industrialized nations. In those countries, screening for
cervical cancer is done by examination of the cells of the cervix
after a Pap smear has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   But in less developed countries, this kind of screening may not
be available. Researchers estimate that only 5 percent of women in
developing countries are routinely screened for cervical cancer,
compared with 70 percent in industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the screening program really successful is not the
test itself but the ability to cover a lot of people with the
test,'' Dr. Paul D. Blumenthal, an author of the Lancet paper and
an associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns
Hopkins University. ``It provides immediate results in
hard-to-reach populations whether in a developing country or in
rural or center-city settings in the industrial world.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, cervical cancer kills 200,000 women each year, mainly
in Africa, Asia and Latin America, said the researchers. In the
United States, the disease led to 4,900 deaths last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-phase, cross-sectional study by the University of
Zimbabwe and a nonprofit reproductive health center affiliated with
Johns Hopkins, 10,934 women were screened by nurse-midwives in 15
primary-care clinics around Harare, the capital. Visual assessments
and Pap smears were done in both phases. In the first phase, if the
visual assessment suggested an abnormal condition, the woman
received a colposcopy (a microscopic examination). In the second
phase, all women had the colposcopy. The acetic acid test detected
more than 75 percent of potential cancers, although false-positives
in visual assessments were high in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
   American researchers see little application for the simpler
screenings here, though there are pockets of women who may not be
screened.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diane Solomon, senior investigator at the National Cancer
Institute, said, ``Most people who advocate the low-tech approach,
advocate it in areas where there is not the infrastructure of
cervical cytology. But I would not like to see a two-tiered
cervical screening system here with low-tech for people who can't
afford high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Carr Wright Jr., director of gynecological pathology
at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, who is working with a similar
project in South Africa, regards the study ``as another test to put
in our packet'' but believes the emphasis in the United States
should be on reducing the cost of the more sophisticated type of
screening.
</P>
<P>
   The human papilloma virus is sexually transmitted and is
sometimes associated with HIV infections. The Zimbabwe researchers
note that cervical cancer is developing at increasingly younger
ages and at a greater rate as the HIV virus damages immunity. The
papilloma virus grows slowly and may appear as warty lesions long
after exposure.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steve Forbes planned an unprecedented leap into
political cyberspace today by becoming the first presidential
candidate in U.S. history to formally announce his intentions via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a new, information-age campaign about
great ideas and enduring values,'' Forbes says in a statement to be
delivered live this morning (8:30 a.m. EST) on his campaign
website, http://www.forbes2000.com/.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to run the first full-scale presidential campaign in
American history on the Internet _ because I want you to be
involved every step of the way,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The closest any other candidate has come to Forbes' Internet
appearance occurred last month when Rep. John Kasich of Ohio
announced the formation of a committee to explore whether he should
run for the GOP nomination. C-SPAN, which provides coverage of
Congress and other public affairs events to cable TV systems around
the country, put Kasich's announcement on its website.
</P>
<P>
   Following his Internet appearance, Forbes planned to travel to
Concord, N.H., for a more traditional announcement of his candidacy
and an interview on America Online, the nation's largest Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' choice of the Internet as his forum underscored the
``Washington outsider'' theme he intends to use in this, his
second, attempt to win the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I are entering the information age _ and the
Washington politicians are stuck in the Stone Age,'' he says in his
statement. ``The problem is the Washington politicians don't get
it. They're wholly-owned subsidiaries of the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, 52, the multimillionaire head of his family's magazine
publishing business, is feared by some of the other GOP
presidential candidates, largely because of his personal wealth. In
1996, he poured millions into his campaign against Bob Dole for the
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is a very serious player because of his money,'' said
Charles Black, an informal adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the frontrunner for the 2000 GOP nomination. ``He's like a loose
cannon on the deck ... and he's got more cannon balls than anybody
in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's statement announcing his candidacy for the 2000
nomination invokes the name of former President Ronald Reagan, the
GOP's icon. ``Today marks the beginning of a national crusade to
restore Ronald Reagan's vision of hope and prosperity for all
Americans,'' Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement also contrasts slightly with the rhetoric of
his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Where Forbes pushed a flat tax four years ago, in his statement
today he is a bit more vague, calling simply for ``an honest,
simple tax code for a new century _ one that will put real money
back into the pockets of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   And where he largely avoided the issue of abortion in 1996, he
suggests today that ``the establishment politicians'' should not be
trusted to ``protect the first and most important freedom of every
child - the freedom to be born.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding any mention of his Republican opponents by name, Forbes
takes a couple of jabs at President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore, the frontrunner for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He says the Clinton-Gore administration is ``raiding'' Social
Security funds ``to pay for more big government spending.'' And he
vows that as president he would ``clean out the corruption and
sleaze'' of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   He also promises more parental control of schools, more freedom
to choose doctors and medical specialists and more economic
opportunity. ``It's time to give every American the freedom to
participate in this new era of prosperity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes adds that he also would seek to ``confront the atrocities
in China, end Saddam Hussein's reign of terror and deploy a
realistic missile defense system'' for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although he offers no specific proposals, Forbes also says
America's foreign policy must address the global economic crisis
and its affect on American farmers and steel producers. ``America
cannot afford to be an island of prosperity in an ocean of
poverty,'' he says.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell in the mountains east of Los Angeles early Monday at
elevations as low as 1,500 feet as a cold upper-level low-pressure
system came slowly ashore from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will develop Tuesday across parts of
Arizona and New Mexico as the lofty low drifts overhead. Isolated
thunderstorms are also possible across the high deserts of
southeast California. Snow will accumulate above 5,000 feet in
parts of the northern Arizona Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   East of the lethargic low, unseasonably warm weather will
embrace much of the Plains as a warm ridge of high pressure builds
northward from Texas. Temperatures may reach 70 degrees as far
north as Nebraska Tuesday afternoon, save for parts of Oklahoma,
Kansas and Missouri, where vestiges of snow left in the wake of the
storm that struck last week reflect and deplete warming rays of the
sun. The warm spell will be short-lived across the Plains, however,
as a cold front arrives Wednesday. In response, the seat of warmth
will shift to the Gulf Coast and Southeast states.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the heavy snow that blanketed parts of northern
New England Monday, a few areas of light snow will gradually
diminish over northern Maine as the culprit low-pressure system
moves over the Canadian Maritimes. Gusty winds from the northwest
averaging 20 to 30 miles per hour along the New England Seaboard,
will start to ease from Cape Cod northward. As the low over the
Canadian Maritimes lifts northeast Wednesday, milder air from the
south will begin to arrive in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snail's Pace
</P>
<P>
   Up to 10 inches of snow fell in the mountains of Santa Barbara
and Ventura counties of Southern California early Monday. Snow
continued into the afternoon as a cold, upper-level low-pressure
system pressed sluggishly eastward. Slow-moving upper-level lows
are a hallmark of spring weather patterns over the southern-tier
states. With the main branch of the steering winds of the jet
stream having typically retreated toward Canada, potent
disturbances, which might otherwise dislodge floundering
upper-level lows, pass by far to the north, allowing the low's
snail's pace to continue.

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Attorney General John Cornyn joined officials
from other states Monday in protesting a federal proposal to recoup
Medicaid costs from the $246 billion in settlements the tobacco
industry has reached with the states.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said federal claims on Texas' $17.3 billion settlement
should be dismissed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair, it's not the law, and this committee should
reject it,'' Cornyn told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, a Republican, joined Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, a
Democrat, and attorneys general from Iowa and Pennsylvania in
supporting an amendment by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, that
would block federal attempts to take a portion of the tobacco
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment could be heard as early as this week when the
Senate takes up a supplemental spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The states have reached out-of-court settlements with tobacco
companies in an effort to recover the costs of tobacco-related
illnesses paid through Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance
program for the need, disabled and low-income families with
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said a majority in the Senate favor
an administration compromise that would drop reimbursement of
Medicaid expenses if the states agree to spending 25 percent of
their settlements on anti-smoking and cessation programs aimed at
young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not for turning over all the money, carte blanche, to the
states,'' said Specter, the subcommittee chairman, who wants ``some
assurances'' that states spend a significant portion to curb
smoking among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison argued that the states have negotiated the
settlements without help from the administration or Congress, and
should now be free to spend the funds as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the states' money, and I don't think they need strings on
it,'' said Hutchison, whose bill has attracted 44 co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the nation's governors said one of their priorities
this year would be to protect the tobacco settlements from the
Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency seeking
Medicaid reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed waiving the federal government's
reimbursement claim, if the states agreed to spend a portion of the
money on various anti-smoking programs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could come before the entire Senate later this week
when it considers a supplemental spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison expects to move forward with her bill to block the
federal government from taking a 57-percent cut of the settlement _
its share of federal-state Medicaid payment formulas _ or imposing
regulations on how the states can spend their funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep from dictating to the states what they can
do with the money that they won fair and square,'' Hutchison told
Mike Hash, deputy administrator for the Health Care Financing
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Texas settled last year with the tobacco companies for $17.3
billion, to be paid over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the state would set aside $2.3 billion to compensate
counties and rural hospital districts for unreimbursed health care
costs. In addition, the state plans to spend $881 million for a
number of health-related programs, including the creation of a $200
million children's cancer ward at the University of Texas Health
Science Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the money the state has received so far has been
earmarked for health-related expenditure,'' Cornyn said.

COMMENTARY: OF NUKES AND SPOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (In 7thgraf, making it ``Spooks wonder if ....'' to fix grammar)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Absolutely no truth to it _ it's an outrageous
statement,'' fumed Sandy Berger, the first national security
adviser to regularly attend political campaign meetings in the
White House. ``It's wrong ... not based on any facts whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to Tim Russert's quotation on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' of my assertion of connections among: (a) the Clinton-Gore
fund raising from admittedly illegal Asian sources, followed by our
stunning turnabout in trade policy; (b) the uncleared access to the
White House by a high Chinese military intelligence official; (c)
the Clinton decision, accompanied by huge campaign contributions by
a satellite manufacturer, to switch regulation of technology
transfer to his anything-goes Commerce Department, and (d) the
years of foot-dragging by the Clinton National Security Council
when confronted by evidence that China had stolen nuclear secrets
from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Berger would have us believe that these are not facts, and if
they are, they are wholly unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   It would be outrageous indeed to suggest that American officials
were consciously betraying our national interest. But the
confluence of these facts in election year 1996 _ combined with the
urge to disregard or derogate any intelligence that would stop the
political blessings of a ``strategic partnership'' with China _ led
to President Clinton's denial of a dangerous penetration.
</P>
<P>
   A few questions to the committees holding closed hearings this
week:
</P>
<P>
   The White House line is that Congress was adequately briefed on
this 17 times. If true, were the intelligence ``Big Four'' properly
forewarned and did they then fail in their oversight
responsibilities? Rep. Chris Cox tells me no: ``Our committee
expressly found the administration failed to comply with National
Security Act requirements for keeping Congress informed. To claim
otherwise is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Spooks wonder if the FBI office in New Mexico that bungled the
Edward Howard capture fumbled again in 1995 by taking a full year
to react to evidence of heavy theft. Others suggest that Beijing,
eager to intimidate us in the Taiwan Strait, wanted us to know it
had our W-88 nuclear-warhead technology. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Justice Department's intelligence surveillance
policy staff, which reports directly to Janet Reno, deny the FBI
authority to tap the telephone of its suspect, Wen Ho Lee, at Los
Alamos in 1995? This was no mere Mafia drug bust; a Chinese
document showed our most vital national-security secrets were
threatened. Over three years, did FBI Director Louis Freeh protest
to Reno about this leave-him-alone decision?
</P>
<P>
   Why has Berger &AMP; Co. repeatedly stressed that ``other countries,
including friendly countries,'' spied on us? Is this the spin
machine's not-so-sly way to get supporters of Israel in the
Congress and the media to shut up and back off?
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of Department of Energy intelligence, Notra
Trulock, says he was ordered not to inform Congress of his
suspicions, but his boss, Elizabeth Moler, disputes this. Whose
story will change under oath?
</P>
<P>
   Why, if Secretary Bill Richardson were so ``seized of'' this
secret issue last August when he was named, did he demote the
expert, Trulock, and put in charge a CIA man from his U.N. embassy
staff _ Larry Sanchez _ who knew nothing about the agency's worst
problem?
</P>
<P>
   Does Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying, daughter of a top Chinese general,
provide a link between the stealing of secrets at our national
laboratories in the '80s and the purchase of secrets from our
American satellite and computer manufacturers in the '90s? Did a
U.S. company help China widen the acquisition envelope of its SA-12
anti-aircraft missile by 20 degrees, and are Air National Guard
F-16 pilots now being briefed on their new danger?
</P>
<P>
   Is it true that even now, tens of thousands of e-mail messages
every month flow out of our national laboratories at Sandia and Los
Alamos _ but our National Security Agency's Big Ear fails to
monitor them?
</P>
<P>
   Is Berger telling the public the same story he told the Cox
committee under oath? If so, why was Clinton denied knowledge from
1995 to 1997 about this most damaging atomic spy coup since the
Rosenbergs? Isn't a president entitled to such information before
proposing a ``strategic partnership''? Or did Clinton really know?
</P>
<P>
   But to pose these questions is outrageous.

CONGRESS CONSIDERS Y2K LIABILITY LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., S.C. )  (fb) 
 BY SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 N.Y. Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the millennium just a few pages of the
calendar away, lawmakers have caught the Y2K bug, looking for ways
to help businesses stave off potential computer problems and also
limit what could be a wave of costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, House members and senators stand to benefit from
a windfall of campaign contributions as computer companies, trial
lawyers, high-tech firms and small-business owners step up their
presence on Capitol Hill and battle over who is to blame should
computers crash when 2000 rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's a lot at stake with Y2K legislation and
everybody wants to get an edge,'' said Holly Bailey, a researcher
at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the flow of
money on Capitol Hill and in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The potential millennium problem stems from the fact that most
computer programs read the last two digits of a year to register
the date. That means that 2000 could be read as 1900, throwing
various time-sensitive data banks into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, lawmakers have rallied around efforts to give
small-business owners low-interest loans so they can find solutions
to the feared computer bug. One bill even calls for a one-time
national holiday on Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, so corporate America
would have one more day to work on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of liability has emerged as the most
contentious issue of the Y2K debate. Big business wants Congress to
pass a bill that limits the amount of damages anyone could collect
because of a Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, John McCain, R-Ariz., is pushing the Y2K Act, a
bill, strongly supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that does
just that. The Commerce Committee, which he chairs, recently
approved his bill on a party-line vote. Other bills would limit the
amount of money attorneys could collect in any lawsuits stemming
from the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Trial Lawyers of America opposes such legal
limits, and a nasty battle is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Each side accuses the other of greed and selfishness. Corporate
executives describe lawyers as opportunists looking to cash in on a
costly problem, while trial attorneys say big business is just
trying to avoid responsibility for a problem it could have avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wooten, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
Institute for Legal Reform, predicted that there would be a
``litigation explosion'' with businesses suing each other, and
consumers dragging companies into court unless Congress acts to put
some limits in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race to the courthouse will begin,'' Wooten predicted.
</P>
<P>
   To which, Mark Mandell, president of the Association of Trial
Lawyers of America, said, in effect, so what.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely astounding that these people can create a
crisis out of their own wrongdoing,'' Mandell said, noting that the
potential of a Y2K glitch has been known for years. ``And instead
of fixing it, they're trying to deny people their rights ... Why
should they be immune from lawsuits?''
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers did not help their image, however, at a recent
annual convention of the American Bar Association where some
members spoke enthusiastically about the business opportunities the
Y2K problem could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clinton administration and many Democrats opposed the
idea of providing any sort of immunity to the business community.
They argue it would set a bad precedent and discourage companies
from fixing potential computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., the top Democrat on the Commerce
Committee, described McCain's bill as ``little more than an effort
to protect big businesses from their responsibility to ensure that
their products work on Jan. 1, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In this legislative fight, attorneys and businesses will not
weigh in only with words, however. Through political action
committees and individuals, business interests and the legal
community have long contributed to congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, trial attorneys and high-tech companies have
favored Democrats, while corporate America has long been a strong
donor base for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, computer
companies donated $8.8 million to political parties and candidates
during the 1997-98 election cycle, more than doubling what they
gave in the last midterm elections. The Association of Trial
Lawyers of America donated $2.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   If past is prologue, both sides are expected to increase their
donations as Congress considers legislation with costly
implications for both sides.

DON'T MISS OUT ON CHILD TAX CREDIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has been getting the word out that
many taxpayers are missing a tax break _ the new child tax credit _
that could sharply cut their tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   That's good advice. If you qualify for this break, which applies
if you support a child, grandchild, stepchild, adopted child or
foster child who is under age 17, it can mean a credit of up to
$400 per child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very straightforward for the vast majority of
taxpayers,'' said Henry Holmes, spokesman for the Internal Revenue
Service in Houston. ``It's when you get to the higher income and
lower income levels where the confusion sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that the IRS is changing a number of returns where
taxpayers failed to claim this tax break shows there is a lot of
confusion. A lot of people may be missing this new break because
they confuse it with the child and dependent care credit.
</P>
<P>
   The child and dependent care credit applies to expenses you
incur in caring for your child, such as day care. The new child tax
credit doesn't require any spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child tax credit is something you're entitled to, simply
by virtue of having the child,'' said Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   To get the child tax credit, you must file a 1040 or 1040A tax
form.
</P>
<P>
   You should indicate on the front of the 1040 or 1040A form that
you have a dependent who was under age 17 at the end of 1998. You
enter that information on line 6c of both the 1040 and 1040A forms.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to include the Social Security number of each
qualifying child on the return. You need this because the break
only applies if the child is a U.S. citizen or resident.
</P>
<P>
   The credit begins to phase out when your income is $75,000 for a
single taxpayer, or $110,000 for couples filing a joint return. To
calculate the credit, use the Child Tax Credit worksheet. You don't
have to submit this form with your tax return, but keep it for your
records.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the credit amount on line 43 of the 1040 form or line 28
of the 1040A form.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAW HAS SOME TWISTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As always, this new tax law comes with some twists.
</P>
<P>
   If you have two children or fewer, you won't be able to claim
the child tax credit if you don't owe any tax for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the credit is larger than your annual tax liability,
your credit is limited to your total tax unless you have more than
two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most taxpayers are going to multiply the number of qualifying
children they have and get the full credit for that amount,''
Holmes said. ``Where the wrinkles come in is if your income exceeds
a certain amount. Then you have to do some additional computation
to figure out the reduction of your credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is a tax credit, which is better than a tax
deduction because it reduces your tax liability on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. A deduction reduces the amount of income
that is subject to taxation. That means if you're in the 28 percent
tax bracket, for every $100 you can deduct, you're saving $28 in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit can't be larger than your total tax bill for the
year. ``A taxpayer with two children and a tax liability of $500
would only qualify for a $500 child tax credit,'' Holmes said. ``If
this same taxpayer had no tax liability, he would not qualify for
any child tax credit.''
</P>
<P>
   This limit does not apply if you have more than two children.
Then, your tax credit can exceed your tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress figures if you've got families out there who are
low-income and they've got three children, they need extra relief,
more so than that family with just two children,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DO YOU QUALIFY? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether you can get the additional credit, you must
complete child tax credit worksheets in the instruction packet that
came with the 1040 and 1040A forms. You also must complete form
8812, called Additional Child Tax Credit, and attach it to your
1040 or 1040A form.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an additional credit on line 11 of form 8812, carry
it to line 60 of the 1040 form or line 38 of the 1040A form.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Social Security (tax) payments will increase the amount
of child tax credit, but high earned-income tax credit will
decrease the amount of child tax credit,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the IRS really wants you to get this credit
if you qualify.
</P>
<P>
   If the IRS can verify the ages of your children through their
Social Security numbers, it will calculate the credit for you and
send you a refund check.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IRS can't verify the ages of your children, it will
send you a notice telling you that you may qualify for the child
tax credit and to file an amended return to claim the tax break.

CHINESE LEADER PREDICTS CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Less than a month before he leaves for a state visit
to the United States, China's blunt-speaking prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, laid out his agenda Monday for what promises to be a
turbulent trip, saying the two nations would continue to cooperate
despite renewed friction on issues ranging from human rights to
charges that China stole nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it will not be easy for me to go to the United
States in such an atmosphere,'' Zhu said at a news conference. But
he quickly added: ``My goal is to let you vent your anger and
complaints and to tell you the truth. And to regain the momentum of
building a strategic partnership between China and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unscripted 90-minute meeting with reporters after the
adjournment of China's Parliament, Zhu covered a range of topics
including his country's plans to further open its markets, the
arrest of pro-democracy advocates, and China's unyielding
opposition to a proposed regional missile-defense system that could
potentially include Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   None of the positions presented by Zhu were entirely new,
although some fresh tidbits were offered, like China's willingness
to relax restrictions on foreign investment in its banking sector.
More important, the news conference was the first time that many
positions had been stated directly by one of China's top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And Zhu's matter-of-fact style made the many serious conflicts
percolating between the two nations seem more like spats between
old friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, the U.S. Congress has accused China of
stealing American nuclear secrets, trying to smuggle military
hardware out of the United States and violating a U.N. Human Rights
Covenant it signed just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu acknowledged that relations between Beijing and Washington
had lost ``momentum'' since President Clinton's ebullient state
visit to China last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But his underlying theme, that the two nations could cooperate
despite their considerable differences, echoed that of Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright when she visited Beijing last month. And
in general, Zhu's statements were more measured than recent Chinese
government pronouncements, which have lambasted the United States
as ``hypocritical'' on human rights and denounced spying charges as
fabrications by enemies of China.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference was broadcast live, just after China's
Parliament approved a host of reports and constitutional amendments
sponsored by the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Parliament inevitably passes such motions by huge margins,
debates at committee meetings have become increasingly lively. And
this year's meeting provided some unusual excitement as two
government reports on China's legal system presented a frank
picture of widespread abuse and corruption. A constitutional
amendment that elevated the status of the private sector was at
least a symbolic victory for China's emerging business class.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Zhu's meeting with reporters that carried the day.
Zhu is regarded here as the chief sponsor of China's most recent
wave of economic reforms. But Monday's session provided a glimpse
of how he handles foreign relations, less familiar waters that he
will have to navigate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu scoffed at the spying charges that have riveted both the
U.S. Congress and media: that a Taiwan-born scientist passed on
secret information enabling China to modernize its nuclear arsenal.
The charges both underestimate the American government's ability to
keep secrets and Chinese scientists' ability to make discoveries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is fully capable of developing any military
technology,'' he said. ``It's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said the charges had grown out of ``internal struggles in the
United States.'' Evoking the McCarthy era in the United States and
China's Cultural Revolution, he added that both countries had known
``periods where everyone was afraid of being accused by everyone
else, and we should never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's mood turned more serious as he discussed proposals for the
United States and Japan to build a missile defense system for East
Asia that might eventually include Taiwan. He dismissed American
news reports that China has 600 missiles trained on Taiwan. ``How
could they know that?'' he said. ``Even I don't know that!''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years after Chinese Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan,
Beijing still regards the island as a renegade province and
American military aid there as interference in China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also rehearsed answers to the human rights questions that
will certainly come up during next month's trip. Although Chinese
officials have long insisted that human rights policies are
strictly internal affairs, Zhu expressed what appears to be at
least a superficial willingness to hear opposing views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome foreign friends to criticize us in our work, but
don't be impatient,'' he said, noting that he has grown accustomed
to ``friends from abroad pulling out lists'' of pro-democracy
activists whom they want released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   But as Zhu briefly lit into such activists Monday, it was clear
that the two sides shared little common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu was clearly most at home when the talk returned to economic
policy, where he reiterated that the government would not devalue
its currency and would no longer prop up insolvent companies.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of China's renewed eagerness to get into the World
Trade Organization this year. American and Chinese officials are
now negotiating furiously to this end, in the hopes that even a
embryonic deal will provide a happy note to what many expect could
be a dissonant visit to America.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Zhu suggested that China would now be willing to
open its telecommunications and banking sectors somewhat to gain
admission _ a tantalizing prospect for foreign investors _ though
he refused to go into details.
</P>
<P>
   He said that after years of discussion, the two sides had
recently made substantial progress, although differences remained.
``The black hair has turned gray, and it's time to conclude these
negotiations,'' he said.

<P>
   Sure, with St. Patrick's Day on Wednesday you may be yearning to
make some wee connection, searching the closet for that Kelly green
necktie or trying to remember the lyrics to ``Did Your Mother Come
From Ireland?'' But even if your mother (italics)did(end italics)
come from Ireland, your authenticity credentials may pale beside
those of the McCourt brothers, New York's reigning jacks of
heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt laid out his family's moving story in the Pulitzer
Prize-winning memoir ``Angela's Ashes.'' His brother Malachy had
his own tale to tell in ``A Monk Swimming.'' A revival of the
brothers' autobiographical theater piece, ``A Couple of
Blaguards,'' is currently running in Manhattan. And Tuesday night
brings two opportunities to visit the melancholy McCourts via
television.
</P>
<P>
   Cinemax is presenting a documentary, ``The McCourts of New
York,'' directed by Malachy's son Conor. Public television
stations, including WNET in New York, are showing ``The Irish ...
and How They Got That Way,'' Frank's hybrid of revue and history
lesson that ran and ran at the Irish Repertory Theater in Chelsea.
Both have an amateur quality that may tax the viewer's patience.
But both come wrapped in the earnest McCourt charm.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have not read the books or seen ``The McCourts of
Limerick,'' Conor McCourt's earlier film about the brothers' youth,
the documentary will introduce these sons of the long-suffering
Angela McCourt, a woman burdened by a heartless husband and haunted
by the death of an infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, born in New York but reared in his parents' native
Ireland, returned to America alone at 19 and became a teacher and
writer. Malachy came next, becoming, among other things, an actor
and the host at a Manhattan bar. In their shadow dwelt two more
brothers, Mike, who once tended bar for Malachy, and Alphie, who
came over with their mother in 1959. She died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   All four men, whose weathered faces define the phrase ``sadder
but wiser,'' share their memories in scenes that sound like
psychotherapy sessions and look like home video, shot in the United
States, Ireland and India, where Malachy gleefully retraces the
steps of a gold smuggling caper he survived between careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're doing this,'' Frank says of
re-exploring the past, ``when most people are content to let it
be.'' They go back anyway, with occasional glimpses of snapshots to
prove that the brothers once were younger and slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives were all tinged with pain, much of it associated
with alcohol, one of the demons that gripped their detested father,
also named Malachy. ``The booze got in the way,'' says Mike, who
lost his job behind the bar when ``I began to be too much of a good
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   One piece of family history does unfold movingly before the
camera. The four brothers, along with members of the family's later
generations, make a pilgrimage to the pauper's grave in Queens
where baby Mary Margaret McCourt was buried in the 1930s. The four
white-haired men place a marker with her name and slip a shard of
their mother's bone into the soil, reuniting mother and daughter, a
sad duty of these survivors, battered but standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what we came from,'' Frank says about his family,
``we haven't done so badly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking about all his countrymen in America,
which is what he did in ``The Irish ... and How They Got That
Way.'' But while his book elevated life's daily trials to the level
of the historic, his stage show reduces the sweep of history to the
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   The show is an often angry history lecture with songs, delivered
by an attractive, energetic cast of six. The anger is well earned.
The Irish, so badly treated by the English, were hardly welcomed to
their new country:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Irish came to America, one 19th-century immigrant
observed, because they thought that the streets were paved with
gold. But when we got here, we found out that not only weren't they
paved with gold, they weren't paved at all. Furthermore we were
expected to pave them, which we did.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is leavened with a little humor (an Irishman's marriage
proposal: ``Mary, how'd you like to be buried with my people?'')
and lots of familiar music, including the tenor Ciaran Sheehan's
lovely if inevitable performance of ``Danny Boy.'' But the glib
message that the Irish suffered and died so the world could have
George M. Cohan, James Cagney and John F. Kennedy doesn't do
justice to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The production was videotaped at the Irish Rep with its original
cast. The camera cannot capture the live show's intimacy; the stage
lighting and stagey gestures and speeches do not translate well to
video. Still, there is plenty of heart here, and it does come
through. And if Frank McCourt remains more teacher than showman, he
does support his show's thesis, ``It's not easy being Irish.''
Nothing worth being ever is. &QL;

INDIAN POLITICIAN CHARGED WITH ATTACK ON ACCOUNTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Jayalalitha Jayaram, the former movie star
who is one of India's most politically powerful and dependably
outlandish figures, faced charges Monday that she had thrashed her
former accountant with high-heel shoes, beating him black and blue
during an hourlong ordeal and leaving him bedridden with a bandaged
right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha, as she is known here, denies that any such attack
took place. ``I am too cultured to indulge in such an uncivilized
act,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   She sent flowers to the hospitalized auditor, R. Rajasekaran,
who refused the bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say they are investigating the incident, said
to have occurred in Jayalalitha's elegant residence in Madras on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, Rajasekaran's bizarre story was front-page news
Monday in India _ a grand entertainment for some and an acute
embarrassment for others.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha heads the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam,
the political party that is the largest coalition partner of the
Hindu nationalists who lead the government.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the government have frequently had to mollify
Jayalalitha during her many threats to abandon the coalition. They,
in turn, have come under severe criticism for what some here view
as improper efforts to help her escape from numerous criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government transferred various corruption cases
against the former actress away from the special state courts that
had been handling them.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from the early 1990s, when Jayalalitha was
chief minister of the state of Tamil Nadu. During that time she
reportedly accumulated a fortune through kickback schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually clad in a flowing cape, Jayalalitha is known for
ostentatious displays of wealth and a large appetite for fealty.
Followers often bow when greeting her. Campaign posters have
portrayed her as a Hindu goddess. She is feared.
</P>
<P>
   And Rajasekaran is among the fearful. ``They threatened to kill
me if I spoke up,'' the injured man anxiously told reporters at his
bedside.
</P>
<P>
   He had been Jayalalitha's accountant for 10 years until they had
a falling-out in 1997, he explained. He said he was surprised to be
summoned to her residence on Saturday, where the former chief
minister met him along with her long-time companion, Sasikala
Natarajan, and Ms. Natarajan's nephew, M. Mahadevan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sasikala came into the room, she bolted the door from
inside and took two shoes with high heels from a plastic bag,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women hammered at him with the spiked shoes while Mahadevan
used a stick. ``Unable to bear the pain, I cried for mercy,'' the
accountant said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from the assault, with hands swollen from the blows,
Rajasekaran was then made to write and sign statements that
admitted his responsibility for lapses in the two women's tax
returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Jayalalitha called the allegations a complete
lie intended to disparage her. She said she suspects that her
political arch-rival, Tamil Nadu's current chief minister, Muthuvel
Karunanidhi, was behind this ``sinister conspiracy''
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha's supporters Monday demanded the right to stage a
protest in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's Parliament.
When refused the floor, they angrily walked out.

TEXAS CAN DO MORE TO FIGHT DRUNKEN DRIVING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the most emotional issues in any
legislative session is the fight against drunken driving, and this
year's chapter started unfolding last week.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of four teen-age girls, who died Dec. 19 after a pickup
crashed into their car in North Texas, lined a table at the front
of the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   So did their grieving parents and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, all
making a strong pitch for legislation to lower the legal
intoxication limit for drivers from .10 percent to .08 percent
blood alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, a Senate committee unanimously approved the
bill, which also is strongly supported by Gov. George W. Bush and
will likely become law this session.
</P>
<P>
   Would the proposed law have saved the four girls' lives? Nobody
knows for sure, but an argument can be made _ and opponents of the
bill certainly are making it _ that it probably wouldn't have.
That's because the driver of the pickup, who faces charges of
intoxication manslaughter, allegedly had a blood alcohol content
exceeding the more permissible .10 percent when the wreck occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But that argument misses the point. The point is that drunken
driving still produces multiple tragedies in Texas, and the
Legislature can do more to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the intoxication limit is an important step. So is a
proposal to ban open containers of alcohol from motor vehicles, a
perennial bill that also may have a reasonable shot at winning
lawmakers' approval this year.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tougher laws may argue that it is unrealistic
or just flat wrong for the Legislature to try to regulate personal
behavior. But no one has an unfettered right to operate a motor
vehicle on public streets and highways. If people did, the courts
would have thrown out driver's license and insurance requirements _
and even speed limits _ a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Government has a responsibility, within constitutional limits,
to safeguard the public safety, and laws against driving while
intoxicated are part of that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol-related auto deaths have generally been decreasing in
recent years, in part because of tougher penalties imposed by
lawmakers and public awareness campaigns by groups such as Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, or MADD. Improved safety features in cars
and on highways also may have contributed.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas remains a problem state. Some 1,748 people were killed
in alcohol-related crashes in Texas in 1997, the last year for
which complete data are available. Not all those accidents were
actually caused by drunken drivers, but many were.
</P>
<P>
   Helping lead the fight against the lower intoxication limit is
the American Beverage Institute, a trade association of the
restaurant industry, whose members fear that they will sell fewer
drinks and lose money wherever the .08 limit is imposed.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement distributed in Austin, Rick Berman, a
lawyer for the institute, said .08 laws, which 16 other states
already have, don't work because they merely punish ``responsible
social drinkers'' who usually aren't involved in fatal auto
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that most alcohol-related fatalities involve drivers
with blood alcohol contents of .10 or higher. But a scientific
study of traffic deaths in California, Maine, Oregon, Utah and
Vermont _ the first five states to lower their intoxication limit
to .08 _ showed that the law does work.
</P>
<P>
   According to that study, those five states had an overall
reduction of 16 percent in the proportion of crashes with a fatally
injured driver whose blood alcohol content was .08 or higher and an
18 percent reduction in crashes with a fatally injured driver whose
blood alcohol content was .15 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher DWI laws won't keep problem drinkers and irresponsible
drivers from getting behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the restaurant industry's protest, ``responsible''
people don't knowingly violate the law. And if a .08 limit would
make a motorist think twice before ordering that extra drink, so
much the better for that person and everyone else he or she may
encounter on the road while driving home.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Legislature enacted a law to ban drinking
while driving in Texas. But it is extremely difficult to enforce
because a police officer actually has to observe a driver drinking
alcohol. And their jobs haven't been made any easier by convenience
stores that provide a brown paper bag to customers who purchase a
single can of beer.
</P>
<P>
   A law banning open containers of alcohol from the entire
passenger compartment of a vehicle, which also is pending before
lawmakers, may or may not reduce traffic deaths, but it is worth a
try.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a popular misperception to the contrary, a motorist
doesn't have a constitutional right to drink a beer on the way home
from work, and neither does his or her passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to crack down on drunken drivers after they have
killed people, but it is more important to try to prevent tragedies
in the first place.

SPAIN'S FILMMAKERS ON THE VERGE OF A CIVILITY BREAKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 BY AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ When ``The Grandfather'' won an Oscar nomination
last month as best foreign-language film, there was a sense of
vindication for its director, Jose Luis Garci, who has been locked
in a nasty credibility battle with Spain's film establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Garci, who won a foreign-film Oscar in 1983 for ``Begin the
Beguine,'' has attacked the leaders of the Spanish film academy as
``fascist'' for not fully clearing his name after allegations of a
vote-buying scheme for Spain's top film awards, the Goyas.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous letter was sent in December to most of the 771
voting members of the Spanish Academy of Cinematic Arts and
Sciences saying that Garci's aides would personally collect the
ballots, which are supposed to be mailed directly to a Madrid
notary. Garci has denied any connection to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   It is the biggest scandal ever for Garci and for the 13-year-old
Spanish academy, which some industry veterans regard as a clubby
institution whose members have more than once snubbed
internationally known Spanish directors like Pedro Almodovar.
</P>
<P>
   The academy insisted in two communiques in January that the
matter was settled when no proof emerged of vote buying or improper
back-room pressure to win votes. The academy dropped the matter,
although its president agreed to consider a stricter code of ethics
on voting.
</P>
<P>
   But for Garci that was not enough, and he abruptly quit the
academy before its Jan. 23 awards ceremony here. ``The
Grandfather'' won just one Goya statuette, for best actor, after
being nominated in 13 categories, including best picture and best
director.
</P>
<P>
   Garci said the results demonstrated that he did not buy votes.
His lawyers are seeking a more definitive statement from the
academy absolving him of any misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can play with a person's honor,'' said
Garci, 55, a compact, dark-haired man. ``I want a full reparation
of the damage, and I hope to get it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Garci and others said that fierce commercial pressures, and
perhaps pure envy, may have inspired the anonymous letter.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal arose after the Spanish film industry had reached
cruising speed, with high-quality movies and wide popularity after
years of hard work. In 1997, Spanish moviegoers bought some 13
million tickets to domestic films, accounting for $52 million in
box-office receipts, roughly double the numbers from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grandfather,'' the story of an aristocrat's search to
discover which of his two putative granddaughters resulted from an
extramarital affair by his daughter-in-law, got off to a good start
in October when Spain's academy designated it for a foreign Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   It then became one of the American academy's foreign finalists,
an honor that Garci has now achieved with four of his films, more
than any other Spanish director.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, the Spanish academy announced the finalists
for its Goyas, and ``The Grandfather'' was second in nominations
behind ``The Girl of Your Dreams,'' by Fernando Trueba. He is the
only Spanish director besides Garci to have won a foreign Oscar,
for ``Belle Epoque,'' in 1994. (The Spanish director Luis Bunuel
won in 1972 for ``The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' but as a
nominee from France, where he lived in exile.)
</P>
<P>
   The anonymous letter appeared soon after the announcement of the
Goya finalists and, Trueba said, it cast a ``shadow of doubt'' over
all of the competitors. ``I would have preferred not to have been
in competition this year,'' Trueba said. ``It wasn't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trueba's film won the Goya as best picture and six other
prizes, and the film's producer, Andres Vicente Gomez, called Garci
a coward for not attending the awards ceremony, although Garci
apologized the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Gomez strongly criticized the anonymous letter, but he
said Garci may have contributed to the controversy by ``taking the
role of the victim and trying to promote his film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The epilogue to the story is that `The Grandfather' got the
Oscar nomination,'' Vicente Gomez said. ``This compensates
everything. I wish him luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery remains over who sent the letter to the academy
members. ``We'd need Philip Marlowe to find out,'' said Garci,
referring to the Raymond Chandler's fictional Los Angeles
detective. Various rumors have swept Madrid about the letter's
author.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Garci may have been singled out as a target for having
been perceived as cuddling up to the conservative government But he
pointed out that some of his earlier films had anti-Franco themes,
like ``Begin the Beguine,'' the story of a Spaniard in exile after
the Civil War who wins the Nobel Prize in literature.
</P>
<P>
   While the harsh words have waned, the wounds do not appear to be
fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   After ``The Grandfather'' became an Oscar finalist, the film's
leading actress, Cayetana Guillen Cuervo, who is Garci's romantic
off-screen partner, told the Spanish daily El Pais: ``Now some
people will have to shut up. Or did we buy the American academy,
too?''

WHITE HOUSE TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If President Clinton had heeded former White House
press secretary George Reedy's advice, he would not have let George
Stephanopoulos into his inner circle to invade his privacy and
betray his trust.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted by the competing egos and circular intrigues of Lyndon
Johnson's chaotic White House, Reedy concluded that no one should
be permitted to work for a president until he or she was at least
40 years old and well-seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Young folks, the middle-aged Reedy felt, were not yet adequately
equipped with experience and maturity to serve responsibly and
dispassionately in the heady, high-pressure environment that
inevitably surrounds a president. Stephanopoulos was only 30 when
he went to work for Clinton, where he eventually became living
confirmation of the soundness of Reedy's theory.
</P>
<P>
   In his self-serving, harshly judgmental book ``All Too Human'',
Stephanopoulos concedes that Clinton finally figured this out for
himself, regretting the hiring of too many wide-eyed young
assistants who were ``smart but not wise.'' Of course no staffer
brought such disgrace on the institution as Clinton himself, but
several public embarrassments could have been avoided had he been
given better advice.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, as Reedy knew, is no place for idealism and
selfless devotion, qualities Stephanopoulos claims to have
initially held before he realized Clinton's flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It is inevitably a hotbed of seething staff ambition, in which
pandering to the chief occupant in pursuit of reflected glory
becomes more important than thoughtful decision-making or
commitment to principle. And its intimate institutional nature
exposes a president and first lady _ ANY president and first lady _
to the kind of close-up scrutiny that allows little privacy and
room for imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos was an eager player in the inner game, elbowing
his way to Clinton's side and clinging like a limpet until Clinton
became disenchanted with his aide's loose tongue and political
miscalculations. Stephanopoulos fled his mentor before he could be
shoved out the door, capitalizing on his White House credentials in
a new role as television commentator and author of a $2.75 million
tell-all book.
</P>
<P>
   Now he makes money pontificating as the insider he no longer is
_ or ever will be again unless some other big league politician is
foolish enough to want a smart-aleck blabbermouth at his side.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, beyond a few anecdotes, Stephanopoulos doesn't tell us
much that we didn't already know or guess about White House
infighting and presidential bumbling. He has no particular sense of
the sweep of history and the implications of the events he
witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   He is carefully discreet about still-powerful presidential
friends like Erskine Bowles while he has a good time detailing his
feud with outside strategist Dick Morris, an easy target since
Morris' disgraceful adventures with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos is candid about the mental and emotional toll
levied by his constant desire to please Clinton amid all the White
House tensions and conspiracies. He developed insomnia and slid
into clinical depression, which a psychiatrist finally treated with
the prescription drug Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy could have predicted that, too.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1970 book ``Twilight of the Presidency,'' Reedy notes,
``The inner life of the White House is essentially the life of
chickens in the barnyard. ... It is a question of who has the right
to peck whom and who must submit to being pecked.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stephanopoulos was riding high and doing the pecking, he
was okay. But when he fell from favor and saw himself as low on the
pecking order, he was consumed by hives and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institution provides camouflage for all that is petty and
nasty in human beings and enables a clown or a knave to pose as
Galahad and be treated with deference,'' Reedy observes.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy wasn't referring merely to the Johnson White House that he
knew best. He quoted a former aide to Franklin Roosevelt, a fellow
known for what FDR called a ``passion for anonymity,'' as
explaining that insecurity and duplicity were eternal at the seat
of ultimate governmental power. ``That's the way it has always been
and that's the way it will always be,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Insider stories from the subsequent administrations of Richard
Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush reinforce the truth of that
pessimistic but realistic view. Despite the tawdry behavior of its
president, the internal Clinton White House is not a horrible
aberration but part of a traditional pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos pretends he never anticipated any of that. His
insistence on his own honorable political principles and naivete
about Clinton's womanizing are a typical author's trick. You get to
write the book; you get to cast yourself as hero.
</P>
<P>
   But he comes across as a far less intriguing personality in his
own book than Hillary Clinton, whom he has trouble understanding
and whose character is as complex and puzzling as that of the
president. On one page, she is bullying her husband. On another,
she is vulnerable and crying. On a third page, she is compassionate
and considerate.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos can't make up his mind whether to like her or
not. It doesn't matter. On the basis of his premature literary
squealing we can easily decide not to like him.
</P>

FAIR HAS LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION ... AND ART 
</HEADLINE>

 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAASTRICHT, Netherlands _ Thirty-three private planes flew into
the tiny airport here during the first 24 hours of the opening of
the European Fine Art Fair over the weekend, with others rerouted
to nearby Liege, Belgium. Hotel rooms were sold out nearly a year
in advance. On Friday afternoon and all day Saturday, cars were
backed up for miles on local roads, and the best restaurants within
50 miles were fully booked all weekend. These are the trappings of
art buying on a scale never seen in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem strange that the world's largest art fair is held in
this small Dutch city, especially to Americans who are used to
visiting big cities to see great art. But for Europeans,
Maastricht's proximity to France, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg
makes it convenient. Over the years, as word has spread that this
was the place where all the major European collectors buy great
art, Americans have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Now museum curators, auction house experts and collectors from
all over the world make the pilgrimage to Maastricht every March.
As a result the fair has grown to a degree that staggers first-time
visitors and seasoned dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago I never would have imagined this fair would draw
such crowds,'' said Konrad O. Bernheimer, a London dealer. ``The
fact that it's in the middle of nowhere is the secret to its
success. People come here for days, and they come here to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its beginning 25 years ago as primarily a showcase for
paintings, particularly 17th-century Dutch works, the fair has
significantly broadened its scope, and it now includes outstanding
examples of every collecting category from Old Masters and
antiquities to textiles, jewelry and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maastricht Convention Center, a stark space that seems
more appropriate for a cattle auction than an art fair, nearly 200
dealers (13 more than last year) from 12 countries exhibit their
best finds. The scope of these offerings is enormous. Some of this
year's highlights include a 1740 English garden pavilion with its
original pine paneling, priced at $235,000; an $11 million emerald
and diamond snake necklace, and a $1.3 million illuminated
manuscript made for an abbey near Antwerp, Belgium, in 1524.
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 68,000 people came to the fair. This year
the organizers have conservatively estimated that a total of more
than 72,000 will have attended by the time the fair ends on Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fair is physically larger this year. A 7,000-square-foot
hall has been added to the convention center, and the aisles have
been enlarged as have many of the booths. To transform this
cavernous space into an elegant art fair is not easy. The dealers'
stands are covered in colored felt, and the show's central plazas
are decorated with enormous flats of tulips and hyacinths.
</P>
<P>
   There are curators here from the National Gallery in London, the
Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford. Christie's auction house dispatched nearly 40
of its employees here to chat up clients. Major collectors in
attendance include Sir Graham Kirkham, a British financier; Mica
Ertegun, a New York City decorator and collector, and Linda J.
Wachner, the chief executive of Warnaco.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fair's inception, this has been known as the most
comprehensive place to see Old Master paintings. It still is. This
year, however, many of the dealers are grumbling that there are not
enough masterpieces on view because business has been so brisk in
recent months that they haven't been able to replenish their stock.
Even so, Rob Smeets, a Milan, Italy, dealer, offered ``The Mocking
of Christ'' (circa 1615), a luminous candlelight painting by
Honthorst.
</P>
<P>
   At an auction in Paris three months ago, Jean-Luc Baroni, the
director of Colnaghi, a London gallery, bought ``The Scourging of
Christ'' by a medieval painter known only as the Master of the
Karlsruhe Passion. It is one of six panels painted between 1435-65
for a church in the Strasbourg area. The other five panels are all
in European museums.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers have purposely hidden their best artworks, saving
them for special clients. ``Let me show you my finest painting,''
said Simon Dickinson, a dealer in London and New York, leading a
visitor into a tiny room tucked in the back of his booth to see
``Rest on the Flight into Egypt, with St. Jerome'' (1530), by Paris
Bordone. Dickinson was also offering some of the fair's only
top-quality Impressionist paintings, including Pissaro's ``Campagne
aux Environs de Conflans-Ste.-Honorine'' (1874).
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Waddington, a London dealer, has been appointed chairman
of the paintings department at the fair and has worked to improve
its quality. His own stand featured a sampling of works by Picasso,
Warhol, Josef Albers and Henry Moore. This year he persuaded Annely
Juda of London, a leading dealer in contemporary art, to exhibit at
Maastricht. Ms. Juda is displaying works by Christo, Anthony Caro
and David Hockney, as well as a 1927 Mondrian, ``Composition with
Red, Yellow and Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the fine arts tend to get most of the attention at the
fair, there are also rare examples of silver, furniture, porcelain
and jewelry. One of the choicest pieces is a rock crystal and
silver gilt 16th-century double cup that the London dealers S.J.
Phillips have had hidden away since they bought it at a sale of
objects from Victor Rothschild at Sotheby's in London in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dealers in Oriental art have deserted Maastricht
this year for the Asian Art Fair to be held in New York later this
month. One holdout is Ben Janssens, a London dealer whose booth
here displays a rare Tang dynasty group of 10 horses with riders,
some of whom are holding musical instruments. He found the pieces
in an English private collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``At specialized fairs you only meet people interested in
Oriental art,'' Janssens said. ``But here I meet new people who are
interested in all fields of collecting.''

OFFICIALS SAY AIR TRAVEL COMPUTERS WILL BE FIXED BEFORE JAN. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government investigators said Monday they are
confident that the computers operating the nation's air traffic
control system will be updated with new programs before Jan. 1,
ensuring that it will be safe to fly on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that manages the
nation's air traffic controls, is installing new computer programs
at about 3,700 air traffic facilities so that the computers will
correctly read dates after Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the government's computers, as well as those in private
industry, use two digits to read the year. Unless this is fixed,
computers and embedded microchips could read ``00'' as 1900 rather
than 2000 and malfunction. The potential problem is known as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators such as the General Accounting Office
warned last year that the FAA might not have its systems fixed by
Jan. 1. The agency did not begin fixing its computers until last
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Congress heard good news Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a much higher level of confidence today than we did a
year ago that the Department of Transportation's mission-critical
systems, such as air traffic control, will be Year-2000 complaint
before October, 1999,'' Kenneth Mead, the DOT's Inspector General,
told the House Government Reform and House Science Committees.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssn, the General Accounting Office's director of
civil agencies information systems, agreed. ``Looking back to where
the agency was only a year ago, FAA has made tremendous progress,''
he said. ``But much remains to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Garvey, head of the FAA, said the agency is scheduled to
have its computer systems fixed and installed by June 30. That
deadline, however, is behind the Clinton administration's plan to
have all government computer systems upgraded and tested by the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Garvey, as well as the inspector general, noted that the FAA
has been able to meet its self-imposed deadlines during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA will also conduct its first major test next month when
FAA air traffic control systems in Colorado will be turned ahead to
April 10, 2000. The test will be conducted on a flight from
Colorado Springs to Grand Junction to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said the test is designed to determine whether individual
system fixes will be able to work together in an actual operational
environment. So far the only testing that has been completed has
been with simulations.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is also in the process of developing contingency plans
in case any of its computer systems fail on or after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said it includes such things as increasing the amount of
distance between planes that are landing and taking off. It also
includes having another air traffic control tower take over for one
that is experiencing problems.
</P>
<P>
   This, for example, could mean that air traffic controllers at
Dulles Airport in suburban Washington, D.C., would help controllers
at Ronald Reagan Washington National airport if a problem arises
there.
</P>
<P>
   Willemssn said such a plan would not work, however, in the event
of widespread power outages.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said the FAA is continuing to work with airports to
ensure that all of its systems including airport lighting and
baggage systems, are upgraded. She also said the agency is working
with international aviation officials to ensure that their air
traffic control systems will be fixed by Jan. 1. The FAA plans to
conduct tests with several countries by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the GAO reported mixed results in airports'
Year-2000 readiness. One third of 413 airports surveyed said they
would be ready by June 30 while the rest planned on a later
completion date.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those airports are small, but the GAO said 26 of the
nation's largest 50 airports' computer systems would not be ready
by June 30.

   At last there's a way to fight the dreaded E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian biotech company has developed the first drug to treat
the agonizing gut cramps and life-threatening kidney damage that
result from Eshcherichia coli 0157 infections. The drug could help
victims of outbreaks such as the one which recently hospitalized 22
British people _ half of them children _ who drank contaminated
milk.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian company says that the drug could have been made
available on ``compassionate grounds'' to help treat the victims of
Britain's latest outbreak in Cockermouth, Cumbria, had it been
notified earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful drug for this terrible, terrible condition,''
says Howard Trachtman of the Schneider Children's Hospital in N.Y.,
who is in charge of a multi-center trial of the drug in the United
States and Canada. ``The beneficiaries would be patients like those
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachtman says that in trials the drug has reduced by half the
risk of patients going on to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), the stage of disease in which the kidney is damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which was developed by Synsorb Biotech of Calgary,
consists of an inert sphere of silicon dioxide from which multiple
copies of a trisaccharide sugar molecule protrude. These mimic the
receptors on gut cells to which the bacterium's deadly ``shiga''
toxin binds. When patients swallow the drug, it reaches the gut
undigested and mops up the toxin.
</P>
<P>
   Intensive trials are under way at hospitals throughout the
United States and Canada. The results of earlier trials in Japan
and Argentina have been encouraging, although Japanese recipients
received antibiotics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only 1 percent of patients receiving the combination
developed HUS compared with a usual rate of 15 percent for
antibiotics alone. &QL;   &QL;

<P>
   Mitochondrial Eve, from whom all women are descended, is twice
as old as we thought. That's the suggestion from two new studies
that challenge the idea that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited
only from our mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria, the energy-generating structures in all our cells,
have their own DNA. Even if mitochondria from sperm get into the
egg during fertilization, biologists thought they would be rapidly
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   This simple pattern of inheritance, as well as the speedy rate
at which some parts of mtDNA mutate, has made it a very useful
molecular clock to study evolution. Using this clock, biologists
were able to estimate that ``Eve,'' the most recent common ancestor
of all women, lived in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years
ago. Tracing ``Adam,'' the equivalent common ancestor for men, has
until recently proved more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies of the distribution of mtDNA mutations in human
populations now suggest that there is a degree of paternal mtDNA
inheritance. That throws previous evolutionary calculations using
mtDNA into confusion and greatly complicates the business of
estimating when Eve lived.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of these studies, an international team led by
Erika Hagelberg of Cambridge University studied the distribution of
one mtDNA mutation on the island of Nguna in the Melanesian
archipelago of Vanuatu. The mutation, which causes the substitution
of a single amino acid in one mitochondrial protein, is present in
people of many separate maternal mtDNA lines.
</P>
<P>
   One reason this might happen would be if this particular
mutation has a tendency to occur spontaneously. But the fact that
it doesn't exist outside Vanuatu makes this unlikely. The obvious
explanation, the researchers say, is that some paternal mtDNA
enters the egg and recombines with the maternal mtDNA.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, by John Maynard Smith and colleagues at the
University of Sussex, focused on mutations in mitochondrial
proteins from populations around the world. They found a large
number of mtDNA sites where mutations occurred. But most of these
mutations were found in only a limited geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   This again suggests that the mutations occurred very rarely and
then spread locally by recombination of maternal and paternal
mtDNA, say the Sussex researchers. ``These two studies represent
the first evidence that recombination is happening in mtDNA,'' says
team member Adam Eyre-Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If recombination with paternal mtDNA is responsible for some of
the variation in mtDNA, then its true mutation rate is much lower
than biologists thought and Eve must have lived longer ago than the
100,000 to 200,000 years of current estimates. ``These findings
mean that she must be twice as old,'' Eyre-Walker says.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Hurst, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of
Bath, predicts the two studies will provoke a heated debate.
``These papers are going to create some waves,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to prove that paternal recombination, rather than
just mutation, is involved, says Hurst. ``But I think recombination
is the best explanation for what they've found.'' &QL;   &QL;

<P>
   Biochips that can spot dangerous pesticides and fungicides at an
early stage in their development are being tested by Zeneca, the
British agrochemicals manufacturer. The new system could reduce the
need for animal testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't substitute for full toxicology testing in animals
with the final molecule,'' says David Evans, research and
development director at Zeneca. ``But it will offer early alerts
which allow us to navigate the chemistry into safer areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca expects the biosensor to provide a wealth of data on
desirable and undesirable effects. It could show, for example,
whether an experimental pesticide would endanger humans, farm
animals or plants. It could also help show if the chemicals are
dangerous to bees and earthworms, and how effective they are
against pests.
</P>
<P>
   Different biosensors are needed to measure effects on different
organisms, but all are made in the same way. A chip of glass, nylon
or silicon is coated with fragments of genes from one species, each
fragment occupying a set position on the surface. These genes are
those known to be switched on when the organism is exposed to high
levels of toxic chemicals. In humans, for example, some liver genes
become unusually active when exposed to potent toxins.
</P>
<P>
   To test the effect of a particular chemical on the organism, the
chemical is added to a culture of the organism's cells. Since
messenger RNA (mRNA) is made only when genes are active, extracts
of mRNA can reveal which genes are active. The degree of activity
is reflected by the amount of mRNA produced. The mRNA fragments are
then labeled with a chemical that fluoresces when exposed to laser
light.
</P>
<P>
   Active genes are identified by exposing the biochip to the
labeled mRNA. The fragments bind to the corresponding genes on the
chip, so the areas with active genes will fluoresce when exposed to
laser light.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca has tested biosensors against known poisons to
distinguish between patterns of safe gene activity and patterns
that betray unacceptably high levels of toxicity. It has also
investigated the effectiveness of its fungicides, using a biosensor
with all 6,000 genes from bakers' yeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a few compounds through to see what we got, and it
looks very promising,'' says David Lawrence, head of crop research
at Zeneca.
</P>
<P>
   2,000 human genes known to be activated by toxic drugs or
pesticides are being tested to find the best indicators among them.
Lawrence expects the biosensor to become more useful as more human
genes are sequenced in the human genome project. &QL;   &QL;

<P>
   They may look harmless but screensavers could betray you while
you're out at lunch. Paranoia? Not according to two Israeli
cryptographers have discovered that the randomness of the ''keys''
that are used to encode encrypted documents may, in fact, be their
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible for hackers to search your hard disc for a
signature key only when a screensaver is on, ensuring that the user
is away from his or her desk.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made by Adi Shamir at the Weizmann Institute
of Science in Rehovot, Israel, joint inventor of the widely used
RSA public key cryptography system, and Nicko van Someren of
Cipher, a British electronic security company based in Cambridge.
The found that the more random a private signature key is, the
harder it is to crack encrypted files. But by scanning hard drives
for chunks of data that are particularly random, the pair found
that it is possible to weed out keys stored on a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Most programs organize data into some sort of level of
structure, so blocks of randomness stand out and can be spotted
with the same ease that a human eye can tell the difference between
a good TV picture from one with lots of interference. According to
van Someren, this means that even though the keys take up a mere
kilobyte of memory, it could take as little as 40 minutes to find a
signature key on a modern 10-gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be possible to write a program that searches the hard
disc automatically and sends the key to the villain,'' says van
Someren. This, he says, could be carried out by a virus that runs
only when the screensaver is on, making it extremely difficult for
the user to detect.
</P>
<P>
   A running screensaver could contain viral codes that would tell
a hacker when the user is away from their desk, thereby avoiding
detection _ the user wouldn't notice the computer slowing down as
the virus hunts for keys.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility highlights the need to keep signature keys safe,
says Phil Zimmermann, who wrote Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a
popular encryption program that is reckoned to be hard to crack.
''Users must never leave their private key exposed in a non-secure
environment,'' he says. ''This is as obvious as not leaving your
wallet unattended on a bus bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Any worthwhile encryption program encrypts the key before
storing it, making it useless if found. However, a ''swap'' file _
a temporary file stored on the hard disc-may still hold the key in
its unencrypted form, allowing it to be detected by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to combat this sort of attack, such as
overwriting swap files as the PGP program does. But some encryption
systems are vulnerable, particularly those on Web servers where the
keys are constantly in use. &QL;   &QL;

   The discovery was made by Adi Shamir at the Weizmann Institute
of Science in Rehovot, Israel, joint inventor of the widely used
RSA public key cryptography system, and Nicko van Someren of
Cipher, a British electronic security company based in Cambridge.
The found that the more random a private signature key is, the
harder it is to crack encrypted files. But by scanning hard drives
for chunks of data that are particularly random, the pair found
that it is possible to weed out keys stored on a disc.
</P>
<P>
   Most programs organize data into some sort of level of
structure, so blocks of randomness stand out and can be spotted
with the same ease that a human eye can tell the difference between
a good TV picture from one with lots of interference. According to
van Someren, this means that even though the keys take up a mere
kilobyte of memory, it could take as little as 40 minutes to find a
signature key on a modern 10-gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be possible to write a program that searches the hard
disc automatically and sends the key to the villain,'' says van
Someren. This, he says, could be carried out by a virus that runs
only when the screensaver is on, making it extremely difficult for
the user to detect.
</P>
<P>
   A running screensaver could contain viral codes that would tell
a hacker when the user is away from their desk, thereby avoiding
detection _ the user wouldn't notice the computer slowing down as
the virus hunts for keys.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility highlights the need to keep signature keys safe,
says Phil Zimmermann, who wrote Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a
popular encryption program that is reckoned to be hard to crack.
''Users must never leave their private key exposed in a non-secure
environment,'' he says. ''This is as obvious as not leaving your
wallet unattended on a bus bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Any worthwhile encryption program encrypts the key before
storing it, making it useless if found. However, a ''swap'' file _
a temporary file stored on the hard disc-may still hold the key in
its unencrypted form, allowing it to be detected by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to combat this sort of attack, such as
overwriting swap files as the PGP program does. But some encryption
systems are vulnerable, particularly those on Web servers where the
keys are constantly in use. &QL;   &QL;

MADISON SAID IT: ARM YOURSELF WITH KNOWLEDGE OR LOSE FREEDOM

<TEXT>
<P>
   March 16, James Madison's birthday, is the occasion for a
national celebration _ Freedom of Information Day. It's a day to
remember the significance of requiring open government and open
records.
</P>
<P>
   Madison expressed this thought powerfully in his 1798 report to
the Virginia House of Delegates, ``Knowledge will forever govern
ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must
arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is there are bureaucrats at every level of government
who hide their mistakes as officials from the public, who hide
government maneuvering that exceeds legislative intent, who wish to
deny agency errors, who want to blind the public to the expansion
of their power.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is there are presidents and governors and members of
city and town councils who cherish power more than they cherish the
tradition of democracy and representative government. And there are
state and federal legislators who would join these would-be
tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is the term ``national security'' is used to conceal
despicable acts and contemptible policies. Agents of the government
used citizens without their knowledge in radiation experiments, to
test diseases, to see if psychedelics could be used to control the
mind. And hid it all behind the old rubric of ``national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential national security decision directives are used to
create foreign policies without the knowledge of the public and
often without the knowledge or advice of Congress. President Reagan
wasn't the only president to issue such directives, although he may
have issued more of them than any preceeding president,
approximately 300. One NSDD authorized the use of the National
Security Council to conduct covert operations _ a clear violation
of its mandate. The secrecy of NSDDs destroy the checks and
balances built into our system of government. Not even our elected
member of Congress can stop a policy of which they are ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious violation of national security'' was the
government's cry when the Pentagon Papers were first published in
The New York Times and the Washington Post. After examining the
papers, a majority of the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court
thought otherwise. Indeed, what the report clearly showed was how
the United States politically blundered into the Vietnam War
without a clear foreign policy goal and without cogent military
leadership. It also showed that secrecy was the handmaiden of this
nation's bungling.
</P>
<P>
   According to Arthur Schlesinger Jr., President Kennedy later
regretted that The New York Times had not played up its story on
the exile invasion of Cuba. ``If you had printed more about the
operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake,'' he
told a Times editor.
</P>
<P>
   When California closed its prisons to journalists a few years
ago so that interviews with inmates were either forbidden or
greatly restricted _ on the phony rationale that criminals
shouldn't be treated as media stars _ newspapers were kept at a
distance and their role as government watchdogs severely
diminished. Any wonder then, that last year the Los Angeles Times
was finally able to break a series of stories about prisoners being
used as gladiators in fights to the death in prison yards? When
there is no public oversight, power is rawly abused.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, again from that 1798 report, said: ``To the press
alone, checkered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for
all the triumphs which have been obtained by reason and humanity
over error and oppression.'' The press is the only private,
commercial enterprise mentioned in the Bill of Rights or in the
Constitution, for that matter _ for good reason, the Founding
Fathers understood the significant role that newspapers play in
informing the people about public issues. At root, that is one
reason we, the people, manage to hold tight to our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1966. It grants all
citizens and journalists the legal right to inspect records kept by
federal agencies except those specifically exempt as classified or
records that reveal commercial trade secrets. Presidents have
attempted to limit the scope of the FOIA _ Reagan, and Gerald Ford,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has stood firm in bipartisan support of the FOIA
and in 1974 passed important amendments to the act, over the veto
of President Ford. In 1996, the act was again strengthened with the
passage of key amendments regarding electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   But there are new problems in this electronic information age.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies remove Web pages without storing them or
copying them to files that can be accessed by the public at some
later date. In other words, an agency can alter the history of its
actions _ not unlike George Orwell's prophetic novel ``1984.''
Federal agencies are also failing to make public information
available on their Web sites or withdrawing the information for
so-called security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has begun to be understood to be one of the most
powerful communication tools the world has ever known. A citizen
can know as much about an issue as his senator or representative in
Congress _ sometimes a lot more. Knowledge gives the people
leverage in Congress and in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups understand the enormous power of the
Internet to defeat misinformation circulated by agricultural or
mining interests.
</P>
<P>
   The hog farm industry spends millions of dollars to convince
legislators that hog farm waste isn't a danger to surrounding
communities and well water. Ask a North Carolina resident who lives
anywhere near the 10 million hogs produced in that state.
</P>
<P>
   The government, as the Founding Fathers understood it, has an
obligation to provide public access to any information created or
compiled by government employees at taxpayer expense. It has an
obligation to preserve that information and guarantee its
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Madison understood there is no democracy when the citizenry is
ignorant.
</P>
<P>
   We need more than one day a year to keep vigilant on these
issues, but one day is a good start.

 &HT;    Once-mighty Hayes to auction what remains
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is how it ends: with the bark of an auctioneer,
the call for bids and the carting away of what's left.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day auction of assets at Hayes Corp., the company that
once dominated the analog modem market, begins Wednesday at 10 a.m.
in the Norcross building that once housed its corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Emerald Assets Management, Nuri Otus, will take
the microphone as he has at hundreds of auctions and invite the
bidding to start. For item number one, he has promised a surprise
_something bidders will not be expecting.
</P>
<P>
   But everything else is on display until the end of the day
today.
</P>
<P>
   Emerald workers have gone through the four-building, 178,000
square-foot spread and tagged every for-sale item with a number to
make bidding easy.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses might be interested in the more common devices,
or perhaps office furniture, Otus said.
</P>
<P>
   Some huge corporations have checked out the now-idled Hayes
assembly lines, which include a number of large, complex machines
that cost tens of thousands of dollars new.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something for everyone,'' Otus said. ``In terms of
buying one modem, no. But for buying a computer or fax machine,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hayes factory are circuit board inserters, ovens to bake
parts into place, wave soldering machines, in-circuit testers, a
bar code printer, oscilloscopes from Tektronix and something called
a Vectorscope from NTSC.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the floor sits a Hewlett Packard 3070 Series II
in-circuit board tester, the kind of machine that _ unlike personal
computers _ does not become obsolete every four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a current product that sells for about $400,000 new,''
Otus said. ``We will probably take in half to two-thirds of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction takes place at Hayes corporate headquarters, on
Peachtree Corners East, just off Peachtree Industrial Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The event is open to the public and is intended to raise money
toward paying off the debt Hayes amassed as it went under.

 &HT;    Worldspan chief exec to quit post for new job
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The top executive at Atlanta-based Worldspan is
leaving the travel reservations company to take a job with an
Internet real estate firm in California.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Buckman, Worldspan's chief executive officer since 1995,
will depart at the end of the month. Worldspan said a search for a
successor has begun, and an interim CEO soon will be named.
</P>
<P>
   Buckman, who will be president and chief operating officer of
Real Select, is the second top Worldspan official to leave in
recent weeks. Jeffrey Hoffman, vice president for distribution
planning and development, left for a job at the Internet travel
service priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coincidence that they both went with Internet
companies,'' said Patricia Cooledge Forsyth, a Worldspan
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspan, based at the Cobb Galleria, is one of a handful of
computer reservations systems that sell booking information and
tools to travel agencies. It also provides computer support to
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspan is jointly owned by Delta, Northwest and TWA and has
about 3,100 employees, just over half of them based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the fourth-largest global reservations system,
behind Galileo, Sabre and Amadeus, which also are partly owned by
various domestic and foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between Worldspan and Europe-based Amadeus was widely
expected last year, but Amadeus reportedly hoped to combine the
move with an initial public offering and shelved the plan when the
market cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the deal has quieted, but not died, since
then.

THE DAY AFTER A NIGHT OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hazel is sated, happy and confident after their first night of
making love. Finally the mists of growing up and casting about to
find out who she is have lifted, and she is ready to set a course
out into life.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is sated, happy and in deep doubt. Mists were a comfort,
and a sunlit course is scary. After Hazel brushes a languorous
morning-after hand across his chest, he reflects: ``That was nice,
he couldn't deny it but then uninterrupted niceness had been part
of the problem the first time around.'' Poets apart, it is in
happiness, not dreams, that responsibilities begin. For Spencer,
seeking is much lighter than finding: it imposes neither choice nor
its constricting consequence. Being knocked off his donkey by
divine choice was not the big thing for Saul/St. Paul. Rather, it
was choosing that choice and submitting to go on by foot to
Damascus and the other towns that would more and more painfully
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus is title and metaphor for Richard Beard's blithe jaunt
around the uncertain peaks and yawning hollows of his
contemporaries' efforts to engage the task of living. The
transfiguring event that is supposed to bring commitment is also a
perpetually receding alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, that tumble from the donkey wasn't such an event, only a
matter of an inconvenient pebble. Nor, surely, could it be a night
of astonishing happiness with a long-sought-for woman. (Hazel and
Spencer had been courting and evading each other since childhood.)
</P>
<P>
   Beard takes us through the day that follows the couple's night,
to the unsurprising conclusion that this pretty much has to be it.
That is the only unsurprising thing about ``Damascus.'' The novel
is a tipsy game, part of whose fun consists in figuring out rules
that alter as you go along, like the flamingo mallets in Alice's
Wonderland croquet.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nick Hornby and Jonathan Coe, two other young British
writers, Beard comically unhinges style, character and point of
view to tell us that indeed we are in the chaos of the contemporary
world. Then they introduce an oddly straightforward tenderness to
suggest that we may indeed survive it.
</P>
<P>
   The joining of such opposites is not always convincing _ it can
excessively manipulate plot and emotions _ but what results is
witty, original and sometimes transporting.
</P>
<P>
   In ``X20,'' his first book, Beard used a dizzying set of
variations on the subject of smoking and not smoking to construct a
graceful novel about the frontier between ego and intimacy, a
frontier that contemporary culture has armed to the point of
outright warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Damascus'' he uses two other drolly disorienting devices to
chart Hazel's and Spencer's struggles to burn clear in an era of
quenching becloudment.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, a series of brief retrospective chapters about
their growing up are all announced as taking place on Nov. 1, 1993
_ the night and day of the story's present action. This bewilders
for a while and sometimes irritates, but it works oddly well.
</P>
<P>
   Beard's wackiness has a shrewd precision that makes it
infectious. Furthermore, there is a point. Memory takes place in
the present, clarifying or befuddling it. Everything that Hazel and
Spencer remember crowds into the same forcing-chamber with their
efforts to decide who they are and who they will be.
</P>
<P>
   A related device consists of blurring circumstances so that each
retrospective chapter is described as occurring in half a dozen
different spots in Britain (seven or eight dozen of them, by the
time we're through, a veritable travel guide).
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly loony and certainly reiterative; yet again, there is a
point. It is like one of those old stage effects in which the
background moves by while the characters stand still: instead of
dispersing emotion, the effect is to focus it on them.
</P>
<P>
   Devices aside, the best scenes in ``Damascus'' come in glimpses
of Hazel and Spencer from birth to that first bedding. At 12 they
meet at the beach where their families have gone for chilly (and
cheap) off-season holidays. It is a lovely portrait of
shy-but-longing boy and shy-but-assured girl. (It will be years
before they are reunited, though they keep in touch by illegally
activated pay phone.)
</P>
<P>
   Later there will be Hazel's promiscuous adolescent rebellion
against a smothering mother who has no doubt that anxiety is the
right response to life. ``Her timidity is therefore very assured,
almost aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for adolescent Spencer, he is convinced that he is the only
male of his age who doesn't have ``nonstop all-action sex all of
the time.'' At his school dance he prepares pickup lines, each more
absurd than the other, and tries them on three girls. They ``heave
with laughter, as if together they comprise a single organism which
feeds off the embarrassment of 15-year-old boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard writes these chapters with comic ardor and telling
silences: the blackouts and uncanny touches that characterize
memory as opposed to narrative. As for the narrative _ the 24 hours
in a dilapidated London mansion where a series of extravagant
incidents propel Hazel and Spencer into something approaching a
happy ending _ it is less successful, though it contains much that
is engaging.
</P>
<P>
   There is William, the wobbly brother of the mansion's wealthy
owner, and under Spencer's hired care. Shrewd and kindly, William
suffers from a state of indecisiveness so extreme that he is unable
to leave the house. Everything he sees _ pedestrians, buses,
garbage cans _ seems equally in need of his attention, making him
forget why he went out in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   True, the outdoors is unsettling in Beard's faintly absurdist
contemporary London. Britain is about to join the European
Community, the local library is putting on a shouting session for a
festival titled ``Most Noise Ever Heard in a Library,'' and a
vagrant who haunts a nearby doorway is the former director of the
National Economic Development Office.
</P>
<P>
   What disrupts all this is a McGuffin so gnarled and elaborate as
to throw the novel out of whack, even as it propels the plot. An
insane Japanese student armed with a poisonous powder invades the
house convinced that he is in love with Hazel. What follows is
frequently comic and appropriately absurd, but it is also terribly
forced.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, so is the Hazel-Spencer resolution it engenders.
After bringing us a witty, original and sometimes enchanting novel,
Beard has tried too hard to bring it off. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves drop in on Galarraga
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Javy Lopez knocked on the front door, and when
Eneyda Galarraga let him in, the Braves catcher found Andres
Galarraga hanging up the telephone. Peering out the door, Galarraga
saw a pair of buses filled with teammates Monday morning, all there
to make a surprise housecall on the Big Cat.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a cue to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm a tough guy,'' Lopez said. ``But if I could cry, I
would have.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first face-to-face contact with Galarraga since he was
diagnosed with lymphoma on Feb. 18, the Braves detoured from their
route to Roger Dean Stadium to drop by his West Palm Beach home.
The idea was a conspiracy between Eneyda, manager Bobby Cox and
traveling secretary Bill Acree, and the event appeared to be
mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was just happy to see everybody,'' Cox said. ``It's
pretty tough. But he looked very good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looked good, man,'' shortstop Walt Weiss said. ``I'd rather
stayed there than come here (to Jupiter).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he could hit a couple home runs today,''
pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``You'd just have to expect that
what he's going through would take something out of him. But he
looks strong as a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Depressed and despondent by the original diagnosis, Galarraga
appeared buoyant and happy during the team's five-minute visit.
After a month's seclusion with his family while he started
chemotherapy, the first baseman will make his first public
appearance Wednesday morning with a news conference at the Braves'
Walt Disney World complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he looks like he is right mentally, now,'' Lopez said.
``He looked relaxed, not depressed anymore. It's just knowing he
has the disease, but he's really calm knowing he's going to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The visit) helped him a lot,'' Eneyda said. ``He was excited
everybody came to see him. It was good for the team. He's an
inspiration to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, Ryan Klesko approached the man he has replaced
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a big hug,'' said Klesko, ``and he told me to go
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of what the Braves were trying to say to him.

 &HT;    Masters field the largest in 33 years
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angel Miguel Jimenez of Spain and Patrik Sjoland of Sweden were
added to the 1999 Masters field on Monday through invitations from
Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The starting field of 95 is the largest since 103 golfers
competed in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Three more opportunities are available, for winners in the Bay
Hill Invitational, The Players Championship and Atlanta's BellSouth
Classic.
</P>

   It will be the first Masters appearance for Sjoland, 27, who
finished fifth in the 1998 European Tour Order of Merit, and the
second for Jimenez, 35, who on Sunday won his second Turespana Open
in a row. Jimenez, fourth on the Order of Merit last year, missed
the cut at the Masters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think both men are very talented players,'' Johnson said.
``Both golfers finished among the top five last year 
European Tour's Order or Merit and have competed successfully
against the best players in the world. We are very happy to have
them in our field.''
</P>
<P>
   The total number of Masters invitations is 104, but nine have
gone to non-competing players. The Masters, the first major
championship of the season, will be played April 8-11.

 &HT;    International soccer: Will Real Madrid survive?
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most storied club in European soccer is in grave danger of
missing out on the continent's most lucrative competition next
season. And for defending European Cup holders Real Madrid, that's
far from being good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Real, which travels to the Ukraine on Wednesday to play
dangerous Dynamo Kyiv (4:45 p.m., ESPN2), must win the second leg
of its Champions League quarterfinal matchup in order to move on.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish giant is hanging on by a thread, as it was last
season. Real won a spot only by virtue of its European Cup
championship, a record seventh. Its current seventh-place status in
the Primera Division won't be enough by itself, even with the
Champions League expanding from 24 to 32 teams next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kyiv got a crucial road goal in a 1-1 draw at Madrid's Bernabeu
Stadium two weeks ago. The good news for Real, which has given up a
Primera-high 42 goals, is that the injured Fernando Hierro and
Manuel Sanchis are back, and defender Christian Panucci and
midfielder Clarence Seedorf are coming off suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Europe: Cup crazy
</P>
<P>
   Other Champions' League matches Wednesday feature Manchester
United at Inter Milan; Juventus at Olympiakos and Bayern Munich at
Kaiserslautern, with the visitors all having the upper hand. . . .
The second leg of the UEFA Cup quarterfinals will be played
tonight: Olympique Marseille at Celta Vigo; Bologna at Olympique
Lyon; Girondins Bordeaux at Parma; and Atletico Madrid at AS Roma.
. . . On Thursday, the same stage of the Cup Winners' Cup will be
held: holdersChelsea at Valerenga of Norway; Lokomotiv Moscow at
Maccabi Haifa of Israel; Varteks of Croatia at Mallorca; and Lazio
at Panionios of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   England: Wembley bought
</P>
<P>
   The Football Association will purchase Wembley Stadium in London
and spend $380 million for a complete overhaul to help England's
bid for the 2006 World Cup. Wembley, which opened in 1923, will be
demolished and rebuilt to seat 80,000, with modern facilities and
improved sight lines. . . . Premier League chief executive Peter
Leaver resigned last week after board members expressed dismay that
he hired two executives of BSkyB, Rupert Murdoch's cable outlet, as
media advisers. . . . After getting his third red card of the
season Sunday, Arsenal's French midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, says he
wants to leave England. Petit will be suspended for Arsenal's
upcoming FA Cup semifinal match with Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   France: Buying Bordeaux
</P>
<P>
   Although leading the first division, financially troubled
Girondins Bordeaux has attracted the interest of an English
investment firm and a French television station. The club also has
been clouded by decade-old allegations of fraud and bribery. A
players' agent has testified in an ongoing trial that he offered
gifts and women to referees to help Bordeaux officials fix
Champions' League matches in 1985. . . . Artur Jorge has left as
manager of Paris St-Germain, the richest club in France but
currently in 12th place in the first division.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Juninho no given
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian midfielding whiz Juninho has been told by interim
Atletico Madrid manager Carlos Aguiar that his spot in the lineup
is not guaranteed. Juninho, who passed up a chance to return to
England after being promised a starting role by former manager
Arrigo Sacchi, has played little since Aguiar came on board last
month. . . . Rivaldo scored twice in the first half Saturday,
pushing his total to 15 for the season, as Barcelona built a
four-point lead in the Primera with a 3-0 win over city rivals
Espanyol.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America: Pan-Am no go
</P>
<P>
   The South American federation will not send men's or women's
teams to the Pan American Games this summer. Organizers in Winnipeg
balked at being asked to spend $3 million for CONMEBOL to
participate. . . . The Argentina Clasura season got under way over
the weekend after a three-week players' strike, and Racing Club of
Buenos Aires also got into the act. The club, a favorite of former
dictator Juan Peron, was declared part of the country's national
heritage by current president Carlos Menem, himself a Peronist.
Cash-strapped Racing, which nearly went bankrupt, now will get
government protection from creditors for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe
</P>
<P>
   FIFA boss Sepp Blatter has proposed a global calendar to be
played annually between February and November to help meet his goal
of holding the World Cup every two years. He also proposes that
domestic leagues cut down to 16 teams, an idea being blasted in
Europe. . . . Tokyo will be the site for the 2002 World Cup
qualifying draw on Dec. 7. The Asian federation is threatening to
withdraw all 40 nations under its umbrella if it doesn't get more
slots in the finals. Asia has only two other teams in the 32-team
event besides co-hosts Japan and South Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALTO, Uruguay _ Eucalyptus trees and jasmine vines perfume the
daytime air of Uruguay, until the cool and sweet scents are
overtaken by the smell of burning pine, fuel for the evening
barbecue ritual in a country where grass-fed beef is exported to
Argentina and costs less than chicken in the supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday before Ash Wednesday, our route winds north along
Route 3 and Rio Uruguay to the Salto province to visit my hosts'
relatives and soak in roadside hot springs at sunset. After bathing
we drive into the capital city of the state, also called Salto, and
are greeted by the sounds of drummers practicing on side streets
for the evening's four-hour-long desfile, or Carnaval parade.
</P>
<P>
   Salto is laid out in a grid with a mix of architectural styles
19th-century neo-classical, stone-columned municipal buildings and
boxy flat-roofed stores and houses from the 1950s and '60s. We
inhale the aroma of grilled freshly slaughtered beef and lamb as we
drive toward our hotel on Plaza Artigas. Every city has a similarly
named memorial designated for Jose Gervasio Artigas, a leader in
Uruguay's 1811 revolution against Spain. The banks of the Rio
Uruguay and the Argentine border are a 15-minute drive east, and
all roads lead to the river, which floods waterside neighborhoods
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The party would not begin until 10:30 p.m., and a mass of
spectators senior citizens and teen-agers aboard buzzing scooters,
horse-drawn wooden carts driven by children and groups of walking
families head toward Calle Uruguay, the evening's byway for bands,
clowns, beauty queens and floats.
</P>
<P>
   Multicolored wands of lights provided by commercial sponsors are
strung across the parade route. The celebration begins with a
summons of cymbals and drums accented by firecrackers that pass
beneath our hotel balcony. The costume colors and rhythms are so
alluring I cannot wait to get to the street, but we do not want to
leave our perch for fear of missing any of the show. Our lodgings,
the Gran Hotel Salto, cost about $50 per night for suites, which my
hosts think is pricey.
</P>
<P>
   It is the tallest structure in the city, a five-story Art Deco
building with a 1950s interior in a neighborhood of embassies, a
historic church and retail storefronts. When we return to the
street, the crowd is six deep on both sides, choked with chairs and
tables that were set up hours earlier. But the curb-side seated
spectators are friendly and we squeeze in and do not miss a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Marchers dressed as witches, monsters and giants loom over
children who run along the sidelines near their families' spots.
The kids sneak up on the performers, who feign surprise and turn to
frighten them. The brave ones retaliate with foam sprayed from
narrow cans or throw water to melt the threat away, before running
back to their folks, shrieking. It is a great way to wear out the
little ones who are excited by the colors and the noise.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, their faces covered with fabric or masks bought at
bodegas, join the scary monsters in the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   Women shimmy atop floats to the musical vibrations of
unamplified but powerful bands whose sounds shake the curb-side
trees. Throngs of dancers appear wearing smiles, sequined tangas
(thongs) and brief bras, dancing to an escola do samba beat, a
Brazilian influence from the neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Hourglass is not a dirty word in Uruguay, and the female form is
celebrated, especially the posterior portion. Since this is not
Brazil, breasts are restrained. The parade is simulcast live on
televisions in city restaurants and bars, and shown in slow-motion
when cameras focus on costume beads that bounce off of undulating
hips.
</P>
<P>
   A 120-member band featuring a line of 30 drummers precedes a
spangled white float with an almost life-size model of an SST jet,
pulled by a proud farmer driving a tractor. The band rocks back and
forth, taking baby steps down the calle while playing a samba
serenade, allowing spectators an eyeful of the woman deemed most
beautiful in all of Salto, the parade queen who stands at the
plane's tail.
</P>
<P>
   The brunette monarch wears a white beaded mini shift and high
white boots; on her shoulders rests a harness of 12 2-foot-long
white feathers that nuzzle her face and long dark hair in the soft
breeze like nurturing angels' wings. The float carries her court, a
corps of young girls who wear tangas and bras with less dramatic
yellow feather headdresses. It takes a half-hour for the queen's
group to pass the block, and the pulse of the music never wavers
during the sustained applause for the sight.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders, unable to keep still, join the swirling dancers that
keep coming down the parade route. If the crowd really claps, the
performers will come close and dance just before them. Radio
station vans are joined by a Santa Claus float, a huge dove with
luminescent eyes and adolescent girls in evening dresses who are
targets of the sprayed foam, which they smilingly wipe away.
</P>
<P>
   Uruguay is one of South America's smallest countries with only
3.2 million people. It sits on the Atlantic coast, to the right of
Argentina, just beneath Brazil. The warmth of the climate permeates
the culture, where a handshake is an insult and introductions are
made with a kiss. Or two.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to the Southern Hemisphere to escape the cold of North
America may seem extreme, but an invitation from three generations
of Uruguayans (who are friends and naturalized Americans) to join a
Carnaval Week road trip around their homeland was too enticing to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The Carnaval in Uruguay is a blend of traditions: the Llamadas,
which are candombe drum rhythms played by black musicians and
whites in blackface who summon residents to their Montevideo street
party; religious celebrations of the cross and also of the farmer's
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Every desfile also contains performances by groups called
Murgas.
</P>
<P>
   The word means a band of street musicians, and there are about
20 groups that come from some of the poorest sections of the
country. Murgas perform nightly in cities and villages during the
month of February for prizes and to earn money for their art. A
century-old theatrical tradition, the groups specialize in drum
sounds derived from the Canary Islands and incorporate humor,
political parody, skits or a combination of all those forms in
their shows.
</P>
<P>
   A national election will be held in November, and posters of
smiling candidates were glued to the walls of shantytown shacks on
the outer rings of cities. Graffiti and murals touted members of
the red, green and other political parties, saturating the
landscape and informing the themes of the murgas, who as comedians
and actors perform behind masks in ornate rainbow-colored satin
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Salto desfile, some of the murga's headpieces completely
covered their faces, sometimes they relied on paint. Always they
carried political banners bearing their group's name in one case
``Faltan Papas'' (not enough potatoes, or food; that is, people are
hungry), and careened around the calle like the Marx Brothers while
singing sardonically about corruption, poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to Montevideo, the country's capital, we spent
Friday night at Club Atletico Tabare in the Buceo barrio to see the
famed murga group ``Reina de La Teja,'' or Queen of the
Neighborhood, which has toured in parts of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While a desfile attracts everyone, murgas used to draw only the
poorer people to performances and have become a chic entertainment
attended by the upper classes. In this small neighborhood where it
seemed every resident turned out for a show on the other side of
the planet from the United States, a skit about President Bill
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was prominent as the second act and
received uproarious applause.
</P>
<P>
   The song was a bizarre North American intrusion on my escapist
reverie that was Uruguay. Otherwise my journey was an exotic and
sunny escapade, and the Carnaval was just one highlight.

   Days began with Parisian-style breakfasts of bizcocho
(croissants), followed by a climb into the navy blue Hyundai van
that held eight (grandparents, my friends and their teen-age sons)
and took us on a c-shaped tour of the western and southern sections
of the country. We enjoyed luxurious beach living on the
southeastern coast (the Uruguayan Riviera) and bounced along in the
dark on our way to Tacuarembo on a 40-mile rocky path that maps
described as a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with native speakers is the best way to learn about
subtle aspects of a culture, things like the rivalries between
Uruguayans and the superior mind-set of the Argentines;
understanding the jokes during a rapid-fire theatrical performance
on a bus ride around the old section of Montevideo; which pastas
contain sesos, or cows' brains, considered a delicacy, and that
tipping more than 10 percent is considered a week's wages for some.
</P>
<P>
   During the 10-day trip my hosts took me to pueblos in the
northern Artigas state that are not in any guidebook ... places
where there is not even a plaza, police station or church, only a
school and general store, where gasoline is sold from a glass jar.
</P>
<P>
   Often we were the only game in those dusty towns, and our
late-model vehicle stood out among the decades-old cars and trucks
that appeared well maintained and were painted far more brightly
than their original colors.
</P>
<P>
   Though education is mandatory through only the sixth grade, the
country claims a 98 percent literacy rate. ``Even gauchos need to
count,'' my friends said. Speaking of South American cowboys, some
were more handsome than Antonio Banderas, and adhered to a unique
sartorial style of bloused pants, ponchos and three-cornered or
flat-brim hats.
</P>
<P>
   When not on horseback they wore fabric espadrilles and because
they eat even more beef than the average Uruguayan, their huge
carving knives, strapped to the small of their backs on wide
leather belts, were often visible ... a fierce aspect that belied
their friendly demeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days was too brief, despite my host's efforts to present the
variety of Uruguay, and I feel compelled to return, an indication
of a successful and soul-nourishing trip.

MONUMENT-ARIZONA (Flagstaff, Ariz.) - A new national monument
proposed for northwest of the Grand Canyon should be twice as large
as originally envisioned by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the
head of a prominent Flagstaff environmental group said Monday. The
Grand Canyon Trust wants to make the proposed Shivwits National
Monument nearly 1 million acres, almost the size of Grand Canyon
National Park. Opponents call the monument ``Land Grab II.''
Ranchers, miners and others _ still steaming over the 1996
designation of a national monument in southern Utah _ protested the
proposal at a town hall meeting in Flagstaff on Monday night. By
STEVE YOZWIAK. Storyr will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PARK-ARIZONA (Ajo, Ariz.) - Most small-town residents in
southwestern Arizona can appreciate the pristine Sonoran Desert's
natural beauty. To a point, they even want to preserve it. The
desire to preserve stops short of depriving personal freedoms, some
Ajo and Gila Bend residents declare. They're speaking of a group of
40 mainly Tucsonians and Phoenicians who want to convert more than
3 million acres of sonoran desert into a national park. ``If they
get through with this (national park) it's going to destroy the
community,'' said Ajo resident and activist Bud Klinefelter. By
SETH LANDAU. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BABBITT-GRANDJURY (Washington) - The independent counsel
investigating Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has convened a grand
jury and is looking inside the White House to determine whether
politics influenced a decision on an Indian casino, The Republic
has learned. The existence of the grand jury has not previously
been reported. One of the witnesses who has been called is Loretta
Avent of Phoenix, a former deputy assistant for Indian Affairs to
President Clinton. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HAGGARD-MUSIC (Phoenix) - It comes as a surprise to hear Merle
Haggard, one of America's most gifted songwriters, proclaim,
``There's nothing I hate worse than perfect music.'' After all,
what could be more perfect than the heartfelt lyrics of the
country-music standards penned by Haggard over four decades. But
there he is, on the phone from his home in northern California,
expressing concern that country music in the '90s has had its roots
polished right out of it. By LARRY RODGERS. Story moved in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
COMPUTER-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Ack! I've been attacked by a killer
Trojan worm! Yes, you read that right. We consumers would call it a
virus. But experts in Computing Land say the correct term is either
``Trojan'' or ``worm.'' (I added the ``killer'' part for fun!). By
DAVID HOYE. Story moved in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FUENTES (Phoenix, Ariz.) - Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes now wears
the literary mantle he inherited last year after the death of
Octavio Paz. But although acclaimed as the grand old man of Mexican
letters, Fuentes, 70, is still as productive and in demand as ever,
having just produced a new novel, ``The Years of Laura Diaz.'' By
BARBARA YOST. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;

 &HT;    ACCUSED IOC MEMBER BASHES INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, INVESTIGATOR
 &HT;    EDs: With optional add at 600 words.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (s) Sports categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The most prominent IOC member targeted
for expulsion in the Salt Lake City bidding scandal went on the
offensive Monday saying the investigation that implicated him was
fatally flawed and motivated by internal politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is fighting about the succession after (IOC President
Juan Antonio) Samaranch retires,'' said Jean-Claude Ganga, the
member from Congo and president of the association of African
Olympic committees. ``Maybe it's because I have a little influence
with the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga's aggressive stand could preview what the IOC's leadership
will face Thursday when it pushes the full membership to expel six
members on allegations that they accepted bribes or improper gifts
during Salt Lake's successful campaign for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   With 91 IOC members attending the emergency session called to
respond to the Salt Lake crisis, it will take 61 votes to expel.
While many IOC members say they expect the full committee to follow
the lead of the executive board, there is the chance that Ganga and
others of the accused could muster the 31 votes needed to block
their ouster. This would be interpreted as a disaster for Samaranch
and the IOC leadership, which is under extreme pressure from
sponsors and the public to take substantial steps in response to
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, speaking to reporters in the lobby of the Lausanne Palace
hotel, refused to name the orchestrators of the campaign against
him but implied strongly that he suspects Dick Pound, the Canadian
IOC member who chaired the inquiry commission that recommended
Ganga's expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga denied he did anything improper and said he has documents
to support his case. He said the Pound commission's investigation
was done hastily and overlooked facts that would exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the things they say I have done wrong, they cannot
prove,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that Pound was out to get him because of Pound's own
ambitions to become IOC president, which Ganga would oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the members of the Pound commission -- Pound, Jacques
Rogge of Belgium and Pal Schmitt of Hungary -- have long been
considered successors to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   One of the members implicated in the Salt Lake scandal is Kim Un
Yong, the South Korean member who also has been mentioned as a
candidate to replace Samaranch, whose term expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, whom Ganga supports, was issued a strong warning by Pound's
commission, which stopped just short of seeking to expel him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim did nothing wrong,'' Ganga said. ``They want to kill him
because he is a candidate for IOC president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga also suggested that Pound's enmity may date back to the
1976 Montreal Olympics when Ganga orchestrated a damaging boycott
by African countries. Pound was a member of the Montreal organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Pound denied that he had any ulterior
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as a lawyer, if you have a case with bad facts, you
attack the law,'' Pound said. ``If you have a case with bad law,
you attack the facts. If you have a case that has bad facts and law
you attack the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound rejected the argument that the IOC could have avoided such
complaints by appointing an outside investigator to review the
allegations rather than relying on an internal committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied both personally and as chair of this ad hoc
commission that the work that was done was thorough, impartial and
independent,'' he said. ``The ability to self-govern has been
conclusively demonstrated as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound added that his commission heard Ganga's assertions and
still voted to expel him.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, an independent auditor in Sydney said the city's
successful bid for the 2000 Olympics involved numerous breaches of
IOC guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But the auditor, Tom Sheridan, criticized the IOC rules
governing bids, saying the guidelines are unclear and ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan found Danish IOC delegate Niels Holst-Sorensen and his
wife traveled from Copenhagen to Paris to watch the 1993 French
Open tennis final at the invitation of Australian IOC member Phil
Coles, who also worked with the bid committee. Their air travel and
associated expenses were paid for by Sydney's bid.
</P>
<P>
   The bid also paid for Irish IOC member Kevin O'Flanagan and his
brother to travel from Dublin to London for the 1992 Wimbledon
final. Sydney paid their air travel, accommodation, theater tickets
and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan named a number of other IOC members who received
special treatment or gifts from the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said breaches of the IOC guidelines included the value
of gifts given to IOC members, the duration of visits, the number
of overseas trips made by Sydney bid members to lobby IOC officials
and assistance in finding jobs for members' relatives.

MARINE'S DESERT BASE DISCHARGED HIGH NUMBER OF HOMOSEXUAL TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Marine Corps base at Twentynine Palms in
California's Mojave Desert had the highest number of Marines
discharged for homosexuality last year, according to figures
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines fired 76 homosexual troops in 1998 throughout the
force; 12 male and four female Marines were discharged at
Twentynine Palms.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Pendleton, Calif., the Marines fired 10 male and two
female troops for homosexuality during the same period. At Camp
Lejeune, N.C., seven male troops and five female troops were
dismissed for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon figures on specific military installations were
provided by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a leading gay
rights legal organization based here. The group obtained them from
Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps spokeswoman Capt. Aisha Bakkar-Poe said the service
couldn't explain the relatively high number of homosexual
discharges at the desert facility. ``We'd be speculating to say
why,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakkar-Poe said the Marine Corps considers sexual orientation
``a personal and private matter (that) is not a bar to continued
service unless manifested by homosexual statements or conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Twentynine Palms, which occupies about 900 square miles of
desert, hosts large-scale infantry, artillery and armor exercises
to test the military preparedness of Marine Corps units.
</P>
<P>
   Located an hour's drive from Palm Springs and near the 500,000
acre Joshua Tree National Monument, the base, known as the Marine
Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, is home to the service's
communications and electronics school and about 9,600 military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's current policy of ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' means that homosexual activity is banned in the military,
but that gays and lesbians may serve as long as they keep quiet
about their sexual orientation and aren't caught engaged in
homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders may not inquire of a service member's sexual
orientation, according to the rules. However, they may do so if
they have ``credible information'' that a service member engages in
homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pentagon efforts to clarify the policy, homosexual
rights organizations maintain that gays and lesbians in the ranks
who conceal their sexuality are routinely drummed out.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the armed forces discharged homosexual personnel in
record numbers last year despite the Clinton administration's
controversial policy aimed at allowing gays and lesbians to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the military, there were 1,145 personnel discharged
in 1998 for homosexuality, compared with 997 personnel the previous
year. The 1998 total was the highest level since 1987 when 1,380
men and women were released, according to Pentagon data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Air Force let go 414 gay and lesbian personnel. The
Army discharged 310 personnel, while the Navy released 345 sailors.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent the largest number of homosexuals
discharged from the military since President Clinton's
controversial ``don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue'' policy went
into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network believes contends that
the increase is due to an increase in anti-gay harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The group documented 400 cases of anti-gay harassment in the
military last year, including death threats, compared with 182
violations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the legal group, said
Monday that homosexual personnel ``are forced between hiding under
this blanket of fear and anxiety from harassment every day or
coming out and being fired for who they are.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I am a 58-year-old maintenance worker
with 33 years of experience in my field. I have had many interviews
for better jobs. Every time the interviewer says I would fit the
job well. Often one uses the word ``great,'' but then I get a
letter saying someone else was picked. I am in very good health,
happy and a great worker, but I am feeling left behind because of
my age. What can I do? L.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You indicated that you are a great worker and the
interviewers often say you are great, but then you get rejected,
and that's not great. Unfortunately, it is possible that a company
may foolishly, recklessly and illegally exclude you because of your
age. If that is the case, there are governmental agencies that can
help. However, the fact that you are having successful interviews
with several companies before the rejections can indicate that
something else might be happening here.
</P>
<P>
   For example, perhaps you are receiving a less-than-great
reference from a former employer, or perhaps, after the glow of the
interview has dimmed, there is something about your work history
that troubles potential employers.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the best step is to try to find out what the
problem is. In the event you are rejected again, one approach is to
call the interviewer, say how much you enjoyed talking with him or
her, and ask what happened. You may get a hint or two that can make
something better happen next time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am fairly new in this company. People are paged on a
loud-speaker system that is wired into every office. These
interruptions are loud, and they make it hard for me to
concentrate, talk on the phone and contribute in meetings. The
people who have been here for a while seem to ignore it, but it
goes right through me. Do you have any suggestions? P.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you stop what you are doing right now, you can hear other
noises. Perhaps there are people talking, a heater whirring or
phones ringing, but you are used to them and can block them out.
Depending upon volume and content, such sounds generally turn into
background noise.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are volume levels so great that some noises start
out in the foreground and never leave, the kind of system you are
describing sounds like one that is likely to blend in after a
while. The best approach is for you to concentrate on your work and
let some time pass.
</P>
<P>
   It should not be long before your mind automatically blocks out
all of the pages except those for you. If the paging is incredibly
intrusive, however, and several of your associates as well as you
cannot block it out, then perhaps it would be a sound decision for
you to discuss some paging alternatives with management.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After doing some salary research, I feel that I am
considerably underpaid. I like my job, but I if I look for another
job, is it wise to say to the interviewer that I need to obtain a
higher salary? Also, my boss once told me to tell her if I'm ever
looking for another job. Should I actually tell her? M.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you have jumped to the finish line before
running the race. You are not finished in this job. In fact, rather
than looking for a job, you are looking for money in a job you
enjoy, and that should be the topic of a discussion with your boss.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing so, it is important to remember that research on
pay levels can lead to some mixed messages. For example, another
company may be paying more for the same job, but perhaps the
benefits are grossly inferior or the company may be a totally
undesirable place to work. Be sure to compare apples with apples,
not apples with lemons.
</P>
<P>
   If your research still indicates that your paycheck is not up to
par, then you should tell your boss that you are concerned with the
comparability and equity of your pay. You can provide some specific
data, but be sure to mention points that demonstrate the value that
you add to the organization, such as your productivity, expertise,
continuing education or informal leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If the pay issue is not resolved and you decide to leave as a
result, you can say so to a potential employer. In fact, this can
be interpreted as a sign of confidence and self-worth on your part,
and that can pay off in a job interview.

THE WORLD NEEDS MORE EINSTEINS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REA LUBAR DUNCAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was April 1954, and I had gone to see Albert
Einstein at his home in Princeton, N.J., to ask if he would accept
an achievement award from Lord &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a Lord &AMP; Taylor?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   And would he make an acceptance address at a luncheon at the
Waldorf?
</P>
<P>
   This was during the tyrannical reign of Sen. Joseph McCarthy,
the Wisconsin Republican who was trying, all too successfully, to
destroy the careers and ruin the lives of non-conformist thinkers
he stigmatized as communists.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with bravery that the late Dorothy Shaver, then
president of Lord &AMP; Taylor, dared to present the store's awards
that year to ``intellectual adventurers whose non-conformist
thinking had opened new worlds of thought and accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   I presented to her my suggested winners, among them newsman
Edward R. Murrow whose rambunctious adventuring on television
helped topple McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've left out the greatest intellectual adventurer of our
time,'' she snapped. ``Einstein. Get him.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bernard Shaw called Einstein, who died April 18, 1955,
``a maker of universes,'' ranking him with Pythagorus, Ptolemy,
Kepler, Copernicus, Aristotle, Galileo and Newton. The atom bomb,
as we called it then, was, of course, his brainchild. And, in the
10 years he lived after the first bomb shattered Hiroshima, he was
sickened from self-torment that perhaps he had been a destroyer,
not a maker of universes.
</P>
<P>
   I saw him as neither, but rather as a gentle host of astonishing
modesty, roguish humor and insatiable curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was arranged. But the question remained, would
Einstein accept such a ``commercial'' award?
</P>
<P>
   Entering Einstein's house, I trembled with fright. Downstairs
all was darkly somber, the parlor furnished with brown mohair
furniture and tall, heavy, carved, German-style wooden chairs.
</P>
<P>
   But upstairs, in the professor's study, all was sunshine and
bright from a great picture window. It looked out on the garden,
where a dogwood tree was in full snowy bloom and daffodils were
golden.
</P>
<P>
   The professor greeted me from a well-worn brownish upholstered
arm chair. He looked _ well, like Einstein. Wispy white hair, a
threadbare jacket the color of rotten spinach over a gray
sweatshirt. Shoes but no socks.
</P>
<P>
   I was so nervous, I had to smoke. Would the professor mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, no, I will take one from you.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't smoke it. Instead, he unrolled the cigarette and
carefully poured every grain of tobacco into a battered cold pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professor is not allowed to smoke,'' said his housekeeper,
Miss Dukas. ``It's bad for him.''
</P>
<P>
   When she left to make tea, he whispered, ``If you send some
tobacco to this address, I will get it.'' It was the house next
door.
</P>
<P>
   I never sent any. How could I risk shortening by even a moment
the earthly stay of this rare human being who, although he well
knew his self-worth, had no self-illusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago I thought I was very important,'' he said,
``but I long ago grew out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, talking about scholars who risked their careers to pursue
unpopular ideas, he said, ``I do not deserve this award. I take no
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the risk of pursuing a theory for years and having
it lead nowhere?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is no risk,'' he said giggling. ``That is the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally I got up the nerve to ask: Would he accept the award?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But no, he would not attend the luncheon. He was in poor health
and made few public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   I was devastated. My job was to get him there. Sensing my
plight, he said, his blue eyes twinkling, ``Make me a
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought fast. Would he record his acceptance remarks to be
played at the luncheon? He would. I still have the recording.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that five awards be given instead of the customary
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some young non-conformist must not lose recognition because of
an old one like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now picture me, a person who barely scraped through college
physics, having to describe Einstein's achievements for the
presentation speech _ including, my God, the theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   With dread, I phoned him and read him the segment for approval.
</P>
<P>
   There was an ominous silence, then came his wondrous giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it stand,'' he said. ``No one will know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   With typical humor, his acceptance remarks began, ``It gives me
great pleasure, indeed, to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible
non-conformist warmly acclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, professor, the world has need of you now.

CARLOS FUENTES HAS MADE MARK AS WRITER, DIPLOMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - From his home in the south of Mexico City, Carlos
Fuentes can see the volcanoes of the Ajusco Mountains spewing
plumes of white steam.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, craters like Popocatepetl have been
``rumbling fiercely,'' the venerable writer says, a phenomenon that
disturbs him not in the least.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico itself has been rumbling since the revolution of 1910,
providing Fuentes with the themes of political and social turmoil
that permeate his acclaimed novels, including ``The Death of
Artemio Cruz'' and ``Where the Air Is Clear.''
</P>
<P>
   At 70, he takes rumbling in stride. Comfortable wearing the
literary mantle passed to him after the death last year of Octavio
Paz, the graceful and erudite Fuentes now is considered the grand
old man of Mexican letters, though he shudders a little at the
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not old!'' he protests with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he has just published a new novel, ``The Years of Laura
Diaz,'' which looks at Mexican history through the eyes of women.
It is a companion piece, he says, to ``Artemio Cruz.'' Sales have
been brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Could this work finally earn him the Nobel Prize, which has
continued to elude him despite his winning nearly every other
literary prize in Latin America?
</P>
<P>
   He dismisses such notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever thinks about winning a Nobel Prize,'' Fuentes says
by telephone in the flawless English he learned while being
educated in the United States. ``One doesn't write to win prizes
but for the pleasure of writing.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 45 years, Fuentes has had the pleasure of writing
as one of the luminaries of the ``El Boom'' generation of Latin
American authors who came to prominence in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of his colleagues have passed on, Fuentes endures,
bridging the gap to what he calls the ``Boomerang'' of
up-and-coming poets and novelists.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation includes such writers as Alberto Rios, 46, a
regents professor at Arizona State University in Tempe who teaches
creative writing and Latin American literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love his poetry,'' Fuentes says of Rios.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuentes' ideas are big ideas,'' Rios says. ``He is urbane and
persuasive. He is a charming man. When he comes into a room, you
know it. He has a lot of energy, a lot of poise, a good sense of
humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios hopes to reacquaint himself with Fuentes when the elder
writer appears at ASU in Tempe on Monday, March 22, to deliver the
Centennial Lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Fuentes was the first guest of the Centennial
Lecture series, sponsored by the Flinn Foundation. Fuentes says he
has ``warm memories'' of Tempe and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a trip to Arizona inspired his writing of ``The Old
Gringo,'' a story in which American author Ambrose Bierce finds
himself in the midst of the Mexican revolution confronting Pancho
Villa. The story is based partly on history. Bierce, indeed, did
disappear into Mexico around the turn of the century and never was
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Gringo'' became the 1989 American film of the same name,
starring Gregory Peck as Bierce and Jimmy Smits as Villa.
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask Fuentes his opinion of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not speak of that,'' he says sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes easily can afford one bad movie treatment of one fine
novel. His status is secure not only as a writer of fiction but
also as a journalist and diplomat as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he served as Mexico's ambassador to France and
consistently has shouldered the responsibility of interpreting the
culture and politics of Mexico for the world outside its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been an articulate spokesman for the cultural,
political and social relations between the U.S. and Mexico,'' says
David Foster, regents professor of Spanish and chairman of ASU's
languages and literatures department.
</P>
<P>
   Foster says Fuentes has devoted his career to expounding on the
``vast panorama of Mexico,'' which Foster characterizes as a
diverse people who do not always share even the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done that brilliantly,'' Foster says.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes agrees that his beloved Mexico is a complex society. It
is a mix of Indian, Iberian, Greek, Roman and mestizo heritage.
Fuentes' own great-great-grandparents came from Spain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He prides himself on being one of the first Mexican writers to
be in touch with an American audience, which long has embraced his
intellectual writings.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuentes warns that the United States has become more
isolationist since the end of the Cold War, concerned mostly with
``itself, its scandals and with entertainment . . . Madonna and
Bruce Willis.''
</P>
<P>
   Though America and Mexico share a common border, they also share
misconceptions about each other.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, Mexicans view Americans as vulgar and loud,
Fuentes says. Up north, Americans see Mexicans as shiftless, lazy
and unruly. He says neither stereotype is true.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans ultimately admire the culture of the United States, but
they have been frequent victims of its lumbering foreign policies
and trade practices, he believes, especially during the War of
1848.
</P>
<P>
   Two incendiary issues, illicit drugs and illegal immigration,
continue to divide the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems can be solved with diplomacy and goodwill,'' he
insists.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes' penchant for promoting diplomacy and goodwill is his
personal choice, not a professional mandate. He believes a writer's
duty is only to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``A writer's obligation is to language and imagination, to
create a new realism in the imagination,'' he says. ``The purpose
of a novel is to extend the consciousness of your reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Fuentes is fluent in English, French, Italian and
Portuguese, he writes only in Spanish. Though a rich language for
literature, English is not the tongue of his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dream in English. I don't make love in English. I
don't get mad in English. That's why I don't write in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, he executes most of his writing in the most
English-speaking of countries. With homes in Mexico and England, he
spends six months of the year on the speaking circuit in Mexico and
then retreats to London for six months.
</P>
<P>
   That storied land of bad food and worse climate, he says,
provides a solitude that nurtures his creativity. In a city with no
distractions beyond the odd trip to the theater, the grand old man
of Mexican letters gets down to business.
</P>
<P>
   England swings, but it does not rumble. In London, Fuentes is
the only volcano. &QL;

 &HT;    COMPROMISE URGED IN STATE-FEDERAL FEUD OVER TOBACCO FUNDS
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Attorney General John Cornyn drew on a
childhood fable Monday as he asked Congress to keep the federal
government's hands off the money the states won by suing tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who joined officials of three other states before a
Senate Appropriations subcommittee, said the dispute over $206
billion reminded him of ``The Little Red Hen,'' who tried in vain
to get the Cat, the Rat and the Pig to help plant the grain,
harvest it and bake the bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused,'' Cornyn said, but the three were more than
willing to help eat the loaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is like the Cat, the Rat and the Pig,''
the Texas attorney general said of the Clinton administration's
effort to claim 57 percent of money yielded by a 46-state effort to
recover health-care expenses from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won, and that money is theirs,'' agreed Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, who is sponsoring a measure with Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., to keep all of the money in the states. The
provision has been added to an emergency supplemental spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
voiced ``strong opposition'' to the Bailey-Hutchison proposal
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal share of Medicaid expenses ranges from 50 percent
to 77 percent,'' she said in a letter to the Senate Appropriations
Committee. She added that the federal government is entitled to
recover its share of the expenses, or at least to direct how the
states spend the proceeds of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has told the state governors that they could
control the money, if they would spend 25 percent of it for
anti-smoking campaigns and follow his priorities, including helping
tobacco farmers, assisting children and promoting public health.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, an administration official testified that
the federal government is legally entitled to 57 percent of the
lawsuit proceeds. ``Existing federal law clearly requires states to
share all Medicaid recoveries with federal taxpayers,'' said Mike
Hash, deputy administrator for the Health Care Financing
Administration. ``Nothing in the law creates an exception for
tobacco settlements, regardless of their size.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks drew a vow from Hutchison, whose state of Texas won
$17.3 billion in the tobacco settlements. ``I'm going to try to
keep you from dictating to the states what they do with money
they've won fair and square,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
indicated that a compromise could be in the works. ``It may be that
we can reach an accommodation,'' he said. He predicted that a
majority of the Senate will favor ``some sort of guidance'' for the
states that does not set up restrictive regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison told reporters later that she would go along with a
``sense of the Congress'' measure that would make general
recommendations to the states. ``But a set-aside would be a very
difficult hurdle for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She said spending one-quarter of the funds for anti-smoking
campaigns could be excessive amount in large states. In Texas, that
amounts to more than $4 billion over 25 years. ``I don't think you
could spend it responsibly for smoking cessation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials urged a quick resolution of the dispute so
that they could begin spending their tobacco payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this issue is settled, I would not recommend spending
any of these funds,'' Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky told the
Senate panel. Iowa attorney general Tom Miller said that his state
was ``paralyzed'' until the issue is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are proceeding with plans for spending the funds,
even with the final control in doubt. Texas is proposing to spend
$881 million over the next two years for a variety of health care
and anti-smoking programs. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has proposed
using some of that state's $13 million settlement for tax cuts as
well as for anti-smoking efforts.

CALIF. REGENTS TO VOTE ON PLAN TO MAKE UNIVERSITY MORE ACCESSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They get nearly perfect grades, take honors
classes, hold student body offices and outside jobs. But for some
of the highest-achieving students in the state's inner city and
rural school districts, University of California appears hopelessly
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't attract my attention,'' said Claudia Pompa, one of
the top seniors at Fresno's Central High School this year. ``It's
too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the list of her accomplishments is long _ a 4.0 grade
point average, honors classes, membership in numerous student clubs
_ she hasn't requested a UC application and plans to go Cal State
Fresno, where she can live at home.
</P>
<P>
   This week the UC Regents are set to vote on a plan to make the
top 4 percent at every California high school eligible for the
university in an effort to draw more students from rural and
inner-city areas. But some counselors, administrators and students
say while they welcome the plan, it will take extra financial aid,
outreach and preparation to get them there.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers to UC are complex and costly. Many students from
poor families cannot afford the yearly $13,000 price tag to attend
UC and live on campus. Some fear, despite their own high grades,
that they are poorly prepared to compete with the state's best
students. And others simply do not have what's dubbed the ``UC
mind-set'': They may be the first in their family to attend college
of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that general lack of confidence and lack of feeling
they will do well,'' said Marigrace Cohen, head counselor at
Mission High School here, where several top students said they
believe UC is ``too much of a jump'' for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go from here to there,'' said Arlene Mitri, a
Mission High senior with a 3.85 grade point average, who has taken
honors classes and works outside school 25 hours a week. ``It's not
possible for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4 percent plan, backed by Gov. Gray Davis, is being hailed
by UC President Richard Atkinson as ``historic,'' and is expected
to be approved by regents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Through it, the university would identify the top 4 percent of
students in their junior year, then advise them on what courses to
take and what financial aid to seek in order to attend one of nine
campuses in the prestigious UC system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is one of three suggested changes to make the top 12.5
percent of students statewide eligible for UC, a state goal.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 11.1 percent of students statewide are eligible, but
that figure hovers between 5 and 6 percent in some inner cities and
rural areas like the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The other two major changes would alter the weight of SAT scores
and reduce by half the extra point given to students who take
Advanced Placement courses, which are not available at all high
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The 4 percent plan is not expected to change the racial
diversity at UC, where affirmative action was banned four years
ago. But it is an attempt to boost access among students who attend
high schools in disadvantaged regions.
</P>
<P>
   About 240 of the state's 858 high schools send few students to
UC and about 50 send none.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving what school administrators call the UC mind-set,
however, will not be simple. Even UC-Riverside Professor Keith
Widaman, who heads the faculty committee that drew up the
recommendations for regents, said he didn't consider UC as a young
student growing up in the Central Valley because of its size, cost
and distance from his home.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest obstacle to UC cited by students and counselors is
lack of money. Indeed, even Regent Ward Connerly, the architect of
the ban on affirmative action at UC, said he worries that without a
commitment to provide financial aid for needy students, the
proposal won't help broaden access to universities.

GEPHARDT BACKS GORE FOR PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H _ Armed with the endorsement of a former rival,
Vice President Al Gore dropped by two key primary states Monday to
promote an array of domestic initiatives and ignite his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gore received the endorsement of House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who opted last month to
sit out the 2000 presidential race and instead concentrate on
winning back the House for Democrats and becoming the chamber's
next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Gephardt faced each other in the 1988
presidential primary and have differed in the past on a number of
issues, particularly on trade policy, the House leader lavished
praise on the almost-certain candidate at a rally of Democratic
supporters at the New Hampshire Institute of the Arts and Science.
</P>
<P>
   Countering the stereotype of Gore as a stiff policy wonk,
Gephardt said he had seen the vice president ``react as a father
and a husband'' when his son was seriously injured by an automobile
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that Gore ``cares most deeply about what happens to all
of the people,'' Gephardt said, ``I am here today to say that I
will make my fight putting Al Gore into the presidency of the
United States.``
</P>
<P>
   While Gore acknowledged that the two men occasionally fought, he
said they were ``almost always on the same side.``
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt later flew with Gore to Iowa, where Gephardt has a
strong political organization, and then to the congressman's
hometown of St. Louis, where the two were scheduled to dine at one
of Gephardt's favorite Italian restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, Gore picked up 67 endorsements of state
politicians and Democratic activists.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's support for Gore was a setback to former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the only Democrat who is currently
challenging Gore for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And aides said the endorsement was meant to show a unified
Democratic Party in contrast to the Republicans, who face a bitter
primary fight that, at the moment, features a dozen high-profile
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But two of those Republican candidates who announced exploratory
committees last week, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Elizabeth
Hanford Dole, have received an unusual amount of publicity so early
in the campaign cycle and, at this early stage, polls show they
appear to hold more appeal with voters than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Fox News poll, taken March 10-11 among 900
registered voters nationwide, Bush led Gore 59 percent to 30
percent. Dole led Gore 50 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a Zogby International survey of 908 likely voters conducted
March 4-7, Bush bested Gore 55 percent to 38 percent. The Zogby
poll did not test a Dole-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not officially announced his intentions to run
for president, Gore's trip to New Hampshire and later to Iowa
appeared a concerted effort to focus attention on his upcoming
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Urging supporters to ``stand with me,'' Gore laid out a domestic
plan heavy with Clinton administration proposals, such as hiring
new teachers and protecting Medicare and Social Security. He also
offered a handful of new proposals, the most prominent being the
promise to provide preschool education for all children.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to core Democratic constituencies, Gore stressed equal
pay regardless of gender, more progress on racial harmony, and
attention to the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Long known for his environmental activism, Gore briefly touched
on proposals to reduce global warming and curb urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But criticized by Republicans for what they consider
environmental extremism, Gore justified some of these plans as an
extension of solid family values. He said curbing growth would
allow people ``to spend more time with friends and families than
stuck on the road.``
</P>
<P>
   Eager to carve out his own political identity, Gore largely
avoided mention of Clinton. But at the same time he made it clear
he hoped to benefit from the economic prosperity that has kept
Clinton's approval ratings astronomically high.
</P>
<P>
   In a theme that advisers said would be a mainstay of his
campaign, the vice president indirectly warned of the economic
downturn that could occur if the White House was turned over to the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not slow down our economy. Let's not go back to some
failed prescription of the past,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sidestepped any talk of two areas that could prove
troublesome, the recent impeachment of Clinton and foreign affairs,
where the administration is currently embroiled in controversies
over China and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked if impeachment would factor into the
campaign, the vice president responded,``The American people want
to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point supporters who had been listening burst into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Gore adviser Bob Squier said he believed the economic message
would be powerful in the 2000 campaign and would help propel Gore
past Republicans such as Bush and Dole. Early polls show both
potential candidates leading Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Squier dismissed these early polls arguing that Bush and Dole
are ``two big brand names.``
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic consultant said voters currently do not see Gore
as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see him right now as part of Clinton Gore. ... He is not
thought of in presidential terms,'' Squier said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was unconcerned about his current underdog standing
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits me fine,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a computer glitch kept thousands of customers unsatisfied,
wouldn't any company be embarrassed?
</P>
<P>
   Not E-Trade, the brash Internet stock brokerage company. It
ended its shareholder meeting last week with an elaborate video
montage of the news coverage of its three days of trading halts in
February. While Christos M. Cotsakos, the company's chief
executive, acknowledged that E-Trade had to prevent such problems
from recurring, he used the video mainly as a rousing affirmation
of E-Trade's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies have had systems issues, but we were the only
company to get worldwide coverage in virtually every media,''
Cotsakos said in an interview last week. ``The degree to which we
have been recognized as a leader in this space is unequaled. And
that is something we should be very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   That is typical bravado from Cotsakos, who likes to say he is
not simply running a company but rather leading a ``revolution that
is turning into a movement'' as online trading grows to account for
one in every seven stock trades in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cotsakos wants his revolutionaries to charge from the stock
exchange to the shopping mall and the television station. E-Trade,
he said, is becoming a ``digital financial media company'' that
will offer financial transactions, information, advertising and
electronic shopping over the Internet, cable television and even
wireless hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he wants to marry the media aspirations of Internet
portals like Yahoo with the dream of building a financial
supermarket. Oh, yes, Cotsakos also wants E-Trade to foment this
movement in more than 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by fighting on so many fronts, Cotsakos risks giving up the
ground that E-Trade has already won in the brokerage business,
where competition from Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Merrill Lynch
is growing more intense. He has even sacrificed E-Trade's position
as one of the few profitable Internet companies in order to spend
as much as $150 million on an extravagant marketing blitz meant to
attract a million new customers during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christos has the most expansive vision of what an online
trading company can become,'' said Bill Burnham, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston. ``But that kind of aggressive attitude,
being willing to try stuff that other people don't think is
completely baked, is a double-edged sword. They could be throwing
money down a black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors certainly found the timing of the marketing plan
half-baked. It was announced last summer just as a market slump
raised fears that volume at stockbrokers would dry up. E-Trade's
shares fell to $6 in October, adjusted for a recent 2-for-1 split,
from $17.25 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos readily acknowledges he has had some selling to do, but
that is what he is good at.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are making money, how do you convince shareholders that
by losing money you will increase value in the long run?'' Cotsakos
asked in an earlier interview. ``With absolute, sheer
fundamentalist dedication, I said the only way we would be
successful was to take big bold risks and to move very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the company's stock has bounced back, buoyed by the surging
market and some early positive return on the marketing campaign.
The shares closed Monday at $54.125, giving E-Trade a market value
of $6.2 billion _ now larger than that of Paine Webber, a more
conventional brokerage firm. Perhaps more important, investors have
come to realize that Cotsakos' plan to lose lots of money to
finance rapid growth resembles the strategy of highly valued
Internet companies like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christos has turned E-Trade from a brokerage play to an
Internet play,'' noted Julio Gomez, who runs a consulting firm
focused on electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   Not all investors are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christos rubs institutional investors one of two ways,''
Burnham, the First Boston analyst said. ``Some are caught up in the
vision. Others are turned off and say he's a self-promoter who
doesn't know anything about the blocking and tackling of the
brokerage business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some competitors acknowledge that so far E-Trade has
been able to deliver on most of its grandiose promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have thrown the long pass, and then to my surprise, they
have run forward to catch it every time,'' said the head of a major
online brokerage operation who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 UNDATED: of anonymity.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Cotsakos, 50, joined E-Trade just before its initial public
offering in 1996, he knew nothing of Wall Street. But he brought a
passionate leadership style, built on his experience as an Army
squad leader in Vietnam and honed by his failure to make it as an
actor.
</P>
<P>
   After his acting career stumbled, he signed on as a $3-an-hour
package handler at Federal Express. He worked his way up rapidly
and was assigned to run the company's operations in Continental
Europe in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was hired to run the European operations of A.C.
Nielson, the big market research company. He rose to become
president but left the company just before its owner, Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet, took it public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nielson was not successful when Cotsakos was there,'' said
James D. Dougherty, an analyst with Paine Webber who has long
followed the company. ``He banked all the company's future on
whiz-bang silver-bullet software that just never worked.''
(Cotsakos said Dun &AMP; Bradstreet would not invest the money needed
to realize his plans.)
</P>
<P>
   At E-Trade Group, based in Palo Alto, Calif., Cotsakso draws
from both his military and theatrical experience to practice what
one employee calls ``management by revival meeting.'' He eschews
formal meetings for what he calls ``swarms,'' more informal
sessions in which employees buzz briefly about dealing with a
problem. And he will surprise his executives with sudden changes in
strategy, such as replacing E-Trade's somber gold-and-black logo
last year with a hip and decidedly unfinancial green and purple
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will take your breath away,'' said Lisa Nash, a vice
president for marketing. ``That's part of his management style.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos hired a management team drawn largely from outside
financial services, and they have brought some unconventional
ideas. Debra J. Chrapaty, who was recruited from the National
Basketball Association, has built a computer system based on a
network of dozens of small workstation computers _ unusual in
finance services, which typically relies on mainframes to keep
customer data secure.
</P>
<P>
   The company's marketing is in the hands of Jerry Gramaglia, who
was recruited from Sprint. Last week, he hired Omnicom Group's
Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, the advertising agency that
produced the ``Got milk?'' campaign, to create a successor to
E-Trade's long-running ``Someday we'll all invest this way''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign began when E-Trade's $20 commission level
differentiated it from its more expensive competitors. But now
competitors like Fidelity and Schwab have lowered their prices. And
deep discounters have emerged, like Datek and Ameritrade, with
commissions under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Full-service firms like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Donaldson
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, are offering
research and advice along with online trading. And Schwab, which
has become the leading online broker despite $30 commissions, is
devoting considerable effort to offering advice and hand-holding to
lure customers from firms like Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade does not fear being caught in the middle as the leader
in neither price nor service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab's position is that most people who come online are
clueless and need a broker as a security blanket,'' Gramaglia said.
``That is not whom we target. We believe that most customers are
smart enough and capable enough to control their own investments
once we give them the same tools that brokers have.''
</P>
<P>
   An expanded tool kit is the centerpiece of the company's
expensive new strategy: Destination E-Trade. It has refashioned its
Internet site to offer casual visitors as well as customers all
sorts of up-to-the-minute information, research, bulletin boards
and other investing tools, at a cost to E-Trade of several dollars
a month for each ``member.'' It is modeled on the popular finance
channels of Yahoo and the other portals, where E-Trade was
advertising at ever increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being held hostage to someone else's distribution
channel,'' Cotsakos said. ``It was getting very costly if you
didn't own your own distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The results from E-Trade's refurbished Web site have so far been
mixed. In the last three months of 1998, E-Trade spent $41 million
in marketing, including the cost of the site, TV commercials and
inducements like $50 rebates for people who opened accounts. That
has brought in 500,000 members and 97,000 new brokerage accounts
(excluding the low-margin corporate options business), according to
Burnham, the First Boston analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to a cost of $404 to lure each new core brokerage
account. Since Burnham estimates that the average account will
produce only $526 in profits over the life of the customer, E-Trade
may have little to show for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, however, says it can make two or three times that by
finding other ways to profit from an affluent customer base. It
will expand its own site with banking, mutual funds and other
services. And it will sell advertising and generate commissions
from referring customers to other online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the move into advertising has been disappointing,
Cotsakos acknowledges, bringing in less than $200,000 in the most
recent quarter. But he argues that ad revenue will grow quickly,
now that the company has expanded its sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos also wants to offer a greater range of products to
corporations and institutions. The company has invested in
E-Offering, an investment bank backed by Sanford Robertson, to
compete with Wall Street investment bankers in initial public
offerings. And it plans to attract big institutional investors with
a service combining electronic stock trading with the sort of data
provided by Reuters and Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has also franchised its name and its systems for use by
brokerage firms in 33 countries. Currently, its affiliates have
opened in Canada and Australia. The company expects Britain, Japan
and a few others to follow this year.
</P>
<P>
   It took six months and a revived but still wobbly market in
Internet stocks for E-Trade to regain the confidence of investors.
But Cotsakos promises even more changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will morph again in a year,'' he said. It will start a new
``asterisk channel'' after E-Trade's logo, that is a combination of
CNBC and a sort of financial home shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the game from here is about interactive multimedia.
It's not the Internet. It's how you take the convergence of video,
voice and data on wireless phones, computers and television to give
people what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   For E-Trade, however, to be any more than an asterisk in the
history of finance, investors and analysts say it will also have
pay attention to the basics, making sure that last month's computer
problems do not happen regularly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by the breadth of stuff they are talking about
doing,'' said Burnham, ``But I hope that someone remembers to
complete the trades.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Ethnic Albanians said Monday that they were ready to
sign the Kosovo peace accord, but the signing was delayed while
mediators consulted the Serbs to see whether they would accept the
agreement with some minor changes, French officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the ethnic Albanian delegation said that if the
international sponsors of the talks began proposing changes to the
plan to end the violence in the Serbian province, the ethnic
Albanian promise could be nullified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to a document that has already been completed,''
said Veton Surroi, a leader of the Kosovo Albanian delegation.
``It's up to the mediators now to get Serb agreement to the
document.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord taken up when Kosovo peace talks resumed Monday in
Paris would grant the ethnic Albanians autonomy, disband their
guerrilla army and enforce the settlement with 28,000 NATO
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian side has accepted most of the political provisions
of the agreement but has refused to consider NATO peacekeepers to
enforce it, even though the alliance has threatened President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia with heavy bombing of Serbian
military targets if he does not agree.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian delegation took more than two weeks to
discuss the terms of the agreement, settled in talks at
Rambouillet, France, with representatives of their people, who
account for 90 percent of the population of Kosovo. They announced
their acceptance of the package only under considerable pressure
from the United States as fighting in Kosovo continued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you propose changes to the agreement the Kosovars have
accepted, you will take what had been a victory for British and
American diplomacy and turn it on its head,'' said Paul Williams, a
legal adviser to the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, and the British
foreign secretary, Robin Cook, co-chairmen of the peace conference,
which is also sponsored by the United States, Russia, Germany and
Italy, hailed the long-awaited acceptance of the terms by the
Kosovo Albanians as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav delegates are now up against the wall,'' Vedrine
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must now act quickly to make up for lost time,'' Cook
agreed at a news conference in the French Foreign Ministry, on the
other side of the Seine from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At the news session, the two officials portrayed the Serbs as
the main obstacle to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton praised the decision by the
ethnic Albanians and renewed the NATO threat to carry out air
strikes if Milosevic did not agree to the accord or if attacks on
civilians continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shows intransigence and aggression,'' Clinton said, ``I
think that from my point of view we would have little option'' but
to use force against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Clinton, Vedrine seemed almost to play down any
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO decisions remain in force,'' he said, ``and everyone
knows it. We have not as yet fixed a deadline. If there was one, it
would be very short.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in answer to a question, he added: ``There is a
finalization of the negotiations, which were quite far advanced in
Rambouillet, on the political side of the agreement. And that is
taking place between the Yugoslav delegation and the mediators.
Obviously, there is very little leeway.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said the mediators were not discussing changes
in the agreement with the Serbs but only trying to sound them out
about what changes they wanted and try to persuade them to accept
the agreement in principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know nothing basic or really important can be changed,''
one official said. ``But if they would agree, for example, to an
`international military force,' if not yet to a NATO force, then it
would be difficult to justify bombing them.''

 PARIS: bombing them.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underlying the differences is the fragility of agreement in the
six-nation ``Contact Group'' that is sponsoring the talks. The
allies would like Russia to participate in the eventual
peacekeeping force, but it is adamantly opposed to bombing the
Serbs to get them to agree to it. The United States is more ready
to use the threat of bombing than France is, but would leave most
of the peacekeeping to 14,000 French and British troops. Germany
and Italy are somewhere between France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kosovo Albanians proved far less willing to accept
allied guarantees of their security than the United States thought.
Even Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to persuade them
in Rambouillet last month to sign the agreement when it was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Williams said, ``The Kosovar Albanians have given an
unequivocal yes to the document.'' But, he added, ``The Kosovar
delegation was informed by the U.S. National Security Council last
week that there would be no changes to the agreement absent their
consent,'' and none had been discussed with them yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their acceptance Monday came in a letter to the co-chairmen from
Hashim Thaci, chairman of the Albanian delegation. ``This
delegation and I personally say `yes' to this agreement,'' he
wrote. ``We would be honored to sign this agreement in your
presence at a time and place of your choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the Albanians Monday afternoon, Vedrine and
Cook said, they sought and got reassurances that this meant
acceptance of both the peace terms and the NATO peacekeepers to
enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   European officials said they did not ask the Albanians to sign
right away because they wanted flexibility in dealing with the
Serbs to get them to accept the peace plan, an 82-page document
with provisions for a constitution, an ethnically representative
legislature, an independent police force and a multinational
NATO-led military force that would disarm the Kosovo Liberation
Army and oversee the withdrawal of all but 1,500 Serbian border
troops from the province within 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, it says, an international meeting would be
convened to discuss a final settlement for Kosovo, taking into
account ``the will of the people'' and the ``opinions of relevant
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's special envoy, the Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, said after Monday's talks ended, ``We are still
working on the political agreement. All those stories that the
agreement is finished are fake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unilateral signing does not mean anything,'' he said of
Albanian acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   And he and other Serbian delegates to the talks told
international mediators they would not accept foreign peacekeeping
forces on Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States have emphasized that any agreement
must include NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   About 26,000 soldiers, largely European, would oversee the
disengagement of Albanian and Serbian military and police forces in
Kosovo and supervise the withdrawal of all but 12,000 Serbian
Interior Ministry Police to withdraw within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers would be commanded by a British general with a
rear base of 2,000 support troops in Macedonia. Some 10,000 allied
soldiers and others are already gathering there now, ready to go in
within a week of a possible accord. The force is to include 4,000
U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   If the mediators conclude that Serbian refusal of the accord is
the main obstacle to ending a year of violence that has killed more
than 2,000 people and driven 200,000 from their homes, then the
alliance's secretary-general, Javier Solana, has been authorized to
send hundreds of warplanes against Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, visiting Washington Monday, said: ``If an agreement is
not reached and President Milosevic doesn't sign, the risk of a
catastrophe will be very likely, and we have to prevent that from
happening. And NATO will prevent that from happening.''

RESOLUTE TRAVELERS FIND THRILL IN TAKING A RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Helga Hahneiser vacationed in Cambodia while the
murderous Khmer Rouge still roamed the country, went sightseeing in
Lebanon near the Hezbollah guerrilla headquarters and visited Zaire
while leader Mobutu Sese Seko was railing against whites.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hahneiser is heading to Libya, which the United
States considers a rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Hahneiser, 57, is one of a growing number of people seeking rare
sights and unusual experiences on their vacations.
</P>
<P>
   In the tourism business, it is known as ``adventure travel.''
</P>
<P>
   While some vacationers crave physical thrills, such as glacier
skiing, others seek the excitement of mingling with unfamiliar
cultures, and exotic flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   Hahneiser is drawn to Libya _ and other countries deemed unsafe
by the U.S. government _ for their ancient archaeological sites,
which have not yet been overrun with busloads of
video-camera-toting tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived at the temple of Baalbek in Lebanon last year,
there were five Japanese tourists roaming through who left after an
hour,'' said Hahneiser, who lives near Los Angeles. ``After that I
had a splendid, incredible archaeological site all to myself. For
me, those are moments to accept a little bit of danger for.''
</P>
<P>
   A desire to travel to remote lands can lead to dangerous, even
deadly experiences _ as in Uganda recently when rebels killed eight
foreign tourists who were on a safari to see mountain gorillas in a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   The area had long been considered safe; 4,000 permits are issued
each year to visitors hoping for a glimpse of the elusive primates
portrayed in the movie ``Gorillas in the Mist.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the massacre, a London newspaper reported that rebels
had warned Ugandan officials in advance that they planned to target
British and American tourists. The threats were not passed along to
tour operators or diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young Pelton, author of ``The World's Most Dangerous
Places,'' said adventure-seeking travelers court disaster when they
travel to places without a political road map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although statistically it's safe in Uganda, people are
entering into areas where there isn't much security or control,''
he said. ``There are three wars going on in Uganda _ on its
northern, southern and western borders. Islamic fundamentalists are
seeking to destabilize the government, and they're using tourists
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two British men and an American woman died when Yemeni
troops stormed a terrorist hideout to rescue 16 foreign tourists
who had been abducted by Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   If the tourists had been familiar with the political situation
in that Middle Eastern country, they would never have chosen to
sightsee in that part of Yemen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started their trip four days after the United States
starting bombing Iraq,'' Pelton said. ``They went into the south of
Yemen, which is a hotbed of terrorists, after a fatwa (Islamic
edict) had been issued against British and Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But they wouldn't have found that out from a popular guidebook
that described Yemen as an exotic place that had calmed down and
was ready for tourists, Pelton said, noting that 160 foreigners
have been kidnapped in Yemen since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell tourists they are being parachuted in behind enemy
lines in a country, they would think twice about taking a bus tour
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelton, whose new book, ``Come Back Alive,'' will be released in
June, has become a magnet for accounts of tourists caught in a
country's political cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents happen on a regular basis now,'' he said.

<P>
   Jim Sano, president of Geographic Expeditions of San Francisco,
said his travel company takes special security precautions when
sending people to risky areas.
</P>
<P>
   The company hired armed escorts to go to Cambodia with a group
of wealthy people who had donated money to preserve Angkor Wat, an
ancient temple complex.
</P>
<P>
   Sano said the company outlines travel risks to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attach all the latest State Department information to our
predeparture materials,'' he said. ``When somebody signs up for a
trip with us, we also give them medical information and general
security information, like pickpocketing in capital cities, which
is a big deal in Mexico City right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sano said the company also relies on its partners in foreign
countries for up-to-date information on changing political
situations. Sometimes, the State Department calls Geographic
Expeditions for information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company cancels trips when the danger becomes too great.
</P>
<P>
   Sano said risk is part of all travel _ wherever vacationers go.
And their tolerance for risk varies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started going to Iran in 1993, the individuals who
signed up for those trips were in their 50s and 60s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't fit the typical profile of people who were willing
to take what was perceived as a risky trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel company does put some countries _ such as war-ravaged
Afghanistan _ off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we don't have partners on the ground there, and
we don't feel comfortable taking those kinds of risks,'' Sano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the Wild West there in terms of security concerns.
We could not guarantee anybody's safety.''

   BOSTON -- Scientists at the Whitehead Institute will be major
players in a new, accelerated phase of the drive to decode all the
genetic blueprints of man, creating a foundation for a new era of
biology and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research was notified Monday
it will receive $35 million from the federal government as one of
three US genetics facilities that aim to create a ``working draft''
of the human genome by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Human cells each contain about 70,000 genes that serve as
blueprints for making the proteins that build and operate the body.
Those genes, altogether, contain about 3 billion chemical units of
four types that spell out all the information that's inherited
through generations.
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, said Eric Lander, the director of the Whitehead
genome facility in Cambridge, Mass., scientists hope to have
deciphered, or ``read out,'' the code for 90 percent of the human
genome (all the genes in a human cell). At present, only about 15
percent of the complete sequence has been deciphered, in a ``pilot
phase'' of the project that concluded at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot phase has been about developing the methods of
sequencing the genome accurately and efficiently,'' said Lander in
an interview. ``Costs have dropped from about $2 per base (chemical
unit of code) to about 20 cents a base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequencing'' is the process of determining the order of the
chemical units _ represented by the letters a,c,t and g _ that,
through long combinations of thousands of letters, spell out the
gene's ``message'' for how to make a given protein.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project began in 1990 as scientists first made maps,
by locating distinctive pieces of DNA that served as landmarks on
the 23 pairs of chromosomes that carry the 70,000 genes.
Researchers could locate certain genes with respect to these
landmarks, thereby putting the genes on a map.
</P>
<P>
   But to learn what information the genes contain, it's necessary
to read all the chemical letters in order. This task used to be
done by hand in the laboratory, but now there are robot-like
computerized machines that can do the reading at a rapid pace,
which accounts for the drop in the cost of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``working draft'' will contain missing stretches of genetic
code in the genes' messages, said Lander, but a finished and
accurate version of the ``book of life,'' as it's been called,
should be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Whitehead, scientists at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis and Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston received funding for the next phase of sequencing. The
Sanger Centre in England is the fourth facility receiving the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The speeded-up sequencing drive by the federal government comes
partly in response to a challenge by a private company, Celera
Genomics, of Rockville, Md., whose scientists say they can sequence
the genome faster and cheaper. However, Lander and other
researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health and the US
Department of Energy say the sequences deciphered by Celera's
methods may not be as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   With the human genetic blueprints in hand, researchers believe
they will be able to unlock many secrets of how the human being
develops and how genetic variations and adverse changes affect
health and illness. Pharmaceutical companies are eager for the
sequence data so they can design new and better drugs. The genome
project also aims to decipher the genes of organisms like mice,
rats and harmful micro-organisms to compare with the blueprints of
humans.

DOROTHY BUTLER, 84; STORIED WEDDING MADE HEADLINES IN WWII 
</HEADLINE>

 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy (West) Butler of Holderness, N.H., whose whirlwind
romance and storybook wedding to a captain in the Royal Welch
Fusiliers made international headlines in the early days of World
War II, died of heart failure March 4 in Speare Memorial Hospital
in Plymouth, N.H. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   A niece of the late US Senator Leverett Saltonstall, Mrs. Butler
was born in Chestnut Hill, Mass. She attended Beaver School in
Brookline and Foxhollow School in Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   ``She met my father, who was in the British Army, in Ireland. It
was 1937. A fox hunting party,'' her son George, the author of the
book ``Pumping Iron,'' and director of the movie of the same name,
said in a story published in the Globe on Feb. 2, 1984. ``My father
had to immediately report to his regiment in Nigeria. So he
proposed to my mother by post, by sea mail, and he didn't get an
answer from her for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When his letter arrived in Boston, it kicked up a big family
storm,'' he said. ``My mother was terrific, the oldest daughter of
a formidable man, George Saltonstall West. He was a powerful
presence, a man who looked like God and had played football at
Harvard. But she was enormously self-confident. She used to say to
me often: `If you can do something you want to do, something
outrageous, and not worry about what other people think, you can do
anything.' But at that time what she said to her father was: I'm
going to marry Capt. Butler.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, German forces were driving the British back in
North Africa and the English military was operating in great
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the London Daily Mirror on Nov. 6, 1940, said ``A
Guards officer's American fiancee has been sworn to silence about
her wedding plans by British Authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her lover is overseas and an indiscreet word about where he is
stationed might imperil him and his men. She is on her word of
honor not to reveal, even to her relatives the date and place of
the wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mirror, ``She herself is at present unaware of
her fiance's whereabouts, because the authorities refuse to reveal
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got in a ship and went to Africa. She landed in Cape
Town,'' said her son. ``There was no Capt. Butler waiting for her
at the wharf. She went incognito to Nairobi, thinking he was there.
But her trip had made all the newspapers. All of Kenya was looking
for him. And anybody named Butler was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother arrived at the New Stanley Hotel in Nairobi three
days before she had to leave the country. A runner arrived from
Nkuru with the message that my father was on his way to Nairobi. He
arrived and they got married.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Butler married Desmond Butler in Nairobi Cathedral. They
remained together until his death in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves two sons, George of Holderness and Richard of
Gardiner, N.Y.; a sister, Mary Barnes of Concord, Mass.; and a
brother, Eric West of Lyme, Conn.

HUTCHISON CALLS CLINTON'S PLAN A `FEDERAL GRAB' FOR SHARE OF
TOBACCO MONEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn on Monday assailed President Clinton's proposal
that Texas and other states give the federal government at least 25
percent of the billions of dollars from out-of-court settlements
with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, R-Texas, speaking at a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee hearing, derided Clinton's plan as ``a federal grab''
for a percentage of the $17.6 billion Texas wrestled from tobacco
companies after lengthy and expensive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a subcommittee member, has introduced legislation to
ensure that states remain free to spend their settlement money as
they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who testified at the hearing, mockingly compared the
president's effort to the tale ``The Little Red Hen,'' in which
farm animals reject a hen's request for help in the kitchen but
then have the gall to ask for her bread after it is baked.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, through its Health and Human
Services Department, has told the states that federal law requires
that they pay 57 percent of the settlement money to Medicaid, the
federal government's health care program for the poor. But under
strong opposition from Texas and other states, Clinton last month
proposed that states earmark 25 percent of the settlement money for
public education campaigns targeted at discouraging teen-agers from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hash of HHS defended the administration's call for 57
percent, telling the subcommittee Monday that the federal
government is a ``third-party'' beneficiary to the states'
settlements with tobacco companies and is entitled to that
percentage under the Medicaid law. But Hash said the president is
willing to work with the states to reach an agreement that would
require them to put a portion of the settlement money toward
programs to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal taxpayers are entitled to their fair share,'' said
Hash, deputy administrator of HHS' Health Care Financing
Administration. ``We should work together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison and Cornyn rejected Hash's reading of the law and
said the federal government has no claim to the settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who chairs the subcommittee, said he
rejects the administration's specific demand that states either
surrender money to the federal government or set aside a percentage
for specific programs. Specter, however, said he would not object
to the federal government setting general guidelines for how states
should spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison said she would reject any proposal that would
interfere with a state's independent spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to keep you from dictating to the states (how
they spend) money they have earned fair and square,'' Hutchison
told Hash. ``Let's look for another funding source.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn told the subcommittee that the federal government's claim
to the settlement money under the Medicaid law is irrelevant
because neither Texas nor most of the other states sued the tobacco
industry to recover Medicaid funds they had paid to Washington. The
federal government also has no other claim to the settlement money
because it did not participate in the states' lawsuits, Cornyn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies in January 1998 agreed to pay Texas $17.3
billion over 25 years to settle the state's claims that cigarette
companies violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, also knows as the RICO law; federal and state
antitrust and personal-injury laws; and Texas product-liability
law. The industry also agreed to pay another $3.3 billion in
attorney's fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas settlement is separate from the $206 billion
out-of-court agreement the tobacco industry reached with 36 other
states in November. That agreement was reached after Congress last
year failed to enact a $368 billion settlement, as the out-of-court
deal called on federal lawmakers to do.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher and Tom Miller,
attorney general of Iowa, echoed Cornyn's opposition to the federal
government in their testimony before the Subcommittee on Labor,
HHS, Education and Related Agencies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the $17.3 billion Texas settlement, $2.3 billion has been set
aside for counties and hospital districts to compensate them for
unreimbursed health-care costs. Under a proposal before the Texas
Legislature, $881 million of the settlement money would go toward a
children's health insurance program; a statewide anti-smoking pilot
program directed at children; and the creation of 11 research
endowments to benefit public health to create and operate a
children's cancer center and an institute for border health.

URBAN COWGIRL LOOK RETURNS, SANS BOOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Yeee ... haw! Cowgirl couture is back in town.
</P>
<P>
   As fashion turns its heel on '60s geek chic, start looking for
prairie panache. The details? Deep, dark denim skirts and cuffed
jeans; peasant blouses, bandanna prints and dresses with other Wild
West motifs that we haven't seen since the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The look is a citified version (no rhinestones), that's taken
root in the music industry, and Levi's Jeans is leading the fashion
posse. The original blue jeans company not only is sponsoring
Grammy Award winner Lauryn Hill's worldwide Miseducation Tour but
is also dressing her. According to Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. spokeswoman
Kim Sobel, ``Lauryn liked several pieces from our current
collection, including the cargo pants, dark denim jeans and denim
jacket ... and her input helped inspire the special 10-piece
collection she'll be wearing on her tour.'' Sobel added that the
youthful line reflects Hill's distinct style that's reminiscent of
the '70s, and it may be available in stores at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she says, take note that denim jackets are back, but
the latest trend is to wear them short and form-fitting in the
darkest blue possible.
</P>
<P>
   While other denim designers are bringing back red and pink jeans
to be worn with white cotton peasant blouses (remember puff
sleeves?), L.A. designers are thinking of what to wear to the next
barn dance.
</P>
<P>
   Mica's design director Judy Rabineau, is celebrating the
company's 10th anniversary with a variety of saucy country-girl
dresses, featuring empire waists and ruffled hems, in red and blue
bandanna prints and gingham checks. The dresses are priced under
$200 at Macy's and Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   Too citified?
</P>
<P>
   Try the Trail Blazer. It's a photographic image of the West at
its wildest, printed on a strapless tube dress. Designed by Hot
Kiss, the desert-themed dress is available at junior fashion
outposts such as Wet Seal and Contempo Casuals for $49.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before the dust settles and the fashionistas move on to new
territory, rethink prairie skirts with ruffled flounces and white
petticoats. Or embroidered and/or top-stitched jeans and overalls,
denim bikini tops worn with skirts or pants (very '70s), and top it
off with a colorful cowboy hat like the big 10-gallon model favored
on the head of MTV host Ananda Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But resist the urge to pull on western boots. Dainty mules are
the shoes that separate the haute from the hayseed. &QL;

CARTILAGE PROTEIN SHRINKS MOUSE TUMORS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Scientists say a potent tumor-starving protein found
in cartilage has sharply curbed the spread of cancer in mouse
experiments, and could be ready for initial human tests later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the protein, troponin I, is the latest installment
in the closely-watched drama of anti-angiogenesis therapy _ the
development of non-toxic drugs to treat cancer by destroying the
life-support system of blood vessels a tumor needs to survive and
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Like glamour drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have produced
stunning anti-tumor results in mice, the new substance, called
suppresses the formation of tiny blood vessels _ angiogenesis _ and
thereby starves the tumor of nourishment from blood.
</P>
<P>
   Troponin I, isolated several years ago from animal and human
cartilage, is ``one of the most potent inhibitors'' of angiogenesis
yet discovered, said Robert Langer, an author of the paper
appearing in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The PNAS issue contains a related paper in which scientists from
Duke University Medical Center say they have found the exact
structure on blood vessel cells that angiostatin binds to,
revealing how angiostatin blocks blood vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors have been
angiostatin and endostatin, discovered in the Children's Hospital
laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman. A combination of the two drugs
dramatically shrank cancers in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity about the drugs has stirred enormous interest and
desperate pleas from cancer patients, even though scientists stress
the fact that they have worked only in mice and may not be
effective _ or as effective _ in humans.
</P>
<P>
   A biotechnology company and the National Cancer Institute plan
to conduct the first human tests of endostatin and angiostatin in
late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Troponin I, first purified from veal cartilage, is a protein
that is also found in smooth muscle of the heart. It is the most
recently found of seven or eight natural angiogenesis inhibitors
discovered in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The protein was identified in the laboratories of Langer, who
has laboratories at Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and Marsha A. Moses, who heads a
laboratory affiliated with Folkman's at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The research was supported by Boston Life Sciences Inc., which
licensed the rights to the protein from Children's.
</P>
<P>
   It was Folkman who, 25 or 30 years ago, first proposed that
cancers must recruit new blood vessels from surrounding tissues to
survive, and that biological weapons targeted to those blood
vessels could destroy them and cause the tumor to become dormant or
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Cartilage, because it contains no blood vessels, has seemed a
natural place to look for angiogenesis inhibitors. Langer and Moses
several years ago made an extract from cartilage that inhibited
angiogenesis, but they didn't immediately identify it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently they purified the active ingredient in the extract
and discovered that it had the same structure as troponin I, which
had been discovered earlier in muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Using laboratory animals, they showed the troponin I could block
the formation of new blood vessels. Then they injected it into mice
that one day earlier had been injected with skin cancer cells that
quickly and aggressively metastasize, or spread, to the lungs. The
drug reduced the number of lung metastases by more than half,
compared with untreated animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When compared with other angiogenesis inhibitors tested in
this same model, (troponin I) is among the most inhibitory,'' the
scientists said in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, in an interview, agreed that the new inhibitor is
``very potent.'' And, he added, ``whenever a new one (inhibitor) is
found, the message is that the body has a whole family of these
proteins whose job it is to keep blood vessels from growing'' in
certain circumstances, ``so that must be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc E. Lanser, founder and chief scientific officer of
Boston Life Sciences, said his goal was to apply for and receive a
permit from the US Food and Drug Administration and begin human
trials later this year. The first patients to receive troponin I
will probably be those with sarcomas, cancers of soft tissues that
tend to metastasize quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, enthusiastic publicity about the animal results with
endostatin and angiostatin stirred premature hopes among cancer
patients who ignored warnings that cancer drugs that work in mice
may not be effective in people.
</P>
<P>
   Lanser said he wasn't concerned about such a reaction, because
``the data speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The companion scientific report in PNAS helps clarify a
longstanding question about how blood vessels are able to grow in
the hostile environment of a tumor. The center of a growing tumor
is filled with dead and dying cells because oxygen is in short
supply _ there are no blood vessels nearby to supply it.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do the tiny, new blood vessels that grow during
angiogenesis manage to survive as they form new endothelial cells
(the lining of blood vessels) to reach the tumor?
</P>
<P>
   Duke researchers Sal Pizzo and Tammy Moser answered the question
by looking at the flip side of the question: not how do the vessels
grow, but how does angiostatin, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, stop
the vessels' growth?
</P>
<P>
   They report in their paper that angiostatin binds to a molecule
on endothelial cells that scientists hadn't know was there. The
molecule -- ATP synthase _ is a kind of biochemical power pack that
provides energy to growing blood vessel cells so they can overcome
the lack of oxygen in a tumor. When angiostatin seizes the ATP
synthase molecules, it deprives the blood vessels of their crucial
power, and they die.

ETHNIC ALBANIANS SAY THEY'LL SIGN PEACE PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Ethnic Albanian leaders gave a written pledge Monday
that they would sign a proposal to end months of ethnic strife in
Kosovo. This put pressure on the Yugoslav Republic's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to do the same or face possible NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
   But the Western allies brokering the deal set no deadline, and
it remained unclear how long Milosevic could continue to defy the
West without suffering consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge was signed by Hashim Thaci, the Kosovo Liberation
Army commander who leads the ethnic Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the six-nation Contact Group on the Balkans, who
convened the Kosovo peace talks, took heart from the written pledge
because it came from Thaci. The KLA had initially balked at the
settlement that would return political automony to Kosovo because
it did not guarantee an independence referendum and called for the
KLA to disarm. Kosovo had been largely self-governing until 1989,
when Milosevic revoked its autonomy and brought the province under
the political control of Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, when the peace talks reconvened after a
three-week hiatus, Thaci handed a copy of the pledge to Christopher
Hill, the US envoy to Kosovo, asking that it be sent to US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. According to Hill's
spokesman, Philip Reeker, the pledge said, ``This delegation and I
personally say yes to this agreement. We would be honored to sign
at a time and place of your choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the logistics for having the ethnic Albanians sign the
81-page settlement had not been worked out Monday night, the
diplomatic pressure shifted to the Serbs. The initial session with
the Serb delegation was not encouraging, according to US and
European diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say they are willing to accept the political component
of the agreement, which allows the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of the 2 million people in Kosovo _ a province in Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia _ to run their own affairs. But
the Serbs refuse to accept the provision that calls for 28,000 NATO
troops, including 4,000 Americans, to police the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, and his British
counterpart, Robin Cook, who are hosting the talks, said they would
meet regularly with the Serbs this week to try to persuade them to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine said the Contact Group _ the United States, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, and Russia _ had not set a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there was one,'' he said, ``it would be a very brief
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Albright and Defense Secretary William S.
Cohen met with NATO general secretary Javier Solana at the White
House Monday and gently turned up the heat on Milosevic. Clinton
said afterward that bombing Serb military installations remained a
real possibility, but he sounded more conciliatory than in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to give everyone time to assess the situation,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's caution reflects a rift within the Contact Group
over the wisdom of using air strikes. While NATO's credibility is
on the line, and the prospect of backing down just a month before
NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary is galling to many NATO
members, there is no consensus for bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who are sympathetic to the Serbs, are vehemently
opposed to using force to settle what they see as a domestic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Europeans, the French are the most skeptical about the
wisdom of bombing. But Vedrine asserted that the Contact Group's
resolve remained strong and warned Milosevic not to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, meanwhile, gave the strongest hint yet that Russian
troops, who are not part of NATO, would be part of the peacekeeping
force if the Serbs relent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome them,'' Cook said he told the Russian prime
minister and foreign minister last week.
</P>
<P>
   The chief mediators, including Hill, the US ambassador to
Macedonia, are trying to sell that compromise to the skeptical
Serbs, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian negotiators had tried the patience of the Contact
Group ever since the initial round of peace talks ended
inconclusively last month at Rambouillet, 35 miles southwest of
Paris. The Albanian delegation said then that they accepted the
agreement in principle but could not sign it until they consulted
with their supporters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there were still no formal signing, US and European
diplomats seemed assured that it was a done deal Monday, if only
because the Albanians would lose all credibility if they reversed
course again.
</P>
<P>
   While the mood among US and European diplomats was upbeat for
the first time in more than a month, the situation on the ground in
Kosovo remained unstable. Serb forces are digging in around the
southern border between Kosovo and Macedonia, shelling ethnic
Albanian villages and creating more refugees. Some 2,000
international observers inside Kosovo remain potential hostages.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the unpredictability of the situation, a
sign behind Cook and Vedrine fell down as they talked to reporters
in an opulent, chandeliered room at the French foreign ministry.
The reporters laughed. Cook and Vedrine did not.

IOC MEMBER GANGA SAYS HE'LL FIGHT EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ A defiant Jean-Claude Ganga, insisting
he has done nothing wrong, claimed Monday that he was being
railroaded and vowed to fight his expulsion from the International
Olympic Committee before the full membership here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I am condemned, then they ask for proof,'' said Ganga,
the member from the Republic of Congo who was forced out by the
executive board in January after allegedly taking more than a
quarter of a million dollars in payoffs and gifts from the Salt
Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games. ``I'm guilty until
proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who was portrayed as the worst offender among the nearly
two dozen IOC members implicated in the scandal, said he was being
singled out because he led the African boycott of the 1976 Summer
Olympics in Montreal and because the IOC wanted to reduce his
continent's influence in the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true I was excluded, but I don't think it was because I
have done something wrong,'' said Ganga. ``Some heads had to be
sacrificed to save the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Four members already have resigned amid the worst scandal in
modern Olympic history, and Ganga and five others are expected to
be expelled by two-thirds of the 91 voting members.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ganga was accused of taking $70,000 in payoffs from Salt
Lake plus free medical services, lavish trips to Utah, and
expensive gifts for his family, he said he was being punished for
trifles while colleagues guilty of graver offenses have escaped
notice. He specifically mentioned vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who chairs the inquiry panel that recommended Ganga's
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga noted that Pound had accepted a family genealogy from the
Church of Latter Day Saints worth at least $40,000 and suggested
that Pound also had profited while acting as the IOC's TV rights
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think this person is qualified to head the (inquiry)
commission?'' Ganga said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound flatly denied both charges Monday. The genealogy was a
``spontaneous gift'' made two years after Salt Lake was awarded the
Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, Canada had a candidate for 2002 (Quebec City),''
Pound said. ``It was quite clear I would not be voting for Salt
Lake in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV contracts, Pound said, are approved by the 11-member
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not negotiated in one dark corner of the world by one
person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound denied that Ganga was being singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these investigations are politically motivated,'' he
said. ``The facts were all divulged to us by Salt Lake City and by
their ethics report. They weren't generated by the IOC. Mr. Ganga
has been confronted with the evidence that exists and has been
given an opportunity to refute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who heads Africa's association of national Olympic
committees, said the $70,000 was merely being kept in his personal
bank account before being distributed to other countries. He said
he assumed there was no fee for the medical services because of a
sponsorship agreement between the Salt Lake bidders and the Utah
hospital. And Ganga insisted that he had paid for the shopping
trips himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid for every single item that was bought in Salt Lake
City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga will be given 30 minutes to make his case before the full
membership, but IOC sources say privately that he is all but
certain to be expelled, along with Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein
El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio
Santander Fantini of Chile, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recognize that the Olympic movement is organized
by human beings,'' Ganga said. ``They are not angels, they are not
saints. If you want angels and saints, go to heaven to organize the
Olympic Games. But if you organize them on this earth, you have to
organize them with human beings who have good sides and bad
sides.''

GORE SAYS HE HAS NEW ANSWERS TO NATION'S PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N. H. _ Apparently seeking to set himself apart from
his boss, Vice President Al Gore said Monday that he offers the
country new answers and new approaches for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   In a presidential campaign trip that will take in New Hampshire,
Iowa and Missouri, Gore also received an endorsement from the House
minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, the St. Louis Democrat and a
former competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was greeted by a raucous crowd of several hundred people at
the Manchester Institute of Arts and Sciences. Banners proclaimed
``New Hampshire Welcomes Our Next President.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Gore emphasized that he had the answers for
the coming century, the overarching theme of his 2000 campaign.
Even his campaign posters had a space-odyssey look, with an arc and
a star around his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face entirely new challenges in the new century, and we
need new answers and new approaches and that's what I represent,''
he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's appearance to endorse Gore was in the works for more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful human being and we would all be proud to
have him as president of the United States,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore's only opponent for the Democratic nomination is
Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator. Civil rights activist
Jesse Jackson is also considering entering the race. Gore will
formally announce his candidacy later this year.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the need to chart his own course is balanced against
the leading role he has played in the administration for the last
six plus years. Rather than disavow that role, Gore pointed to what
the White House may consider its proudest accomplishment: the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a part of the policies that have led to our
prosperity,'' he said. ``I know how to keep our prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of some of his new ideas and new approaches for
the next century, Gore said, preschool should be universal for all
children. New Hampshire does not require communities to offer
public kindergarten for its children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he would like to see the ratio of children to
teachers reduced to about 20 children per classroom. And he said it
is time for women to receive equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed suggestions at the news conference that his
lagging in the polls behind Governor George W. Bush of Texas posed
a serious problem for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a campaign about ideas, not polls,'' Gore
said. ``This is going to be about a vision of America in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he would separate himself from President Clinton,
Gore again pointed to the future. ``I'm excited about offering my
own vision for what America should be in the 21st century,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which Clinton was personally and politically
humiliated with a sex scandal and impeachment, Gore was asked if he
would like the president to campaign for him here and in Iowa, the
premier primary and caucus states in the nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want his endorsement and I would want his support,''
Gore said. Indeed, Clinton has spent time in New Hampshire this
year holding private meetings with activists in order to persuade
them to back Gore's bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it will be possible for Gore to campaign for
president without frequently confronting Clinton's problems remains
to be seen. The vice president, however, was prepared with an
answer: ``I think what the president did was terribly wrong and I
said so repeatedly. But you know, the American people want to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   To the crowd of several hundred supporters, most of whom had
stood for two hours in a stifling auditorium, the vice president
confided that he would become a grandfather for the first time this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new grandchild will live a life almost entirely in the
21st century,'' he said, pledging to keep the prosperity going and
the economy growing.

OMNIA COMMUNICATIONS TO BE SOLD FOR $429 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small Massachusetts technology company that's never sold a
product is about to sell itself for $429 million. That's how much
Maryland-based Ciena Corp. will pay to acquire Omnia Communications
Inc. and its technology for managing Internet and voice data
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena also announced it would pay $552 million to acquire
Lightera Networks Inc., which makes switches for use in
high-capacity data networks. Both Omnia, of Marlborough, Mass., and
Lightera, based in California, are closely held. Ciena will pay for
the transactions with stock _ 16 million shares to acquire Omnia
and 20.6 million for Lightera. Omnia and its 75 employees will
remain in Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive,'' said Ciena president and chief
executive Patrick Nettles, ``but we thought it was a good buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nettles is trying to strengthen the product offerings of Ciena,
which makes equipment that packs large amounts of data onto
fiber-optic communication lines.
</P>
<P>
   Omnia, founded two years ago, has designed a product that can
combine multiple voice circuits and Internet connections for
transmission over high-capacity fiber-optic lines. Omnia president
Michael Champa said his company's product will make it easier for
telephone companies to add service offerings to their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each new service, the phone company has had to install
and support a new box,'' Champa said. ``What we are doing is
totally integrating those technologies onto one platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cavallone, an analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group in
New York, said Ciena needs to expand its offerings beyond its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking to expand their market opportunities, to
integrate basic technologies with their own existing
technologies,'' Cavallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ciena's customers in the telephone industry are
looking for a single supplier that can help the phone companies
enhance their service offerings and increase the capacity of their
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena's technology, called wave-division multiplexing, allows
the same telephone line to carry many times as much data as it was
originally designed to handle. Lightera makes switches that can
efficiently direct this torrent of data. And Omnia will provide a
single device that can sort out the data into separate streams of
voice and computer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But first Omnia must complete work on its device, to be called
the AXR 500. Champa said test versions would soon be made available
to phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena stock closed down 2 1/16 to 24 3/4 on the Nasdaq stock
exchange.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early last year, as undercover U.S. Customs agents
neared the end of the biggest investigation ever conducted into the
illegal movement of drug money, bankers working with Mexico's most
powerful cocaine cartel approached them with a stunning offer.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, posing as money launderers from Colombia, had
insinuated themselves deeply into the Mexican underworld, helping
the traffickers hide more than $60 million. Now, money men working
with the cartel said they had clients who needed to launder $1.15
billion more. The most important of those clients, they said, was
Mexico's powerful defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   The customs agents didn't know whether the money really existed
or if any of it belonged to the minister, Gen. Enrique Cervantes,
officials said. But having heard about American intelligence
reports pointing to corruption at high levels of the Mexican
military, the agents were mystified by what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continue the undercover operation to pursue the
deal, Clinton administration officials ordered to shut it down on
schedule several weeks later. No further effort was ever made to
investigate the offer, and officials said prosecutors have not even
raised the matter with the suspects in the case, who have pleaded
guilty and are cooperating with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we sitting on this kind of information?'' asked the
former senior customs agent who led the undercover probe, William
F. Gately. ``It's either because we're lazy, we're stupid, or the
political will doesn't exist to engage in the kind of investigation
where our law-enforcement efforts might damage our foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials denied that foreign policy
influenced their decision to end the operation, saying they were
moved primarily by concerns for its security. They also emphasized
that the agents were unable to verify the Mexican traffickers'
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials of the administration, which has based much of
its Mexican drug strategy on collaboration with Cervantes, said
they are confident that he is above reproach. A spokesman for the
Mexican Defense Ministry, Lt. Col. Francisco Aguilar Hernandez,
dismissed the traffickers' proposal as self-serving lies.
</P>
<P>
   But a detailed account of the case _ based on confidential
government documents, court records and dozens of interviews _
suggests that U.S. officials walked away from an extraordinary
opportunity to examine allegations of the official corruption that
is considered the main obstacle to anti-drug efforts in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, American officials have been haunted by the
spectacle of Mexican officials being linked to illicit activities
soon after they are embraced in Washington. And just weeks before
the customs investigation, known as Operation Casablanca, ended
last year, administration officials received intelligence reports
indicating that the Mexican military's ties to the drug trade were
more serious than had been previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   But when faced with the possibility that one of Washington's
critical Mexican allies might be linked to the traffickers, the
officials gave the matter little consideration. They said they
opted for a sure thing, arresting mid-level traffickers and their
financial associates and at least disrupting the money laundering
system that drug gangs had set up. To reach for a general, they
said, would have added to their risks with no certainty of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was a significant allegation,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in an interview. But he added:
``There was skepticism about it. Was it puffing? It just was not
seen as being _ I won't use the word credible _ but it wasn't
verified.''
</P>
<P>
   When senior administration officials announced the sting last
May 18, they took a triumphant inventory: the indictments of three
big Mexican banks and bankers from a dozen foreign banks; the
arrests of 142 suspects; the confiscation of $35 million in drug
profits and the freezing of accounts holding $66 million more.
</P>
<P>
   The officials claimed the success as the result of a
longstanding administration fight against money laundering. But
Gately, who retired from the Customs Service on Dec. 31, said his
investigation ran a gantlet of resistance from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, uncomfortable with cases in which
undercover agents laundered more money for drug traffickers than
they ultimately seized, were imposing new limits on the time that
such operations could run and the money they could launder,
officials said. And though the restrictions did not apply to
Customs, a branch of the Treasury, Justice Department officials
continued to play strong, skeptical roles in supervising cases
throughout the government.
</P>
<P>
   One federal official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
admitted that he initially dismissed Gately's plan as a nonstarter.
``You're out of your mind,'' the official remembered saying.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues said it was the sort of response that Gately,
49, tended to see as a challenge. A decorated former Marine who
enlisted for service in Vietnam at the age of 17, he had already
been at the center of several cases that mixed internal struggle
and public success. Friends and critics described him in similar
terms: driven, sometimes abrasive and unusually creative.
</P>
<P>
   After leading an investigation that revealed ties between the
Italian mafia and Colombian cocaine cartels, Gately co-wrote a 1994
book about the case, ``Dead Ringer,'' that cast him as a lonely
crusader surrounded by small-minded bureaucrats. ``It is the story
of one man who refused to succumb to corruption,'' the prologue
reads, ``who believed in his oath and mission, and the consequences
he paid for believing in what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the senior customs drug investigator in Los Angeles, Gately
said, he first heard from an informant in 1993 about an important
shift in the way that Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers were
converting their cash into funds that could be freely spent.
</P>
<P>
   The informant said traffickers were depositing their money with
corrupt Mexican bankers, who sent it back to them in almost
untraceable cashier's checks drawn on the American accounts that
the Mexican banks used to do business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gately hoped his informant could infiltrate that system _
collecting illicit cash from drug wholesalers in the United States
and then wiring it to corrupt bankers in Mexico. The bankers would
issue drafts for the money, and customs would develop evidence
against suspects on both ends of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Many customs officials, however, were skeptical that the ruse
would work. Drug-enforcement agents wanted to use the informant in
another case. One federal prosecutor opposed using him at all
because he had a criminal past and threatened to indict him in a
10-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Gately was eventually able to recruit another
informant, a Colombian known by the pseudonym ``Javier Ramirez,'' a
senior Justice Department official, Mary Lee Warren, pressed him to
limit the operation's scope, Gately and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she wanted to know was, when was this going to be over?''
he recalled. ``What was our endgame?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Colombian drug contacts introduced the
undercover agents to Victor Alcala Navarro, a representative of
Mexico's biggest drug mafia, the so-called Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The customs agents, posing as money launderers from a dummy
company called Emerald Empire Corp., began picking up the Mexican's
profits and laundering them as planned.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, at meetings in Mexico, Ramirez was introduced
to Alcala's boss. A few months later, the customs informant found
himself chatting by phone with the head of the cartel, Amado
Carrillo Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   Over scores of meetings and million-dollar deals, the
traffickers grew more open about the official protection they
enjoyed in Mexico, law-enforcement officials and government
documents indicate.
</P>
<P>
   At one meeting in Mexico City on May 16, 1997, the traffickers
brought along 16 federal police agents as bodyguards. At another
meeting, a man who identified himself as an official of the Mexican
attorney general's office picked up $1.7 million in cash, including
$415,000 that the undercover agents had brought for the cartel boss
himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a later meeting in New York, Alcala told the agents that
like Mexico's drug-enforcement chief, who had been arrested for
collaborating with the Juarez cartel, the defense minister,
Cervantes, was in league with the competing Tijuana cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they remained skeptical of what the
agents heard, including the traffickers' claim that Carrillo
Fuentes had actually faked his own death in 1997. But in December
1997, Ramirez invited Alcala to Colombia for an elaborately staged
meeting that seemed to raise their partnership to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   At a heavily guarded hacienda overlooking Bogota, an informant
acting as Ramirez's Colombian boss, Carlos, said he and his
partners had $500 million of their own to launder. They wanted to
know whether the Mexican bankers used by Alcala's boss, Juan Jose
Castellanos Alvarez-Tostado, could help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvarez called us right back,'' Gately recalled. ``He said,
`Let me send you my very best people, and we will get it done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, 1998, Alcala arrived with several businessmen at the
tastefully furnished offices of Emerald Empire in an industrial
suburb of Los Angeles. This time the businessmen brought a big deal
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, David Loera, said he knew ``a general'' who had
$150 million in Mexico City to invest. Would Ramirez _ who had told
the traffickers he owned part of a Nevada casino used to launder
money _ care to help?
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six weeks, according to government documents and
the accounts of Gately and several officials, the deal was
discussed in three more meetings and three telephone conversations
between Ramirez, the undercover agents and the traffickers. All of
the contacts were secretly tape-recorded and transcribed, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In one call, two senior investment managers at Mexico's
second-largest bank told the customs operatives that the money
belonged not just to ``a general'' but to the minister of defense.
Later, the two Mexicans advised Ramirez that the minister was
sending ``his daughter'' (a woman later said to be a friend) to
meet with them, along with an army colonel and a third person.
</P>
<P>
   However, the investment managers said, the amount to be
laundered was much more than they had discussed: the minister had
$500 million in cash in New York and another $500 million in the
Netherlands, in addition to the $150 million in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said they queried the CIA, which works closely
with the Mexican military on drug-control and other programs. The
CIA responded tersely that they had no such information about
Cervantes, an assessment that other officials have since
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   But while Cervantes has not been a focus of suspicion, Mexican
and American officials said several senior generals close to him
have been under scrutiny by investigators from both the Mexican
attorney general's office and a special military intelligence unit.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, analysts at the Drug Enforcement Administration
briefed Attorney General Janet Reno on intelligence indicating that
senior Mexican generals might indeed be cooperating with Carrillo
Fuentes' organization, officials said. And in a separate customs
case in Houston, undercover agents had been approached about
laundering millions of dollars for an unnamed Mexican army general,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, Alcala visited Emerald Empire with a cousin, who had
just returned from Mexico with a message. ``He was very nervous
about the deal,'' Gately said. ``He said it could be very dangerous
if it got screwed up, because the money belonged to `all of them,
including the president,' '' Ernesto Zedillo. (A spokesman for
Zedillo, David Najera, dismissed the claim as baseless.)
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, Gately went to Washington to brief officials
including Kelly _ who was then about to take over the Customs
Service after overseeing it as the Treasury Undersecretary for
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly said, `How do we know it's really him?' '' Gately
recalled, referring to Cervantes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `We don't know,' '' Gately said. `` `We can't
substantiate it. But we have no reason to believe they're telling
us anything other than what they know.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't trying to impress us, they were trying to make
deals with us,'' Gately added. ``So whoever had this money, I
thought it was worth pursuing _ whether it was the defense minister
of Mexico or somebody we'd never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the discussions said they did not go much
further. The general's supposed emissaries were to meet Ramirez in
Las Vegas on April 22. They did not arrive, and the traffickers
reported that they had gotten nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly acknowledged that he had been pressing for months to wrap
up the investigation; he said he had grown increasingly concerned
that information about it might leak out, endangering the
undercover agents. The final sting had already been postponed twice
because federal prosecutors were still preparing indictments.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Johnson, who succeeded Kelly as undersecretary and has
closely supervised Treasury's relationship with Mexico on
enforcement issues, added a cautionary note that several officials
said seemed to underscore his concern for the political stakes.
Unless the agents had proof of Cervantes' role, several officials
quoted him as warning, they should not bandy his name about in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful about how we talk about this sort
of thing,'' a senior law-enforcement official, who would not speak
for attribution, quoted him as saying. ``If we don't have the
goods, it makes us look like we're overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would not comment publicly on the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The operation had already navigated a series of sizable
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Gately and some other agents were worried that their boss in Los
Angeles, John Hensley, had leaked information about the secret
operation to congressional aides and others; Hensley had also
pressed hard to bring the operation to an end, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, officials said Hensley had accused his
strong-willed subordinate of transgressions ranging from traveling
without authorization to stealing millions of dollars. Kelly
acknowledged that the charges were investigated and found baseless;
Hensley declined any comment.
</P>
<P>
   As discussions about the supposed $1.15 billion were going on,
the undercover operation also suffered a serious setback with the
capture of a key Juarez operative in Chicago. The arrest brought
money deliveries to a halt while the cartel hunted for a mole.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, May 16, more than two dozen Mexican traffickers,
bankers and other operatives who had been invited to the United
States by the undercover team were rounded up in San Diego and at
the Casablanca Casino Resort in Mesquite, Nev. And officials said
whatever thoughts they had that the allegations about Cervantes
might be pursued were dropped in the diplomatic backlash that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mexican authorities were asked to arrest about 20
suspects indicted in the case, they initially located only six. One
was the partner of Loera, the fugitive businessman who first
proposed the deal with ``the general.'' The partner was found dead
in a Mexican jail from injuries that the police described as
self-inflicted. Alvarez-Tostado has never been found; his deputy,
Alcala, awaits trial in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the operation, American officials said, they showed
the Mexican government some of their information on apparent
corruption in the case. They said they kept silent about more
explosive evidence to avoid exacerbating the furor that had broken
out over their decision not to warn Mexico about the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the officials said that none of the information was ever
pursued, and the Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar,
obliquely dismissed the allegations in a little noticed statement
issued last July.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said in an interview that the Americans told him only
about unnamed federal agents and a money laundering scheme
involving ``a general who had a daughter.'' He said the name of
Cervantes, who has no daughter, was never mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the information that they gave me, what could I possibly
have done?'' Madrazo asked. ``Gone and looked for a general with a
daughter?''

   SEATTLE _ ``The Sisters Matsumoto,'' a play by Philip Kan
Gotanda about Japanese-Americans emerging from internment camps
after World War II, was ending its well-received world premiere run
at the Seattle Repertory Theater's new 286-seat house when the
theater opened a new show on its main stage: the Northwest premiere
of Martin McDonagh's Broadway hit, ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.''
For several nights in a row the lobby of the theater at the Seattle
Center, this city's sprawling arts campus was thick with the hushed
fervor of engaged playgoers.
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive week for the Rep, this city's flagship
theater, and for its new artistic director, Sharon Ott, who arrived
a year and a half ago from the Berkeley Repertory Theater. Her
predecessor, Daniel Sullivan, a gifted director who led the theater
to national prominence by developing new, largely mainstream plays
(Wendy Wasserstein's ``Heidi Chronicles'' and ``Sisters
Rosenzweig,'' for example) had left to pursue his own work as a
director. It has been Ms. Ott's mandate to root the theater more
firmly in the city and to reclaim its stature as a local
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an artistic director because I'm interested in what
theaters do in a community,'' said Ms. Ott, 49. ``If I wasn't, I'd
just be a director.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she has expanded the theater's multicultural
programming and started collaborations with local institutions like
the Seattle Asian Art Museum (where admission to the current ``Year
of Japan'' exhibition is free with a ``Sisters Matsumoto'' ticket
stub) and the Wing Luke Asian Museum, which remounted its exhibit
on the internment camps in the lobby of the Rep during the
``Sisters'' run.
</P>
<P>
   This season the theater has produced ``Play On,'' the show
created by Sheldon Epps from the music of Duke Ellington, the first
musical the Rep has put on in years. In the spring, it will stage
``Radio Mambo,'' by the Hispanic performance group Culture Clash,
the theater's first gesture in the direction of the region's Latin
population. ``We've had Asian audiences here occasionally,'' Ms.
Ott said. ``But the Hispanic population is tougher to reach.
They've probably never been here.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agenda at the Seattle Rep, which was founded in 1963, is
at the forefront of a reconfiguring of the theatrical landscape in
this city of 600,000 (about 1.8 million including the surrounding
counties). Seattle has blossomed steadily as an arts town in
general and a theater town in particular since the World's Fair of
1962, but now competition among the larger theaters has begun to
eat into the audiences for the fringe groups that have proliferated
here for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that there are three major nonprofit theaters in
Seattle, including A Contemporary Theater (known as ACT) and the
Intiman Theater, each with more than 10,000 subscribers and budgets
exceeding $3 million, is extraordinary in a city this size. All
three have had successful capital fund drives in the 1990s and
significantly improved their physical plants.
</P>
<P>
   This is in addition to the Seattle Children's Theater, perhaps
the most prominent niche theater on the West Coast, and a range of
smaller professional and nonprofessional companies (the number
ranges from 60 to 75, depending on who is estimating) sprinkled
throughout the area. And in the last decade, two nonprofit groups
have begun operating downtown theaters as houses for road show
musicals, adding 6,000 theater seats to an already swarming arena.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recently published survey by the Corporate
Council of the Arts, a Seattle-area fund-raising body that annually
makes about $2.5 million in operating grants to local arts groups,
theatergoers account for 35 percent of audiences for arts events
here, excluding for-profit enterprises like movies and pop
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably there has been a downside. On the same day that
``Beauty Queen'' opened at the Rep to laudatory reviews, there was
a bit of bad news as well. The Bathhouse Theater, a small but
locally renowned company that had survived for 20 years on spit and
gumption, finally succumbed to financial pressures and closed.

<P>
   It was another reminder of the growing pains the theater here
has been going through. Seattle has long been a place where eager
young companies, fed by the University of Washington's theater
program, have found a place to produce their work and people who
want to see it. Seattle is also a place where arts institutions are
famously cooperative; in 1965, when ACT opened for business as a
home for new plays, the Rep shared its subscriber list, essentially
fueling the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That set a pattern that survives today,'' said Peter Donnelly,
the former managing director of the Rep and now the president of
the Corporate Council. ``As a result the arts have had a collective
face in the city that you don't get when you're squabbling all over
each other. The arts are at the table in every important community
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, audience-building has become more competitive than ever
with the recent expansions of the Rep, the Intiman, across the
alley at the Seattle Center, and ACT, on the other side of downtown
in the former national headquarters of the Fraternal Order of
Eagles and with corporate money from the young computer industry
beginning to find its way to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more and more theater happening here,'' said Susan
Trapnell, managing director of ACT. ``At a certain point you can't
keep growing new theaters in a city this size.'' Indeed, in
addition to the Bathhouse, the city has lost several other small
theaters in the last year, including its only company devoted to
multicultural programming, the Group Theater, and its only gay and
lesbian theater, Alice B.
</P>
<P>
   The Langston Hughes Cultural Center, a neighborhood arts center
housed in a former synagogue, is, with city support, in its second
year of producing work with largely African-American themes, but
aside from that there is no black theater in the city either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community used to be smaller and more niched,'' said
Melissa Hines, the managing director of Empty Space, an
experimental theater that was founded in 1970 and is the city's
third oldest. ``The growth that has taken place has also introduced
fascinating problems.''
</P>
<P>
   All the lost theaters had specific difficulties to combat. The
Group, for example, was forced from its home on the university
campus to a more expensive space in the Seattle Center just when it
suffered a withdrawal of foundation support. But part of the
problem is also the expansion of programming in the three large
houses, which gobbled up audiences and financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in the theater ecology is the larger houses
are becoming more stable and doing strong work,'' said Tim Bond,
the former artistic director of the Group. ``And the small to
midsize theaters are losing their funding and audience support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Group led the way in diversity programming here, but as
the other theaters began to make headway in that direction, we had
funders tell us, `We've given our multicultural dollars for the
year.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Big Three, which were founded with distinct
missions (the Rep as a standard repertory house, ACT focusing on
new plays and the Intiman, which opened in 1972, devoted to
classics, with an emphasis on Ibsen and Strindberg), have all begun
in the last decade to pursue a similarly broad agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the theaters complement one another; ACT and the
Intiman both run spring to fall schedules, minimizing their
head-to-head competition with the Rep and allowing multiple
subscribers the chance to pursue their theatergoing year round. But
of course they compete with each other, and all three wage regular
battles for the rights to put on shows like ``Beauty Queen,''
``Three Tall Women'' (Intiman) and ``Side Man'' (ACT).
</P>
<P>
   One might expect ``Sisters Matsumoto'' to be a natural for ACT;
by the same token, ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``The Crucible''
should fit most easily at the Rep, but ACT did the former in 1997
and will do the latter this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time has gone on, we've become more and more alike,'' said
Benjamin Moore, the Rep's managing director since 1985. ``Some
people think we should all merge and become one big theater.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, won't happen, though Ms. Ott raised the idea of
the Rep, the Intiman and ACT's combining resources to sponsor a
theater festival. What is more certain is that the three theaters
will use their new facilities to distinguish themselves in ways
that have yet to be determined. The Rep is unusual in that it has
two proscenium houses, ACT's main stage is a theater in the round,
and the Intiman features a semi-thrust stage.
</P>
<P>
   Their programming is bound to be informed by the ascent of new
leaders. Gordon Edelstein, formerly an associate artistic director
at the Long Wharf Theater in Connecticut, took over the artistic
reins at ACT in September 1997. Shook, who has presided for seven
years over a resurgence of the Intiman, has announced that this
year would be his last. A search for his replacement has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is general agreement among institutional
administrators that both corporate and individual arts philanthropy
is a seriously undertapped resource. Several older corporations
with headquarters here _ Boeing, Weyerhauser and Safeco Insurance,
three of the largest _ have been steady arts contributors. Now a
new generation of givers flush with high-tech profits has begun to
emerge, and arts groups have begun to focus on them in hopes of
establishing a serious habit of arts support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this town could be much more of an intellectual and
international center for the arts than it has been,'' Ms. Ott said.
``It's located well, on the Pacific Rim, in a vibrant part of the
world. There is money here and the potential for patronage. All the
businesses here have global interests, and I don't think it's too
much to think that the performing arts will share in that.''

CLINTON WARNS OF NATO ATTACK IF SERBS REJECT PEACE PROCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Kosovo's ethnic Albanians agreeing to a
cease-fire, President Clinton and NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana threatened airstrikes Monday if the Yugoslavs show any
``intransigence or aggression'' against the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders warned during a meeting at the White House that
they would have little choice but to use military force against
Serbian troops if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does not
agree to the cease-fire and the posting of NATO troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Milosevic) shows intransigence and aggression, from my
point of view we would have little option,'' Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Solana agreed. ``If an agreement is not reached and President
Milosevic doesn't sign, the risk of a catastrophe will be very
likely, and we have to prevent that from happening,'' said Solana,
who heads the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Milosevic has balked at allowing NATO to station about
28,000 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, likening it to a foreign
invasion of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, ethnic Albanians refused to go along with the
peace accord, which requires Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo
and calls for the Kosovo Liberation Army to disarm. The army has
been fighting to free the largely Albanian region from Serb
control.
</P>
<P>
   Even as peace talks continued in Paris, however, both the
Yugoslav army and the KLA bombarded villages with tanks and rocket
and rifle fire, setting houses ablaze and wounding at least eight
Yugoslav soldiers. The army said it also ``inflicted losses'' on
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, fighting between the Kosovo rebels and
Serbian security forces has killed 2,000 people. More than 300,000
people have lost their homes. U.S. officials say Serbia has
recently posted more troops in the province, has begun mining
routes they expect NATO troops to take from Macedonia into the
province, and over the weekend has shelled three rebel-held
villages in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright received a
letter in which Hashim Thaqi, chief negotiator for the Kosovo
Albanians, promised to sign the cease-fire accord. The agreement
calls for three years of autonomy for Kosovo, a period in which
NATO troops _ including 4,000 U.S. soldiers _ are to maintain peace
between the warring ethnic groups. The letter also was sent to the
foreign ministers of Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``This delegation and I personally say `Yes' to this
agreement,'' Thaqi wrote. ``We would be honored to sign this
agreement in your presence at a time and place of your choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Milan Milutnovic played down the significance
of the Kosovo Albanians' agreement to sign the peace deal, saying
that ``unilateral signing does not mean anything.'' He also
dismissed threats of airstrikes. ``This is not out of the question,
but we are not afraid of that,'' Milutnovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and German Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping cautioned the Serbs to go along with the deal,
noting that U.S. and other NATO forces in Europe are still on alert
to launch immediate strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope (Milosevic) will see the handwriting is very much on
the wall for him to observe, and will take peaceful action as
opposed to seeking greater conflict,'' Cohen said at a news
conference with Scharping.
</P>
<P>
   The German defense minister said Milosevic is mistaken if he
believes NATO might be unwilling to act if necessary. ``Mr.
Milosevic must be clear that NATO is ready and decided to act if
necessary,'' Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO currently has more than 400 attack and support aircraft
within striking distance of Serb targets, a contingent assigned to
the region five weeks ago when Milosevic refused to participate in
the peace deal. The aircraft include U.S. B-52 bombers and
radar-avoiding F-117A ``stealth'' fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the peace talks resumed Monday in Paris, State
Department officials said Albright currently is not planning to
participate and has no immediate plans to travel to Europe for
Thaqi's signing of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials indicated they would not wait for
Thaqi's signature to put military heat on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the pressure is indeed shifted, and I think the spotlight
is going to shine very brightly on the Serb side to agree,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin. ``They are still not
engaging seriously on the fundamental question'' of allowing NATO
peacekeepers into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton indicated no strike was imminent and
that negotiators should be given time to bring Milosevic and his
allies around to signing the agreement. At the same time, he said,
stalling will not be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to be able to talk this through a little bit,'' the
president said. ``But, obviously, they can't go on indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage Mr. Milosevic to agree to the terms as well
so that we can avoid further conflict and bloodshed,'' Clinton
said. ``From his point of view, I think it's the best chance to
preserve the integrity of Serbia and avoid economic and other
adversity.''

LINCOLN CENTER TO REVIVE OPERA THWARTED BY CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.) (fb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center announced Monday that it would present
a complete 20-hour production of the classic Chinese opera ``The
Peony Pavilion'' similar to the one that was canceled last summer
after cultural officials in Shanghai refused to allow the
performers to leave China.
</P>
<P>
   The work, staged by the New York-based director of last summer's
aborted production and featuring the same charismatic Chinese
performer as its female lead, is to be presented throughout Lincoln
Center Festival '99, which runs from July 7 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the production has been envisioned virtually
since it was called off last year. But the production has become
much more expensive, partly because it is being produced in the
United States. Substantial donations and a crucial financial gift
recently from Bloomberg News are making the production possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came at a good moment,'' Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of
the board of Lincoln Center, said of the contribution. It was
described only as being ``in the mid-six figures'' and was
announced by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News
and a member of the board, at a meeting of the board's executive
committee on Feb. 23. ``It takes away an enormous burden,'' Sills
said.
</P>
<P>
   The staging, by Chen Shi-Zheng, a New York director and
performer, is closely modeled after his innovative production with
performers of the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company, which was to have
been the centerpiece of the Lincoln Center Festival last year.
Shanghai cultural officials intervened just as sets and costumes
were to have been shipped from the Shanghai International Airport
last summer, jeopardizing the festival schedule. The shipment was
freed after several days of negotiation, but the company was denied
permission to leave, forcing cancellation of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent presentations in Paris, Sydney and Hong Kong were
also canceled. The Festival d'Automne in France has again joined
forces with Lincoln Center and is to present the work in Caen and
Paris in November. Presentations elsewhere are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Chen recently began rehearsals with a mostly new troupe at an
undisclosed location on the East Coast. The only holdovers from the
Shanghai company are Qian Yi, a gifted young performer who plays
the heroine in the romantic epic, and Zhou Ming, a flutist who
leads the little orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve other performers have come or are coming from Beijing and
elsewhere in China. The rest of the 21 cast members and 12
instrumentalists are Chinese citizens living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any derring-do had been required to enlist
performers from Shanghai and China in light of the diplomatic furor
that arose last summer, Nigel Redden, the festival director, said
only, ``They all got out legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of the performers, many of them young, would have
difficulty returning to China and resuming their careers there,
Redden said: ``We went to great lengths to talk to people who know
about such matters, and everyone encouraged us to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that ultimately the individuals and their families
were the best judges of that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who left China in 1987 and has often returned there to
work, said: ``It's a fast-changing society in many ways. The
performers are confident that they will be able to work both in
America and in China.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When the Lincoln Center production was canceled last summer, the
sets and costumes, all painstakingly handmade in China, were
shipped to France for a scheduled presentation in November. They
have arrived back in New York unused.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sets, which are made of fitted wood, without nails,
will need minor rebuilding, Redden said, but the 800 pieces of
clothing that make up the more than 500 embroidered costumes are in
good shape and need little attention other than refitting for
different performers.
</P>
<P>
   Redden traveled to Shanghai last summer to join Chen in
last-ditch negotiations with Ma Bomin, the director of the Shanghai
Municipal Bureau of Culture and the central figure in the dispute.
The bureau, which considers itself the guardian of the ancient
regional tradition of Kunqu opera, judged the production
pornographic, feudal and superstitious, and therefore a
misrepresentation of Kunqu tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau was seconded in that opinion by some Kunqu adherents
elsewhere, including the New York Kunqu Society, which recently
presented a three-hour condensed version of ``The Peony Pavilion''
as a lesson in proper performance style. Another condensation of
similar length but pointedly untraditional style, directed by Peter
Sellars and with new music by Tan Dun, had its American premiere
this month in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peony Pavilion,'' written by Tang Xianzu in 1598, has come
down as a canonic work in the tradition of Kunqu, one of the most
venerable and refined forms of Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we're not going to call it Kunqu,'' Chen said of his
production. ``It uses the Kunqu music, but we're just going to call
it my interpretation of Tang Xianzu's work and not refer to any
particular tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival also plans to present a symposium in collaboration
with the New School University exploring the topic ``Who owns
tradition?'' and related issues surrounding the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hoped we could revive the production,'' said Nathan
Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center. ``The forces that tend
to prevent freedom of expression can't win. We can't let them
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The same issues evidently led to the Bloomberg News
contribution. ``We are a communication company,'' Bloomberg said.
``We feel strongly about freedom of the press, freedom of
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who had spent eight months in intensive rehearsals with
the Shanghai troupe for the production last year, was initially
skeptical about starting again.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought I should just put it away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has only four months to duplicate what he achieved in
twice that time last year: a production that the French newspaper
Le Monde called ``one of the major cultural events of the end of
the 20th century'' on the basis of the dress rehearsal in Shanghai.
As in Shanghai, Chen has older, more experienced performers working
with the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated production last year cost about half a million
dollars, with Lincoln Center covering two-fifths of the budget and
its co-commissioners in Paris, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia,
covering the rest. For the current production, Lincoln Center
expects to invest $1.1 million and $300,000 in donated goods or
services. Additional costs will be incurred by the Festival
d'Automne and other partners that may pick up the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a more difficult prospect than last year,''
Redden said. ``This has not been a producing festival but a
presenting festival. Now we have to come up with rehearsal space
and a supporting staff for a large company.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Center Festival is to include 10 other events, some
consisting of several parts. They are to be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Each presentation of ``The Peony Pavilion'' is to consist of six
segments. Three complete cycles are to be presented at the 800-seat
La Guardia Concert Hall, near Lincoln Center. The first cycle
comprises one installment each on July 7 and 8, and two on July 9
and 10. The other presentations take place July 16-18 and July
23-25, with two segments staged each day.

CARTILAGE PROTEIN SHRINKS MOUSE TUMORS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Scientists say a potent tumor-starving protein found
in cartilage has sharply curbed the spread of cancer in mouse
experiments, and could be ready for initial human tests later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the protein, troponin I, is the latest installment
in the closely-watched drama of anti-angiogenesis therapy _ the
development of non-toxic drugs to treat cancer by destroying the
life-support system of blood vessels a tumor needs to survive and
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Like glamour drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have produced
stunning anti-tumor results in mice, the new substance, called
suppresses the formation of tiny blood vessels _ angiogenesis _ and
thereby starves the tumor of nourishment from blood.
</P>
<P>
   Troponin I, isolated several years ago from animal and human
cartilage, is ``one of the most potent inhibitors'' of angiogenesis
yet discovered, said Robert Langer, an author of the paper
appearing in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The PNAS issue contains a related paper in which scientists from
Duke University Medical Center say they have found the exact
structure on blood vessel cells that angiostatin binds to,
revealing how angiostatin blocks blood vessel growth.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most potent angiogenesis inhibitors have been
angiostatin and endostatin, discovered in the Children's Hospital
laboratory of Dr. Judah Folkman. A combination of the two drugs
dramatically shrank cancers in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity about the drugs has stirred enormous interest and
desperate pleas from cancer patients, even though scientists stress
the fact that they have worked only in mice and may not be
effective _ or as effective _ in humans.
</P>
<P>
   A biotechnology company and the National Cancer Institute plan
to conduct the first human tests of endostatin and angiostatin in
late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Troponin I, first purified from veal cartilage, is a protein
that is also found in smooth muscle of the heart. It is the most
recently found of seven or eight natural angiogenesis inhibitors
discovered in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The protein was identified in the laboratories of Langer, who
has laboratories at Children's Hospital and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and Marsha A. Moses, who heads a
laboratory affiliated with Folkman's at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The research was supported by Boston Life Sciences Inc., which
licensed the rights to the protein from Children's.
</P>
<P>
   It was Folkman who, 25 or 30 years ago, first proposed that
cancers must recruit new blood vessels from surrounding tissues to
survive, and that biological weapons targeted to those blood
vessels could destroy them and cause the tumor to become dormant or
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Cartilage, because it contains no blood vessels, has seemed a
natural place to look for angiogenesis inhibitors. Langer and Moses
several years ago made an extract from cartilage that inhibited
angiogenesis, but they didn't immediately identify it.
</P>
<P>
   More recently they purified the active ingredient in the extract
and discovered that it had the same structure as troponin I, which
had been discovered earlier in muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Using laboratory animals, they showed the troponin I could block
the formation of new blood vessels. Then they injected it into mice
that one day earlier had been injected with skin cancer cells that
quickly and aggressively metastasize, or spread, to the lungs. The
drug reduced the number of lung metastases by more than half,
compared with untreated animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When compared with other angiogenesis inhibitors tested in
this same model, (troponin I) is among the most inhibitory,'' the
scientists said in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman, in an interview, agreed that the new inhibitor is
``very potent.'' And, he added, ``whenever a new one (inhibitor) is
found, the message is that the body has a whole family of these
proteins whose job it is to keep blood vessels from growing'' in
certain circumstances, ``so that must be important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc E. Lanser, founder and chief scientific officer of
Boston Life Sciences, said his goal was to apply for and receive a
permit from the US Food and Drug Administration and begin human
trials later this year. The first patients to receive troponin I
will probably be those with sarcomas, cancers of soft tissues that
tend to metastasize quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, enthusiastic publicity about the animal results with
endostatin and angiostatin stirred premature hopes among cancer
patients who ignored warnings that cancer drugs that work in mice
may not be effective in people.
</P>
<P>
   Lanser said he wasn't concerned about such a reaction, because
``the data speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The companion scientific report in PNAS helps clarify a
longstanding question about how blood vessels are able to grow in
the hostile environment of a tumor. The center of a growing tumor
is filled with dead and dying cells because oxygen is in short
supply _ there are no blood vessels nearby to supply it.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do the tiny, new blood vessels that grow during
angiogenesis manage to survive as they form new endothelial cells
(the lining of blood vessels) to reach the tumor?
</P>
<P>
   Duke researchers Sal Pizzo and Tammy Moser answered the question
by looking at the flip side of the question: not how do the vessels
grow, but how does angiostatin, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, stop
the vessels' growth?
</P>
<P>
   They report in their paper that angiostatin binds to a molecule
on endothelial cells that scientists hadn't know was there. The
molecule -- ATP synthase _ is a kind of biochemical power pack that
provides energy to growing blood vessel cells so they can overcome
the lack of oxygen in a tumor. When angiostatin seizes the ATP
synthase molecules, it deprives the blood vessels of their crucial
power, and they die.

NO GUARANTEES NEW BANKING ENTITY CAN FEND OFF ACQUIRERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp. tout their
proposed merger as a way to ensure that Boston will always have a
hometown bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important day for these two companies, and we hope
an important day for New England,'' Fleet's chief executive,
Terrence Murray, crowed at a press conference Monday to announce
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that there will be no guarantees in the next
millennium for bankers wishing to maintain independence _ not even
for the chief executives of the two biggest banks in New England,
Murray and his counterpart at BankBoston, Charles Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Today's financial world is being transformed so rapidly and so
dramatically that big never seems to be big enough, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, globalization and cross-industry mergers in the
financial industry wiped out all boundaries to doing business _
witness Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, cutting a deal in
November to purchase Manhattan-based Bankers Trust Corp. And
cross-country mergers became vogue with the matchup of BankAmerica
Corp. in San Francisco and NationsBank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In heady talk hours after the Fleet-BankBoston merger
announcement, there was talk that Fleet Boston Corp. might one day
pair up with Boston's biggest insurer, John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this company, Fleet Boston, if it wants to compete
with the big banks in this country, will need to grow to $300
billion in assets in the next five years,'' said Gerard Cassidy,
banking analyst for Tucker Anthony Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If a banking company is big enough, the theory goes, then it is
too big to take over. As a bank grows in size, there are fewer
banks with enough market capitalization to buy them out.
</P>
<P>
   A Fleet-BankBoston merger, if approved by regulators, would
create the nation's eight-largest bank with $178 billion in assets.
``When you get near $200 billion, you're only going to be bought if
you want to be bought,'' said Nancy Bush, senior vice president of
Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., a Livingston, N.J., investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to merge would intensify, other analysts said, if the
newly merged Boston institution isn't profitable enough to keep its
share price high. That's what happened to BankBoston _ its stock
price dropped from a 52-week high of 58 11/16 partly because of
financial disaster in emerging financial markets that rocked the
company's substantial operations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston closed Monday at 47 1/16, up 1/8, in reaction to the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, where investment banking fees are commensurate
with the size of the deal, deal makers scoff and say Fleet Boston
is not immune. ``They're not too big to be gobbled up,'' said one
New York investment banker who asked not to be named. ``There are
still much bigger players out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Citigroup, a $669 billion institution formed in the
unprecedented merger of the nation's largest bank, Citicorp, and
insurance behemoth Travelers Corp. And there is BankAmerica, which
has $618 billion in assets _ three times more than Fleet Boston
would have.
</P>
<P>
   James Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc., said
Fleet's ownership of BankBoston's premier franchise in Brazil would
make Fleet Boston attractive _ and vulnerable _ to a whole new
league of international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these New York banks would dearly love to have some of
Latin America,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of such megamergers is highly speculative at a time when
the merger has not been approved by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts said, there are two likely routes for
Murray. One is to continue on his well-worn path, acquiring small
and large banking companies and nonbanking companies. Murray has a
history of aggressive acquisitions, including virtually every major
bank in the region as well as Quick &AMP; Reilly, the discount
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston is limited in how much it could expand inside the
region through acquisitions of smaller banks. With its heavy
concentration in urban markets _ namely Boston, Hartford, and
Providence _ it would quickly run into problems with regulators.
The banks said Monday that they would be required to divest some
$13 billion in deposits and sell branches and ATMs to comply with
regulatory antitrust hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Kane, professor of finance at Boston College, said
Fleet may one day seek merger partners among banking companies
outside the region in a bid to extend its geographic reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they say is plausible _ it's big enough for the time
being and it may want to make some out-of-region takeovers to
become a truly national enterprise,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors swirled Monday that Boston insurer John Hancock might be
Fleet's next merger game. ``It's ridiculous,'' said Stephen Burgay,
a Hancock spokesman, about the rumor. The company's plan to sell
public stock ``is our priority.''

ECUADORAN BANKS REOPEN, BUT TENSIONS PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Banks here reopened Monday for the first time
in more than a week after a government decree closed them because
of a worsening financial crisis. But tensions remained high, the
result of a strike by taxi drivers that blocked roads and brought
commerce and transport to a near halt throughout this Andean
country.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Ecuador's cities, irate cab drivers blocked key
intersections with their yellow vehicles, built barricades and set
tires and tree trunks on fire. They were protesting increases of
nearly 200 percent in the price of gasoline, to more than $3 a
gallon, announced Thursday by President Jamil Mahuad as part of a
broader austerity package that unions have vowed to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about politics,'' said Alberto Carrillo, a
64-year-old taxi driver, as he and colleagues stood near a burning
barricade. ``This is about being able to make a living, and we are
not backing down until the government rescinds these measures that
are crippling the middle class and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The only signs of real activity Monday were outside bank
branches, where depositors began lining up at dawn in hopes of
retrieving money from accounts that have been blocked to them all
of last week.
</P>
<P>
   The bank reopening was regarded as an important test for
Ecuador, one of Latin America's most impoverished countries, which
has been battling what the government is calling the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. A combination of low
prices for oil exports, damage from El Nino, pressing government
debts and the broader economic problems that have hurt Ecuador's
giant neighbor, Brazil, have sent the economy into a tailspin.
Ecuador has been negotiating with the International Monetary Fund
for a rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   A pent-up demand for the currency, the sucre, and speculation by
some banks helped the sucre surge in value when the banks reopened
Monday. The sucre was trading at 9,050 to the dollar in late
Monday, 30 percent higher than its level of 12,500 to the dollar
after the banks were closed March 5.
</P>
<P>
   President Jamil Mahuad had ordered the banks to close in hopes
of preventing a run on deposits that had seized the country amid
signs that several large banks are on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I took everything out, every last cent,'' Juan Caicedo, a
31-year-old mechanic, said Monday morning after closing an account
that had less than $200 in it and therefore was not subject to
restrictions on withdrawals Mahuad decreed Thursday. ``I have no
confidence in any of the banks, and since no one can guarantee to
me they won't collapse, I'm going to invest this in something else
until I feel that it is safe to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mahuad, a 49-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer,
declared a 60-day state of national emergency. Though army and
police units have been patrolling the streets ever since, they have
been sparing in their use of force, apparently fearful of fanning
popular discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Many bus drivers joined in Monday's taxi strike, and the lack of
public transportation paralyzed much of daily life. Most stores and
businesses did not open Monday morning. Those that did seemed to be
operating with a skeleton staff, their employees unable to get to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Molina, a secretary for a fruit juice bottler, was one of
those who was forced to stay home. Six months pregnant, she felt
she should not walk to work, and was worried because she is running
out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no buses, no trucks, no transport at all,'' she
said. ``My paycheck was deposited directly in the bank, and I
couldn't get at it all of last week. This economy is really fatal,
and I don't know what is going to become of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ecuador's 12 million people had hoped the situation here
would calm down after a two-day general strike last week, but
Monday's work stoppage contributed to a sense that things are only
getting worse. ``The country finds itself on the verge of
anarchy,'' the daily newspaper ``Hoy'' warned Monday in a front
page editorial, blaming what it called the ``blindness of political
leaders and the intransigence of unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have promised further strikes this week, with some
even threatening to occupy banks. In addition, the leader of the
country's main coalition of American Indian organizations, Antonio
Vargas, has called for a ``popular uprising'' to defeat the
president's austerity package, which has been widely criticized by
members of the opposition-dominated Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot go on like this,'' Carlos Torres, a 29-year-old
X-ray technician, said Monday, despair in his voice. ``The country
has been paralyzed for a week, and nobody is producing anything.''

STATES PREPARING REMEDIES IN CASE OF WIN IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio, Minn., Utah, Ky., Texas, W.Va., Md., S.C.,
Conn., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flush with optimism about the way their case is
progressing, the 19 state attorneys general who joined the federal
government in the landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
say they will not be satisfied, should they win the case, with any
remedy that does not revamp the company.
</P>
<P>
   No specifics have been decided about how that should be done _
and probably none will be until the judge issues his ruling this
summer. But as equal partners in the lawsuit, the states hold
something of a veto power over the kinds of remedies the federal
government can recommend, and the offices of the attorneys general
are alive with discussion of the various options.
</P>
<P>
   The one receiving the most favor right now would force Microsoft
to license the source code for the Windows operating system to
several other companies _ instantly creating competition in the
operating system business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the states _ including New York, Ohio,
Minnesota and Utah _ are eager to use provisions in their own laws
that would allow them to fine Microsoft for every antitrust
violation ``incident.'' The amount for each incident varies, from
$2,000 in Kentucky to $100,000 in New York, but there is little if
any case law to suggest how an incident is defined in this context.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several states said they were hoping to establish
that every purchase of a copy of Windows constituted a violation.
``With per violation or per occurrence, that would be millions and
millions of dollars,'' said Doug Davis, an assistant attorney
general in West Virginia. But state officials acknowledged that it
was far from certain that the courts would uphold that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the states have stayed out of the spotlight, relying
primarily on the Justice Department's lawyers, most notably its
lead trial lawyer and hired gun, David Boies, to argue the case in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the states are key players.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states researched the case cooperatively with the
Justice Department. When it came time to file the suit last spring,
one of those states, Texas, decided to drop out of the effort,
while a handful of additional states, including West Virginia and
Maryland, decided to join. That brought the total to 20.
</P>
<P>
   In December, South Carolina's attorney general announced that he
was leaving the group, asserting that competition in the software
industry remained strong, making the suit unnecessary. The 19
remaining attorneys general say they remain strongly committed to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department and the states filed similar but
separate antitrust suits against Microsoft last May, the cases were
merged and are being tried together. So, although Justice officials
say they have not yet decided on what remedies to propose should
they win, whatever they recommend to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
must have the approval of the states as co-litigants.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the remedy Jackson imposes might or might not be
based on the recommendations of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Because state attorneys general are elected officials, their
motives are not always the same as those of the Justice Department.
They must be more responsive to their constituents _ or, viewed
more cynically, play to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When the suits were filed last May, ``we got some constituent
mail asking why we were harassing Microsoft,'' said Mark Weaver,
Ohio's deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But now, says Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of
Connecticut, ``We feel vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public,'' he added, ``has a much better understanding of
Microsoft's abuses and violations of law.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft insists that it will win the case, the hardened
position on remedies is fueled by a growing perception among the
attorneys general that their side has gained the upper hand in
court. In interviews last week, attorneys general or their
assistants in more than a dozen states said they had been
pleasantly surprised, even thrilled, with their accomplishments in
court _ though all acknowledge that the judge could ultimately rule
in Microsoft's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft have both completed presentation of
their cases, and the trial is now in recess until mid-April, when
each side will present rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Blumenthal said, ``Our case has been more powerful and
vivid than we ever anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Granholm, Michigan's attorney general, said: ``We feel
very good. It's safe to say our confidence has improved; the
credibility of the Microsoft defense seems to have been seriously
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception has emboldened the states to consider asking for
stronger remedies than they might have originally contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad sense, antitrust remedies fall into two classes:
conduct relief and structural relief.
</P>
<P>
   If the court imposed conduct relief, Microsoft would remain
intact, and its business incentives would not be changed. Instead,
the company's ability to engage in illegal conduct would be
limited. One example might be to regulate the sorts of contracts
the company could write.
</P>
<P>
   Structural relief would include any remedy that would change the
nature of Microsoft's business incentives, the motivations for its
competitive behavior. Structural remedies could include forcing the
company to license the source code of its software to competitors.
It could also mean breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar has been raised,'' said one attorney general, who,
like several interviewed, asked not to be identified. ``The mere
thought that people are talking about dividing up the company now
shows that the thinking has advanced. It was mentioned before, but
not discussed with the level of plausibility it's being discussed
now.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason some states say they joined the Microsoft case was
that they were not satisfied with the government's conclusion of
the last antitrust case against Microsoft, in 1995. That one ended
with a consent decree _ a form of conduct relief.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, state officials say, immediately worked around the
agreement, and all of the behavior that is the subject of the
current suit occurred in the following years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Microsoft,'' a senior assistant attorney general said,
``it's pretty clear that conduct relief is not lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Several state officials said they were impressed with evidence
introduced during the trial indicating that Microsoft had never
taken the earlier consent agreement seriously. Just a few months
after that agreement, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, told a
group of business allies, ``This antitrust thing will blow over; we
haven't changed our business practices at all,'' according to notes
of that discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft's strategy in court _ vociferously
contesting every point, no matter how much contrary evidence is
introduced _ has helped convince attorneys general that nothing
short of a structural remedy would have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior has proven the need for an effective remedy,''
said Wayne Klein, head of the antitrust division in the Utah
attorney general's office. ``There's no contrition there. No
admission that they did anything wrong. And we're now in a position
where we think we can establish something that's effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Granholm said, ``We've got to have a remedy with teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general are now debating three possible structural
remedies. The one least favored at the moment, several officials
said, would break the company into two or three parts. One of the
new companies would keep the Windows operating system, another the
applications programs like Word and Excel. A third company,
possibly, would get Microsoft's Internet and multimedia businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has lost favor, the officials said, because whichever
new company had Windows would still hold a monopoly in personal
computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to break the company into three equal parts,
each of which would have complete copies of Microsoft's source code
and intellectual property. They then would begin competing with
each other. One problem with this idea is deciding which company
would get Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys general say they worried that the third proposal
_ forcing Microsoft to license the Windows source code to other
companies _ would end up creating incompatible versions of Windows,
resulting in software that runs on one machine but not on another.
But other state officials argue that all of the companies creating
new versions of Windows would have strong incentives to make sure
their versions were compatible with the others.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant attorney general heavily involved with the
discussions insisted that the states were not limited to these
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still exploring things,'' he said, ``and other things
might come up, stuff we hadn't even though of before.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, the states do seem unanimous about requesting
one specific remedy: forcing Microsoft to pay their legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``And given the number of lawyers who are working on this,''
said Weaver, the Ohio official, ``that bill is not going to be
insubstantial.''

IOC MEMBER GANGA SAYS HE'LL FIGHT EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ A defiant Jean-Claude Ganga, insisting
he has done nothing wrong, claimed Monday that he was being
railroaded and vowed to fight his expulsion from the International
Olympic Committee before the full membership here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I am condemned, then they ask for proof,'' said Ganga,
the member from the Republic of Congo who was forced out by the
executive board in January after allegedly taking more than a
quarter of a million dollars in payoffs and gifts from the Salt
Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games. ``I'm guilty until
proven innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who was portrayed as the worst offender among the nearly
two dozen IOC members implicated in the scandal, said he was being
singled out because he led the African boycott of the 1976 Summer
Olympics in Montreal and because the IOC wanted to reduce his
continent's influence in the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true I was excluded, but I don't think it was because I
have done something wrong,'' said Ganga. ``Some heads had to be
sacrificed to save the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Four members already have resigned amid the worst scandal in
modern Olympic history, and Ganga and five others are expected to
be expelled by two-thirds of the 91 voting members.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ganga was accused of taking $70,000 in payoffs from Salt
Lake plus free medical services, lavish trips to Utah, and
expensive gifts for his family, he said he was being punished for
trifles while colleagues guilty of graver offenses have escaped
notice. He specifically mentioned vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who chairs the inquiry panel that recommended Ganga's
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga noted that Pound had accepted a family genealogy from the
Church of Latter Day Saints worth at least $40,000 and suggested
that Pound also had profited while acting as the IOC's TV rights
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think this person is qualified to head the (inquiry)
commission?'' Ganga said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound flatly denied both charges Monday. The genealogy was a
``spontaneous gift'' made two years after Salt Lake was awarded the
Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, Canada had a candidate for 2002 (Quebec City),''
Pound said. ``It was quite clear I would not be voting for Salt
Lake in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV contracts, Pound said, are approved by the 11-member
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not negotiated in one dark corner of the world by one
person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pound denied that Ganga was being singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these investigations are politically motivated,'' he
said. ``The facts were all divulged to us by Salt Lake City and by
their ethics report. They weren't generated by the IOC. Mr. Ganga
has been confronted with the evidence that exists and has been
given an opportunity to refute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who heads Africa's association of national Olympic
committees, said the $70,000 was merely being kept in his personal
bank account before being distributed to other countries. He said
he assumed there was no fee for the medical services because of a
sponsorship agreement between the Salt Lake bidders and the Utah
hospital. And Ganga insisted that he had paid for the shopping
trips himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid for every single item that was bought in Salt Lake
City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga will be given 30 minutes to make his case before the full
membership, but IOC sources say privately that he is all but
certain to be expelled, along with Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein
El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio
Santander Fantini of Chile, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to recognize that the Olympic movement is organized
by human beings,'' Ganga said. ``They are not angels, they are not
saints. If you want angels and saints, go to heaven to organize the
Olympic Games. But if you organize them on this earth, you have to
organize them with human beings who have good sides and bad
sides.''

   LONDON _ A well-known human rights lawyer who had received death
threats for her work representing Catholics in one of Northern
Ireland's most volatile communities was killed Monday when a bomb
blew up her car as she drove from her home.
</P>
<P>
   A renegade Protestant guerrilla group, the Red Hand Defenders,
claimed responsibility for the blast in a telephone call Monday
night to the BBC in Belfast that used an authenticating code word.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Nelson, 40, suffered fatal stomach injuries in the
explosion, which occurred 50 yards from the primary school in
Lurgan, where her sister is a teacher and her 8-year-old daughter
was on lunch break. Two sons, 11 and 13, were away in France on a
school ski trip.
</P>
<P>
   Her car had been parked outside her house while she was in the
Irish Republic with her husband, Paul, an accountant. Police on
Monday night appealed for information from witnesses who might have
seen any activity in her driveway over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson had represented the residents of the Catholic
housing projects lining the Garvaghy Road in nearby Portadown that
has repeatedly been a flash point in Northern Ireland's sectarian
conflict. It is the thoroughfare from Drumcree Church that
uniformed men of the Orange Order have tried to walk at the
beginning of the Protestant ``marching season'' each July,
provoking province-wide violence.
</P>
<P>
   The main paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have been
maintaining cease-fires while their political representatives took
part in the negotiations that led to the peace settlement that
faces an April 2 deadline to be put into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hand Defenders are a small band of dissidents dedicated
to upsetting the accord, and Mrs. Nelson's death is the third they
have claimed since they began a campaign of pipe bomb attacks on
Catholic families and of arson attacks on churches last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole aim of the murderers is to remove any chance of
reconciliation,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.
``They will not be allowed to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson had gone with a group from Garvaghy Road to 10
Downing Street last month to discuss the Drumcree standoff with
Blair. She was quoted in Monday morning's Irish News saying the
confrontation had left community relations in the town in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing occurred as the political leaders of Northern
Ireland were gathering in Washington, where they hoped to resolve
remaining disagreements with the help of President Clinton, who was
a major force behind the peace accord signed last year on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart opened his daily news
briefing Monday with a statement from the president calling the
bombing a ``despicable and cowardly act.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists and First Minister
of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, called the murder ``an
appalling act'' and said ``at the end of the day it is going to be
counter-productive and it is not going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, called Mrs. Nelson a beacon
for truth and justice whose killing put an onus on the signatories
to the pact to overcome obstacles to putting it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was endorsed in referendums in the Irish Republic and
British-ruled Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has set Good Friday, April 2, as the deadline for
transferring home rule to Belfast from London, but politicians in
Northern Ireland are at an impasse over the issue of paramilitary
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Adams insists that leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army, must be able to take up all the seats
they are entitled to in the new assembly cabinet. Trimble says he
will not admit them until the IRA signals a willingness to start
dismantling its arsenal.
</P>

<P>
   Mrs. Nelson visited New York last April to inform U.N. and U.S.
officials about the intimidation of lawyers in Northern Ireland.
Martin McGuinness, the chief Sinn Fein negotiator, said it was ``a
well-known fact'' that her life had been threatened repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nelson disclosed last week that she had prepared 200
compensation claims against the Royal Ulster Constabulary from
Catholics injured in the Drumcree confrontations. A group of
demonstrators marched to police headquarters in Lurgan Monday night
with black flags and spray painted ``Disband the RUC'' slogans on
the barracks walls.

INSTITUTE TO SHARE IN DEVELOPING HUMAN GENOME BLUEPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Scientists at the Whitehead Institute will be major
players in a new, accelerated phase of the drive to decode all the
genetic blueprints of man, creating a foundation for a new era of
biology and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research was notified Monday
it will receive $35 million from the federal government as one of
three US genetics facilities that aim to create a ``working draft''
of the human genome by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Human cells each contain about 70,000 genes that serve as
blueprints for making the proteins that build and operate the body.
Those genes, altogether, contain about 3 billion chemical units of
four types that spell out all the information that's inherited
through generations.
</P>
<P>
   By next spring, said Eric Lander, the director of the Whitehead
genome facility in Cambridge, Mass., scientists hope to have
deciphered, or ``read out,'' the code for 90 percent of the human
genome (all the genes in a human cell). At present, only about 15
percent of the complete sequence has been deciphered, in a ``pilot
phase'' of the project that concluded at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot phase has been about developing the methods of
sequencing the genome accurately and efficiently,'' said Lander in
an interview. ``Costs have dropped from about $2 per base (chemical
unit of code) to about 20 cents a base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequencing'' is the process of determining the order of the
chemical units _ represented by the letters a,c,t and g _ that,
through long combinations of thousands of letters, spell out the
gene's ``message'' for how to make a given protein.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project began in 1990 as scientists first made maps,
by locating distinctive pieces of DNA that served as landmarks on
the 23 pairs of chromosomes that carry the 70,000 genes.
Researchers could locate certain genes with respect to these
landmarks, thereby putting the genes on a map.
</P>
<P>
   But to learn what information the genes contain, it's necessary
to read all the chemical letters in order. This task used to be
done by hand in the laboratory, but now there are robot-like
computerized machines that can do the reading at a rapid pace,
which accounts for the drop in the cost of doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``working draft'' will contain missing stretches of genetic
code in the genes' messages, said Lander, but a finished and
accurate version of the ``book of life,'' as it's been called,
should be completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Whitehead, scientists at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis and Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston received funding for the next phase of sequencing. The
Sanger Centre in England is the fourth facility receiving the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The speeded-up sequencing drive by the federal government comes
partly in response to a challenge by a private company, Celera
Genomics, of Rockville, Md., whose scientists say they can sequence
the genome faster and cheaper. However, Lander and other
researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health and the US
Department of Energy say the sequences deciphered by Celera's
methods may not be as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   With the human genetic blueprints in hand, researchers believe
they will be able to unlock many secrets of how the human being
develops and how genetic variations and adverse changes affect
health and illness. Pharmaceutical companies are eager for the
sequence data so they can design new and better drugs. The genome
project also aims to decipher the genes of organisms like mice,
rats and harmful micro-organisms to compare with the blueprints of
humans.

SCIENCE PANEL SAYS PRESERVING LETHAL VIRUS COULD YIELD BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An independent scientific panel has concluded
that preserving the world's last known samples of deadly smallpox
virus in Russia and the United States may provide important
scientific and medical opportunities that would be lost if the
virus is destroyed later this year as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The report issued Monday by a 19-member committee of the
prestigious National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine is
likely to influence significantly President Clinton's thinking
about this politically and scientifically contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in January, Clinton said
he would rely heavily on guidance provided by the Institute of
Medicine report in formulating his administration's position on
whether the stocks should be retained or destroyed. Clinton said he
would rely on the report's recommendations to ensure that the
United States would have ``whatever it takes to buy us a response
[to a potential smallpox outbreak) as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The 100-page report did not express an opinion whether the
stocks should, or should not be destroyed, since the panel of
experts was asked to examine only the potential value that such a
stock provides.
</P>
<P>
   But its main conclusion that retaining the virus could lead to
``new and important discoveries with real potential for improving
human health'' _ including the development of new antiviral drugs
to protect citizens against a future smallpox outbreak _ is likely
to strengthen the hand of those within the administration who want
the United States to join Russia in opposing the destruction of the
highly infectious, lethal virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the report will have a major impact,'' said a
senior White House official who has closely followed the explosive
debate both within American scientific circles and at the United
Nations. ``Science is science, and the science that has now spoken
will dramatically affect the decision-making process here.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent American scientists, such as Donald A. Henderson, a
former deputy White House science adviser and dean emeritus of
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, helped lead the campaign for
eradication and then the destruction of all smallpox stocks soon
after the World Health Organization, a Geneva-based agency of the
United Nations, certified in 1980 that smallpox had, in fact, been
eradicated. In 1996, the WHO recommended that the remaining stocks
of the dangerous virus be destroyed, a decision then supported by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the WHO also decided, again with Washington's
agreement, to recommend that destruction be deferred til June 30 of
this year so that, among other things, the scientific consequences
of destruction could be more fully evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the 190-member group are scheduled to meet in
Geneva to review the issue in May, and many poorer nations that
suffered the worst smallpox epidemics are expected to press hard
for the virus' destruction as scheduled. Officially, the world's
only remaining collections of live virus are now kept only by the
federal Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, and at the State
Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, known as Vector, a
leading Russian research institute in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But many American experts now agree that smallpox samples may
have already been secured by rogue states or terrorist groups
seeking to wreak havoc or settle grudges.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview late last year, Lev. S. Sandakhchiev, Vector's
director, denied allegations that Russia had given samples to
suspect nations, such as North Korea. He also spoke passionately
against destruction of the virus, arguing, as he has in scientific
papers, that infectious diseases like smallpox cannot ever be
considered completely eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infectious disease eradicated can return anytime,'' he said,
sometimes in even more virulent form. Sandakhchiev has proposed
that international research teams work together at Vector to devise
new antiviral drugs and more effective vaccines against smallpox
and other viruses.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report issued Monday concluded that
the most ``compelling'' reason for long-term retention of smallpox,
or live variola virus stocks, was ``their essential role in the
identification and development of antiviral agents for use in
anticipation of a large outbreak of smallpox.'' Supplies of the
existing vaccine ``have dwindled and may be deteriorating,'' the
report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the current vaccine is a live virus that ``cannot be
used safely with immunocompromised individuals,'' such as those
infected with HIV or who have had organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the report notes, ``much scientific information,
particularly concerning the human immune system, could be learned
through experimentation'' with the smallpox virus. Smallpox, the
report notes, ``was eradicated before the development of many
modern techniques of microbiology.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, the leading advocate of destruction, expressed
``disappointment'' in the report's conclusions, saying he wished
the panel's findings had been ``more balanced.'' Destroying the
stocks, he argues, would effectively criminalize the use of the
disease as a weapon and send a powerful moral signal that even
rogue states or terrorists could ill ignore.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that new antiviral drugs could theoretically be
developed without the live smallpox collections, and said he
doubted that drug companies or even the government would invest the
$200-400 million required to produce such new drugs from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developing world has been been very unhappy that Big
Brother and Russia have retained these stocks. They have worked
very hard to get rid of this terrible scourge, and yet those who
argue that the strains must be kept for research are not doing
research on them,'' Henderson said. ``So I understand when they
ask: What right do you have to retain these strains? What if some
of them escape, why should we have to fight this fight all over
again?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the past year, the Clinton administration has debated
whether the United States should formally oppose destruction at
this time, as Russia did last year. An interagency group is
scheduled to meet at the week's end to consider the issue again,
now in light of the Institute of Medicine report, and come to a
formal decision by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine report, however, appears to strengthen
considerably the retention camp in its strong endorsement of the
potential value of stock retention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the interview in January, said that while the United
States had supported destruction of the live virus stocks in 1996,
``we're concerned about having adequate stocks of the vaccine,''
and, he added, ``we want to have some way of conducting research
because smallpox, or any kind of virus, can be wrinkled, if you
will, twisted, turned a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   While he knew that much of the world favored destruction, he
said the United States would be the most likely country ``rushing
in'' to a poor country to help it contain a future outbreak.

MORE TROUBLE SEEN ON DEFAULTED RUSSIAN DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A group of 19 Western banks holding $15 billion in
defaulted short-term Russian government debt headed for deeper
division on Monday after the largest creditor, Credit Suisse First
Boston, broke the group's already fractured ranks to announce a new
ruble-based investment fund aimed at recovering the bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Credit Suisse First Boston represented the
second time in recent weeks that the lender banks had been divided
over the best way to recover at least some of a debt that no one
expects to be repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting in London on Monday, participants said at least
one other major bank in the group felt that Credit Suisse First
Boston had, in the words of a banker who spoke in return for
anonymity, ``cut a side deal'' with the Russians without the
knowledge of the other members of the creditors' committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Ipkendanz, appointed by Credit Suisse First Boston to
head the fund, disputed that, saying, ``The fund is open to all
banks and their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The same charges of separate dealing were leveled last month at
Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan, which accepted Russian terms for
debt restructuring _ said to be worth no more than 5 cents on the
dollar and possibly less _ when the others did not and before
Russian authorities had disclosed the full terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of the Credit Suisse Group,
said Monday that its Nikitsky Recovery Fund, which will last at
least seven years, would provide an alternative to the Russian
terms, enabling creditors to invest in infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at Monday's meeting said officials of Credit Suisse
First Boston had been reluctant to say whether the Russian central
bank had agreed to the terms of the new fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Ipkendanz, appointed as head of the fund, and who previously
led the Emerging Markets Fixed Income Group of Credit Suisse First
Boston, said in a telephone interview: ``We have been in a dialogue
at the highest level with the Russian government, and they have
approved in principle the creation of the fund. We are working on
the details and expect an announcement soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse said it would provide management and a $15 million
loan to the fund. But other bankers complained that the deal also
involved a management fee of 2 percent of the net asset value,
payable to Baiame Strategic Advisers Ltd., to be headed by
Ipkendanz.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank had been acting as the leader of the creditor
banks in negotiations with the Russians until it broke with the
group a few weeks ago and cut its own deal. The other banks decided
to proceed without a leader, which raised questions over the
group's future.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's development deepened that uncertainty by leaving the
creditor banks facing two clear options _ to accept Russia's terms
by a deadline of April 15, or to sign up for the Credit Suisse
First Boston fund by March 31. But bankers said that both
alternatives were risky and that one could undermine the other.
</P>
<P>
   The debt involves GKO Treasury bills and OFZ Finance Ministry
bonds held by foreign institutions when Russia defaulted on
billions in Treasury debt last August, setting off wide financial
trouble. Roughly a third of the debt was held by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In tortuous negotiations since then, Russian authorities offered
to refinance the debt in the form of new bonds and ruble payments
but they did not provide full details of the vaguely worded
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan accepted the deal
last month. Chase said it agreed to exchange its own holdings,
though not those of clients, while Deutsche Bank agreed to swap
part of its own holdings and some client holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston said it would contribute most of its
proprietary holdings to the new fund, adding in as statement that
it believed ``investors must be offered a real alternative to the
restructuring terms presently proposed by the Russians.'' It argued
that the 19-bank committee ``is not an effective forum to pursue
that alternative approach.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the statement said that Credit Suisse
First Boston would remain as a member of the committee ``in order
to obtain the best solution possible for those GKO and OFZ holders
who wish to participate in the Russians' restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, said that the new fund's existence could
weaken Russia's commitment to its existing repayment terms. And,
said an opponent who spoke in return for anonymity, ``it shows the
Russians that now the ranks of the creditors are truly divided.''

MEDICARE COMMISSION TO WEIGH PLAN WITH DRUG BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leaders of the bipartisan commission struggling
to resuscitate Medicare unveiled a compromise plan Monday that
would for the first time cover the cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ``represents both good policy as well as good
politics,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., co-author of the proposal
and chairman of the 17-member National Bipartisan Commission on the
Future of Medicare. It ``does what the people of this country want
us to do, that is to save Medicare (and) guarantee it will be there
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., will present the plan
up at the commission's final meeting Tuesday in a gamble that it
will win the 11 votes required by law for a formal recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But Breaux and Thomas, the co-chairman of the panel, made clear
that even if their plan does not win 11 votes, they intend to take
it to the floor of Congress for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal that we will present is the only reasonable way
to go,'' Thomas said. ``The work product of this commission will
become law.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is a new version of one introduced in January by Breaux
but retains the central feature of Breaux's original proposal: A
new government subsidy that would partly fund the purchase of
private health insurance tailored to the needs and income of
elderly people. Beneficiaries also would pay a premium averaging 12
percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
   But beneficiaries also could elect to stay in the existing
``fee-for-service'' system, in which the government pays set
amounts for medical bills and beneficiaries pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The plan unveiled Monday differs from the January version
because it adds coverage for prescription drugs. Under the new
proposal, health plans would be required to offer prescription
coverage for which beneficiaries would be expected to pay higher
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income beneficiaries _ a yearly income of up to $10,568 for
individuals and $13,334 for couples _ would be eligible for full
government coverage of prescriptions under the federal Medicaid
program.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had been deadlocked on what kind of fix is needed
for the 34-year-old program of government-paid medical assistance
to the elderly. Seven of the committee's nine Democratic members
want the prescription benefit but oppose the Breaux concept of
subsidies for the purchase of private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's eight Republican nominees support the Breaux
plan, but many say the drug benefit as unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   With a drug benefit now included, it remains to be seen whether
the revamped Breaux plan will win 11 votes. ``Stay tuned,'' Breaux
told reporters in a late-afternoon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made a pitch in his State of the Union message
for prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has proposed pumping 15 percent of projected budget
surpluses _ about $350 billion _ into Medicare. The money would
extend Medicare's lifespan from 2010 _ when it would become
insolvent if nothing is done _ to 2020.
</P>
<P>
   But the president has been silent on Breaux's subsidy idea,
leading Republicans to criticize him for not helping to drum up the
necessary votes among Democrats to make it an official commission
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only group that hasn't given us one vote is the
president's appointees,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of prescription drugs has skyrocketed in recent years,
rising 14 percent in 1997 alone. At the same time, drugs have
become integral elements of treating chronic illnesses. Often
doctors prescribe medications for conditions that might have
required hospitalization a decade or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senior-citizen advocates argue prescription drug coverage is
indispensable to any Medicare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without coverage of prescription drugs, you don't have
anything responsive to where medicine is going in the 21st
century,'' said John Rother, legislative director of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are skeptical. Greg Scandlen, health policy fellow
at the conservative Cato Institute, said that 65 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries get prescription coverage through private
``Medigap'' health insurance that covers what Medicare does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To turn that into a free-for-all program doesn't make sense
when Medicare already is on shaky financial ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Established by Congress in 1965, Medicare now provides health
insurance to nearly 40 million elderly Americans. Medicare's ``Part
A'' hospital insurance program, which pays hospital bills, is
financed through a 2.9 percent payroll tax split between employers
and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``Part B'' supplementary medical insurance program, which
pays for care by doctors and other health professionals, is funded
through beneficiary-paid premiums and general tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The government will spend about $207 billion on Medicare this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Social Security, Medicare faces the impending retirement of
a rising pool of beneficiaries _ the 70 million baby boomers born
between 1946 and 1964. Without changes, it will be up to the
less-populous ``Generation X'' _ 40 million people born between
1965 and 1980 _ to finance the government programs.

NEW STUDY CITES EXTINCTION DANGER TO RIGHT WHALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Already teetering on the brink of extinction, the Northern right
whale population has been shrinking since the early 1990s,
according to a disturbing new study, putting the animals on a path
to oblivion if more is not done to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and the University of Massachusetts at Boston, shatters
the widely held belief that the world's 300 remaining right whales
were slowly gaining numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the population has been declining as female right
whales have fewer calves while more whales die from collisions with
ships, entanglement with fishing gear, and perhaps pollution, the
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture is not good at all,'' said Hal Caswell, a
mathematical biologist at Woods Hole who calculated the whales
could become extinct in less than 200 years if current trends
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published in the current Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, are sure to heighten debate over
whether the federal government and other agencies are doing enough
to protect the right whale, already known as the most endangered of
the world's large whale species. For example, there are no
mandatory speed limits or other restrictions on ships when they
enter known right whale areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear change in the fate and fortune of right whales
in the last eight to 10 years that we don't fully understand, but
we had better begin to do something about it,'' warned Scott Kraus,
director of the New England Aquarium's Edgerton Research Laboratory
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Right whales, known for their distinctive V-shaped spouts,
white-speckled heads and the large filters through which they feed,
were hunted nearly to extinction by the early 20th century because
their slow speed and near-shore visits made them easy targets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other whale species such as the humpback, Northern right
whales have not rebounded strongly since the end of whaling.
Despite more than 60 years of federal protection, their numbers
remain so small that even a single death is viewed as a setback by
conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Their exact numbers are not easy to count because the animals'
habitat ranges from the Bay of Fundy in the north to the Florida
coast in the south. Caswell and the other researchers used
extensive photographic records from the New England Aquarium,
identifying each whale by unique marks such as the white growths on
their heads, called callosities.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the number of whale offspring remained
stagnant while the death rate rose significantly. As a result,
instead of a gain of 5 to 10 whales per year that had been
estimated in the 1980s, the researchers found the population was
shrinking by a few whales annually.
</P>
<P>
   At that pace, Caswell gave the whales less than 200 years until
extinction, and even fewer years if the death rate continues to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why right whales have fared so poorly is highly debated,
but Kraus's research, which was conducted separately from the
study, shows that part of the problem is that females are taking
longer to produce each calf, now waiting five years between each
offspring. He said the slowdown may reflect the long-term effects
of pollution, genetic inbreeding or natural changes in their food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kraus and other researchers point out that
relatively little has been done to reduce collisions with ships. He
said that a coalition of fishermen, shipping companies, and
conservationists has begun pressing Congress to provide more money
for measures such as acoustic signals that could warn whales when
ships are near.
</P>
<P>
   However, Caswell said the news may not be all bad. His analysis
does not include the impact of several new measures to prevent
fishing gear entanglements and to educate shipping companies that
could reduce whale deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Thounhurst, a marine mammal specialist at the National
Marine Fisheries Service, said that voluntary efforts to work with
mariners seem to be helping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much the entire fishing community knows about right
whales now. That's a lot of eyes on the water that we didn't have''
a few years ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kraus said right whale protections have failed in part
because the National Marine Fisheries Service has had too few
resources and too little direction. ``There is no overarching
vision for right whales in the Fisheries Service as far as I can
tell,'' said Kraus. ``That has really hurt them. They're trying to
do everything at once.''

ISLAMIC WORLD OPENS DOOR TO THE INTERNET, BUT RESTRICTIONS ARE
MANY
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ Ever so gingerly, the Internet is being
allowed across some final frontiers, into restrictive parts of the
Islamic world, under the wary eye of governments used to playing
Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Saudi Arabia, where access was barred until two
months ago, the change is being hailed as a belated revolution.
Internet cafes have sprung up in Teheran and Riyadh, and novices
are being dazzled by sites like Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authorities are trying to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, users _ who are monitored by some providers _ must
promise, among other things, that they ``will not contact stations
against Islamic regulations'' _ a reference to those with sexual
content. Violators are warned that they could lose Internet
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship in Saudi Arabia is even more overt. Under a system
that took two years to develop, all Internet connections in the
country have been routed through a hub outside Riyadh, where
high-speed government computers block access to thousands of sites
catalogued on a rapidly-expanding blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   Want to check out what opposition groups abroad have to say
about the ruling al-Saud family? ``Forbidden!!!'' the computer
responds. How about a chat service that allows for, well,
free-wheeling conversation? No again. A game of blackjack? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   ``All access attempts are logged,'' users are somberly warned,
in a hint that attempts to stray beyond what the Saudi government
considers acceptable bounds could have further, unspecified
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the enthusiasm with which the Internet is being received
seems to reflect a view that a little access is better than none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get angry that we had to wait so long,'' said
Hisham A. Turkistani, 25, a young Saudi who sat hunched over a
computer in Jidda's Cafe de Paris, Saudi Arabia's first Internet
cafe, listening to Mariah Carey on mtv.com. ``But now the Internet
is all that my friends and I talk about. There are so many things
in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening at the cafe in Jidda, on the Red Sea coast,
other customers _ who were paying $12 an hour for the privilege _
included a medical student, Hilal Sonbul, 25, clearly amazed as a
technician showed him how much information about his future
profession could be found with a few keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Persian Gulf in Iran, at another brand-new cafe, a
young man was sending an electronic greeting card to a friend in
the United States. He had also spent his Friday afternoon
downloading applications, he said, for admission to graduate
schools, among them the engineering program at the City University
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to take three or four weeks for letters to get
through; now it takes a few seconds,'' said the young man, who
would give his name only as Hamid. ``I know that some people here
are afraid of the Internet, but I don't think most of them even
know what the Internet is.''
</P>
<P>
   Technophobia is hardly new to the Middle East, where the
sensitivities of strict Islamic cultures and the worries of
security-conscious regimes have long been combined to justify
repressive censorship.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, every government in the region has
jammed radio broadcasts, intercepted publications, scuttled fax
transmissions, barred mobile telephones, or prohibited satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the Internet, however, many countries, such
as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, have quietly conceded the fight,
concluding that the benefits of the new technology far outweigh the
cost. In these countries and others, essentially unrestricted
Internet access has been available since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more conservative governments, such as Syria, Iraq, Iran
and Saudi Arabia, have done their best to keep walls in place.
There is no Internet access in Iraq and Syria, where the concept is
being studied by a committee headed by the son of President Hafez
al-Assad _ an indication of the matter's sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, an Islamic Republic that prohibits the publication of
photographs of women unless their heads and bodies are covered,
ordinary people were not permitted graphic access to the Internet
until December 1996, after the election of President Mohammad
Khatami ushered in an era of relative openness. Even now, the
service, whose prices begin at $330 a year for one hour a day,
remains too costly for all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, it was not until January that users could get
access to the Internet without first establishing an account abroad
and then connecting to the provider via an international call, at a
cost of at least $1 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules, 42 local providers have been licensed, after a
high-level government study that lasted two years. But the service
has been plagued by growing pains, and only 10,000 Saudis have
signed up so far, though some 115,000 are expected by the end of
the year _ a small fraction in a country of 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   And still, neither delays nor limitations have assuaged fears
that the information highway is a road to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A top Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Janatti, warned in a recent
Friday sermon that the ``disgraceful, immoral pictures'' broadcast
on the Internet were an affront to ``all humanity, morality and
chastity'' that ``threatens us all.'' Even now, the Iranian
government still has not officially legalized Internet use, perhaps
with an eye to conservative militias that have threatened attacks
on the offices of Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, criticism has been muted since King Fahd
himself issued a decree in March 1997 calling for the drafting of
guidelines for Internet use, thus offering the idea his implicit
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the system is in place, Saudi officials are seeking to
call attention to what is quickly becoming available _ including
Internet banking _ instead of what is banned. ``There is nothing to
block except two things _ that which is against our religion, and
that which is against our society,'' said Abdullah al-Rasheed,
deputy director of the King Abdelaziz Center for Science and
Technology, a government entity charged with supervising the
Internet in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, those criteria have proven far-reaching.
One local provider's effort to establish a Saudi chat site was
rejected, apparently out of concern that it would allow contact
between unmarried men and women _ still taboo in a society in which
even dating is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently for similar reasons, videoconferencing also remains
off limits. Sites containing nudity or sexual material are rendered
inaccessible. And the absolute ban on content ``against our
society'' has kept a lid on political dissent, barring access to
sites that offer any hint of criticism of the Saudi regime.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions have prompted some quiet criticism, mostly from
parents who argue that online contact between young people is a
healthy alternative to trying to suppress such contact altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not hearing the voice, they're not seeing the face, so
where is the haram there?'' asked Samar Fatany, a radio
broadcaster, using the Arabic word for something prohibited for
religious reasons. ``I don't think anyone can label it as a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the rules, the Saudi government has assumed the role
of parent _ using commercial software like Smart Filter, by Secure
Computer, to screen all requests and block contact to sites it
wants kept off-limits. The software is updated every day, Saudi
officials say, as Riyadh-based technicians add new sites to he
blacklist _ in part by watching to see which sites the Saudis
themselves seek out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' said Fadlil Khaliallah, 33, manager of
the Internet cafe in Jidda. ``If someone manages to get on to a bad
site, we otice that it is always blocked by the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of new web sites created every day, savvy users
can keep a step ahead of most restrictions; even Saudi officials
concede that keeping the blacklist up to date represents an uphill
fight. Still, they say they are determined to make sure that
Internet use in Saudi Arabia is kept within acceptable bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two choices,'' said Fahad al-Hoyany, a computer
scientist with degrees from three American universities who heads
the government's Internet Services Unit. ``Either you let it go
altogether, or you try to limit it, and we hope to at least protect
the innocents.''

WENDY'S FOUNDER WASN'T A HIT _ EXCEPT WITH CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Basile and Jim McKennan thought their advertising careers
were over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bates USA creative team had just broadcast their first
commercial for Wendy's International using its founder, R. David
Thomas, as the spokesman, and the press skewered it. They picked on
Thomas unmercifully, criticizing his flat Middle American delivery,
his open-faced expression and his pudgy physique. One critic even
called him ``a steer in a short-sleeved shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rough,'' recalled McKennan, a copywriter and group
creative director at Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates
Worldwide unit of Cordiant Communications Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   That was 10 years ago. Since then, Wendy's has broadcast more
than 640 television commercials using Thomas, making it the
longest-running campaign featuring a company founder as spokesman,
according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out that as rudimentary as the early spots were, a funny
thing happened after they ran on TV: consumers believed them. To
television viewers, Thomas resonated as a man who looks like what
he portrays _ the Horatio Alger-like inventor of the Wendy's
hamburger chain who enjoys a hearty meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you get,'' said Thomas, 66, speaking
recently in a phone interview from Miami where Bates was shooting a
series of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The Bates ad team concedes that Thomas' early performance _ in
which he guaranteed Wendy's quality or he ``wouldn't have named the
company'' after his daughter _ was ``awful,'' said Basile, an art
director and group creative director at Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech, pacing and rhythm were way off,'' Basile said.
``But he has a believability, an honesty and a sweetness that is so
far away from the glib spokesman that people were intrigued. People
said this is a real guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wendy's crucial franchise system _ which pays a portion of
the advertising _ embraced the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy's says the advertising works because ``it's not about
Dave; it's about Wendy's'' quality, and Thomas is the likable
messenger who is recognized by the public, said Don Calhoun,
Wendy's senior vice president for marketing in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said each of the 65 commercials Bates created annually
started with the product. The creative team then decides how Thomas
can promote it, often in a humorous way.
</P>
<P>
   Bates has also learned how best to use Thomas. The senior
chairman of Wendy's board _ whose aphorisms such as ``be nice'' are
called ``Dave-speak'' inside the company _ is often seen poking fun
at his own simplistic Dale Carnegie-like philosophy and his love of
the food he invented. One commercial showed Thomas at a chic
restaurant where the entrees are artistic creations the size of
peas; another had him writing to the blues great B.B. King, who
confesses a love for Wendy's food, with a letter extolling the
musician to ``Keep smiling, you'll beat those blues yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Wendy's is a mass-market business, the commercials are
designed to appeal more to a consumer attitude than to a
demographic segment of the population, said Gary Steele, managing
director of Bates Retail, a unit that oversees retail accounts. But
he said Wendy's did appeal slightly more to adults and women
because of its chili and salad menu offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The company spokesman genre was a favorite in the 1980s when it
was common to see Lee Iacocca pitching Chrysler, Frank Perdue
selling Perdue chicken and Orville Redenbacher for the popcorn with
the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not as popular, partly because companies realize
that not many chief executives have the kind of history and
business knowledge of, say, a Thomas, that would lead an agency to
use them as a representative, said Gary Stibel, principal of New
England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. He said a notable
exception today is the use of August Busch III and his son, August
Busch IV, in advertising for the beer giant Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   While Wendy's has had a good run, Stibel said he believed the
campaign was ``getting a little stale,'' and that the Wendy's adult
slant missed the all-important children's market, which is a
battlefield of advertising and toy giveaways between the hamburger
leader, the McDonald's Corp., and the second-ranked Burger King, a
unit of Diageo PLC; Wendy's is ranked third.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Wendy's adult concept is well positioned for the long
term because of the aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to drive growth in the future is the
adult-oriented convenience situation,'' said Bob O'Brien of NPD
Food Service Information Group in Rosemont, Ill., a research
concern. ``And Wendy's has the oldest skew to its buyer profile.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bates won the huge Wendy's account in 1987 while the chain was
suffering a malaise after the famous ``Where's the beef?'' campaign
created by its previous agency. That campaign's signature line was
picked up in the 1984 presidential campaign, and became part of the
American vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Although the account had billings of more than $100 million,
Bates found itself stymied because nothing the agency did excited
Wendy's. Calhoun recalled: ``The advertising wasn't incorrect.
There just wasn't a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Charles Rath, the former Wendy's marketing director, who
suggested using Thomas _ an idea that was not exactly embraced by
the urbane Bates ad team. Using a company spokesman is often
considered trite _ and an obvious move to massage a chief
executive's ego.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not so with Thomas, who did not even want to be in
the advertising and said he was nervous about how his name and
likeness would be depicted.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Thomas said, it is like ``a reunion'' to go on a
Wendy's shoot. In an advertising rarity, Bates has used virtually
the same 50 or so people over the last decade to create Wendy's
commercials, from the director, Billy Hudson, to extras.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Wendy's plans to continue the campaign, which Calhoun
said had contributed to Wendy's decade of growth and profits. In
1998, Wendy's systemwide sales of company and franchise-owned
stores increased 7 percent, to $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the minute sales turn soft,'' Steele said, the Thomas
campaign would be history.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be fine with Thomas, who said, ``If we don't have
the sales, I'm gone.''

BRUINS FOCUS ON EVEN-STRENGTH WEAKNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Bruins spent Monday's hour-plus practice working
on what has become their Achilles' heel of late: their play at even
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns put his club through several one-on-one drills
with an eye toward correcting some of the errors that led to a 3-1
loss in Buffalo Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play's not killing us,'' said Burns. ``We're ninth
in the league, it's not the (penalty killing), that's rated No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's killing us is the five-on-five goals. We're getting
beat one-on-one, we're getting guys walking out of the corners on
us. It's a lack of concentration. We talked about that. We've got
to be a lot better in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said it was incumbent upon both the defensemen and
forwards to be more diligent in following through on their
assignments. On the Sabres' third goal, which came off the stick of
Brian Holzinger at 9:19 of the third period, Burns said it was just
a colossal breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's four different errors on one play,'' he said.
``(Mattias) Timander gives the puck up, (Cameron) Mann and (Ken)
Belanger don't pressure the guy. (Dave) Ellett goes and takes the
wide guy and then Kenny comes in and doesn't know who to take and
then Ray (Bourque) is in front of the net. That's four major errors
right there on one goal. It might be (the result) of two games in
two nights and your concentration goes down, but it just can't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for it now. You can't get beat one-on-one,
not this time of year. We have a tough schedule compared to
everybody else. Everybody else has three games at home and three on
the road. In our next six games, we've got two at home and four on
the road plus we've got to play the No. 1 team _ Ottawa _ and in
Toronto twice. We can't go to sleep. We've got to be sharp in all
those areas. Every single game is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 games left, and this is the time of year when
players talk about the pressure of keeping mentally prepared and on
top of things with so much on the line. For Burns, it's a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week obsession. Burns, who has said he loses sleep many
nights by getting up to look at videotape or address some other
concern, said his concentration is different from that of his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know as coaches we do more than players do,'' he said. ``I
sit there and watch games and try to figure out things. I go back
and look at a tape once in a while or look at a goal. As coaches,
we have to do that because if we don't, we get our asses fired.
That's the difference between coaches and players. We get
unemployed and they just go to another team.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns empathized with Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, who
reportedly was going to lose his job if New York didn't beat
Charlotte Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 24 hours a day in all sports,'' he said. ``Look at Van
Gundy, he doesn't win the basketball game, he's fired. That's a lot
of pressure to go out there, and you don't hold your destiny. The
Knicks went out and won the game and if they don't win, he goes
home. That's the nature of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about being fired. It's happened before, it's
going to happen again. But we want the owners to be happy, we want
management to be happy. We want everybody to be happy. But when it
comes down, the pressure comes down on one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The objective during Monday's workout in Wilmington, and
today's, too, is to help players cut down on even-strength miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's no goals in a hockey game, there's no errors,''
said Burns. ``Mistakes are going to happen and that's part of the
game. If there were no errors, there would be no fun for anyone to
watch a hockey game or any sporting event. But when errors are
repeated and repeated, then they become mistakes and we wonder if
it's willingly or if it's just that maybe he can't do it anymore or
you can't do it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe, who enters Wednesday night's game in Toronto
with a 2.16 goals-against average and .923 save percentage,
considered the loss to the Sabres a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that was a great chance for us to get right
on their tails,'' Dafoe said. ``If you look at `The Week,' as Pat
called it, if we were going to go .500, we won the two games we
needed to win. It was a pretty good week. We played two on the road
and two at home and we split. I don't think it's tragic at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's positives in the way we played the games. I mean,
Buffalo didn't outplay us by any means. It was just a matter of
mistakes starting to add up. We dodged a couple late in the second
to hang in there. We addressed the issue but it was more talk than
action when we came out for the third. We did the same thing and
they capitalized.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Right wing Landon Wilson skated with the club and said he's
feeling much better after a few days off to recover from a mild
concussion. If he feels all right Tuesday, he'll skate again and
could play against the Maple Leafs.

   BERNALILLO, N.M. _ With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio
Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation.
Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north
from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado
once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in
the sky to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is
a giant neon star bearing the words ``Star Casino.'' Next to the
casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole
championship course. And just beyond that, construction is under
way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to
help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one
are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their
reservations. But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts,
gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these
people have for generations cherished and protected from outside
intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their
religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the
Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here. His
tribe is divided over whether they, too, should develop a casino
resort. ``We're trading our souls for money,'' he said. ``Some
tribe members say `Hey, it's OK. It's glamorous.' But that's not
what we are supposed to be. We are supposed to be stewards of this
land. And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this
stuff to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have
brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been
publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations. But a
once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder. Critics worry
that tourists will trample across what they consider to be
religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes
are forming are increasingly being operated by outside
professionals and managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino
and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member
of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe. But the
medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and
culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way.'' Leon, who
voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed
emotions. ``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said. ``But then more
of the Las Vegas types started moving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what
appears to be progress. Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now
operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than
$350 million a year in gambling revenues. And although there is
still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation
centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are
being made to augment the success of gambling. Several tribes are
expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts,
and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt
Hotels Corp. to build what is being billed as ``New Mexico's first
major golf and spa resort.'' The 350-room resort hotel will occupy
a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is
located 15 miles north of Albuquerque. The tribe will own the
resort and Hyatt will manage it. Additionally, the tribe is
doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las
Vegas-style theater. A retail shopping center is proposed for a
nearby section of the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana
Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation,
next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse. This year,
the tribe will host major golf tournaments, including the U.S.
Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see
it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to
increase economic opportunities. With pending lawsuits and other
initiatives that could shut down their casinos or lead to heavy
taxes on their revenues, they say they are creating an industry
that can survive even if the casinos do not. ``There are so many
attacks on Indian casinos,'' said Roy Montoya, who as chief
administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business
development. ``What the new resort represents is another step
toward self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils
comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to
private business has created two camps. The traditionalists are
leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the
business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand.
</P>
<P>
   As the profits from gambling began to add up, ``we considered
two approaches,'' Montoya said during an interview in his plain but
comfortable office on the reservation. ``Some people said stash the
money. Don't do anything with it. But we chose to put these
different ventures in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by
the economic growth. ``Our culture and religion was very strong
when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the
reservation,'' he said. ``Then when the economy started changing
and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak. But
with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with
your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will
become stronger again.''
</P>
<P>
   The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning. When
the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members
bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from
``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the business types said they needed that site next to the
river, overlooking the mountains,'' said Leon, whose grandfather
held the revered religious title of medicine man. The business
interests prevailed. As a result, Leon lamented: ``The religious
people are upset with us. They worry that the public will wander
over the reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the
religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the
tribe's history. Such museums are becoming a common element in
casino and resort developments on reservations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles
north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to
buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing
casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's
reservation. But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the
growth. Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former
security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has
prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values
and customs. ``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in
ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with
diversions like the casino,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in
the opportunities that have been created.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles
south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member,
was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across
Highway 47 from the tribe's casino. Although he has been playing
golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _
better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf
professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business
enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a
teaching professional at the course. ``But our goal is to see
someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers,
accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl
around the reservation is unnerving to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic
development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe
itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of
South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe. ``I'm amazed that many of the
tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives.
They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and
accountants _ white attorneys and accountants.''
</P>
<P>
   But if appearances count for anything, Roy Montoya appears to be
in control at Santa Ana. One day recently, he walked into a
closed-door meeting of casino executives because he wanted to have
a word with the casino's general manager, a Las Vegas transplant.
Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices,
interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who were
huddled around a conference table. When Montoya entered, they all
popped to their feet, smiling broadly. ``We own everything 100
percent,'' Montoya said. ``All of these people are on contract,
just like out in the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two
years, when current development projects are complete, that number
is projected to reach 700 _ more employees than tribal members.
``When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was
just called Roy,'' said the 58-year-old Montoya. ``Now people call
me sir. But I'm still Roy. I get uncomfortable with sir.''

DIRECTOR FACES OLD RESENTMENTS AT OSCAR CEREMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NANCY SCOTT  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On Sunday, Elia Kazan, famous worldwide as a
distinguished director of theater and film, will walk to the podium
at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles to receive an honorary
Oscar, and if, God forbid, there is an ovation, the sound will be
drowned for some of us by a clamor and a screaming from long-gone
ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first award for Kazan; he has had Oscars before
now, most famously for 1954's ``On the Waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   But news of the special honor has provoked contradictory and
impassioned emotions for hundreds, probably thousands, and the
upcoming ceremony may turn out to be the most divisive and
troublesome moment in the Academy's history because Kazan, 89, is
also known worldwide as the stool pigeon who sold out his
colleagues before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide is no exaggeration. Bernard Gordon, the 79-year-old
blacklisted screenwriter who has begun a protest against Kazan's
award, has received calls from journalists in Brazil, South Africa,
Spain and Colombia; he has heard from the New York Times and from
more than two dozen other newspapers. The first major evidence of
protest will be an ad scheduled to appear in Variety asking the
Oscar audience ``to sit silent'' when Kazan receives his award. A
civilized concept, this one _ no boos or hisses or walking out,
just silence.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Sekler of the Los Angeles Alternative Media Network, who is
preparing the ad, hopes to muster 100 names.
</P>
<P>
   Sekler has ``a handful of famous names,'' although she preferred
not to say who they are just yet (shades of the old days).
</P>
<P>
   Famous names aside, Sekler has signed children of the
blacklisted _ Chris Trumbo, son of the late Dalton Trumbo, who went
to jail for refusing to name names, and Becca Wilson, daughter of
the late Michael Wilson, who wrote ``Bridge on the River Kwai''
(with blacklisted writer Carl Foreman) and received no public
recognition for the Oscar-winning script until 20 years after the
fact.
</P>
<P>
   While the audience inside will _ perhaps _ sitting silent,
Gordon will be wearing a tuxedo and standing in silent vigil
outside the Chandler Pavilion on Oscar Night with as many of his
generation as are willing and able to join him. They are calling
themselves the Committee for Silence, and if they appear on TV _
and I surely hope they will; it's not 1952, I keep telling myself _
I expect that some viewers who were not even born when these elder
citizens were cast out of Hollywood will find the whole spectacle
as mysterious and puzzling as the Wars of the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   They'll probably find it amusing, too _ a bunch of tuxedoed
geezers protesting something that happened 47 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's not the number of names Kazan named to the
House committee, or the nature of those he named; it was his
distinguished reputation that counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He validated the committee,'' says Bernard Gordon. ``It meant
they could continue the blacklist.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Kazan named names and shut up about it, resentment might
have dwindled, but he chose to take out a lengthy ad in the New
York Times excoriating communism.
</P>
<P>
   Even that might have faded from memory, but there were also
rumors that he had made a big- money deal with a major film
producer contingent on naming names.
</P>
<P>
   And there is this: Unlike many informers, Kazan has never
apologized. Add it all up, and as Victor Navasky, publisher of The
Nation magazine puts it, ``Kazan emerged in the folklore of the
left as the quintessential informer.''
</P>
<P>
   Navasky has this to say about Kazan's award. ``He's obviously a
great director, and I do believe that he ought to be honored for
his art. On the other hand, if he is receiving a lifetime
achievement award, he ought to be reminded of his entire
contribution, and that includes keeping other people from
working.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does Kazan deserve to be called great? Absolutely. His triumphs
would fill a page. Among the high points: In 1949, he directed the
celebrated premiere of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' and
Miller (a witness before the House committee who refused to name
names) has written in his autobiography that he believed Kazan
``was a genius of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan directed ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' a breakthrough film on
anti-Semitism in 1947, and won an Oscar for it; in 1949, with John
Ford, he directed ``Pinky,'' a film on racism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 and '50, he directed ``Boomerang'' and ``Panic in the
Streets,'' films of conscience. ``It was because he took social
content so much to heart,'' writes Navasky, ``that his appearance
caused such astonished dismay.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan directed ``On the Waterfront'' two years after his
testimony before the House committee, and his hero was a stool
pigeon. His later films include ``Viva Zapata,'' ``East of Eden''
and ``America, America,'' a rich and gorgeously photographed story
of the immigrant experience based on Kazan's own novel.

 &HT;    Duffel bag may have hidden clinic bomb
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ Federal agents investigating whether fugitive
Eric Robert Rudolph was involved in Saturday's early-morning blast
at a downtown abortion clinic are looking for a suspect who might
have concealed the bomb in a duffel-type bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to know if I saw anybody carrying a bag,''
neighbor Ronald Jones, 37, said Monday, after being questioned by
the FBI on Sunday. ``They asked whether I saw any strangers or any
unusual cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is wanted in the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham
abortion clinic, in which a nail bomb was planted in a plastic tool
box, and in three Atlanta bombings, including an explosion in
Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympics in which a bomb
was concealed in a small military-style backpack.
</P>
<P>
   In a news briefing in Asheville on Monday, officials of the FBI,
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S.
Marshal Service reiterated that they have no suspects and no
evidence linking Rudolph to the Femcare clinic explosion that
startled residents in the working-class neighborhood shortly after
7 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of Femcare said the clinic has been the target of
increasing protests in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extremists are really hurting my business,'' said Ronda
Hensley, 38, owner of Accents, a beauty salon next door to Femcare.
``I am getting tired of this _ the protesting, the bomb threats,
now the bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Femcare was one of numerous clinics that last month received
packages said to contain potentially deadly anthrax bacteria.
Agents descended on the Femcare building, and one entered wearing a
protective suit and mask, but the scare turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence gathered from Saturday's blast is being examined at
ATF's laboratory in Atlanta. ``A good bit of comparison was
accomplished,'' said ATF special agent Richard Fox, but he released
few of the findings aside from the bomb's potential power.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the bomb partly detonated, causing no injuries
and no evident damage to the clinic. If the bomb had exploded as
officials think it was intended to, it could ``have devastated the
entire end of the building and gone into the building approximately
40 to 60 feet,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this bomb was intended to go off and . . . to
kill, maim or hurt people,'' Fox said. Authorities said no one has
reported receiving any warning that the bomb had been planted.
</P>
<P>
   The Asheville bombing drew more than 30 investigators, including
members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, who have been searching
for Rudolph for almost a year in the rugged mountains around
Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work
of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said at the Monday
news briefing. ``It is too early, of course, to draw any
conclusions. . . . It is early in the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who lives about 100 yards behind Femcare, said he saw
nothing suspicious in the hours before the explosion. Later
Saturday, shortly after noon and then around 8:30 p.m., he said he
heard two more blasts, presumably caused by agents detonating parts
of the bomb that had not gone off in the original explosion. Darryl
Unruh, a 61-year-old businessman who owns the building housing the
Accents salon, said police in recent months have photographed the
anti-abortion protesters from his building.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling along Orange Street two or three days a week, the
protesters have numbered from one or two to as many as 15, Unruh
said. One has used an amplified sound system to urge women arriving
at the clinic not to go inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly do not appear violent,'' Unruh said.

 &HT;    Former marine claims Cleland's injuries not a result of own
grenade

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For 31 years, Sen. Max Cleland has blamed his loss
of three limbs on his carelessness with a grenade on a hilltop in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cleland learned that the grenade, and thus the fault,
may not have been his.
</P>
<P>
   The news in no way undoes the terrible damage Cleland, then an
Army captain, suffered on Hill 440 near Khe Sanh on April 8, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia's Democratic senator said Monday that it will
``provide some emotional healing.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lloyd, a former Marine, said he was on the same hill when
a grenade ripped off Cleland's legs and right arm.
</P>
<P>
   After he wrapped a tourniquet around Cleland's thigh, he tended
to another soldier who had been slightly wounded by fragments from
the M-26 grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crying and saying, 'It was my grenade, it was my
grenade,' `` Lloyd recalled in a telephone interview Monday from
his home in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's version of the horror and confusion that followed the
explosion on Hill 440 near Khe Sanh might never have been shared
with Cleland if Lloyd had not been watching a History Channel
program on medics and corpsmen a few weeks back.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland was describing his experience and crediting a Navy
corpsman, attached to a Marine unit, with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took it for granted that it was his grenade,'' Lloyd
said of Cleland. ``That's when I realized he didn't know. He was
living with it for years and feeling bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, a retired Delta Air Lines employee, contacted Cleland's
office. The two men eventually spoke by telephone, and last week
they shared lunch on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost been like a second emotional grenade,'' Cleland
said.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the story has never been about Cleland's wounds,
but his remarkable recovery. His inspirational rehabilitation
undergirds his political career.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever be able to say conclusively how a live grenade
came to rest on the helicopter pad atop the hill. Cleland noticed
it, he has said innumerable times, only after the helicopter that
deposited him there had lifted off. ``I did not know it was live,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The M-26 fragmentation grenade was standard issue for American
servicemen in Vietnam. It typically had a five-second fuse, which
was ignited when a soldier pulled the grenade's pin and let go of
the ``spoon,'' or handle.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's accounts of the accident have shifted, but in an
April 30, 1968, report, Army Capt. Charles E. Steuer wrote, ``The
source of the grenade, and how it became armed ... could not be
determined.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cleland said he has always been haunted by the idea that he
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The story Lloyd told him, of a newly arrived private who
straightened the pins on his grenades to make them easier to
activate in combat, ``meshes with the bits and pieces of
information that I have,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, a corporal in a mortar squad, said he never knew the
private's name. But he said the soldier was on his feet and covered
with blood when Lloyd approached him.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd took away the soldier's other grenades to avoid another
mishap, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Dave told me this I didn't get much sleep the next
night, because it opened up all the old wounds, all the old
thoughts that I had tried to lay aside to get on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine the terrible thing of living with something
like this ... living with the mystery, not the knowledge, but the
mystery that somehow or another you might have screwed up
somehow?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the senator believes that particular burden has been lifted
from his shoulders. But he is not about to place it on someone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever came across that individual,'' Cleland said, ``I
would give him a big hug and say, 'Don't worry, don't feel guilty.
A thousand things could have happened to us out there.' ''

   PRUGOVAC, Yugoslavia _ It was mid-morning on the main road north
out of Kosovo. Police had blocked off the road and automatic
gunfire rattled beyond the village. Over the brow of the hill,
three Yugoslav army tanks pulled into position beside the road,
training their guns on the houses opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers climbed out of their cars to watch as armored troop
carriers and trucks of soldiers poured down the hill and into the
village. More soldiers took up positions along the road, hunkering
down beneath a grassy bank.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath their guns, a middle-aged woman in black, carrying a
bright green plastic shopping bag, walked down the path and into
the garden of her house. Another day in Kosovo. There is a war
going on and it is happening outside everyone's backdoor.
</P>
<P>
   The activity in Prugovac was a typical operation for the
Yugoslav army and police forces. A sniper had shot and wounded an
army officer driving his jeep down the main road at mid-morning,
and the security forces reacted swiftly and with full force.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles west, a group of ethnic Albanian villagers stood
waiting for a bus outside the village of Stanovac. As they talked
beside the road, gunfire crackled behind them. No one even
flinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been shooting since six this morning. We are leaving
for Vuctirn,'' said Ejup Kosumi, a 22-year-old student, as he ran
for the bus heading for the nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   A 60-year-old grandmother who identified herself as Nefiz sat
slumped on a concrete block, too weary to try to catch the bus.
``We left the village on Friday because bullets were flying over
our gardens. Everyone was gettingout, so I did too.'' She returned
on Monday to milk the cow and check on her sons who had stayed
behind.
</P>
<P>
   She said men were firing from the Serbian village, which backed
on to Stanovac, barely 500 yards away. ``They want us to leave our
houses so they can come in and steal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still further on, heavy explosions resounded in the hills.
Serbian forces were shelling to the west in a large-scale operation
to clear villages suspecting of harboring guerrillas of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe are struggling to keep up with pockets of
fighting that are breaking out day and night all over Kosovo. On
Sunday, monitors attempted to drive into the village of Stanovac
but were fired upon from the Serbian village of Grace. When the
monitors tried to drive into the Serbian village, the police
blocked them.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday the monitors were admitting there was nothing they
could do. There was no sign of their neon orange vehicles on the
road outside Stanovac. Most of them were tied up monitoring other
events. ``The nastiness has increased lately,'' commented one
monitor in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors are mostly military men, but they are unarmed and
wear civilian clothes in Kosovo. They are showing frustration at
having to monitor the cease-fire violations, which are growing in
number and seriousness by the day. ``This mission is past its
sell-by date; there is nothing much more that we can do,'' said one
senior military figure in the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE has watched as a string of villages has come under tank
and mortar fire for more than a week now. Yugoslav army forces took
over the Albanian village of Mijalic and were guarding the entrance
with a tank and several troop trucks, keeping journalists and
monitors away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war zone, '' said a young Serbian soldier guarding
the road, an automatic rifle at the ready across his chest. ``It is
dangerous and you must leave.''
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell, fires broke out in the houses across the lower
half of the village, blazing fiercely against the darkening sky.
Bright flashes of light showed through the smoke as mortars were
fired, impacting with a heavy crump moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Across the fields several men ventured out from houses to watch
the war on their doorstep. They pointed out the villages that were
burning. ``This one here is Mijalic, that is Glavatin, and over
there is Bechuk,'' said Isak Caka, a 35-year-old builder and ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are torching the villages by hand,'' he said of the
Yugoslav army. ``They want to leave us out in the woods with no
roof over our heads because they do not even want to set eyes on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Media Center in Pristina issued a statement on
Mondayh blaming the Kosovo Liberation Army, known as the KLA, for
provoking the Yugoslav troops and said the guerrillas were seeking
to push NATO to use force against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But the men disagreed. They said everyone knew guerrilla
fighters had been present in Mijalic before the army's operation,
but they argued the scale of the retribution was unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   Of the group of six, four of the men were refugees from villages
in the region, and had fled with their families down the valley.
Now they had sent the women and children on again to the nearby
town and said they were watching developments by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid. They do not ask you if you have KLA in your
village or not,'' Caka said.

DuPONT, EXPANDING INTO BIOTECHNOLOGY, PLANS TO BUY PIONEER HI-BRED
 
 (fb) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DuPont Co., seeking to create an agricultural powerhouse to
match its giant chemical business, said Monday that it would pay
more than $7.7 billion in cash and stock to buy the remaining 80
percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the world's largest
producer of seed corn.
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which the companies had said on Friday was in the
works _ is part of DuPont's effort to push aggressively into the
life sciences arena, where it would compete in the race to create
and develop genetically engineered seeds and crops.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Pioneer, a company that sells corn, soybean and
other seeds, DuPont hopes to develop genetically altered seeds and
sell them directly to farmers worldwide in tandem with DuPont's
herbicides and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which already owned 20 percent of Pioneer, said on
Monday that it would acquire the remainder by paying the equivalent
of $40 a share, with 45 percent of that in cash and 55 percent in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Pioneer, which is based in Des Moines, rose $4.0625 on
Monday, or 11.8 percent, to $38.375. DuPont, based in Wilmington,
Del., fell $1.50, to $56.25.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, analysts say, some of the world's largest
drug and life sciences companies have been scrambling to position
themselves in the fast-growing field of genetically engineered
crops and drugs, and companies like DuPont want to be involved with
seeds to guarantee greater access to that business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seed companies are the key to the whole world of
biotech,'' said Leonard G. Teitelbaum, an analyst at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co. ``How do you get your seeds to the farmer? You don't put them
in an envelope and mail them. It's through seed companies.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Monday, Charles O. Holliday Jr., the
chief executive of DuPont, said that while DuPont had not expected
to make a large acquisition that might weaken the company's stock,
rapid developments in the life sciences made such a deal urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``one of the most important mergers in U.S.
history,'' Holliday said the acquisition of Pioneer would allow
DuPont to participate in the creation of higher-yielding crops and
more nutritious foods in a world where the amount of available
arable land will soon be inadequate to handle a growing population.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why such a deal needed to take place now, he replied:
``Speed. Speed. Speed.'' The company simply could not sit around
and wait for things to happen, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the acquisition is approved by regulators, DuPont will take
control of the last remaining giant seed company, making DuPont a
formidable competitor to Monsanto Co., which has acquired more than
$8 billion worth of large seed companies over the last two years,
adding the heft of being the world's largest seed company to its
strengths in herbicides and genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement appears to preclude any deal between
DuPont and Monsanto, coming just weeks after executives close to
the companies said the two were considering a giant combination
that would join their life sciences and pharmaceutical divisions.
Wall Street analysts say a deal between Monsanto and DuPont could
now run into antitrust problems because of their dominant positions
in seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised Monday's deal, saying that there were
indications that Pioneer had pushed itself into a marriage with
DuPont after reports circulated about a DuPont-Monsanto deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several analysts said they were puzzled by the deal and
how swiftly it had occurred. Beginning in late 1997, DuPont spent
about $1.7 billion for a 20 percent stake in Pioneer, and the two
companies agreed to collaborate on research and development. But
under the terms of the agreement, DuPont agreed not to increase its
stake for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have scrapped that agreement and over the
weekend the boards of both companies agreed to the deal, which lets
Pioneer retain its name and its headquarters in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pioneer had to be looking over its shoulder, and DuPont was
looking to get deeper into life sciences,'' said George S. Dahlman,
an analyst at Piper Jaffrey. ``They had a chance to work with each
other, so that made the deal easier.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont said that financing for some of the cash portion of the
offer would come from the $4.4 billion raised in the spinoff last
year of the Conoco energy unit.
</P>
<P>
   Holliday acknowledged that DuPont, which had revenue of more
than $25 billion last year, had shown lackluster earnings growth
last year. But he said DuPont was steering a new course toward
pharmaceuticals and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont said last week that it would create a separate tracking
stock for its life sciences business to allow the operations to
participate more actively in industry consolidation. The company
also said that it planned to seek alliances in the pharmaceuticals
business.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, which was founded in 1926 by Henry Wallace, who was a
vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt, has about 5,000
employees; DuPont has about 92,000 employees. The Wallace family
currently has a 14 percent stake in Pioneer.

 &HT;    El Paso-Sonat deal stirs interest in metro utilities
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday's announcement that Texas-based El Paso Energy
Corp. is acquiring Birmingham-based Sonat Inc. and forming the
largest U.S. interstate natural gas pipeline company may have
implications for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies operate gas pipelines that connect to Atlanta Gas
Light Co.'s network. Sonat also is a partner with AGL Resources
Inc., parent of the Georgia utility, in the wholesale gas and
electricity marketing business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a combined company could emerge as a competitor to
Atlanta-based Southern Co. as it moves into the electricity
business. And the new company could become an acquisition target
for Southern, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of announcing his company was acquiring Sonat for
$6 billion in stock and assumed debt, El Paso Chairman William Wise
placed a courtesy call to Walter Higgins, chief executive officer
of AGL Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he thought the merger created some very interesting
possibilities for our company and Georgia,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   AGL announced last month it would review its 35 percent stake in
a natural gas marketing venture with Sonat after $4.1 million in
losses during the first fiscal quarter. (El Paso has a similar
business of its own.) Higgins said the merger had created a ``new
set of alternatives'' for the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could also have an impact on interstate pipeline
links to Atlanta Gas Light's 30,000-mile pipeline system that
supplies 1.5 million homes and businesses in Georgia and part of
Tennessee. The utility currently gets about 85 percent of its gas
supplies from Sonat pipelines, 15 percent from Transco and 5
percent from El Paso's East Tennessee pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   AGL has filed plans to drop the East Tennessee pipeline in favor
of a new interstate pipeline it plans for North Georgia in a 50-50
partnership with Transco, a subsidiary of the Tulsa, Okla.-based
Williams Cos.
</P>
<P>
   PSC Chairman Stan Wise said he does not view the merger as
anticompetitive in Georgia because interstate pipeline charges are
regulated by the federal government. But the merger may give AGL
and Transco more ammunition when the PSC opens hearings April 12.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern acquisition of Sonat could face antitrust barriers
because of the Alabama company's concentration of assets in
Southern's Southeastern service territory.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Southern held unsuccessful negotiations
to acquire El Paso. The talks reportedly collapsed over what role
El Paso Chairman William Wise would have played in a combined
company.
</P>
<P>
   Under Monday's merger plans, Wise will be the CEO of the merged
company, the corporate headquarters will be in Houston, and the
name will be El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barry M. Abramson, utilities industry analyst at
PaineWebber, El Paso will now be positioned to compete against
Southern in the fast-growing gas-and-electric national wholesale
business. He also said Southern, the largest U.S. power generator,
could end up acquiring the combined company. ``It's big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenue of the combined company would be $9.5 billion, with $15
billion in assets. Southern's revenue last year was $11.4 billion,
with assets of $36.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wise told The Wall Street Journal his company does not need to
``inhale a slow-growth utility'' to grow. But El Paso said it will
expand into the unregulated wholesale electricity business with the
expanded company.
</P>
<P>
   Sonat announced plans last week to build an electric power plant
in Upson County, its third Georgia power plant project. El Paso
already has stakes in 17 U.S. power plants, though it is still
primarily a gas company.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Tirello, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said El Paso will
``not be a big threat'' to Southern unless or until it greatly
expands its electricity holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But once Wise consolidates the two companies, El Paso will be
attractive as an acquisition for any number of big electric
companies that want to become full-service energy providers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tirello predicted a new owner during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fits into a lot of big strategies,'' he said. ``In time,
this could be the next acquisition of the Southern Co.''

 &HT;    Milestone not touched, but close a record
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market roared skyward like a jet through
clouds Monday but failed again to break through the magical barrier
of 10,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   In a rally that began at the opening bell and lasted all day,
the Dow rose three times within striking distance, once coming as
close as 30 points before settling back to close at a new high of
9,958.77.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dow's fourth high in seven trading sessions. Broader
market indexes also advanced.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 12.67 to 1,307.26, also a
record. The Nasdaq, driven by technology issues, rose 49.91 to
close at 2,431.44.
</P>
<P>
   There was a clear consensus _ from clerks on up to top members
of the New York Stock Exchange _ that 10,000 will be surpassed
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even bearish experts said they don't think the Dow can be
stopped for more than another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, expressed alarm at the Dow's recent rise, calling
it unjustified and reflecting a speculative mania in which
investors are buying simply because it seems like everyone else is.
Stocks are overpriced by any historical standard, and many analysts
believe the market is at least 20 percent overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dangerous,'' said Robert W. Seijas of Fleet
Specialists, who holds one of the most important positions on the
exchange floor. He is a specialist who deals in high-quality stocks
such as Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and AGL Resources, parent of
Atlanta Gas Light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public investors tend to chase strength. They buy stocks that
are going up, and that's fine _ until the end. They (stock prices)
won't go up forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Seijas said the danger is that naive investors are throwing
money at highly speculative stocks of Internet companies that are
actually losing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that folly must be paid, '' he said. ``Quality
is smart investing, stocks like Coke and Procter &AMP; Gamble. They
make things. Internet stocks make noise.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Buying some of these Internet stocks is like paying
$150,000 for a Cadillac. It may be a great car, but it's certainly
not worth that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, hundreds of tourists in lower Manhattan braved the snow
and sub-freezing temperatures to visit the New York Stock Exchange
in hopes of catching a glimpse of history from the visitors gallery
25 feet above the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   The din was constant among the traders _ but not as much as it
was during the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, or the Friday the 13th
mini-crash in October 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Many floor brokers were almost nonchalant going about their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a number,'' said trader Frank Schultz, 52. ``It'll
hit 10,000 and then go higher. The public is fascinated with
numbers. We'll hit it this week, easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Brahams, 49, of Los Angeles, was one of the spectators
crowding the visitors gallery, gawking at the swirl of red, green,
blue and black jackets below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive it'll hit 10,000,'' said Brahams. ``People may be
a little skittish, but we're still positive.''

 &HT;    Home Depot seeks to authorize more shares
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot shareholders are voting on the company's
proposal to double the number of authorized shares of common stock
from 2.5 billion shares to 5 billion, according to a preliminary
proxy filed last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based home improvement retailer said the additional
shares would be used for potential stock splits and dividends, as
well as to ``meet future business and financial obligations,''
according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opens the door for a stock split, but I wouldn't read too
much into it,'' said analyst Stephen Long of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot shares recently have been trading in the mid-$60s,
Long noted. ``They like to split more in the $70 to $80 range.''
</P>
<P>
   The proxy also noted an increase in base salaries for Chairman
Bernard Marcus and Chief Executive Arthur Blank. In 1998, both
salaries rose roughly 12.5 percent to $900,000, from about $800,000
in the previous year. Marcus and Blank each received bonuses of $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Blank's base salary will increase to $1 million effective in
April. The preliminary proxy didn't reveal Marcus' 1999 salary.
Marcus and Blank do not receive annual stock option grants.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's annual meeting is scheduled May 26 at the Cobb
Galleria. The company may broadcast the meeting over the Internet
through its Web site.

 &HT;    'Craziness' of market attracting spectators, speculators
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Financial manias have been occurring ever since ''Peg
Leg'' Peter Stuyvesant hobbled down what's now Wall Street before
the British kicked out his Dutch settlers and changed the Big
Apple's name from New Amsterdam to New York.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening on Wall Street now represents the latest, and
many experts fear it will end the same way as all the others: A
bust.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, seems to doubt that the Dow Jones industrial
average will break through the 10,000 mark this week, and possibly
today, culminating a gigantic rally from 5,000 only four years ago.
The runup has made thousands of investors rich, and at least as
many far richer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is craziness,'' says Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and one of the Street's most respected analysts. ''It's like
the Super Bowl, this fascination with 10,000. I think it's a good
time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs is a big bear, but he's outnumbered by raging bulls even
though by historical standards, stocks are way overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   The speculative frenzy that has lifted the prices of many
Internet stocks to astronomical levels has drawn in countless
investors, many of whom have never experienced a bear market and
whose brokers were still in college when the Dow crashed in 1987,
Seijas said Monday as the world watched to see if the Dow would hit
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But for every expert who's cautious, there seems to be two or
three who're still raging bulls, like Ralph Acampora of Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love what's going on,'' he said. ''All the people who're
concerned because they say it's only the Dow that's rising, I
disagree. We are going to cross the bar and keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, says
he's worried, too, but not about a major decline.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply time, he said, to be careful. ''Forget the forest,''
Acuff said. ''Look at the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But many famous economists, such as Harvard's John Kenneth
Galbraith, who has written books detailing previous manias in
history, aren't as upbeat. He compares what's happening on Wall
Street now to the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, when the people of
Holland went wild trading tulip bulbs, many of which had been
infected with viruses that made them not only beautiful, but
unique.
</P>
<P>
   That ''bubble'' burst, bankrupting thousands in Europe who had
paid the equivalent of $50,000 in today's money for a single tulip
bulb.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this goes back more than 300 years,'' Gailbraith said
Monday in an interview from his Boston home. ''What we know for
sure is, what goes up eventually comes down, and extravagantly.
Everyone should be warned by what has happened throughout
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The tulip mania, he said, was the first recorded in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen, footmen,
maid-servants, even chimney-sweeps and old clotheswomen dabbled in
tulips,'' Galbraith said in his 1990 book, ''A Short History of
Financial Euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what made people come to their senses, he said, but
thousands were reduced to ''beggary.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came the Mississippi Bubble in 1720. A Scotsman named John
Law concocted a scheme to pay off the French national debt by
establishing a bank and selling stock in it. Trouble was, Galbraith
said, people thought they were investing in a company that would
search for gold in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   The bubble burst when investors realized their money went to pay
the French debt and line the pockets of Law and a handful of French
nobles.
</P>
<P>
   Law fled for his life back to England, where another bubble was
ballooning. Investors there formed the South Sea Co., which agreed
to pay off England's national debt for the exclusive right to trade
in the Pacific. Shares were in great demand until one day people
realized that Spain controlled the area, and that there were few
people in the area to enslave _ a major part of the South Sea Co.'s
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were other bubbles in between, another blew up in
the United States after the formation of America's first central
bank. It floated loans for speculative ventures, which didn't pan
out, causing that bubble to burst in 1837.
</P>
<P>
   America plunged into a depression in 1873 and again 20 years
later. The first burst, experts of the day said, because the U.S.
was trying to retire Civil War debt and move to a gold standard.
The collapse in the 1890s was loosely blamed on a railroad boom
characterized by corruption and thievery.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few others afterward, but the classic example came
in 1929, when the stock market crashed after a years-long
speculative frenzy similar to what's happening now in the Internet
sector, Galbraith said. A contributing factor was that people could
buy stock with only a 10 percent down payment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after the Dow had rallied from 777 in 1982 to over
2,700, Wall Street crashed again, and no one has, as yet, figured
out quite why, Galbraith said, though many reasons have been
offered.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is not to say another crash is in the offing, but
''people should be warned by history,'' Galbraith. ''It does repeat
itself. And economic predictions should always be regarded with
skepticism, now as then.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of economists: those who don't know, and
those who don't know they don't know.'' Stuyvesant, incidentally,
was the last Dutch governor of New Amsterdam. The wall for which
Wall Street was named was constructed on his orders.
</P>
<P>
   And it was built by a pirate.

 &HT;    Atlanta won't get 2003 Super Bowl
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In a mixed-bag day for Atlanta, National Football
League officials said Monday that the Georgia Dome will be the site
of a Monday Night Football game in 1999 but not the 2003 Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While the NFL is not expected to make a formal announcement on
the fate of the 2003 title game during this week's owners'
meetings, the decision to remove it from San Francisco already has
been made.
</P>
<P>
   The game was awarded to San Francisco contingent upon the city's
ability to complete a new stadium. That project, though, remains
uncertain and the NFL could wait no longer for a resolution to the
political and economic issues jeopardizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director of special events Jim Steeg, the league's
point man on Super Bowls, and commissioner Paul Tagliabue declined
comment on the 2003 game. However, the game is expected to be moved
to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will have at least one, and more likely two, Monday
Night games this season. Although the regular-season schedule will
not be released until early April, the Falcons probably will face
either Minnesota or San Francisco at home. The Falcons have not
played in a Monday night game since '93. They have not won on
Monday night since 1981, the longest such drought in the NFL, and
have lost seven in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion stalled
</P>
<P>
   Just three hours after Tagliabue assured the media Monday
afternoon the expansion committee would have a recommendation on
Los Angeles or Houston by the end of the day, the process stalled
again and none was forthcoming. It now appears there is some chance
the meetings will adjourn without a recommendation. Clearly some
owners are enamored of the package presented by Houston businessman
Bob McNair. ``Right now we don't even have the 24 votes (necessary)
for expansion,'' said Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson,
chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Talking turkey
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is expected to discuss today a proposal by owners Lamar
Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs and Thomas Benson of the New Orleans
Saints to rotate the Thanksgiving Day games currently held in
Detroit and Dallas. The resolution will not receive enough support.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension, fine for DeBartolo
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue is expected to announce today that San Francisco 49ers
owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. will be suspended for one year and fined $1
million. DeBartolo stepped down from the team to fight federal
racketeering charges in Louisiana, then agreed to a deal in which
he'll testify against former Gov. Edwin Edwards. The club has been
run by his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and former coach Bill
Walsh recently was installed as team president. Most owners agree
DeBartolo should not be able to regain the 49ers until they
evaluate his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Footing the Bills
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills reached a three-year contract extension with
quarterback Doug Flutie. The extension created a four-year deal
worth $22 million and included a signing bonus of $6 million.
Counting the five-year contract the Bills negotiated with Rob
Johnson in July, the team has spent $14.5 million in signing
bonuses for quarterbacks over the past eight months. Owner Ralph
Wilson and general manager John Butler said there are no plans to
trade Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens to get Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens agreed in principle to a deal to acquire
Lions quarterback Scott Mitchell for a third-round choice this year
and a late-round pick in 2000. The Ravens will trade quarterback
Jim Harbaugh to San Diego for a fifth-rounder. . . . The Falcons
were awarded a compensatory seventh-round pick in this year's draft
for free-agency losses last spring.

   A Wisconsin brick cheese described as ``sturdy'' and made under
the Country Cheese brand by the Klondike Cheese Co. of Monroe,
Wis., has been chosen winner of the U.S. Championship Cheese
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milfred Severson &LR; , head cheesemaker at Klondike Cheese, said
he'd been working to win the contest for 30 years. ``I can't

appropriately enough, Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking, which took place Friday, ``featured a
27-foot model gondola with three tiara-topped beauty queens aboard
towed by a pickup through the dry canal channel. A dust devil
briefly struck the speaking platform, popping balloons and sending
others skyward, and a confetti-bearing plane made three unfruitful

said something like, ``Pi Day's today. Meet you at the
Exploratorium.'' The message, however, was left on a wrong number;
its recipient, thinking the caller was a member of the Biotic
Baking Brigade, called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Officers rushed to the scene of a Buddhist event at the Palace
of Fine Arts, which shares the site with the Exploratorium, looking
for a VIP who might be a likely target. When one cop stopped next
door, saw the Pi Day signs and 1,600 slices ready to be served, the
mystery was solved and the case closed.

   &UR; WRITERS' DAUGHTER KVETCHES IN PUBLIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An essay by 20-year-old  &UR; Molly Jong-Fast &LR;  in the latest issue of
Marie Claire is in the  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  mode:
</P>
<P>
   She was a chubby kid; there was pressure to conform; in
desperation, she tried all kinds of things (in Jong-Fast's case,
beauty treatments, not romances) to overcome her low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Jong-Fast describes the ``large lonely purple townhouse'' in
which she grew up, her mother dragging her early on for weekly
manicures; getting drugs, at 13, from a diet doctor to cure ``not
only parental disapproval but also social isolation''; finally
becoming ``thin enough to be seen in public with my Jewish,
quasi-socialite family.''
</P>
<P>
   Such self-loathing, she writes, was inherited from her
self-loathing mother. ``In my house,'' she writes, `` `food' was a
four-letter word, cookies were guarded by a padlock, devil's food
cake really was. Gluttony became my rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jong-Fast is, like most 20-year-olds, eager to blame
everything on her parents, she's at least polite enough not to name
them. Her mother, it doesn't say anywhere in the essay, is feminist
novelist  &UR; Erica Jong &LR; . Her father is writer  &UR; Jonathan &LR; 
 &UR; Fast &LR; .

   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore began laying a
platform Monday for his all-but-announced presidential candidacy,
appealing to both harried suburbanites and more traditional
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered a continuation of President Clinton's policies,
with only minor tinkering. He said, for example, that he wanted to
hire enough teachers to reduce the size of classes in all grades
through high school, not just through eighth grade as Clinton has
proposed. And he wants to make preschool education available in all
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he did little to separate himself from his political
benefactor as he took one more step in his long slow march toward a
presidential candidacy by taking his first official campaign trip,
paid for by his election committee. He is not expected to announce
his candidacy officially until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build on the wisdom that we've all gained in the
last several years,'' he said at a rally in snow-bound New
Hampshire before flying here, paying homage to the two states that
vote the earliest in the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore put special emphasis on what he calls ``quality-of-life''
issues _ easing traffic congestion, for example _ that some have
ridiculed as unpresidential because they are local issues, but that
Gore defends as integral to strengthening families by creating more
free time. They are also aimed squarely at an important block of
swing voters, especially frazzled parents, who live in the suburbs
and could decide the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who deserves to be our next president is the one
who understands how tired working parents are,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the daily commutes get longer and longer,'' he
said. ``And for people who don't think that it's a problem that
parents are caught in traffic jams that are lengthening each day,
I'll tell you, they haven't been in traffic jams and they don't
know what it does to the desire to balance work and family.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Gore's identification with the Clinton
administration, particularly the nation's economic prosperity, he
seemed quite ambiguous about how strongly to associate himself with
it. He did not mention Clinton by name, and he seemed to want to
create distance by describing not a policy divide but an epochal
divide _ a natural break in the calendar in the year 2000 that
would leave Clinton in the past and put Gore in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the beginning of a new century and a new
millennium,'' Gore said. ``It's the beginning of a whole new era in
human history.'' And that, he added, posed a new set of challenges
with ``new approaches for the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent years building up an extensive financial,
political and policy network across the country, and that in-place
apparatus has gone a long way toward clearing the field of primary
challengers. He was accompanied Monday by Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House Democratic leader, who formally endorsed him in
what the two billed as a strong sign of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, is the only
Democrat who has entered the race, and the polls strongly favor
Gore for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But the polls are less encouraging for Gore in hypothetical
match-ups against various Republicans, suggesting serious
vulnerabilities in the Gore candidacy. The latest NBC/Wall Street
Journal poll showed him 18 points behind Texas Gov. George Bush and
15 points behind Elizabeth Dole, the two leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And Judith Hope, the Democratic chairman in New York, last week
openly questioned whether Gore would be the party's best nominee,
noting that Democratic vice presidents who have sought the
presidency have tended to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's media consultant, Bob Squier, said that Gore was flagging
in the polls because he was still being perceived as vice
president. ``He is not thought of in presidential terms,'' Squier
said, suggesting that campaign forays like Monday's, which drew the
biggest press contingent of Gore's tenure a vice president, would
start to change that perception.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sidestepped questions about whether he was too closely
linked with the impeached president. He said the campaign would be
about ideas, not polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore aides admit that he is using a series of narrowly
focused, poll-tested initiatives reminiscent of some of Clinton's
micro-proposals in 1996 to appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton off in Central America last week, the vice
president used the empty stage of the White House almost every day
to discuss topics ranging from traffic jams and drug labels to lost
bags at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Aides even imitated the Clinton strategy of targeting their
announcements to certain media venues to insure maximum _ and
sympathetic _ exposure. For example, at last week's announcement on
ways to ease traffic congestion, they invited traffic reporters,
those who ride the choppers and describe road conditions. This
guaranteed the vice president media coverage in local markets
across the country and on drive-time radio, much as Clinton in 1997
insured heavy attention to his conference on global warming by
inviting more than 100 local weather forecasters to cover it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans have poked fun at Gore for directing a presidential
campaign to such seemingly small issues as lost bags at airports
and such seemingly local issues as traffic congestion. Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been
particularly scathing, accusing Gore of trying to ``do away with
the internal combustion engine, the automobile,'' and calling him
``an apologist for the president; he's a wasteful dreamer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even an airline passenger, Jim Corsetty, of Rockville, Md.,
whose plane was stranded on a runway and who found himself on stage
with the vice president last week, expressed his astonishment that
he had become an anecdote in the presidential campaign. He
introduced the vice president as ``my own personal consumer
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans think Gore might be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who is working for the
presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said that even
if Gore was talking about ``microscopic'' issues and sounded as if
he were running for town manager rather than president, he was
still controlling the policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's working,'' McInturff said with some exasperation.
``You're writing a story about Gore talking about lots of popular
issues. But have we really so dumbed down the office that he can be
talking about traffic?''

   A Wisconsin brick cheese described as ``sturdy'' and made under
the Country Cheese brand by the Klondike Cheese Co. of Monroe,
Wis., has been chosen winner of the U.S. Championship Cheese
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milfred Severson &LR; , head cheesemaker at Klondike Cheese, said
he'd been working to win the contest for 30 years. ``I can't

cheddar made in Cabot, Vt.

appropriately enough, Old Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The groundbreaking, which took place Friday, ``featured a
27-foot model gondola with three tiara-topped beauty queens aboard
towed by a pickup through the dry canal channel. A dust devil
briefly struck the speaking platform, popping balloons and sending
others skyward, and a confetti-bearing plane made three unfruitful
circles over the crowd before flying away.''

Exploratorium.'' The message, however, was left on a wrong number;
its recipient, thinking the caller was a member of the Biotic
Baking Brigade, called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Officers rushed to the scene of a Buddhist event at the Palace
of Fine Arts, which shares the site with the Exploratorium, looking
for a VIP who might be a likely target. When one cop stopped next
door, saw the Pi Day signs and 1,600 slices ready to be served, the
mystery was solved and the case closed.

   &UR; WRITERS' DAUGHTER KVETCHES IN PUBLIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An essay by 20-year-old  &UR; Molly Jong-Fast &LR;  in the latest issue of
Marie Claire is in the  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  mode:
</P>
<P>
   She was a chubby kid; there was pressure to conform; in
desperation, she tried all kinds of things (in Jong-Fast's case,
beauty treatments, not romances) to overcome her low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Jong-Fast describes the ``large lonely purple townhouse'' in
which she grew up, her mother dragging her early on for weekly
manicures; getting drugs, at 13, from a diet doctor to cure ``not
only parental disapproval but also social isolation''; finally
becoming ``thin enough to be seen in public with my Jewish,
quasi-socialite family.''
</P>
<P>
   Such self-loathing, she writes, was inherited from her
self-loathing mother. ``In my house,'' she writes, `` `food' was a
four-letter word, cookies were guarded by a padlock, devil's food
cake really was. Gluttony became my rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jong-Fast is, like most 20-year-olds, eager to blame
everything on her parents, she's at least polite enough not to name
them. Her mother, it doesn't say anywhere in the essay, is feminist
novelist  &UR; Erica Jong &LR; . Her father is writer  &UR; Jonathan &LR; 
 &UR; Fast &LR; .

 &HT;    NCAA Tournament: The year of the party crashers
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinderella isn't making just a token appearance at this week's
NCAA
</P>
<P>
   Sweet 16. She has kicked the door in and taken over the place.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the tournament field was expanded to 64
teams in 1985, five double-digit seeds _ No. 10 seeds or lower _
have advanced to the regional semifinals. Never before had more
than three gone so far.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Gonzaga, the 10th seed in the West Regional, had the
tournament's Cinderella crown all to itself on Saturday when it
knocked off second-seeded Stanford 82-74. But on Sunday, two No. 2
seeds (Utah, Miami of Florida), and a No. 4 (Tennesee)
</P>
<P>
   were beaten to fill this week's dance card with some new faces.
</P>
<P>
   What we are left with this week are three No. 10s (Gonzaga,
Miami of Ohio, Purdue), a No. 12 (Southwest Missouri State), and a
No. 13 (Oklahoma). It was one of the bracket-busting weekends of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri coach Steve Alford, whose team destroyed
fourth-seeded Tennessee 81-51 on Sunday in the East Regional and is
in the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history, spoke for
Cinderellas everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the fun things about this tournament,'' Alford
said. ``I don't believe a lot of brackets out there had us in the
Sweet 16. Suddenly, people out there are scrambing to find out who
we are and wondering if we're really any good. We like that.''
</P>
<P>
   History, however, says that the clock will strike midnight soon
for the Cinderellas. Since 1985, 25 double-digit seeds have
advanced to the Sweet 16 but only four have won their next game in
the regional semifinals. Of those four, only one (LSU, 1986) won a
regional championship and advanced to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, each of these surprising teams has a story to
tell about how it beat the odds:
</P>
<P>
   _ GONZAGA (27-6): Until last weekend, the Spokane, Wash., school
was best known as the alma mater of John Stockton, point guard of
the Utah Jazz, and the late Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   When the Zags beat Minnesota in the first round, the media wrote
it off to the absence of four Gopher players suspended on charges
of academic fraud. When they outrebounded Stanford 47-33 and won on
Saturday, the whole country took another look.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga had played exactly one NCAA Tournament game in its
history until
</P>
<P>
   Thurday, but coach Don Monson says his team is no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids believed we were going to win that game (against
Stanford),''
</P>
<P>
   said Monson, in his 11th season at the school. ``We haven't gone
into a game this season
</P>
<P>
   where our kids didn't think they were going to win. And that's a
hard mentality to get in
</P>
<P>
   when it says Gonzaga on your jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Quentin Hall, born in the Bahamas, is the man who
makes the
</P>
<P>
   Zags zig. He'll have to do it again on Thursday against the
Flordia Gators.
</P>
<P>
   _ OKLAHOMA (22-10): With a No. 13, the Sooners were the
highest-seeded
</P>
<P>
   at-large team in the field, which means they were the 64th and
final team to
</P>
<P>
   make the tournament. Now, OU is in the Sweet 16 after beating
fourth-seeded Arizona and
</P>
<P>
   fifth-seeded UNC Charlotte. Oklahoma is just the third No. 13
seed to advance
</P>
<P>
   from the first weekend of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kelvin Sampson thought his team should have gotten a lower
seed
</P>
<P>
   after finishing second in the Big 12 and posting road wins at
Oklahoma State,
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Texas, all of which got lower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? Sweet 16 gives our program that credit,''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said. ``It's validation. It gives you credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners, who have a group of hot three-point shooters led by
Eric
</P>
<P>
   Martin, are in the round of 16 for the first time since 1989 and
will meet top-seeded
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State on Friday in the Midwest Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   _ SW MISSOURI ST. (22-10): The Bears never have been to the
Sweet 16 but advanced thanks to a withering defense that held No. 5
Wisconsin and No. 4 Tennessee to a combined 30 of 108 shooting
(27.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   SMS has a pair of solid guards in William Fontleroy and Kevin
Ault and a vastly under-rated post player in Danny Moore, who had
37 points and 21 rebounds in two games. The Bears also have a good
forward in Ken Stringer, a native of Lithonia.
</P>
<P>
   For its efforts, Southwest Missouri State gets to play No. 1
Duke Friday night in
</P>
<P>
   East Rutherford, N.J. Duke has won its last 11 games by an
average of 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Alford is realistic. ``We'll prepare, show up and play hard,''
said Alford, who might be headed
</P>
<P>
   to Iowa after that game. ``People certainly never thought we'd
get this far.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MIAMI OF OHIO (24-7): As one scribe said, it's Wally's World
and we're just living in it.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Wally Szczerbiak, who had 43 points in the
first-round upset
</P>
<P>
   of Washington and 24 on Sunday when the Red Hawks knocked off
second-seeded Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in my game and our team's playing our game, then
we're a team to
</P>
<P>
   contend with,'' the 6-8 forward said.
</P>
<P>
   After losing in the MAC Tournament, the Redhawks weren't
positive that they were going to get a bid. When they got a No. 10
seed, many poeple figured that Wally and the boys
</P>
<P>
   wouldn't be hanging around too long.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miami, in its first Sweet 16, takes on Kentucky, the
defending national champion,
</P>
<P>
   Friday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   _ PURDUE (21-12): After losing five of its last six games going
into the tournament, the Boilermakers were one of the least likely
teams to make the Sweet 16. But
</P>
<P>
   Gene Keady and company, known for so many early exits as a low
seed, turned the
</P>
<P>
   tables, knocking off seventh-seeded Texas in overtime and
second-seeded Miami of
</P>
<P>
   Florida by 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't even think we belonged in this
tournament,'' said
</P>
<P>
   forward Brian Cardinal, who had 20 points against Miami. ``It's
kind of fun to shock people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers, who finished 7-9 in the Big Ten, will play
sixth-seeded
</P>
<P>
   Temple in East Rutherford, N.J., on Friday.

AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE CHIEF TO LEAVE FOR THERMO ELECTRON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Syron, who spent four years buffing up the
image of the often-beleaguered American Stock Exchange before
executing a surprising merger with the rival Nasdaq Stock Market
last year, will leave the exchange on June 1 to become chief
executive of Thermo Electron Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A conglomerate with subsidiaries in the instrumentation systems,
medical equipment and industrial machinery industries, Thermo
Electron has been one of the largest sources of new listings for
the American exchange in recent years, with 23 publicly traded
subsidiaries now traded on it.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, who has served on the board of Thermo Electron since
September 1997, will replace the company's 72-year-old founder,
George Hatsopoulos, who will remain as a non-executive chairman.
Hatsopoulos guided the company's unusual strategy of forming dozens
of subsidiaries around new technologies and then offering minority
stakes in the new companies to the public.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy, combined with growth that was often fueled by
acquisitions, led to big gains for Thermo Electron shareholders in
the first half of the 1990s, when the company's share price
quadrupled, to more than $44. But over the last three years, the
company has struggled, particularly since the Asian financial
crisis has slowed many of the cyclical industries, like paper and
pulp, where the company operates.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in addition to announcing Syron's appointment, Thermo
Electron said that a continued slowdown in its biomedical products
business would cause earnings in the first quarter to fall below
expectations. Thermo Electron shares, which are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, fell 18.75 cents, to $14.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Thermo Electron's board, Syron, 55, is already
familiar with the company and its unwieldy array of subsidiaries.
In fact, Syron said in an interview that the company's strategy has
created such a complex corporate structure that one of his first
jobs will be to decide which subsidiaries should be reincorporated
into the parent and which should be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The new position will represent a significant departure for
Syron, who has spent most of his career as a regulator, first
within the Federal Reserve System and then on Wall Street at the
American exchange.
</P>
<P>
   From those comparatively staid, tradition-bound institutions,
Syron will move to a company with an embedded entrepreneurial
culture, where for the first time he will answer to public
shareholders who, in effect, vote on the company's stock price
every day.
</P>
<P>
   His departure also marks the end of a sometimes rocky
relationship with members of the American Stock Exchange.
Seventy-five percent of the American exchange's members voted in
favor of the merger last June, but many of those were won over to
favoring the merger only in the final days of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Liang, a managing member of PBL Partners, a Chicago
investment firm, who initially opposed the merger, said he came to
have a good working relationship with Syron. ``He is a very
progressive thinker,'' Liang said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said that if Syron had done more to promote the
exchange's growth, perhaps the institution could have remained
independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the exchange in the position where the Nasdaq merger
was the best of the alternatives it had at that time,'' said Lewis
Lowenfels, a former member of the board of governors of the
American exchange, and a prominent New York securities lawyer who
represented the floor brokers in the Nasdaq-American Stock Exchange
merger. ``Perhaps he didn't build up the number of listed companies
to the extent that he could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Syron came to the American Stock Exchange in 1994 from the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where he served as president and
chief executive beginning in 1989. For the three previous years, he
was president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he arrived, the American exchange was beset with problems
that went far beyond a poor image. The exchange was unable to
attract the most desirable technology companies, which favored the
Nasdaq market, and often lost listings of growing companies to the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first moves was to shut down the Amex's Emerging
Company Market, a small-cap market that was originated by Syron's
predecessor, James Jones, a former congressman who left the
exchange to become ambassador to Mexico. Soon after the new market
began operations, the exchange was embarrassed to find among its
listings a company whose largest shareholder had previously been
barred by the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Syron said he recognized that some exchange members did not
favor the merger with Nasdaq, or wanted him to recruit more company
listings. But he points out that during his tenure the exchange has
listed several highly successful unit trusts, each a sort of
publicly traded index fund that tracks a popular market index.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the exchange has lost several high-profile listings,
most recently Viacom Inc., which will begin trading on the Big
Board next month. But Syron points out that since he took over, the
value of seats on the American exchange has grown markedly, to a
record $660,000 last month from about $100,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron shareholders are likely to expect similar
results from Syron after seeing the value of their shares fall by
63 percent in the last year. Syron said he will initially put his
emphasis on continuing a restructuring that began last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues and challenges for Thermo Electron are not in its
product markets,'' Syron said. ``The company has become, perhaps
inevitably, quite complex, and that complexity is in danger of
deflecting the focus of the company's managers away from what they
need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There are benefits to the company's structure, Syron said,
including giving the smaller subsidiaries access to the corporate
infrastructure of the parent and allowing them to borrow money at
lower rates than they would otherwise be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the complexity has made it difficult for many investors
and many institutions to understand the company,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The company will still consider potential acquisitions, he said,
but the more immediate focus will be either to bring companies that
are not sufficiently large to stand on their own back into the
parent's fold, or to sell those that do not fit with its long-term
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Further details about Syron's plans will be revealed on May 27
at the company's annual meeting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Syron said he did not see any conflict in holding a seat on
Thermo Electron's board and, at the same time, overseeing the
exchange where its subsidiaries listed their shares. He noted that
he is not a member of the boards of any of the subsidiaries, and he
said he recused himself from any listing decisions. In addition, he
said, no exceptions to listing requirements were made for
Thermo-related companies while he was at the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Syron is not the only stock exchange chairman to serve on a
corporate board. Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange, has served on the board of Computer Associates
International since 1994.

NISSAN SHARES, AND HOPES, RISE SHARPLY ON TALK OF RENAULT DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Shares of the ailing Nissan Motor Co. rose 13 percent in
heavy trading Monday as investors increased their bets that Renault
SA would seek to preserve its future in the rapidly consolidating
global auto industry by taking a stake in Japan's second-largest
car maker.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan said in a statement that it had received no formal offer
from Renault and could not comment on any discussions. But Kaoru
Yosano, the minister of international trade and industry, said
Nissan had become more confident that it would complete a deal.
Yosano said he believed that the two companies were close to
reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the ministry were similarly confident just two
weeks ago that Nissan would sell a stake to DaimlerChrysler AG.
Those negotiations broke off abruptly last week, apparently over
issues of management control and DaimlerChrysler's concerns about
its integration of the former Daimler Benz and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, would say only that a
whirlwind 32-hour trip to Paris and back over the weekend to hold a
meeting with Renault's head, Louis Schweitzer, was very amicable.
Twenty-five of those hours were spent in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers would normally construe the trip's brevity as a sign of
rebuff, but Hanawa's trip was interpreted on Monday as an effort to
demonstrate good faith and personally negotiate the final issues
relating to a potential deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nissan shares rose 53 yen, to 454
yen, or $3.85, in trading of 21.3 million shares, about five times
the average. Renault shares fell 0.43 euro, or 1.2 percent, to
35.40 euros, or $38.59, on the Paris Bourse.
</P>
<P>
   Renault's board is to meet on Tuesday to discuss the offer. The
French government owns 44 percent of Renault's shares, and it has
already expressed enthusiasm for an investment in Nissan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without French government support, Renault might face difficulty
raising enough money to purchase a big enough stake to have board
representation and limited veto power. The company has $2.1 billion
in cash at its disposal, but a 33.4 percent stake would cost it 500
billion yen, or about $4.3 billion at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a stretch for them, yes,'' said Steven Usher, an
auto analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ``But if they
get the backing of the French government, which implies they will
have the full faith and credit of the French government behind
them, it won't be a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the deal makes sense for Renault. An alliance with
Nissan would offer opportunities for sharing car designs and
utilizing surplus capacity in Nissan's factories in Japan and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It would also greatly expand Renault's global reach. Usher said
the company currently gets 84 percent of its revenues from Europe,
where it will face increased competition at the end of the year
because of deregulation. Only 4 percent of its revenues come from
Asia, and although the bulk of Nissan's Asian sales come from
Japan, its factories here would give Renault a springboard to the
rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's board was to discuss the terms Hanawa brought back with
him at a meeting on Monday. The most contentious issue was likely
the question of how much control Nissan was willing to cede to its
French suitor; many of Nissan's board members are worried about
signing away the company's autonomy, according to former
executives.

A MEXICAN DRUG CASE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Early last year, as undercover U.S. Customs agents
neared the end of the biggest investigation ever conducted into the
illegal movement of drug money, bankers working with Mexico's most
powerful cocaine cartel approached them with a stunning offer.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, posing as money launderers from Colombia, had
insinuated themselves deeply into the Mexican underworld, helping
the traffickers hide more than $60 million. Now, money men working
with the cartel said they had clients who needed to launder $1.15
billion more. The most important of those clients, they said, was
Mexico's powerful defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   The customs agents didn't know whether the money really existed
or if any of it belonged to the minister, Gen. Enrique Cervantes,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than continue the undercover operation to pursue the
deal, Clinton administration officials ordered it to end on
schedule several weeks later. No further effort was ever made to
investigate the offer, and officials said prosecutors had not even
raised the matter with the suspects in the case, who have pleaded
guilty and are cooperating with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we sitting on this kind of information?'' asked the
former senior customs agent who led the undercover inquiry, William
F. Gately. ``It's either because we're lazy, we're stupid, or the
political will doesn't exist to engage in the kind of investigation
where our law-enforcement efforts might damage our foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials denied that foreign policy
influenced their decision to end the operation, saying they were
moved primarily by concerns for its security. They also emphasized
that the agents were unable to verify the Mexican traffickers'
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials of the administration, which has based much of
its Mexican drug strategy on collaboration with Cervantes, said
they were confident that he was above reproach. A spokesman for the
Mexican Defense Ministry, Lt. Col. Francisco Aguilar Hernandez,
dismissed the traffickers' proposal as self-serving lies.
</P>
<P>
   But a detailed account of the case, based on confidential
government documents, court records and dozens of interviews,
suggests that U.S. officials walked away from an extraordinary
opportunity to examine accusations of the official corruption that
is considered the main obstacle to anti-drug efforts in Mexico.
 &UR;  &LR;  ``Obviously it was a significant allegation,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said &UR; .  &LR; ``There was skepticism about
it. Was it puffing? It just was not seen as being _ I won't use the
word credible _ but it wasn't verified.''

COMMENTARY: THE DOOMSDAY A-LIST
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ I don't know about you, but I slept particularly well
last Friday night, knowing that Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic had just joined NATO. What? You say you were too disturbed
by the reports of the Clinton team's lackadaisical response to
potential Chinese pilfering of U.S. nuclear secrets to sleep well?
You say you had insomnia over the fact that our nuclear arms
control regime with Russia is crumbling?
</P>
<P>
   Well, to you I say, ``Don't worry, be happy.'' I read in my own
newspaper that the Clintonites are planning to bring Slovenia into
NATO next, and if that doesn't make you sleep better, I can't help
you. You must be one of those nuts who still think that the most
important strategic issue facing the United States is all the
nuclear weapons pointed at us from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you are one of those nuts, you are going to have to
look outside the administration for therapy. While everyone is
yapping about whether China stole some nuclear secrets, the fact is
China has 24 long-range warheads capable, at best, of hitting
California. Folks, Russia still has 7,000 such warheads, and Russia
is falling apart. And because the Clinton administration made NATO
expansion its priority, rather than getting the Start 2 nuclear
missile reduction treaty with Russia implemented _ which would
eliminate 3,000 long-range Russian nuclear weapons _ the whole arms
control agenda is now drifting aimlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Fact: The Clintonites, and Congress, including the Republicans,
have been grossly negligent in dealing with America's nuclear arms
reduction agenda, particularly with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But don't listen to me. Read the most important book by any
ex-Clinton official, which also came out last week but was totally
overlooked. The book is by former Defense Secretary William Perry
and his top arms control aide, Ashton Carter, and is called
``Preventive Defense.'' Perry and Carter reveal that when they were
running the Pentagon they argued to Clinton that NATO expansion
``should be deferred until later in the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry details how he insisted at a top-level meeting with the
president, on Dec. 21, 1994, that ``early expansion was a
mistake,'' because it would provoke ``distrust'' in Russia and
undermine cooperation on arms control and other issues, and because
``prematurely adding untried militaries'' at a time when NATO
itself was reassessing its role would not be helpful. Perry was
overruled, in my view because of the Clintonites' zeal for Polish
votes.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a book about the future. The authors argue that
there are three sorts of security problems America now faces: There
is the ``C-list'' _ Kosovo, Haiti and Bosnia. They dominate the
headlines, require diplomatic energy to solve, carry regional
importance, but in no way threaten our vital interests. Then there
are the ``B-list'' issues. These are major theaters of war _ Iraq
and the Korean Peninsula _ where we have major interests and
resources at stake, but where there is still no immediate, Cold
War-like threat to America's way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the ``A-list.'' These are the strategic
nuclear threats that can destroy our way of life. For the past 10
years, the immediacy of these threats has been overshadowed by the
B- and C-lists. But the A-list threats must be reasserted as a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   We not only need to get the Start 2 treaty implemented and a
Start 3 negotiated _ at a time when the Russians are ready for
radical reductions in nukes _ but, says Carter, we have to start
thinking creatively about reducing Russia's 30,000 potentially
loose nukes, that is, all its short-range nuclear warheads and
fissile cores, which could easily fall off the back of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``An arms control or elimination program that would address
short-range weapons would require a level of transparency and
cooperation that we could not get in the Cold War but might be able
to get to now _ that is what we mean by preventive defense,''
Carter told me.
</P>
<P>
   Perry made Russian denuclearization his top priority when he was
defense secretary, but since he left that focus has been lost in
both the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that our successors believe in the things we were
trying to do and support them,'' Perry said to me. ``But believing
and supporting them are not the same as getting them done.''

IN WAKE OF SPY CASE, 2 SENATORS DEMAND LIMITS ON CHINA TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(wg) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Influential senators demanded Monday that the
Clinton administration limit its trade policies with China and
suspend some scientific exchange programs, reflecting Congressional
anger over President Clinton's response to suspicions that China
stole nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said they
would move to block any effort by the White House to help China
become a member of the World Trade Organization this year,
threatening the administration's leading diplomatic effort to
improve fast-deteriorating relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, urged the president or Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to put a moratorium on visits by
scientists from countries like China and Iran to American national
weapons laboratories, and on reciprocal visits by American
scientists to foreign installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our labs are not as secure as they should be,'' Shelby told
reporters after an hourlong, closed meeting with CIA Director
George Tenet. ``This perhaps is just the tip of an iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department last week dismissed a Taiwan-born
scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory for security breaches,
after the FBI questioned him in connection with the suspected theft
of nuclear weapons designs. Investigators say they believe the
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, gave the Chinese sensitive information on
nuclear detonations during a visit there for a 1988 seminar. Lee
has not been charged with any crime, but is the prime suspect in
the case. China denies any theft and has called the allegations of
nuclear espionage outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House and Senate have criticized the
administration for not tightening security quickly enough and
failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the seriousness
of the possible breaches at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Monday night the administration would work with Congress to resolve
the WTO issue, but the official rejected Shelby's proposal.
``There's no evidence the visitors program has contributed to any
damage to national security,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The double-barreled attack from Capitol Hill came as Richardson
and Tenet, in separate closed briefings, tried to contain the
political fallout from the administration's handling of the spy
case by explaining steps the administration has taken to prevent
any more thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet announced that a retired four-star admiral, David
Jeremiah, will head an independent panel of experts to review the
possible harm to national security that resulted from suspected
thefts that took place in the 1980s and that were discovered by
nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos in 1995. Admiral Jeremiah is
expected to report by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the administration stepped up its defense of its
response to the spy case, the White House took a blow on its trade
policy with China. The warning from Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, and Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Commerce Committee, was issued in a letter sent to all senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations,
espionage and possible technology transfers,'' they wrote,
``suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter
the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, in Beijing, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright assured China's leaders that the question of whether China
was ready to enter the WTO _ a decade-long aspiration for China and
a move that could prove enormously beneficial to the country's
economy _ would be decided solely on commercial grounds. It would
not hinge, she said, on China's human rights record or other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that even
if that is the administration's plan, the atmosphere in Congress is
rapidly changing. And congressional approval will be necessary,
because China's entry would require a major amendment of the law
that allows Congress to review, each year, whether to extend ``most
favored nation'' trading status to Beijing.

RHODE ISLAND'S CHAFEE TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John H. Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican who over
four terms in office became a champion of moderate conservatism,
announced Monday he will not run for reelection in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, 76, a descendant of one of Rhode Island's founding
families, said the decision was based neither on fear of losing nor
frustration with the conservative wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chafee said simply: ``I want to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen senators hang around too long,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``There are not enough Michael Jordans,
leaving at the peak of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the heels of similar retirement
announcements by four other powerful senators, prompting new
speculation about whether the balance of power in the Senate might
shift in the next election. It also renewed questions about whether
another member of the Kennedy clan, Representative Patrick Kennedy,
Democrat of Rhode Island, might run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision left a gaping hole in the so-called New England
``mod squad,'' the group of four moderate Republicans who often
share opinions, and who, at Chafee's urging, meet for lunch in
Washington every Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant effect, in the eyes of officials in
both parties, was the loss of a powerful personality who for
decades stood as a symbol of New England independent-mindedness,
repeatedly _ and stubbornly _ bucking his own party to defend his
position on issues such as health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the announcement, President Bill Clinton phoned
Chafee in his Rhode Island office to praise his service in the
Senate, saying he was a ``darned good poker player'' for keeping
the decision secret for several weeks. Prodding Chafee to keep up
his good work during the remainder of his term, Clinton spoke to
the senator as an ally, saying he was ``interested in getting
things done with people who want to get things done,'' according to
a Chafee aide.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, the junior senator from Rhode Island and a
Democrat, described the affable war veteran as a role model of
sorts, saying ``everyone in Rhode Island will measure their careers
against the standards that he set.'' And throughout New England,
other moderates lamented the departure of a senator who staunchly
defended centrism even when the GOP made it politically dangerous
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept saying to him, `Oh, John, don't do this to us,''' said
Senator Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine. ``I just
wanted to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about a successor immediately swept Rhode Island and
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had earlier toyed with the idea of running for Senate,
then pledged to remain in the House, where he was recently
appointed by Minority Leader Richard Gephardt as chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee _ a powerful position
that controls the party's congressional bids.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, many Democrats wondered aloud whether Kennedy would run
anyway. Representative Joseph Moakley, dean of the Massachusetts
congressional delegation, said he would be in favor of a Kennedy
run but said voters ``would probably see another broken promise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, 31, who has shot up through the leadership ranks
since his arrival in 1994, renewed his promise to stay put. Any
hints of laying political groundwork _ such as Kennedy's brutal
attacks on Chafee for his role during the president's impeachment
trial _ should be taken at face value, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the precipice of the House going back Democratic and
my mentor and friend, Dick Gephardt, being speaker, I think it's a
very big deal for me,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is the Senate, but it's got one Senator Kennedy
there already,'' he said, referring to his father, Senator Edward
M. Kennedy. ``The only Kennedy on the ballot in 2000 is going to be
my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, attention turned to a wide range of candidates from
both the Democratic and Republican parties. Among the potential
candidates was another political son: Lincoln Chafee, son of the
senator, who is the Republican mayor of Warwick, just outside
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Chafee deflected attention away from a possible bid
Monday, saying of his father, ``Today is his day.'' But an aide
hinted his campaign was likely, even as a host of other politicians
threw their hats into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Robert Weygand, the state's junior Democratic
congressman, was widely viewed as a contender. So, too, were
Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci, an Independent; Richard Licht, a
former lieutenant governor and a Democrat; William Lynch, chair of
the state's Democratic Party; former lieutenant governor Bernard
Jackvony, a Republican; and Rhode Island Secretary of State James
Langevin, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, strategists at the national level wondered
what impact Chafee's retirement would have on the Senate, where
Republicans are in the majority, 55 to 45. Three Democrats _
Senators Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Frank R. Lautenberg of New
Jersey, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York _ have said they
will not run again. One Republican, Senator Connie Mack of Florida,
has made similar plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears there's going to be a lot of change in the Senate
next time,'' said Senator Susan M. Collins, another moderate
Republican from Maine. ``Certainly, Senator Chafee's retirement
puts Rhode Island in the toss-up category.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, a Marine veteran of World War II and the Korean War,
came to elected office in 1956, as a legislator in the Rhode Island
Statehouse. He made his first astounding victory over a Democrat in
1962, beating an incumbent to become governor. After facing defeat
in 1968, he served as Secretary of the Navy to President Nixon. In
1976, after a failed Senate bid against Democrat Claiborne Pell,
Chafee was elected to the Senate _ the first Republican to do so in
six decades.
</P>
<P>
   He now sits as head of the Environmental and Public Works
Committee, in a powerful slot that handles conservation and
environmental issues. On the environment, he has sided with
Democrats more than once: In 1987, he supported a water projects
act opposed by President Reagan, and in 1990, he helped push the
Clean Water Act through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been a prominent voice on health care, chairing a
Republican task force on the issue in 1990 and later, in the early
1990s, working on proposals that, although never adopted, were at
the time deemed potentially bipartisan deals.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Chafee has been a true conservative, supporting
Republican initiatives such as NAFTA. Collins described this
independent quality as his ``substantial contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a well-respected voice of reason on so many
issues,'' said Collins, who considers Chafee a mentor and friend.
``It's a loss for the Senate, and the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said: ``I'm saddened to leave them, too.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly 12 years, former Army Maj. Jeff Cleghorn
felt like a hunted man.
</P>
<P>
   Every bookstore he entered, every dinner with friends, every
time he looked at another man, Cleghorn, a Griffin native, feared
his fellow servicemen would detect the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And if they found out that he was gay, Cleghorn feared he would
be thrown out of the Army, an institution that had given him a
college education at North Georgia College and a passport to places
like Munich, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day of my life I was concerned about being found out,''
Cleghorn said. ``You are forced to submit to a pattern of deceit,
which runs against every core value taught in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn's experience is not uncommon. In fact, a new report
released Monday from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network
asserts that discrimination against gays in the military is far too
common and on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after President Clinton adopted its ``don't ask,
don't tell, don't pursue'' policy, the group has found that
homosexual men and women are ferreted out, harassed and discharged
from the military against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, reports of anti-gay harassment more than
doubled. Reports of military commanders asking and pursuing
suspected homosexuals increased by 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department reported 1,145 gay discharges from all
service branches in 1998, up from 997 in 1997. In 1994, the year
the last year, the Pentagon reported in January. In 1997, the total
was 997, the highest number since 1987. The number hit a low of 617
in 1994, the year the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy took effect,
there were 617 such discharges.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Fort Benning has one of the highest discharge rates
for homosexuality, scoring sixth among the nation's 44 major Army
bases, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
   And that has Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.), a member of the
House Armed Services Committee, concerned that Fort Benning is
mistreating homosexuals and thumbing its nose at the president's
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be allowing persecution at Fort Benning,'' McKinney
said. ``That's quite disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney plans to write a letter to Clinton urging him to
reconsider his policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any report of failure of a policy that was implemented to make
life easier for gays and lesbians is disappointing,'' McKinney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Army Lt. Col. Tom Begines said the Defense Department conducted
an extensive review of the policy last year and found that the
president's wishes were being applied and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our policy that harassment of individuals will not be
tolerated,'' Begines said. ``If a service member is harassed or
threatened because of perceived sexual orientation, it is the
department's policy that commanders hold fully accountable those
persons who did the harassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's policy was adopted in 1994 after the killing of
a sailor in Japan. The policy allows gay men and lesbians to serve
in the armed services, but it prohibits them from declaring their
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Benning, Army spokesman Richard McDowell said he was
surprised at the base's ranking for discharging homosexuals. One
reason for the high number of discharges could be the high number
of trainees at the camp who don't make it through the rigors of
training. The president's policy is closely followed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard the charge that someone is being pursed,''
McDowell said. ``Our policy is the president's policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The denials carry little weight for Michelle Benecke and C.
Dixon Osburn, co-authors of the group's 230-page report documenting
cases of abuse and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbian, gay and bisexual service members are caught in a
deadly Catch-22,'' Osburn said. ``If they come out to try to dispel
the myths and stereotypes, they will be fired. Silence in the face
of anti-gay harassment only fuels the fires of hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do gay service members still endure physical attacks and
verbal comments such as ``You better not be gay, because in the
Navy we kill our fags?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of leadership,'' said Benecke, a former Army captain and
battery commander. ``Senior military leaders have been AWOL when it
comes to stopping anti-gay harassment.''

CANADIAN STOCK EXCHANGES TO REORGANIZE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bid to reduce costs and compete more effectively for
domestic and international trading business, leaders of the four
largest stock exchanges in Canada announced on Monday that they had
agreed to a sweeping reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, still subject to regulatory approval, calls for
the Toronto Stock Exchange to become the national center for
trading in the shares of major Canadian corporations, as the
Montreal Exchange transforms itself from a stock exchange into a
modern options and futures exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also called for the Vancouver Stock Exchange to merge
with the Alberta Stock Exchange in Calgary and the Canadian Dealer
Network, an electronic market for small stocks operated by the
Toronto exchange, to form a single pan-Canadian ``junior'' exchange
for smaller companies and start-up ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes will help ensure that the Canadian capital
market system is streamlined and better able to perform in an
increasingly competitive global marketplace,'' said Rowland
Fleming, the president of the Toronto exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said he expects the new plan to be fully in place by
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The rearrangements in Canada reflect the increasingly
competitive environment confronting many of the world's major stock
exchanges, as investors demand cheaper and more efficient trading
services.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the New York Stock Exchange and its rival, the
Nasdaq market, have both confirmed that they are exploring new
alliances with some of the private electronic stock-trading
services with which they compete. And in Europe, stock exchange
leaders are quietly exploring the formation of a pan-European
market that would capitalize on the new unified currency system
there.
</P>
<P>
   The realignment of trading roles between Toronto and Montreal
will cut costs for Canadian brokers and exchange-listed companies,
said Barbara Stymiest, the chairwoman of the Toronto exchange's
board of governors. Duplicative trading and listing fees will be
eliminated, she explained, and brokerage houses will be able to
focus their equities and derivatives operations in the appropriate
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is likely to win applause in the brokerage community,
said Fred Ketchen, managing director of equity trading at Scotia
McLeod Inc. ``Our competition is from the south, not from across
our own land,'' he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement allows Montreal to concentrate all its resources
on building its derivatives business, officials there said. ``The
Montreal Exchange is already the most successful futures
marketplace in Canada, and one of the fastest growing in the
world,'' said Gerald A. Lacoste, the exchange's president. ``By
specializing in the rapidly growing futures and options markets,
the Montreal Exchange is building on what we already do best.''
</P>
<P>
   When rumors of the reorganization broke in Monday's newspapers
across Canada, there was some speculation that the proposal would
be opposed by the Quebec provincial government, which was expected
to object to any shift of Montreal's equity trading business to
Toronto. But officials both in Toronto and Montreal said on Monday
that the Quebec finance ministry had been kept informed of the plan
and had raised no objections.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement will pose an immediate challenge to stock
market regulators in Canada, where there is no national market
regulator and each province has its own independent securities
commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the Toronto and Montreal exchanges would continue to be
policed by the regulators in their home provinces, the new market
for smaller stocks would straddle several provinces. Moreover, the
``junior stock'' arena, once dominated by the Vancouver Stock
Exchange, has historically been plagued with regulatory problems _
indeed, the Vancouver exchange has been chronically accused of lax
listing standards and weak enforcement of exchange rules.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear which province would inherit the primary
regulatory chores for the new junior market. Fleming in Toronto
said all the provincial regulators had been kept informed of the
exchanges' proposal and he expected the regulatory issues to be
resolved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Alberta stock exchange, which has claimed a greater share of
Vancouver's business in recent years, will play a strong role in
the new marketplace. The tiny Winnipeg Stock Exchange, left out of
the current talks, is expected to be invited into the new
``junior'' stock market as it develops, Toronto officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some market veterans predicted that the reorganization could
move Canada closer to the creation of a single national securities
regulator. But Fleming said he thought the outcome was more likely
to be closer collaboration among the provincial watchdogs.

   THREATENED-CHINOOK (Seattle) _ Few area residents will feel it
Tuesday, when the chinook salmon is declared a threatened species
in Puget Sound. But over the next five years, the region is
expected to get a lot more green. Trees will be planted along
denuded rivers where salmon currently get baked by the sun.
Streamside forests and wetlands will be preserved. The salmon
listing is going to force people to think more green, too, from the
way they build roads, sewers and homes to the way they regulate
logging, fishing and even lawn fertilizing. The goal: to restore
chinook salmon runs, down about one-third from their peak.

STUDIES AIMED AT ALZHEIMER'S LIKE MALADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Mild memory lapses without other thinking difficulties may
signal early Alzheimer's disease _ but they may not, according to
new studies that are focusing attention on an in-between disorder
called mild cognitive impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' ability to distinguish people with mild cognitive
impairment from those with early Alzheimer's disease led Monday to
the launching of two large studies to see if drugs or daily vitamin
E pills can keep the memory lapses from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly exciting that we're beginning to identify this
new class of people'' with mild cognitive impairment, said Marcelle
Morrison-Bogorad of the National Institute on Aging. ``We know a
lot about the late stages of Alzheimer's disease, with its
multitude of disastrous cognitive problems. Now we must try to go
earlier in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is sponsoring one of the first prevention
trials, and the other is under the aegis of Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp. A third company-sponsored study is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies unveiled Monday will monitor a total of 1,620
patients around the world for three years. They will compare the
effects of drugs used for Alzheimer's, high-dose vitamin E, and
placebo pills.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, scientists have no way to predict which
individuals with mild cognitive impairment will go on to develop
Alzheimer's. The new studies will try to determine if magnetic
resonance imaging scans will help identify those at risk.
</P>
<P>
   A new Mayo Clinic study of mild cognitive impairment, published
Monday, should help researchers and doctors distinguish patients
with mild cognitive disorder from those with mild Alzheimer's or
the normal effects of aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a clear method of evaluating people with
memory loss,'' said Dr. Ronald C. Peterson, a Mayo Clinic
neurologist who led the study. ``We can now differentiate people
who meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment from healthy
people and from those with mild Alzheimer's disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the Archives of Neurology, found that
patients with mild cognitive impairment have memory loss but no
difficulty with language, attention, or orientation in time or
space. The study involved 76 patients with mild cognitive
impairment, 234 healthy subjects, and 106 with mild Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that about 1 percent of healthy elders developed
Alzheimer's each year, compared to 12 percent of people with mild
cognitive impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison-Bogorad said the memory changes seen in individuals
with mild cognitive impairment are different from the common
experience of misplacing car keys or groping for a word. ``It's
more like beginning to forget things you normally don't, like
important appointments,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal study will recruit 720 men and women between the
ages of 55 and 90 in up to 80 centers in Canada and the United
States, including Boston. Some will take the approved Alzheimer's
drug donepezil, others will take 2,000 units of vitamin E daily,
and a third group will take a placebo, or dummy drug.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers may call 1-888-455-0655 or go the project's web site
at www.memorystudy.org, Morrison-Bogorad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Novartis study will compare an experimental Alzheimer's drug
called rivastigmine to a placebo. Volunteers may call
1-877-554-HOPE.

MEDICARE PANEL CHIEF STRUGGLES TO FIND SUPPORT FOR CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a bipartisan commission studying
the future of Medicare made a last-ditch effort on Monday night to
salvage his proposal for radical changes in the health insurance
program for the elderly. However, he said he did not know if he
could round up the necessary votes in time for the panel's final
meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the chairman, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said President
Clinton had given him no assistance in trying to get those votes.
Breaux needs support from at least one of the president's four
appointees on the 17-member commission, but Breaux said he has not
secured support from any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I wish the president had come out and endorsed this
proposition?'' Breaux asked. ``The answer is yes. Am I disappointed
if he doesn't? The answer is obviously yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Breaux's proposal, the government, instead of paying
separately for each medical service, would offer a fixed amount of
money to each beneficiary. The beneficiary could use the money to
buy private health insurance, through a managed care plan, or to
enroll in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was created by a 1997 law, plans to vote
Tuesday on its final recommendations to insure the long-term
solvency of Medicare. The program is expected to run short of money
just as the first of 76 million baby boomers turn 65, in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and liberal Democrats in Congress
predict that the commission will end its work with 10 members
supporting the Breaux plan and seven opposed. Under the law that
created it, the commission needs 11 votes for any recommendation to
be sent to the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   To win support from Democrats, including Clinton's appointees,
Breaux is proposing to offer Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs as a new benefit. The government would pay all the costs of
such drugs for people with incomes up to 35 percent above the
official poverty level (incomes up to $10,568 a year for an
individual and $13,334 for a couple).
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations and other private health plans
would have to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, but
they could charge extra. The original fee-for-service Medicare
program would also offer prescription drug coverage, through
arrangements with private insurers, but the government would not
subsidize the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In purchasing drugs for millions of Medicare beneficiaries,
Breaux said, the government would pay ``prices commonly available
in the market, without recourse to price controls.'' Drug companies
adamantly oppose price controls, saying they would choke off the
revenues needed to finance research and reward investors.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's appointees _ Stuart H. Altman, a professor of
health policy at Brandeis University, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
former chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers _
have praised some features of Breaux's proposal, including its
potential to save money by stimulating competition in the Medicare
market. But they have also insisted that Breaux clarify many
details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's appointees, Bruce C. Vladeck, the federal
official in charge of Medicare from 1993 to 1997, has led
opposition to Breaux's proposal, saying it would shred the
guarantee of health benefits for some of the sickest, most
vulnerable people in America.
</P>
<P>
   Rep.e Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who is co-chairman of the
commission, said he was disappointed that Clinton had stayed aloof
from the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Republicans, we have Democrats,'' Thomas said. ``We
have members of the House, we have members of the Senate. We have
members of the public, and we have members of the private sector
all in support of this plan. The only group that hasn't given us
one vote is the president's appointees.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials responded on Monday that while they had
often consulted with the president's appointees, the commission
members were free to vote as they chose on the proposals. And, the
officials said, the White House will not comment until Clinton
reviews the panel's final report.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Thomas said they would translate the Breaux plan into
legislation and try to push it through Congress this year,
regardless of whether it is formally endorsed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is supported by all 8 Republican members of the
commission and by 2 Democrats, Breaux and Sen. Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's plan would gradually raise the eligibility age for
Medicare, to 67 from 65, over 24 years, from 2003 to 2027. People
age 65 or 66 who could not obtain private insurance would be
allowed to purchase Medicare coverage under rules to be specified
in the future, Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would also extend provisions of the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 that curbed the growth of Medicare payments to doctors,
hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of the commission estimated that Breaux's plan would
not produce significant savings in the first five years, but would
save a total of $100 billion from 2005 to 2009. Then, it said, the
savings would gradually increase, so that in 2030, Medicare
spending would be $600 billion less than now anticipated: $1.6
trillion, rather than the $2.2 trillion envisioned under current
law.

 &HT;    Airline stocks up on fare increase
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite concerns of rebounding fuel prices, Delta Air
Lines' (DAL) and other carriers' stocks soared Monday on news the
industry raised fares for the second time this year.
</P>
<P>
   The ascent also was propelled by United Airlines' announcement
that first-quarter profits will exceed expectations. Parent UAL
Corp. said it foresees profits of about $1.35 a share, 24 percent
higher than the previous consensus. The world's biggest carrier
cited strong domestic business that, so far, has defied predictions
of a downturn this year.
</P>
<P>
   United initiated the fare increase last week, and by Monday
other big carriers had gone along, including Atlanta-based Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Delta closed up $5 at $69. The stock is up nearly 33 percent
year to date.
</P>
<P>
   The increase raises short-notice fares used by business
travelers by 1 percent, while more restricted leisure-oriented
fares rise 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a boost of 2 percent on business-type fares and
4 percent on others imposed in January. Prior to that, there had
been no generalized fare increases in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said the industry's willingness to go along with the
latest boost _ fare hikes usually fall apart if even one big
carrier balks _ reflects concern about rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think one of the primary motivators that caused the
airlines to fall into line was the fact that fuel prices appear to
have bottomed and are creeping back up,'' said Susan Donofrio, an
analyst with BT Alex. Brown Inc.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC last week announced crude oil production cuts that could
lead to a rebound in oil prices, which fell to a 12-year low at the
end of last year. It remains to be seen, however, whether the
planned cuts take full effect and how much they affect prices.
</P>
<P>
   Low jet fuel prices have been a major contributor to the airline
industry's profit run since 1996. Delta, for instance, spent $280
million less on fuel in 1998 than it did the prior year.

 &HT;    Different takes on DiMaggio, Kubrick farewells
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the newsstand sings a chorus of goodbyes to film
auteur Stanley Kubrick and baseball great Joe DiMaggio, some
bidding adieu with a chuckle, others with a tear. In Newsweek
($3.50) Richard Ben Cramer paints DiMaggio as ``the loneliest hero
we have ever had,'' a man who walled himself away from his public,
friends and family. He died as he lived, writes Cramer, ``without
intimates of any sort.'' On the other hand, Roger Angell hymns
DiMaggio in the New Yorker ($3) by writing strictly about his
on-field style. Elsewhere in the New Yorker we learn of Ian
Watson's years-long effort to write a script for a Kubrick project
called ``A.I.'' and his visits to the reclusive filmmaker's manor
house in St. Albans, England. Among Kubrick's idiosyncrasies: Each
day the chauffeur would bring in a tray of fresh grass for one of
Kubrick's pampered indoor cats to roll in.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Yo, don't bumrush the bondsman: Ten years ago Richard
``Professor Griff'' Griffin, one-time ``minister of information''
for the rap group Public Enemy, precipitated a quick separation
from the group after he told a Washington Times reporter that Jews
were ``responsible for the majority of wickedness that goes on
around the globe.'' Today Griffin is a bail bondsman in Atlanta,
and he tells Vibe ($2.99) about his preferred handgun, his methods
of capturing bail jumpers, and his longing for a different line of
work that doesn't ``profit on someone else's misery.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  God, and Private Ryan: James Hampton Jr., an Elloree, S.C.
native, worked as a janitor in Washington D.C. from 1948-1964,
creating, in his offhours, a staggering work of devotional art that
he called ``The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millenium
General Assembly.'' ``St. James'' is profiled in the current Gadfly
($2.95). Also in Gadfly is a relentlessly corrosive review of
Steven Spielberg's cinematic career, printed just in time to take
the shine off Spielberg's upcoming Oscar statuettes. Writes Daniel
Kraus, ``Now Spielberg is merely so talented that he can cover up
the fact that he has almost nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The wood man: Chuck Leavell, keyboard player for the Rolling
Stones, is listed among the Forbes ($4.95) Celebrity 100, partly,
we assume, because of his prudent financial planning. When the
aging Glimmer Twins decide to stop touring, Leavell will retire to
his 2,000-acre tree farm in Dry Branch, Ga. Called Charlane, the
spread generated $350,000 last year from sales of pulp wood and
from quail hunters paying to shoot birds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Funny papers: Despite the success of cartoonists such as Matt
Groening (''The Simpsons'') and Mike Judge (''King of the Hill'')
the comics subculture still lacks regular coverage in the mass
media. To right that wrong comes Hogan's Alley ($5.95), a thick,
and entertaining semi-annual (created by Atlantan Tom Heintjes)
that offers deep detail in the world of comics. The current issue
includes interviews with Tom Batiuk (creator of Funky Winkerbean
and Crankshaft) and an account of Popeye's transformation from a
newspaper comic strip to a Max Fleischer animated cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Early to the massacre: ``Few places can rival the primal
allure of Africa, or the continent's troubles,'' begins the account
of a safari in the current Conde Nast Traveller ($3.95). Writer Ted
Botha takes a trip to the Bwinde Impenetrable Forest in Uganda to
goggle at one of the last surviving enclaves of mountain gorillas.
Shortly after Botha thrilled to a close encounter with a Silverback
male, Rwandan rebels would hack to death eight gorilla-watching
tourists, including two rebels, in the very same national park.

MAGAZINE BILL INTENSIFIES US-CANADA TRADE TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Setting the stage for an ugly trade war with the
United States, Canada has moved forward on a controversial bill
meant to protect its domestic magazine industry from American
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite US warnings of retaliation that could do billions of
dollars of damage to the Canadian economy, Parliament's House of
Commons Monday passed a bill banning Canadian companies from
advertising in so-called ``split run'' editions of US magazines
marketed in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the bill won approval, however, Canadian and US trade
officials continued to negotiate in Washington, raising the
possibility of a compromise before the bill becomes law and a clash
becomes inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, passage of the legislation by Commons, the most
powerful of Parliament's two chambers, represented an escalation of
what has already become one of the most rancorous disputes in
decades between the neighbors, with Washington threatening
sanctions that could put thousands of workers north of the border
out of work by imposing punishing tariffs on Canadian steel,
textiles and plastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian magazine market means very little to the US, but
the US has decided to make a test case, as it has with the European
Union on bananas,'' said Toronto-based trade consultant Lawrence
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is being followed closely in Europe, especially
France, where there is sentiment in favor of restricting some US
``cultural imports,'' especially movies, in order to nurture
homegrown talent. No other country except Canada, however, has been
willing to risk American trade wrath by pressing one of the
trickest of trade issues _ should expressions of culture, whether
high art or low skin mags, be exempt from the rules governing
trade?
</P>
<P>
   For some Canadians the issue carries considerable moral
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We either fight for this country, or we blink and let the
Americans take over,'' author June Callwood told a news conference
in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the bill is to block American mass market
publications from taking an even larger bite of the Canadian
magazine market. But US officials say the measure violates free
trade treaties between the two countries, and Washington has
pledged to launch massive sanctions against the Canadian steel,
textile and plastic industries if the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian nationalists say the drastic step is necessary to
defend Canada from the cultural Juggernaut of the US. Magazines,
they argue, are a vital form of cultural expression, not just a
commodity covered by trade law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do nothing would be to lie down to the schoolyard bully,''
said Canadian Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, chief architect of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the nationalists were crowing victory in Parliament,
Canadian diplomats were negotiating feverishly with American trade
officials in hopes of striking a compromise that would head off a
trade row. There is still time for a deal as the bill heads to
Canada's Senate, a usually rubber stamp body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US and Canada will end up cutting a deal, and all this
will have been for naught,'' said former US Ambassador James J.
Blanchard, who stepped down in 1996 as Washington's top diplomat to
America's most important trading partner. More than $1 billion in
goods and services crosses the US-Canada border every day, the
world's largest trade relationship.

DOW, S&AMP;P CLIMB TO RECORD HIGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rose sharply Monday, swept higher by a
couple of big merger announcements, enthusiastic buying of
technology shares and an optimistic earnings forecast from UAL, the
nation's biggest commercial airline company.
</P>
<P>
   The advance pushed two major market measures _ the Dow Jones
industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index _ to
new records. The Nasdaq composite index failed to set a new high
but was the session's best-performing index. Even small stocks,
which have done dismally this year, had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what has been happening in the U.S. economy, you have to
be very positive on the market,'' said Jack Shaughnessy, the chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 82.42 points, or 0.8
percent, at 9,958.77. Despite the run-up, the Dow never seriously
challenged the 10,000 mark. In the session, it rose as high as
9,970.15. Still, it was the first time the blue-chip index had
closed above 9,900, eclipsing its previous high of 9,897.44, set on
March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the 10,000 level for the Dow is largely an
irrelevancy,'' said Peter Canelo, a U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The key drivers for the market are a
tremendous economy without any inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the S&AMP;P 500 rose 12.67, or 1 percent, to 1,307.26.
That gain passed the previous record of 1,297.68, which was also
established on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Strong buying of technology and Internet shares powered the
Nasdaq index to a gain of 49.91, or 2.1 percent, to 2,431.44. And
the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 2.46, or 0.6
percent, to 400.84.
</P>
<P>
   Two big merger deals _ Fleet Financial's acquisition of
BankBoston and DuPont's takeover of Pioneer Hi-Bred International _
were important positives.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet deal refocused attention on consolidation in the
financial services industry and pushed up prices of a number of big
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch gained 4 7/16, to 91 11/16, on rumors that Chase
Manhattan might be looking to acquire the nation's biggest
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, a Dow component and a company that in the past was
mentioned as a possible takeover candidate, was the best performing
part of the blue-chip index Monday, rising 3 3/8, to 125 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston gained 1/8, to 47 1/8; Fleet lost 2 9/16, to 42 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pioneer Hi-Bred, the world's largest seed-corn
company, rose 4 1/16, to 38 3/8, after it was announced that DuPont
had agreed to buy the 80 percent of the company it does not already
own for about $40 a share in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont was the worst-performing component of the Dow, falling 1
1/2, to 56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings announcement from UAL, which said it expected
first-quarter earnings to exceed expectations by 24 percent because
of strong domestic business, powered the entire airline sector
higher.
</P>
<P>
   UAL, the parent of United Airlines, gained 6 11/16, to 73 3/4;
US Airways rose 2 7/8, to 55 3/8; AMR, the parent of American
Airlines, jumped 3 3/4, to 61 3/4, and Delta Air Lines rose 5, to
69.
</P>
<P>
   The gains helped to push the Dow Jones transportation average up
4.2 percent. Even with the big rise, that index is still trading
almost 8 percent below the peak it set in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strength in the economy, Canelo from Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter said that first-quarter earnings could well be strong
across a wide swath of industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the consumer is slowing down at all,'' he said.
``That should be a positive for the overall economy and should lead
to strong earnings across-the-board, with the exception of some
basic industries and energy, which will suffer due to tough
comparisons from a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In technology, Netscape Communications rose 6 1/8, to 91. It was
announced on Friday that America Online had won antitrust clearance
from federal regulators to complete the $8.98 billion acquisition
of the top maker of Internet software. America Online rose 5 7/8,
to 102.
</P>
<P>
   Among large-capitalization technology companies, Microsoft
gained 5 11/16, to 165 7/8; Dell Computer rose 1 9/16, to 43 3/4,
and EMC jumped 4 1/16, to 116 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's Internet sector index rose 36.83, or 6.5
percent, to a new high of 604.83.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks look expensive, but they have looked that way
since they were trading at half of what they are now,'' said
Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at
Salomon Smith Barney.

COMMUNITIES FORCED TO PLAN FUTURE AROUND SALMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Few area residents will feel it Tuesday, when the
chinook salmon is declared a threatened species in Puget Sound. But
over the next five years, the region is expected to get a lot more
green.
</P>
<P>
   Trees will be planted along denuded rivers, including the
Sammamish River, where salmon currently get baked by the sun.
Streamside forests and wetlands will be preserved by acquisition
and easements.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, the salmon listing is going to force
people to think more green, too, from the way they build roads,
sewers and homes to the way they regulate logging, fishing and even
lawn fertilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Government, business and homeowners ``are going to have to think
far more about their impacts on fish than ever before,'' says King
County Executive Ron Sims.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: to restore chinook salmon runs, down about one-third
from their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Only the general outline of those changes has been framed in
recent months by cities, counties and the state. The details will
be penciled in over the next three years by a plethora of agencies
and watershed groups, perhaps with additions from federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   What won't happen, according to Sims, is economic paralysis. By
taking strong actions to protect and restore salmon habitat, King,
Pierce and Snohomish counties in Western Washington expect to avoid
being tied in knots by Endangered Species Act lawsuits, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have the flexibility to continue much of what
we do today in terms of growth and development _ and still be able
to conserve the salmon.'' Sims said in an interview. ``We're not
going to have a lot of litigation in our county stopping things.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. Environmental-group lawyers are waiting
to see what stream safeguards are applied. And though Sims and
other local leaders hope to get a broad federal exemption from
citizen lawsuits, federal officials are leaning toward narrow
exemptions. In any event, these will take months to hash out.
</P>
<P>
   What will change immediately is anything that involves federal
authority or money. As soon as the fish is formally protected by
the Endangered Species Act, all federal activity in the region will
be subject to review by biologists to ensure it doesn't harm the
fish. Hundreds of road projects will face review, as will decisions
to fill wetlands, dredge waterways or even build federally
subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, nothing else will change right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could drive a bulldozer down a stream on private land now
and it would be stupid, but it wouldn't be illegal,'' at least
under the species law, says Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, local governments face strong pressure to show progress
toward a more salmon-friendly environment. Federal prohibitions
against hurting salmon habitat will kick in as soon as federal
officials write a rule on what is banned. Federal officials want a
Puget Sound chinook rule in place by fall, and another against
harming bull trout in June.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules are crucial to the region. If they are written as
simple, sweeping prohibitions, they could paralyze economic growth
by exposing all kinds of actions to citizen lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, King, Pierce and Snohomish counties and their component
cities want rules that would exempt them from citizen lawsuits. In
effect, they want federal declarations that they are doing enough
to recover the listed fish.
</P>
<P>
   To win such a broad shield, the counties are touting what they
have done in the past, together with promises to do more over the
next three years. Because promises alone aren't enough to satisfy
federal courts or agencies, their strategy to demonstrate
commitment includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Laundry lists of all they have done to preserve and protect
salmon habitat in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ Early actions that include additional environmental reviews
and better enforcement of existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pledges to review all relevent ordinances for salmon impacts.
</P>
<P>
   _ A list of research and habitat protection or restoration
projects they will propose for funding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support for watershed groups that will draft detailed recovery
plans over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges for local government is the need
to show quick improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, salmon habitat protection comes from a tangle of
ordinances that have accumulated over decades: on grading,
clearing, building codes, shorelines, drainage, sensitive areas and
comprehensive plans. Each was a product of years of debate and
compromise, so quickly revising them was not an option. Instead,
the counties pledged to consider tightening each of those
ordinances over the coming year or two.
</P>
<P>
   So far, King County is saying its rules look pretty good, but
need much better enforcement. Pierce and Snohomish Counties are
expected to need more tightening of their rules. And smaller cities
are further behind.
</P>
<P>
   To show quick improvement, the counties have already moved to
hire more staff to enforce environmental rules, and additional
requests for inspectors are coming.
</P>
<P>
   They also have proposed to expand reviews of new construction
near streams, wetlands and shorelines. This scrutiny, conducted
under the State Environmental Policy Act, is likely to push new
buildings farther back from these sensitive areas, while requiring
better runoff control, less pavement and other adjustments. To
builders' distress, it also could expand permit delays.
</P>
<P>
   Major new habitat acqusitions, restoration projects and
construction projects are expected. King County will build new
sewage treatment plants to recycle treated ``grey'' water for use
by golf courses, industries and farms. That will enable those users
to leave more water in streams for fish.
</P>
<P>
   Construction and maintenance of roads will change across the
region, with an eye to reducing the flow of pollution and sediment
into streams. Culverts will be fixed to allow fish passage.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure on homeowners and businesses will mount to
use less water and protect stream quality by using fewer pesticides
and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the counties hope to win these changes through major
public education efforts like newsletters, advertising and public
meetings. But new forms of regulation will be considered.
</P>
<P>
   King County, the only Washington government to require control
of livestock around streams, says it will consider imposing rules
on commercial use of pesticides and fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk and planning, however, will pay off only when it
is reflected in what government actually does. Even while hatching
these plans, local agencies have dredged Adare Creek near Duvall
and polluted it with diesel fuel and sediment from an industrial
storage area, says Kurt Beardslee, director of Washington Trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk is great,'' he said, ``but it doesn't yet match the
reality.''

MEDICARE PANEL VOTE SHY OF REVAMP AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM AND AARON ZITNER

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hopes of a bipartisan agreement in Washington on a
plan to revamp Medicare faded Monday as a blue-ribbon panel charged
by Congress with recommending changes to the financially troubled
program appears to be one vote shy of reaching a consensus on a
broad proposal.
</P>
<P>
   As the popular health insurance program for 39 million elderly
and disabled Americans veers toward bankruptcy, the 17-member panel
has been grappling for more than a year to craft a broad plan to
avert Medicare's financial collapse, which is predicted to occur as
early as 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, scheduled to meet a final time Tuesday, has been
unable to agree on a broad range of issues, from finding new ways
to pay for Medicare to adding prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the panel's co-chairmen, Sen. John Breaux, Democrat of
Louisiana, and Rep. John Thomas, a California Republican, unveiled
a revised final proposal and said they would be making a last ditch
effort to garner the 11 votes needed to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Thomas have 10 votes, but have so far been unable to
come to agreement with swing voters Stuart Altman, professor at
Brandeis University, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, dean of the
University of California at Berkeley Haas School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Altman and Tyson have insisted that the proposal be more
specific about ways to finance Medicare, including adopting
President Clinton's suggestion to devote 15 percent of the
projected federal budget surplus to Medicare. They have also called
for broad prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The final proposal contains neither request, setting up a
scenario in which it is unlikely to muster the necessary votes to
win the bipartisan imprimatur of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux Monday declined to predict the outcome of Tuesday's vote.
He did, however, say he would propose the plan as legislation,
regardless of whether the panel gives its approval. Breaux further
stated he was confident he had enough votes in the Senate to pass
such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the process. This is just the
beginning,'' Breaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal calls for raising the eligibility age for
Medicare beneficiaries from 65 to 67, adding prescription drug
coverage for beneficiaries whose annual incomes are at or less than
135 percent of federal poverty guidelines, requiring Medicare
supplemental insurance policies to cover prescription drugs, and
removing graduate medical education subsidies from Medicare's
budget. It also proposes to create a market for private health
insurers to care for beneficiaries, who would be required to pay 12
percent of the insurance premium.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, Breaux said, would result in $102 billion in reduced
Medicare spending between 2003 and 2009, with savings reaching $700
billion a year by 2030. The proposal would keep Medicare solvent
for five additional years beyond 2008, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's panel debate is likely to be politically charged.
Republicans on the panel have charged Clinton with obstructing
their work, using his influence with Altman and Tyson to hold up a
consensus. Altman Monday vigorously denied the claim, saying he has
always pushed for expanded drug coverage and an effort to identify
explicit financing for the $210 billion-a-year program.
</P>
<P>
   White House deputy for health policy, Chris Jennings, Monday
said Clinton ``made a decision that he wouldn't tell people to vote
for something they think is flawed or against something they think
is strong. The idea that we could direct members cannot be held up
for credible argument. They all have their own views.''

NO LINK SEEN BETWEEN EXPLOSION AT N.C. CLINIC AND BOMBING FUGITIVE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga., Ala., N.C.) (fb)  
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal officials said on Monday that there was no
evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive
charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an
abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion
because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in
Birmingham, Ala., and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was
last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Asheville, federal investigators were
careful to say that they had not definitively excluded Rudolph as a
suspect. But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews
on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb
probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying at this time that we have no evidence that this
is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' said Mark Calloway, the U.S.
attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. ``But it's
early in the investigation, and we're not drawing any conclusions
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Enderson, the FBI agent directing the task force that is
searching for Rudolph, said in a statement that ``there is no
reason to believe'' that Rudolph has any connection to the
Asheville attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another federal investigator, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, was even more explicit. ``We see no linkage,'' the
law-enforcement official said. ``This device is much different than
the devices associated with Rudolph. In a world where anything is
possible, I can't slam any doors because we don't have Rudolph in
custody and we don't know who did it in Asheville. But there are a
lot of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have painstakingly analyzed the components of the
bombs Rudolph is accused of building, and have found numerous
similarities between their parts and their design.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb in Asheville exploded shortly after 7 a.m. Saturday
outside the Femcare Clinic, the only abortion provider in western
North Carolina. The clinic was scheduled to open at 8 a.m. No one
was injured, and the bomb caused little damage because it did not
fully detonate. There were no warnings before the blast, and no
person or group has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Femcare Clinic has never been hit by a violent attack, but
it has been the site of regular protests by anti-abortion
demonstrators. It also received a hoax letter that purported to
contain anthrax last month and a threatening telephone call last
July, Calloway said.
</P>
<P>
   If the bomb had fully detonated, the damage would have been
severe, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in North Carolina. ``It
would have devastated that entire end of the building and
penetrated into the building some approximately 40 feet or so to 60
feet, with fairly complete destruction,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bomb did not explode completely, investigators have
gathered far more information about its components than is usually
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a
fugitive since Jan. 30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed the
New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at
Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan. 16, 1997, bombing of a
north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the
Feb. 21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police
officer in Birmingham, and injured 124. Rudolph remains on the
FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. A reward of $1 million
has been offered for information leading to his arrest.

LOS ANGELES REVELS IN DESIGNATION AS SITE OF DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Evoking the glories and the ghost of John F.
Kennedy, the Democratic National Committee announced on Monday that
it will hold its national convention here in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In coming to Los Angeles for the first time in 40 years, the
Democrats are hoping that history will repeat itself. In 1960, John
F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, won the
presidential nomination here and went on to become a cherished
icon.
</P>
<P>
   The city's selection had been widely known since last week, so
Monday's official announcement was a time for the people who
brought the Democrats to town to take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   The newly elected Democratic governor of California, Gray Davis,
said the convention and the state's new earlier primary will help
give California ``unrivaled clout'' and show that ``Los Angeles is
back, having weathered riots and recession, floods and fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire businessman, Eli Broad, said the convention will
create jobs and pour $150 million into the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan, was
beaming about the prospect of so many Democrats coming to town.
``Democrats are almost as good as Republicans,'' the mayor said
after the news conference. ``Right now, I'm in love with the
Democrats for picking Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the national chair-designate of the Democratic
National Committee, said that Los Angeles was selected for several
reasons, including the ``vibrancy and diversity of the people'' and
the election of Davis, the first Democratic governor elected in
California in 16 years. He added that Riordan, ``a man who has
reached across the divide of partisan politics,'' had also played a
key role.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Andrew said Los Angeles was selected because of a
partnership between business, politicians and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   According to convention organizers, the private sector is
committed to providing $28.1 million of the $35.3 million cost of
the convention. ``The citizens of California,'' Andrew said, ``will
get the benefit and not the burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be held at the new 900,000-square-foot
Staples Center, which is scheduled to be completed this fall. The
center is in downtown Los Angeles, a few blocks from the city's
Skid Row, which was crowded with homeless people on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition
to End Hunger and Homelessness, said he did not expect the
convention to have much economic impact on the people who live so
close to the Staples Center. During the Olympics of 1984 and the
pope's visit four years later, Erlenbusch said, there were
countless ``horror stories'' of homeless people being swept off the
streets by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James M. Lawson Jr., a leader of the civil rights
movement and now the pastor of the Holman Methodist Church, a few
miles from the convention site, said there is no doubt that some
ordinary people will get jobs because of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the convention will not effect any long-term change in Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for
Public Policy, said the coalition that helped bring the convention
to Los Angeles is an example of a new direction for the city.

RAPE CASE ILLUMINATES PROBLEM IN MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ A young female soldier is assigned to work for the
commander of an Israeli military training base in the Negev Desert.
One day, the two start a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it does not sound like a surprising story, in a country
where high-ranking officers are feted like movie stars and where
young female conscripts are assigned to be their secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   But this relationship has moved out of the backroom and into the
courtroom. The woman, who was 19 years old when the affair began
with her 40-year-old married commanding officer, said the
relationship started as consensual but, several weeks later,
culminated in rape in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the military sided with Brigadier General Nir
Galili, who denied raping the woman, although he admitted to a
sexual affair. He was reprimanded for ``inappropriate behavior''
with a subordinate, and his promotion was delayed two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Galili's two years are up, and the military wants to make
him a major general, the second highest rank in the Israeli
military. But the woman, whose name has not been made public, has
gone to the high court to demand it stop the promotion or order
that Galili be tried for raping her.
</P>
<P>
   The military's decision to promote Galili, which the court is
expected to rule on Tuesday, is being cited by women's activists as
proof that Israeli society in general, and the military in
particular, is still unwilling to treat rape allegations seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military says it was consensual, but we think you can't
talk about consent between a 40-year-old man and a 19-year-old girl
under his command,'' said Yaron Keidar, a lawyer for the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The case has come up at a time when reported rapes and other
sexual abuses are on the rise here. Some activists say that the
army, as the protector of the country, needs to show that it is as
serious about protecting those who fill its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, over the past few years, there has been
growing consciousness about violence and sexual abuse of woman, but
where is the army in all this? Is it blind?'' asked Orit
Sulitzeanu, spokeswoman for the Israel Women's Network, an activist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of sexual harassment and abuse is one that all
countries with mixed-sex armies must grapple with, but in Israel
the issue may reverberate more deeply because the compulsory army
service applies to young Jewish women as well as men.
</P>
<P>
   While the military's rules forbid sexual relationships between
officers and soldiers under their command, activists say women
often feel powerless to say no. Some say the military should revoke
Galili's promotion, to make it clear to all soldiers and officers
that any sexual relationship that smacks of harassment or abuse
will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What message is the army broadcasting when it declares its
commitment to fight sexual harassment while, at the same time,
promoting a senior officer who had sex with a female soldier under
his command in gross violation of the general staff's order
forbidding such relationships?'' wrote the defense correspondent
for the respected daily newspaper Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
   The same newspaper reported that some officers say Galili has
been punished enough, arguing that his promotion should not be held
up any longer over a three-year-old rape allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The military itself said in a court filing that the woman's
petition should be dismissed because, among other things, she could
have responded three years ago if she did not like the punishment
meted out to Galili. Noting that she refused to testify at the time
_ making a trial impossible _ it also suggested that her claim was
not credible because she did not immediately leave the room after
the alleged assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the opinion of the chief of staff, he is one of
the best fighters and commanders we have,'' the military's court
filing said of Galili. The filing was provided by Keidar, the
woman's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Keidar added that his client did not testify at the time because
she was traumatized and did not want to face the ordeal of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt ashamed and humiliated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the promotion jolted her and rekindled her anger, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't think he would be promoted and only after she heard
the announcement did she decide to start legal action,'' Keidar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military's stance outrages many women's activists. They say
the military's position is a sign that despite its campaigns to
stop sexual harassment and abuse, the male-dominated institution
still does not understand how difficult it can be for a young,
female conscript.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the structure of the military itself.
With rare exceptions women do not serve in combat units and instead
are often consigned to secretarial work.
</P>
<P>
   The commanding officer, usually a man, has almost full control
over the woman's life. He decides whether the young woman goes home
for the weekend, whether she gets a task she enjoys, what time she
can leave for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand the all-encompassing power he has over
her. She's serving him, he has complete authority over her and I
don't think she has the ability to say no,'' said Anat Hoffman, a
Jerusalem city councilor and a member of the Israel Women's
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people on the outside understand what sort of
price she would have to pay,'' she said.

HATTEBERG CATCHES THE SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Honest, it really happened this way. Monday,
Red Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg learned he no longer has to catch
the knuckleballs of Tim Wakefield. His response was a wide smile
and pair of three-run homers against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't have written a script to top what the third-year
catcher did in the Red Sox' 13-2 exhibition victory. In addition to
his offensive outburst, he was solid behind the plate in his
handling of Pedro Martinez, who struck out seven in four innings
and three times pitched out of danger by changing speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg is no Carlton Fisk. He's not even a Rich Gedman,
although he does wear uniform No. 10. He was the Sox' third pick in
the 1991 draft who has worked himself up through the system and now
splits the major league catching duties with Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg caught 112 games last year, and even with Varitek
assigned to be Wakefield's caddie, Hatteberg will get a lot of
action again this season. He will be looking to hone his skills,
too, because there will be serious competition from some current
farmhands soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the lefthanded-hitting Hatteberg was used mostly
against righthanders, and Varitek, a switch hitter, against
lefties. But even if a righthander is opposing Wakefield, Hatteberg
will take a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to catch both of them every day,'' said Sox manager
Jimy Williams, ``but I can't. Will this take some at-bats away from
Hatteberg? Probably. But it won't matter because these two kids
pull for each other. They really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg's first homer Monday came in the first inning off
Pittsburgh's Chris Peters, a lefthander who gave up seven runs. In
the fourth, Hatteberg went deep off Johan Lopez, a righthander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've gotten a little stronger,'' said Hatteberg.
``It's not a case of me trying to hit more home runs. I think I'm
just making better contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg had no problem with the decision to use Varitek with
Wakefield. There are four other starters in the rotation and a
bullpen to work with. It's a much better situation than a year ago,
when Jim Leyritz, since traded to San Diego, was also in the
catching mix and Hatteberg was battling to make the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Leyritz, and it looked like a situation where neither
of us would be catching a lot,'' said Hatteberg. ``But it worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spring training, I can use it for what it was intended _
get ready for the year. That's nice. You come in and maybe push
each other. Before, you worried if you had a bad at-bat it was do
or die because you want to impress so much. Now you come in and you
feel better _ not that you want to screw up. There's just not that
constant pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot in the last two years. In the case of
pitchers, there are quite a few of them back and it's easier to
work with guys you knew in the past. Last year, it worked out great
offensively. You combine our numbers and it's the kind of
production we'd like to have every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, hitting is always been a matter of adjustments. My
first year I got a lot of fastballs, my second I saw fewer of them
in fastball situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Williams said, decisions to platoon young players
backfire. Varitek has a slight edge on defense. Hatteberg's bat is
making him a valuable asset. And he can catch, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Scotty handle Wakefield?'' said Williams. ``Yes, he did
for two years. But this is just a decision we made. One catcher for
Wake. Maybe this will help him. As for Hatteberg, I know he feels
better about himself. He looks good out there.''

AMEX CHIEF SYRON TO HEAD THERMO ELECTRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 43 years at the helm of Thermo Electron Corp., George N.
Hatsopoulos Monday said he is stepping down as chief executive and
turning over the reins on June 1 to board member Richard F. Syron,
chief executive of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,
will return to Massachusetts to become president and chief
executive of Thermo Electron during a difficult period for the
Waltham, Mass. instruments and equipment company. Thermo Electron
is undergoing a restructuring after a slump in profits. Monday, it
warned Wall Street analysts that first-quarter earnings would be
lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hatsopoulos, 72, will remain Thermo Electron
chairman, his departure from active management ends one of the
longest reigns in corporate history.
</P>
<P>
   Hatsopoulos, a Greek immmigrant who did graduate work at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, founded Thermo Electron in
1956. He and his brother John built the company, a pioneer on Route
128, into a diversified company with $3.9 billion in revenue last
year.
</P>
<P>
   John Hatsopoulos, 64, retired in January as president and will
remain as vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Currentl president Arvin Smith will remain with the company in
an advisory role.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron's stock has fallen from a high of 44 at the end
of 1997 to 13 5/8 earlier this month. Monday, Thermo Electron
shares closed at 14, down 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In December, the board (of directors) and I decided that we
had to addresss the issue of who will succeed me,'' said
Hatsopoulos. ``My health is very good, but I got tired of working
70 hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Syron is ``an organization person, a manager of talent and
someone who also has a vision,'' said George Hatsopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   The board tapped Syron after the company hired a search firm and
interviewed nearly three dozen inside and outside candidates,
Hatsopoulos added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was personal contact that cemented the appointment.
Both men have known each other for 17 years. Hatsopoulos, once a
board member of the Boston Fed, had recruited Syron away from
Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, where was chief executive, to
become Boston Fed president in 1989. Earlier in his career, Syron
had served as an aide to then-Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Syron left Boston for New York to head the American
Stock Exchange. Last year, he helped engineer its absorption into
the Nasdaq Stock Market and its parent, the National Association of
Securities Dealers. That in effect left Syron without a job.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a phone interview, the 55-year-old Syron said he
plans to complete Thermo Electron's previously announced
reorganization. The company is known for its unusual strategy of
forming companies around technologies it develops and selling a
minority interest in them to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization calls for reducing the number of spinout
companies from 23 today to 16 by the end of this year. Last
December, the company said it would fold some spinouts into a
single company, transfer some operations and take some
publicly-held subsidiaries private.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these spinouts _ which are 60 percent to 90 percent
owned by Thermo Electron _ have not been as profitable as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a parent company with 23 subsidiaries, you have
the danger of just the complexity of working on the interactions
between the companies and the managers, which is very
time-consuming, and you have to simplify the organizational
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the core, the strategy of having all these spinout
companies was a good, but we may have stayed with it too long,''
Syron said.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, a Boston native, said future products developed by Thermo
Electron may become part of existing spinout companies that address
specific industries.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came just before the company warned that
first-quarter profit would be around 15 cents a share, down from
analysts' consensus forecast of 19 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thermo Electron has some underperforming businesses and I
think having Syron on board will be viewed positively. He has both
an understanding for the company and a background of leading large
organizations,'' said Michael Hutchison of Barrington Capital.

 WASHINGTON: a deal.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The letter from Sens. Helms and Hollings, which was reported in
Monday's Wall Street Journal, mirrors conditions that the House
Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, has made and portends
a tough fight for China to join the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as anger in Congress grows on the trade front, there is
greater anxiety over security at Los Alamos and other national
weapons labs. The labs had long resisted FBI and congressional
pressure to tighten their security policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which oversees the labs, has been lax in
its supervision. The department, for example, never filed a
congressionally required annual report in 1998 on the status of
security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over as Energy secretary last fall,
Richardson learned of the urgency of the spy case and reinstated
background checks on all foreign visitors, but it was a move the
FBI had recommended 17 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Intelligence Committee's
ranking Democrat, distanced himself Monday from Shelby's suggestion
of a moratorium noting that ``it's not a situation where foreign
visitors are the problems, it's the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, in a statement Monday night, said
rigorous screening and security measures were in place to insure
foreign visitors could not gain access to classified material.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey expressed concern over security at the laboratories,
even with the improvements Richardson has put in place, including
doubling the counterintelligence budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer have any sense of security that we're doing the
right thing,'' Kerrey told reporters after meeting with Tenet.
``What I have right now is a considerable amount of nervousness
over our counterintelligence efforts and their effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans pounced on the spy case as evidence that
the administration's policy of engaging China turned a blind eye to
national security, a top Republican analyst, William Kristol,
accused congressional Republicans of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have largely supported the president and Sandy
Berger on engagement and trade above all else in China,'' Kristol
said Monday, referring to the president's national security
adviser, Samuel Berger. ``Ultimately, it looks like, hey, something
hit the headlines and let's take advantage of it.''

LATIN AMERICA WATCHING FLEET-BANKBOSTON DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ News of Fleet Financial Group's acquisition of
BankBoston Corp. made headlines from Mexico City to Buenos Aires
Monday, as observers in Latin America's major business centers
wondered whether Fleet would maintain BankBoston's decades-long
commitment to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder what they're going to do now in Latin America,'' said
one Mexico-based foreign banker with extensive experience in the
region. ``Fleet has no expertise in this field.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger was front-page news in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial
capital and one of the major hubs of BankBoston's Latin American
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston's international experience could not be
more different. Fleet has no recognizable presence overseas, having
concentrated on building up its domestic and regional operations.
BankBoston, on the other hand, has built an extensive and
well-respected Latin American unit over almost a century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may have been the bank's exposure in Latin America,
coupled with the economic crisis that has hit the region, that
ultimately led BankBoston to accept Fleet's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the stars were aligned this time,'' said
BankBoston chairman Charles Gifford, who will become chief
executive officer of the new entity at the end of 2001. ``The
volatility of our business was making it increasingly difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, officials said Monday, the Latin American
operations of the combined Fleet Boston Corp. will keep the
BankBoston name.
</P>
<P>
   The unit will be managed by Henrique C. Meirelles, BankBoston's
Brazilian-born president, who will oversee much of the new
institution's international businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a continued economic crisis that has hampered the
bank's recent performance in Brazil and Argentina, there are no
immediate plans to scale back an aggressive $100 million expansion
program that BankBoston began in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done business in Latin America for over 80 years, and
we expect to continue that tradition while pursuing opportunities
in other global markets,'' Meirelles said in a statement issued by
both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts and banking industry leaders in Latin America
wonder whether the merger will mean a diminished role for
BankBoston in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will give them more ways to cushion the blow of
what's happened in Latin America,'' said the president of a bank in
Buenos Aires who requested anonymity. ``But in situations like
this, what we usually see is layoffs and loan portfolios which are
cut back because they're considered to be too risky.''
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston established its first Latin American office in
Argentina in 1917 to assist Massachusetts textile companies. Thirty
years later, it set up shop in Brazil, and now has offices in eight
countries, where it provides corporate lending and consumer
services such as checking accounts, credit cards, and mutual funds,
primarily for affluent clients.
</P>
<P>
   The business has contributed as much as 19 percent to the bank's
annual revenue in recent years. But it also has accounted for some
costly failures.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, poor decisions by the bank's emerging-markets
operation resulted in a $52 million third-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, the head of BankBoston's private banking
operation in New York was charged with embezzling $66 million in
fraudulent loans to an Argentine businessman, exposing the bank's
loose financial controls. Officials insist those controls have
since been reviewed and tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger is complete, officials said, Latin American
operations will make up about 9 percent of annual revenue.
Officials said the larger bank will be better insulated from sudden
and explosive swings in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a bigger balance sheet, we can better exploit the
strengths and better withstand the perceived volatility,'' Gifford
said. ``With the new company, there's a lot more we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, competitors and bank employees alike preferred to
withhold judgment about the merger until they had more evidence _
one way or the other _ that Fleet Boston will continue to view
Latin America as an important market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is uncertainty here, but I wouldn't call it panic,''
said one BankBoston employee in Argentina. ``Things are changing,
but none of us are sure yet where we fit in.''

SCIENTIST UNDER INVESTIGATION ADMITTED UNAUTHORIZED CONTACTS WITH
CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-MISSILES) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, questioned in a nuclear espionage investigation,
admitted to the FBI that he had had unauthorized contacts with
Chinese scientists, senior intelligence and law-enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During three days of interviews with the bureau beginning on
March 5, Wen Ho Lee, a 59-year-old nuclear weapons scientist at Los
Alamos, admitted that he had failed to report his contacts with
Chinese scientists to his supervisors at Los Alamos, as government
regulations required, several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   His admissions helped cement the decision by Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson to fire him on March 8, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's statements did not provide enough evidence to lead to his
arrest, however, they said. Still, the officials say that Lee, who
has been the focus of the FBI investigation since 1996, remains a
suspect in the government's investigation into whether China stole
technology related to the design of America's most advanced nuclear
warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the Chinese apparently stole the design
technology in the 1980s, but the United States did not detect the
theft until 1995. In June 1996, the FBI opened a criminal
investigation into the allegations of Chinese atomic espionage,
which have been denied by China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was allowed to retain his access to U.S. nuclear secrets and
remain in a highly sensitive job at Los Alamos for more than a year
after the bureau urged the Energy Department to cut off his access
to classified material and move him to a less sensitive position.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with nuclear weapons experts brought in by the
bureau to determine whether Lee had committed espionage, the
officials said that Lee made statements that proved he had violated
the security rules at Los Alamos, a lab owned by the Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who did not have an attorney with him during the
questioning, stopped being cooperative on the third day, after The
New York Times published an article on the case, the officials
said. The FBI then decided there was no longer any investigative
reason to keep Lee on the job, and gave the green light to
Richardson to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the investigation into the theft of nuclear secrets
from Los Alamos has stalled, the officials acknowledged. They said
they have no other suspects and are uncertain where their
investigation can go from here.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist, has retained an attorney and is no
longer providing any information to investigators, the officials
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this particular case, we don't have anybody saying this is
the guy,'' one senior intelligence official said. He said that
investigators still do not have a clear picture of Lee's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy violated some rules, and was fired for doing that,''
the official said. ``But we really don't know what his motivations
were for doing that. We really don't know enough about what he did.
He may have used poor judgment, he may have been persuaded by
sentiment or something else to give information he shouldn't have.
There are huge unknowns at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interviews with the FBI, Lee confirmed some evidence
about his travel and contacts with Chinese scientists that had
already been gathered by investigators, while also providing
information about contacts with Chinese scientists not previously
known by the FBI. The officials declined to provide details about
the contacts with Chinese scientists acknowledged by Lee. But a
central focus of the FBI's questioning was whether Lee had passed
classified information related to how the W-88 warhead is detonated
to Chinese scientists during scientific conferences. One such
conference occurred in China in 1988, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The admissions that he made were not things that were against
the law, but against DOE regulations,'' said a U.S. official.
``Some of it was known already, and some of it was new, and it gave
DOE a stronger cause for termination,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials say that they have decided to go back to square
one in their investigation. The FBI has added extra agents to the
case in order to review old evidence and hopefully develop new
leads.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, U.S. officials acknowledge that there is
evidence of ongoing Chinese espionage operations aimed at Los
Alamos and America's other nuclear weapons laboratories. Officials
caution that there is no evidence that those spy efforts have
succeeded in stealing more nuclear technology. But the FBI has also
not yet been able to develop enough evidence to open full criminal
investigations of those activities.

CHANCELLOR MEDIA CANCELS DEAL FOR LIN TV; CHANCELLOR CHIEF OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, R.I.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chancellor Media Corp., the big radio and outdoor-advertising
company in Dallas, called off its $900 million deal to buy Lin
Television Corp. on Monday and said that its chief executive had
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, which has been under pressure from shareholders
unhappy with its lagging stock price and its plans to expand into
television, said it would remain independent after a review that
included merger talks with Clear Channel Communications Inc.,
according to people involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Chancellor, Jeffrey Marcus, resigned and
was replaced by Thomas Hicks, the chairman of the Dallas buyout
firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP; Furst, which owns 12 percent of
Chancellor. Hicks was already chairman of Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, a longtime acquaintance of Hicks, took over the top spot
at Chancellor after its former chief executive, Scott Ginsburg, and
Hicks had a falling-out over the company's future. Marcus will join
the board of Lin, which is three-quarters owned by Hicks, Muse, and
will remain a Chancellor director.
</P>
<P>
   He said the reshuffling was not acrimonious, adding that now
that Chancellor would no longer be making a lot of big
acquisitions, ``We no longer had a need for someone who does what I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse will spend $500 million over the next two weeks to
buy Chancellor shares on the open market, giving it a 29 percent
stake in the company once Chancellor completes its pending
acquisition of Capstar Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, Muse, which built Chancellor through acquisitions, also
said Monday that it would stop charging Chancellor oversight and
advisory fees, a practice that had been criticized by some
Chancellor shareholders. The change was made, Hicks said, ``to
eliminate any perceived impediment the fees might otherwise
represent to the maximization of value for all Chancellor
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many shareholders hoped Chancellor would receive an
acquisition offer over the weekend, Hicks, speaking during a
conference call with investors, said: ``We never received an offer
for any of our assets. We had lots of constructive conversations
with people. We concluded that the right thing to do for this
company is to stay independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chancellor, which initially fell 11 percent Monday
morning, recovered strongly and rose $1.1875, to $45.5625, on heavy
volume. Some analysts said that after arbitragers and other
investors hoping for a quick sale to Clear Channel, a media company
based in San Antonio, sold the stock, investors bid shares up on
hopes that a deal with Clear Channel might still occur, and that
Chancellor shares would eventually be awarded the same high
multiple as other big radio companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said in January that it had hired an investment bank
to examine potential mergers and other transactions. Since then,
the company has had talks with Clear Channel about a possible
merger, but did not have discussions of that scope with other
companies, according to a person involved in the discussions. Clear
Channel officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chancellor did, however, discuss other transactions, like
strategic partnerships and equity investments, with several
companies, said the person involved in the discussions. The
companies, that person said, included Outdoor Systems Inc., the Fox
Entertainment Group of News Corp., the NBC unit of General Electric
Co., Walt Disney Corp., Liberty Media Group and America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of a deal with Clear Channel, Chancellor was hoping to
find a company that would invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion _ cash
that could be used to pay down some of Chancellor's debt _ in
exchange for a stake in the company. But Chancellor was unable to
attract much interest from potential partners or investors, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for Outdoor Systems, Fox, America Online, Disney
and Liberty declined to comment. Representatives of NBC were
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference call, Chancellor officials that they
expected to save at least $15 million a year in overhead expenses,
in part by getting rid of the company's Gulfstream jet and by
largely disbanding its internal mergers and acquisitions staff. The
executives also said they hoped to have the company's debt upgraded
to investment grade within a year.
</P>
<P>
   And the company will, within a few weeks, outline an Internet
strategy that Hicks said ``will integrate local Web portals
maintained for each of Chancellor's radio stations with various
e-commerce and marketing opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of the acquisition of Lin Television, which is
based in Providence, R.I., came as several analysts and large
Chancellor investors said it appeared increasingly likely that
Chancellor shareholders would reject the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Asset Management, which owns more than 4 million
Chancellor shares, had already voted against the deal. ``The No. 1
concern was: I bought Chancellor for radio, and radio is a better
business than television; why do I want to vote for something that
dilutes my interest in radio?'' said Thomas Maguire, manager of the
Safeco Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and large shareholders said that a sale to Clear
Channel remained a possibility, noting that Chancellor executives
disclosed that some companies they had talked to had ``indicated
they may want to propose a strategic transaction in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that Chancellor remained a good value in
its own right, given how its stock is priced in comparison with
others in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   William Meyers, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens,
said that Chancellor traded at about 15 times estimated 1999
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
while Clear Channel and Infinity Broadcasting Corp., another big
radio company, both traded at about 20 to 22 times 1999 earnings,
Meyers said.

BRUINS ALREADY START ON NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One season is over, another just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   It's the season of skill development and lonely hours in the
gym, practicing jumpers, honing footwork and improving
ballhandling. UCLA's diligence this spring and summer will help
determine its performance next March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players are made over the summer,'' Bruins forward Sean
Farnham said. ``We all have to get better individually. Everybody
needs to work on their jump shots, their strength and certain
aspects of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches will provide each player with a daily workout
designed to improve weaknesses. Ray Young will concentrate on
dribbling with his left hand, for instance, and Ryan Bailey will
work on his defensive footwork. Jerome Moiso must get stronger and
tougher. Earl Watson must improve his ballhandling and decisions in
the open court.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also will participate in pickup games with NBA
players at the Men's Gym. The games are an invaluable experience if
they avoid the bad habits that typically form in ragged settings _
habits that are not broken when the season arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Watson threw wild passes last summer, wild passes in December
and wild passes last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the pickup games) are just a huge positive,'' coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ How good in 2000?: If sophomore guard Baron Davis returns,
the Bruins will be favored to win the Pac-10 and be a popular pick
for the Final Four. Even if he doesn't, they'll have eight of their
top nine scorers back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a different team,'' Lavin said. ``We won't be the
prohibitive favorite. People will look at us like a top-15 team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Performance review: Asked to assess the season and the
coaching staff's performance, Lavin said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it was a successful season with a disappointing
finish. It would have been nice to have beaten Detroit and gotten a
game against Ohio State, where the tempo would have been more
favorable. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to put in place this year was that the players
understand the importance of working hard. If they did one thing
well, it was that they competed very hard. There were times we
didn't play smart, times we didn't hit free throws or 3-pointers,
but we played extremely hard. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I did at this time last year. Even though
we had gone to the Sweet 16, I didn't feel as successful as I do
now. You're supposed to be depressed after you lose in the first
round. But because there are so many things I like about this team
and so many reasons to be excited about the future, that's why this
feels different than (after first-round losses to) Princeton, Penn
State or Tulsa.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More roulette?: As for his chaotic rotation _ caused in part
by injuries and disciplinary issues _ Lavin said he plans to use as
many players as possible next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be similar to Duke, something like Kentucky with
(two units of five players),'' he said. ``They've shown when you
have 10 guys who can really play, you can wear opponents down. If
we have 10 capable of playing, we'll use 10. If we have six, like
last year, we'll go with six.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: UCLA lost one of its top recruits last
week when Alameda power forward Justin Davis committed to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are actively pursuing JaRon Rush's brother, Kareem, a
shooting guard from Kansas City, and Carlos Boozer, a forward from
Juneau, Alaska, considered the best senior prospect in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Rush has narrowed his choices to UCLA and Missouri. Boozer is
considering UCLA, Duke and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Davis departs, the Bruins will have 12 players
returning and four scholarships available.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't sign anybody, it would still be OK,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gadzuric update: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric is recovering
steadily from February knee surgery and hopes to return to the
court by early summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start rehab in a couple weeks,'' he said. ``I think I'll be
ready by June or July.''

CHAFEE BECOMES 2ND GOP SENATOR TO RULE OUT RE-ELECTION BID
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., R.I., N.Y., Nev., N.J.) (fb)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the courtly
Republican who is one of his party's dwindling band of Senate
moderates, announced on Monday that he would not seek a fifth term.
His decision put another Senate seat up for grabs in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this 44 years and that's a pretty good run,''
said Chafee, 76, a Marine veteran of Guadalcanal who began his
career in public office in the Rhode Island House of
Representatives in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that I'm not going away mad or
disillusioned or upset with the Senate,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``I think it's a great place.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 55-45 seat edge in the Senate. But they will
be defending 19 seats next year compared with only 14 for the
Democrats. Chafee is the second Republican to announce retirement
plans in recent weeks, but his party is expected to have a much
harder time holding his seat than that of the other Republican,
Sen. Connie Mack of Florida, who set off a political free-for-all
with his announcement earlier this month that he would step down in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rhode Island has a Republican governor, the state is
overwhelmingly Democratic, with just 8 percent of its voters
registered as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a competitive state politically,'' said Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``I think people are starting to
recognize what many of us in the Democratic caucus have understood
for some time. There's a real chance that there will be a
Democratic majority in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Senate Democrats _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Richard Bryan of Nevada _ have
also announced that they will not seek re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The scion of a prominent Rhode Island family, Chafee has been a
steadfast moderate in a party whose ranks in the Senate have become
increasingly conservative. He has played a major role in drafting a
generation of environmental laws as the ranking Republican on the
Environment and Public Works Committee and then as the committee's
chairman. He has also put his stamp on health care policy. On
Monday he mentioned a raft of environmental measures and ``the
extension of Medicaid for low income children'' as his proudest
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee won a Senate leadership post as Republican conference
chairman in 1984 but lost it six years later, in part because of
his breaks with party orthodoxy. He favors abortion rights, and he
was one of the Republicans who voted last month against convicting
President Clinton on impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he said Monday, ``it was perfectly justifiable, the
vote I took. I didn't have second thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was among many political figures who called Chafee on
Monday to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he did have some regrets about leaving behind
the small group of moderate Republicans like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of hate to leave them high and dry,'' he said. ``I
just think these things will go in cycles. Others will come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee's son, Lincoln, the mayor of Warwick, is considered a
possible Republican contender for his father's seat. The list of
possible Democratic candidates includes James Langevin, the Rhode
Island secretary of state; Rep. Bob Weygand; Myrth York, who has
lost two governor's races to Lincoln C. Almond, and Richard Licht,
a former lieutenant governor who lost to Chafee in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, who recently became the chairman of the
House Democrats' re-election effort, will not seek the seat, said a
spokesman, Larry Berman.

MARINES DROP HOMICIDE CHARGE AGAINST NAVIGATOR IN FATAL GONDOLA
ACCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Marine Corps dropped manslaughter and homicide
charges Monday against the navigator of the EA-6b Prowler that hit
a gondola cable in the Italian Alps last year, saying it would be
``unreasonable'' to proceed after the pilot was acquitted of the
same charges. But the Corps said both officers will be
court-martialed on charges of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, testified at his
court-martial that he lent his home video camera to his navigator,
Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, who used it to tape an early portion of
the flight, before the accident that killed 20 people in the
gondola car at Mount Cermis.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby testified that after he piloted the damaged plane back to
an air base in Aviano, he removed the tape from the camera and
replaced it with a blank tape and left the camera in the cockpit.
He later gave the tape to Schweitzer, Ashby testified.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer has not said what he did with the tape. His civilian
lawyer, David Beck, would not discuss that Monday afternoon, but
said, ``If there's no underlying crime, what are you obstructing?''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., will be
heard by a different judge and a new jury, which is supposed to be
selected beginning on Thursday. Beck said he would ask for a delay
to prepare his case.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissal of the more serious charges against Schweitzer was
widely expected after Ashby was acquitted on March 4. But lawyers
for both men had hoped for an adjudication of the obstruction
charges in a less formal setting, possibly involving a fine or loss
of rank.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge, which carries a sentence of up to one
year, is the last remaining count that could result in punishment
for any Marine officer involved in the accident. The squadron
commander has been relieved of command and the squadron director of
safety standardization has had a letter of reprimand inserted in
his record.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge was filed after one crew member in the
rear cockpit of the plane, who was granted immunity, told
prosecutors about the tape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ashby said at his trial that Schweitzer had tried to use the
camera only at the beginning of the flight, before it began its
low-level training route, and that he was not sure that it had
taped anything at all, because Schweitzer was unfamiliar with the
camera and complained that he could not find the catch to push the
trigger and start recording.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby testified that while they were still in Italy, they looked
for another 8-millimeter camera after his was impounded by Italian
authorities, but could not find one and thus could not see what was
on their tape.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had put the tape in the pocket of his flight suit
as other crew members, fearful of an explosion, scrambled from the
crippled jet, Ashby testified, ``I can't say exactly why we did it.
We were wrong, and I admit we were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's announcement, the Corps said that Lt. Gen. Peter
Pace, commanding general of Marine Corps Forces, Atlantic, had
``determined that the seriousness of the charges and the
availability of the evidence warrant that Captain Schweitzer face
charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct
justice at a general court-martial.''

 &HT;    New report at AEA show sheds light on technical jobs in Georgia
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's growth in technology industries has pushed
it into the top 10 states in high-tech employment, new reports by
the American Electronics Association show.
</P>
<P>
   But the state still lags in the number of students it produces
with high-tech degrees. It ranks 19th in that category, according
to the association, the nation's largest trade group representing
electronics and information technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings confirm Georgia has reached a new plateau in its
quest to create high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Georgia of 1990. You've come a long way,''
said AEA president William Archey, who disclosed the rankings
Monday in a speech before the Georgia Economic Developers
Association. ``This is a state with a lot of strength in high
tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Archey pulled the information from reports the electronics
association plans to release over the next two months. California
ranks first in high-tech employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech jobs in Georgia grew 54 percent from 1990 through
1997, to 132,524. That's 46,405 new high-tech jobs in the state
since 1990, when the state ranked 16th, Archey said. The numbers
are based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
</P>
<P>
   Another report shows Atlanta in the nation's top 10 metro areas
in the number of high-tech jobs, Archey said. He didn't have other
details about that top 10 listing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dramatic growth in Georgia's high-tech industry, there's
a wide gap between first and tenth. No. 1 California has about six
times as many high-tech jobs as Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Industry recruiters consider high-tech jobs a plum. In 1997, the
average wage for a high-tech job nationally was $53,145, or 77
percent higher than the average for the rest of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia relies heavily on high-tech workers from other states to
fill jobs here. It is one of only two states in the top 10 of
high-tech employment that was not in the top 10 for producing
high-tech graduates.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia is addressing the discrepancy. While the nation
produced 5 percent fewer high-tech degrees in 1996 than it did in
1990, Georgia did the opposite. It awarded about 6 percent more,
according to Archey.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech research grants have doubled to nearly $1 billion at
major universities in Georgia in the past decade, according to the
Georgia Research Alliance. Venture capital invested in young
companies in the state has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia seems determined to increase its investment in high-tech
education. Legislation backed by Gov. Roy Barnes would add faculty
at state universities with the aim of delivering more graduates
specializing in design of microchips for the telecommunications
industry, a niche believed to be particularly fast growing and high
paying.
</P>
<P>
   The job rankings will find their way into presentations Georgia
makes to high-tech companies, industry recruiters say. Archey said
some companies look at the rankings when considering where they may
grow.
</P>

IN WAKE OF SPY CASE, 2 SENATORS DEMAND LIMITS ON CHINA TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: Also moved in `i' category; see also
CONGRESS-SCIENTIST.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Influential senators demanded Monday that the
Clinton administration limit its trade policies with China and
suspend some scientific exchange programs, reflecting Congressional
anger over President Clinton's response to suspicions that China
stole nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said they
would move to block any effort by the White House to help China
become a member of the World Trade Organization this year,
threatening the administration's leading diplomatic effort to
improve fast-deteriorating relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, urged the president or Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to put a moratorium on visits by
scientists from countries like China and Iran to American national
weapons laboratories, and on reciprocal visits by American
scientists to foreign installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our labs are not as secure as they should be,'' Shelby told
reporters after an hourlong, closed meeting with CIA Director
George Tenet. ``This perhaps is just the tip of an iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department last week dismissed a Taiwan-born
scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory for security breaches,
after the FBI questioned him in connection with the suspected theft
of nuclear weapons designs. Investigators say they believe the
scientist, Wen Ho Lee, gave the Chinese sensitive information on
nuclear detonations during a visit there for a 1988 seminar. Lee
has not been charged with any crime, but is the prime suspect in
the case. China denies any theft and has called the allegations of
nuclear espionage outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House and Senate have criticized the
administration for not tightening security quickly enough and
failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the seriousness
of the possible breaches at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Monday night the administration would work with Congress to resolve
the WTO issue, but the official rejected Shelby's proposal.
``There's no evidence the visitors program has contributed to any
damage to national security,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The double-barreled attack from Capitol Hill came as Richardson
and Tenet, in separate closed briefings, tried to contain the
political fallout from the administration's handling of the spy
case by explaining steps the administration has taken to prevent
any more thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet announced that a retired four-star admiral, David
Jeremiah, will head an independent panel of experts to review the
possible harm to national security that resulted from suspected
thefts that took place in the 1980s and that were discovered by
nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos in 1995. Admiral Jeremiah is
expected to report by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the administration stepped up its defense of its
response to the spy case, the White House took a blow on its trade
policy with China. The warning from Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, and Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Commerce Committee, was issued in a letter sent to all senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations,
espionage and possible technology transfers,'' they wrote,
``suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter
the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, in Beijing, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright assured China's leaders that the question of whether China
was ready to enter the WTO _ a decade-long aspiration for China and
a move that could prove enormously beneficial to the country's
economy _ would be decided solely on commercial grounds. It would
not hinge, she said, on China's human rights record or other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that even
if that is the administration's plan, the atmosphere in Congress is
rapidly changing. And congressional approval will be necessary,
because China's entry would require a major amendment of the law
that allows Congress to review, each year, whether to extend ``most
favored nation'' trading status to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a poisonous issue,'' one of the president's
top economic advisers said the other day. ``And it could blow up
the whole deal, if there is a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Sens. Helms and Hollings, which was reported in
Monday's Wall Street Journal, mirrors conditions that the House
Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, has made and portends
a tough fight for China to join the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as anger in Congress grows on the trade front, there is
greater anxiety over security at Los Alamos and other national
weapons labs. The labs had long resisted FBI and congressional
pressure to tighten their security policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which oversees the labs, has been lax in
its supervision. The department, for example, never filed a
congressionally required annual report in 1998 on the status of
security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over as Energy secretary last fall,
Richardson learned of the urgency of the spy case and reinstated
background checks on all foreign visitors, but it was a move the
FBI had recommended 17 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Intelligence Committee's
ranking Democrat, distanced himself Monday from Shelby's suggestion
of a moratorium noting that ``it's not a situation where foreign
visitors are the problems, it's the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, in a statement Monday night, said
rigorous screening and security measures were in place to insure
foreign visitors could not gain access to classified material.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey expressed concern over security at the laboratories,
even with the improvements Richardson has put in place, including
doubling the counterintelligence budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer have any sense of security that we're doing the
right thing,'' Kerrey told reporters after meeting with Tenet.
``What I have right now is a considerable amount of nervousness
over our counterintelligence efforts and their effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans pounced on the spy case as evidence that
the administration's policy of engaging China turned a blind eye to
national security, a top Republican analyst, William Kristol,
accused congressional Republicans of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have largely supported the president and Sandy
Berger on engagement and trade above all else in China,'' Kristol
said Monday, referring to the president's national security
adviser, Samuel Berger. ``Ultimately, it looks like, hey, something
hit the headlines and let's take advantage of it.''

AFRICAN EXPELLED FROM IOC LOBBIES FOR HIS REINSTATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The clubbiness of the International
Olympic Committee was evident Monday when the delegate accused of
receiving the most illicit favors from Salt Lake City Olympic
organizers checked into the same hotel as the members who will vote
on his expulsion and sauntered through the lobby, shaking their
hands and kissing them on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegate, Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, was not
in such an accommodating mood toward the IOC's internal
investigation, which ousted him for receiving more than $250,000 in
travel, medical benefits and extravagant gifts. Ganga denied any
wrongdoing and said that if he broke any rules, the rules should be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that his ouster was politically motivated by
investigators who, like Ganga, would like to succeed Juan Antonio
Samaranch as president of the IOC. Ganga said he was also facing
retribution because he organized the African boycott of the 1976
Summer Olympics after a New Zealand rugby team toured South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga also questioned the integrity of the leader of the IOC's
investigation, accused the committee of a double standard in
ousting only Third World delegates and of trying to ``exclude
Africa from the center of decision-making in world sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's future may rest on Ganga's future. If Ganga's
expulsion in January is not ratified by two-thirds of the entire
IOC assembly on Wednesday, many believe that Samaranch will have
essentially received a vote of no confidence and that he will have
no choice but to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Another IOC member who could face the same fate as Ganga is Kim
Un Yong of South Korea, the highest-ranking delegate to be
implicated in the Salt Lake City scandal. Kim has been accused of
arranging jobs for his daughter and son through the Salt Lake City
bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   When he was given a warning instead of expulsion last week, the
IOC was accused of having a double standard in disciplining
members. The investigation of Kim continues, however, and he may
face a vote of expulsion on Wednesday, IOC officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga defended Kim, saying that his only mistake was in aspiring
to succeed Samaranch and that Kim's scrutiny was also politically
motivated. ``They are looking for lice even though his head is
clean shaven,'' Ganga said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC received further embarrassment Monday when an
independent audit sought by Sydney, Australia, on its bid for the
2000 Summer Games alleged that 16 delegates had received improper
gifts, benefits or trips, including 11 who were not previously
mentioned in investigations of Salt Lake City's successful bid on
the 2002 Winter Games. The audit came six weeks after the IOC
cleared the Sydney bid without sending anyone to Australia to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five delegates _ nearly one-third of the IOC assembly _
have been linked by investigators to improprieties in Salt Lake
City and Sydney. Tom Sheridan, who conducted the independent audit
of Sydney's bid, said the IOC guidelines governing the bidding
process were ambiguous, unworkable and ``had fallen into
disrepute.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Phil Coles, an IOC member from Australia, was the only delegate
accused of both offering and receiving improper favors. He has been
accused by a Salt Lake City ethics panel of repeatedly violating
travel guidelines. The independent Sydney audit accused him of
improperly paying the travel expenses of a Danish delegate and his
wife to the 1993 French Open.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has struggled to explain why Coles merited a warning
instead of expulsion, and Richard W. Pound, who heads the
committee's investigations, was criticized for excessive chumminess
when he had dinner with Coles while investigating his behavior.
There is growing pressure in Australia on Coles to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one more than Ganga epitomizes the ethical blurriness
that exists in the IOC Ganga denied accusations that he and his
family had run up huge bid committee credit card bills and said he
had offered to pay for medical care for hepatitis, even producing a
letter from a Utah doctor that seemed to support his claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Ganga did admit that his wife, Eugenie, had received free
cosmetic surgery and that his mother-in-law had received a free
knee replacement, flying from Paris to Salt Lake City on a ticket
provided by the bid committee. Asked if that was proper, Ganga
said: ``The laws are made by man. It is not the laws that make the
man. If you make the laws and cannot adapt them to different
situations, the laws are bad and must be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga questioned whether Pound should lead the Salt Lake City
investigation, given that he received a genealogy study from the
Mormon Church, which is based in Utah; such a study might cost
$40,000 for an average person. Pound defended himself, saying the
study was presented two years after Salt Lake City won the Games.
Ganga's expulsion was based on facts, not politics, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a case with bad facts, you attack the law,'' Pound
said of Ganga. ``If you have a case with bad law, you attack the
facts. If you have a case with bad facts and bad law, you attack
the prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga was known by staffers in Utah for continually asking for
favors.
</P>
<P>
   Support for him among African delegates has been lukewarm. ``I
don't support people who are guilty,'' said Sam Ramsamy of South
Africa. Even Ganga's longtime friends, like LeRoy T. Walker, former
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, have distanced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed the handshake from palms together to palms up _
what's in it for me,'' Walker said.

   DOW APPROACHES 10,000 AS STOCKS SET RECORDS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rose sharply, swept higher by a couple of big
merger announcements, enthusiastic buying of technology shares and
an optimistic earnings forecast from UAL, the company that operates
United Airlines. The advance pushed two major market measures _ the
Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index _ to records. The Dow closed at 9,958.77, up 82.42 points,
and the S.&AMP;P. closed up 12.67 at 1,307.26. The Nasdaq composite
index failed to set a new high but was the session's
best-performing index.

   UAL, the parent of United Airlines, said that strong domestic
sales and the spillover from last month's sickout by pilots at
rival American Airlines would help lift its earnings above Wall
Street estimates. The announcement, which came on the heels of the
industry's second broad fare increase this year, sent airline
stocks soaring. UAL rose $6.6875, or nearly 10 percent, to $73.75.

 &HT;    Bulldogs seeking backup at quarterback for Carter
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ As Georgia begins spring practice today, perhaps
no position on the Bulldogs' roster is more solid than quarterback,
where Quincy Carter returns after becoming conference and national
freshman of the year last season.
</P>
<P>
   Because of offseason developments, however, the position
suddenly has become one of great focus this spring. Georgia has had
three quarterbacks transfer after Carter's tremendous success _
redshirt freshmen Nate Hybl and Daniel Cobb, and junior Mike Usry.
As a result, developing depth is of paramount importance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs know that fifth-year senior Jon England will be
available, giving them an experienced backup who knows the system
and can fill in if Carter is injured. But Jan. 5 shoulder surgery
will cause England to miss spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves freshman Regan Torbert as the only quarterback in
camp. The Bulldogs may also try freshman Terrence Edwards and
sophomore flanker Labrone Mitchell as backup candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four other questions the Bulldogs hope to answer during
spring drills:
</P>
<P>
   1. Is there a tailback in the house?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Donnan never found a star tailback last year,
depending instead on the solid, no-nonsense work of now-graduated
senior Olandis Gary.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that they have plenty of candidates in camp in
Robert Arnaud, Patrick Pass and Jasper Sanks, none of whom
distinguished themselves last season despite ample opportunities.
Georgia will look for one to emerge this spring, before the arrival
of the freshmen in August.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who will replace offensive tackles?
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were hurt by the loss of Matt Stinchomb and Chris
Terry, both of whom are expected to be high NFL draft choices in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the other five offensive line starters return, along
with part-time starter Reggie Stargill. The Bulldogs need senior
Kelvin Williams or one of five redshirt freshmen to emerge at
tackle, but some reshuffling could be in order.
</P>
<P>
   3. What about the logjam at linebacker?
</P>
<P>
   In his boldest position change of the offseason, Donnan moved
Adrian Hollingshed and Dustin Luckie, last year's starters at
middle linebacker, to defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   The move says that the Bulldogs are desperate to improve their
pass rush and that they have a lot of confidence in the abilities
of Champ's brother, sophomore Boss Bailey, and Will Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the team expects contributions from junior college
transfer Kendra Bell, and redshirt freshmen Tony Gilbert and Kawika
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   4. Can anyone fill Champ Bailey's cleats?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, but the Bulldogs think they can recover from his
loss, at least on defense.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Georgia lost its top four receivers in wideouts
Bailey and Tony Small, and tight ends Larry Brown and Jermaine
Wiggins. Juniors Michael Green and Thad Parker will move up, and
Edwards will get a good look. But the real answers will come his
summer, in freshmen Reggie Brown and Durrell Robinson.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen colleges and universities, including Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Duke and Notre Dame, announced on Monday that they would
be the first to join a new factory-monitoring association that the
White House supports in an effort to ensure that apparel carrying
their names is not made in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to help attract more companies and colleges
to the group, the Fair Labor Association, which has established a
code of conduct for apparel factories and a program to monitor them
for violations, association members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great boost for the Fair Labor Association,'' said
Michael Posner, a member of the association and executive director
of the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights. ``They're intellectual
centers. Their participation in this process will strengthen the
association and broaden the discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The association is made up of several human rights groups and
seven prominent manufacturers, including Reebok International Ltd.,
Nike Inc. and Liz Claiborne Inc. It grew out of the White House
Apparel Industry Partnership, a three-year-old effort against
sweatshops. The association hopes to begin its monitoring program
soon and to attract more corporate members.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at several colleges acknowledged that their decision
to join the association was partly a response to students who
demanded that companies licensed to produce apparel with their
institution's name not use sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   The association has encountered problems attracting corporate
members, partly because many apparel companies do not want to risk
the embarrassment of having monitors uncover factory violations and
do not want to absorb the cost of paying for monitors and complying
with its code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for many companies is, when is it time to get
involved?'' said Roberta Karp, co-chairwoman of the association and
general counsel at Liz Claiborne. ``I'd say the time is now. The
universities are joining. Their licensees will have to follow suit.
Many of the licensees are major apparel companies, and other
companies will see this has momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's code of conduct spells out numerous requirements,
including a minimum age for apparel workers and allowing the right
to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Several students interviewed said the colleges' decision to join
the association was a step in the right direction, but that the
association's code of conduct did not go far enough. They faulted
the code for not requiring that all factories pay a living wage and
because outside monitors will inspect only 10 percent of a
company's factories each year.
</P>
<P>
   The other colleges and universities joining the association are
Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Florida State, Marymount,
Rutgers, Smith, Tufts, Wellesley, the University of Arizona and the
University of Pennsylvania.

CLINTON TO SEEK DEBT FORGIVENESS FOR POOREST NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will propose extensive debt
forgiveness on Tuesday for some of the poorest nations, agreeing to
relieve repayment obligations of some countries in Africa and other
regions if they enact broad reforms, administration officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to announce the program during a meeting here of
African finance and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will require approval by Congress, other donor nations
and multinational institutions like the International Monetary
Fund. Those negotiations could easily take a year or more. The fund
has traditionally been reluctant to endorse such programs for fear
they breed expectations among borrowing nations that if they wait
long enough, they will not have to repay their loans.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure has grown to provide relief to countries that must
commit huge portions of their budgets to pay back debts, which
leaves very little for education, health care or basic services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, one senior official said, would ``provide
deep relief earlier to a broader range of countries in ways that
help promote true economic reform.''
</P>
<P>
   While details are vague, the plan would expand the number of
countries that could benefit from debt forgiveness to nearly 50,
from 41. Countries like Ghana, Congo, Laos and Honduras could all
benefit, but only if they met certain economic targets, which have
yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the United States was willing to forgive
debts of more than $3 billion if other donors _ who are owed nearly
$70 billion more _ agreed. But the impact on the federal budget,
the White House said, would be less than $200 million. While the
accounting is complex, most of the debts have already been written
off as virtually uncollectable, so the added cost to the government
of full forgiveness is considered relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has often talked about debt forgiveness
for countries on the road to reform, it has never before proposed a
broad change in the rules. Congress has often been reluctant to
finance aid programs for the poorest nations, and it is unclear
whether Clinton has the political influence to persuade Congress to
rewrite the rules, even at relatively little cost to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proposal calls on the IMF to sell part of its gold
reserves, which were given to it more than 50 years ago when the
fund and the World Bank were formed. Interest generated from
investing the proceeds of that sale could be used to pay off some
of the money owed to the fund. The United States is the most
influential voice in the fund, but past calls for a sale of the
gold have been in vain.

ONE OF THE TEAMS IN GENOME-MAP RACE SETS EARLIER DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The date for completing the first draft of the human genome, the
three billion units of DNA held in every human cell, has been moved
up to the spring of 2000, the publicly financed consortium
sponsoring the work announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If met, the new date set by the consortium _ the National
Institutes of Health, the Energy Department and the Wellcome Trust
of London _ could allow the public venture to claim some measure of
victory over its commercial rival, Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md.
Celera, headed by Dr. J. Craig Venter, has said it will produce a
substantially complete, accurate human genome sequence by the end
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said in response to Monday's development that he had not
changed his goals and that the public consortium's announcement had
``nothing to do with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is projected cost, projected timetables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the formation of Celera last May by Perkin-Elmer Corp., an
instrument-making company based in Norwalk, Conn., the public
consortium had aimed to finish the complete genome by 2005. Then,
in the fall, the consortium said it could crank out a first draft
of the genome by December 2001. The new target cuts even that
ambitious goal by some 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The genome sequence is expected to become the nucleus of
medicine, because it represents the programming for the human
organism. Most diseases are caused to varying extents by bugs in
this programming, which are the mutations that affect each
individual's genetic endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Participants on both the public and private teams believe that
the intense competition between them has forced faster progress
than if either team were working by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose that pressure, we wouldn't be seeing such good
reciprocity between the public and private efforts,'' said Dr.
Richard Gibbs, head of the sequencing center at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston, who works with the consortium's team.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the pressure that Celera's mere existence has
created for the genome efforts of the National Institutes of
Health, Dr. Norton Zinder, biologist at Rockefeller University and
a member of Celera's board, said, ``The Venter-Hunkapiller
initiative will cause the DNA of the human genome to be made
available from the NIH, without Celera's having to do a line of
sequence.'' Dr. Michael W. Hunkapiller is the Perkin-Elmer
executive responsible for design of the company's widely used DNA
sequencing machines.
</P>
<P>
   The draft that the consortium says it can complete by the spring
of next year is intended to reflect all human genes, estimated to
number about 100,000, and most of the long intervening stretches of
DNA that lie between them. Much of the genome is in the form of
repetitive sequences that are hard to decipher and have no known
functional significance because they are not part of the genes.
Such regions that are not completed now will be done later.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 percent of the genome will be sequenced by the
national institutes' university-based centers, 10 percent by the
Energy Department's laboratories, and 33 percent by the Sanger
Center near Cambridge, England.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's share of the human genome project was
intended to cost $3 billion over 15 years. But Dr. Francis Collins,
director of the institutes' part of the project, said the actual
amount spent on production-scale sequencing would be much less. He
expects the international consortium's cost of preparing the draft
sequence to be $280 million or less, comparable with Celera's
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the national institutes have financed eight
university-based centers to generate human DNA data. But Collins
announced on Monday that new money would be focused on the three
most productive centers, those headed by Dr. Robert Waterston at
the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Dr. Eric
Lander at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and Gibbs at
the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus may give the institutes' decentralized system a
helpful edge in competing with the monolithic but nimble Celera.
Lander said economies of scale were readily apparent in centers
that had 100 of the latest-model DNA sequencing machines, a
capacity that is to be reached soon by the Sanger Center,
Washington University's and his own.
</P>
<P>
   An early test of strength may come with Celera's pilot project,
that of sequencing the entire genome of the Drosophila fruit fly, a
standard laboratory organism. Venter, Celera's chief, said he hoped
to complete the sequence in three to six months.

DINKINS, RANGEL ARRESTED IN PROTEST OVER POLICE SHOOTING

 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Former Mayor David Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel and a
dozen others were arrested Monday as they staged a protest at
Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan over the police killing last
month of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, along with acts of civil disobedience
intended to provoke arrests, have become weekday ritual at One
Police Plaza since last Tuesday, when the Rev. Al Sharpton led the
first group of 12 protesters in a sit-in that ended with their
arrests. Sharpton, who was also arrested Monday, has vowed to
continue the protests each day until the four officers involved in
the Diallo shooting are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens, and two City
Council members, Margarita Lopez and Bill Perkins, both of
Manhattan, were also among those arrested Monday and charged with
criminal trespassing after they entered Police Headquarters and
refused a request to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the police appeared reluctant to arrest Dinkins and
the others. The protesters at first knelt in front of the entrance
to Police Headquarters, an act that had led to the arrest of
earlier protesters on charges of disorderly conduct. But officers
declined to intervene, prompting Monday's protesters to go a step
further and enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in the lobby waiting to be arrested, Dinkins
criticized the Giuliani administration, saying it tolerated acts of
police misconduct as the price for lowering the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this administration is dangerously close to
having adopted a philosophy that the ends justify the means,'' he
said. ``I think that if the street unit were to shake down 10
people and find one dirty, they would think that the other nine
whose civil and human rights were violated, that that was OK, that
that justified it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins was referring to the street crimes unit whose officers
were hunting for a rapist on Feb. 4 when they shot and killed
Diallo, an unarmed street peddler with no criminal record, in the
lobby of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   After Dinkins stood in a circle with the other protesters and
joined arms, a police officer, Lt. Kevin Mullen, addressed the
crowd through a megaphone, telling the people that they faced
arrest if they did not leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have an opportunity to leave,'' he said, waiting a
minute. When nothing happened, he said, ``Now that you have refused
to leave, I'm ordering that you be placed under arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor that
can carry a more severe penalty than disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   One by one they were asked to put their hands behind their
backs, and they were put in plastic handcuffs known as flex-cuffs.
A brief discussion followed among police officials, who considered
taking the protesters out a back door, away from the photographers
waiting outside the front door. The officials decided not to, and
Dinkins and the other handcuffed protesters were led out the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said that police
procedure requires officers to handcuff the people they arrest with
their hands behind their backs, except in extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the protests.

 Kaiser Faces Suit Over Membership Drive
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A consumer group backed by Ralph Nader is filing a novel lawsuit
today that alleges Kaiser-Permanente made false advertising claims
about its quality of care to recruit new members.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which will be filed in California Superior Court in
San Francisco, alleges that Kaiser was supposedly forcing doctors
to cut costs at the same it was spending $60 million a year to
attract new members with ads claiming that doctors, not
administrators, were in charge of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a lie, I don't know what is,'' said Jamie Court,
with Consumer's for Quality Care, a Santa Monica group that is
affiliated with Nader. The case is being handled by the San Diego
law firm of Milberg Weiss, which has specialized in filing class
action lawsuits against high-tech firms for alleged stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials, who have not yet seen the suit, reacted
angrily to the charges. ``Anyone can file a lawsuit,'' said Francis
J. Crosson, executive director of the Permanente Federation, the
partnership that governs the 10,000 doctors who practice at Kaiser
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, doctors are in charge of care at Kaiser-Permanente,''
Crosson said. ``This outrageous lawsuit attacks the hard-earned
reputation of thousands of Kaiser-Permanente physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer and health industry groups, the lawsuit is
apparently the first of its kind involving allegations of
misleading advertising by an HMO in a membership drive. In this
case, the suit charges that Kaiser has recruited 500,000 new
members since it launched its $60-million-a-year ad campaign in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which allegedly represented a 700 percent increase
over Kaiser's 1992 ad spending, used television and other media to
get across the message that, as one ad said: ``At Kaiser-Permanente
your medical care is between you and your doctor, with no
interference from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the suit will allege, while Kaiser was advertising
noninterference, its administrators were reducing the HMO's medical
budget and talking about other cost-cutting steps.
</P>
<P>
   The suit cites two incidents to support the allegations. The
first is a December 1995 budget-cutting speech allegedly given by
Kaiser official Dr. John Vogt.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Vogt allegedly implied that Kaiser had
changed the protocol that doctors follow when deciding when to send
a patient to the hospital after complaints about chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit quotes Vogt as saying ``The reason we're revising
that protocol now is because our (hospital) utilization exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cites a Jan. 26, 1996, e-mail from 56 Kaiser
doctors who allegedly complained about ``drastic cost-cutting and
sweeping changes ... that negatively affect patients and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of KAISER16 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Court said attorneys are also prepared to call several unnamed
Kaiser doctors as ``expert witnesses'' to substantiate allegations
that executives interfered with patient-care decisions by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is filed on behalf of new Kaiser members who were
supposedly wronged by the allegedly misleading ads. It seeks
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, an immediate halt to
Kaiser's current ad campaign and corrective advertising to set the
record straight.

BANK DEAL UNLIKELY TO SPUR OTHER MERGERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Calif.) (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, two large banks have merged. Once again, speculation
is rampant about which banks will rush to the altar next.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleet Financial Group's proposed $16 billion acquisition of
the BankBoston Corp., while creating a powerhouse in New England,
would not likely spur a new round of megamergers similar to the
gargantuan deals of last year, bank advisers and analysts said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even with a market capitalization of about $40 billion
and $180 billion in assets, the new bank _ to be named the Fleet
Boston Corp. _ would still lack the size needed to ensure that
Boston will remain home to a major bank in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   A historic round of mergers during the last few years has split
the banking industry into two camps, with a handful of big banks _
Citigroup, BankAmerica, Chase Manhattan, Bank One, First Union and
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. _ in one and thousands of small community banks
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Left out of both are scores of midsized banks that missed
joining the ranks of the titans but are too big to offer the
specialized handholding that community banks provide clients.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives say that the future of those
midsized banks _ including Keycorp, PNC Bank, USBancorp, National
City, Wachovia and SunTrust Banks _ will be as acquisition targets
or as participants in smaller mergers that merely delay their
eventual acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there's been major consolidation and the top 10 banks
will have the majority of the assets,'' said Terrence Murray,
Fleet's chief executive, in a telephone interview on Monday. ``And
the nature of services and demands on the upper tier of banks
continues to get more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is to be Fleet Boston's chief executive for the first two
years, to be succeeded by Charles K. Gifford, the chairman and
chief executive of BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even among the handful of giants atop the banking industry,
analysts say, there will be another eventual winnowing. Bank One,
First Union, Wells Fargo and Fleet all have at least one more deal
ahead of them involving the changing of names, location and
management, either as acquirers or acquirees.
</P>
<P>
   The banks that survive the last hurrah of banking mergers within
the upper echelon will be those that execute their current mergers
successfully _ no small feat given that successful mergers are as
much an art as a science.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, once regarded as among the most skillfully managed
banks in the nation, botched its acquisition of First Interstate a
few years ago, setting up the bank for a takeover by the Norwest
Corp. last year. Wells kept its name but its senior management
largely stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   First Union, until recently considered one of the industry's
most adept acquirers, is slashing as many as 7,000 jobs to meet
expense goals tied to overly rich takeovers, at the same time that
some of its business lines are slowing. The bank has recently
disclosed an inability to meet both first-quarter and
second-quarter earnings estimates; its stock now suffers from these
merger-related woes, trading well below its 52-week high of
$65.9375. It closed at $52 on Monday, down $1.125.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, still one of the top banks in the country, has been
awash in merger speculation because it has yet to deliver on the
financial promises it made when it began transforming itself into
an investment bank in the late 1980s. Its stock has also been weak.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chase has quietly pulled off two of the
biggest mergers in banking and its stock has soared, leaving it
well set for a shopping spree.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chase, which had serious merger discussions with the Credit
Suisse Group last year, is hungry for an equity operation and has
courted such brokerage firms as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Bank advisers
say Chase may now try to achieve its goals by snapping up the Paine
Webber Group and Lehman Brothers Holdings in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston plan to cut as many as 5,000 of about
60,000 jobs at the combined bank and a substantial number of those
cuts will involve layoffs. The banks said that cuts are required
for Fleet Boston to reach financial goals and overcome regulatory
hurdles. But a demoralized work force, or understaffed service
operations, could undermine the merger's potential success.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, investors showed a lack of enthusiasm for the
deal on Monday. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Fleet's
shares sank $2.5625, or 5.7 percent, to $42.1875, while
BankBoston's shares rose only 12.5 cents, to $47.0625, less than
the $53 a share Fleet has offered to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The architecture of these deals is pretty clear now,'' said
Don Kerr, a senior vice president with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton, a
consulting firm. ``Who wins and who loses within the top tier will
ultimately be determined by which banks trip up or make mistakes
and then get punished by the stock market.''

   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I'm tempted to lecture you on morality, but I won't,
because I think you know everything I might say.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that you probably can't count on your
accountant to keep your secret. Your conversations with the
accountant qualify as privileged communications only if the IRS
socks you with a civil suit _ not in a criminal action. And if the
agency thinks you deliberately evaded taxes, it may very well bring
a criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   You may think you can play it safe by using a lawyer as an
intermediary in dealing with your accountant _ or by simply dealing
with a tax lawyer. But that won't work either, because there is no
lawyer/client protection in a criminal case when it comes to
working papers or conversations that go into preparing a tax
return. They must be disclosed if the IRS requests them.
</P>
<P>
   You also must bear in mind that whoever paid you the money
already knows about your hidden income.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't mention how much money is involved _ but is your
potential saving from tax evasion worth the burden on your
conscience? How much is peace of mind worth to you?
</P>
<P>
   Oops, I promised not to lecture.
</P>
<P>
   My bottom line advice is borrowed from a famous vaudeville
routine: ``Pay the $2.''
</P>
<P>
   Market, Limit Orders
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly do discount brokers do once you ask them to sell
your stock? Do they watch the prices go up and down until they
think they have the best possible price? Or do they just sell it
willy-nilly?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It all depends on you. If you ask a discount broker _ or
any other broker _ to sell stock for you, you are expected to make
one of two basic choices.
</P>
<P>
   You can enter a ``market order,'' in which case your broker will
sell the stock immediately at the best available price.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you can enter a ``limit order,'' in which you specify the
lowest price you will accept for your shares. For example, if the
market currently prices the stock at $50 per share, you might tell
your broker to sell your shares for $52 per share or more. However,
in that case you might not sell the shares quickly.
</P>
<P>
   You also can place limit orders on the buy side, specifying the
highest price at which you will buy a stock.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG (72753 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Limit orders can be placed for one day only, or you can instruct
your broker that the order is ``good until canceled.'' If the trade
isn't transacted on the day you place the order, the order will
carry over from day to day until a trade is made on your terms, or
until you cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``good until canceled'' is slightly misleading, because
most brokers expect you to refresh your GTC orders, typically every
month or two. You should keep close tabs on this and renew your
broker-canceled GTC orders promptly if you still want to buy or
sell the stock at the price you specified.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Lost Shares
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own 16 shares of a blue-chip stock, but I only can find a
certificate for eight shares. Evidently the company split the stock
two shares for one, but I misplaced one of the certificates. How do
I go about getting my other shares? Also, once I get my shares, I
want to sell them. Do I need a broker for that? I don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Telephone your company's headquarters and ask for the
investor relations department. Explain your plight and the people
in that department will explain how to replace your missing
certificate. You may have to pay a fee.
</P>
<P>
   While you have them on the line, ask whether the company buys
back stock from shareholders. Many do, and you might be able to
sell the shares that way, with little or no commission.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you should get a broker to sell your stock.
</P>
<P>
   If you only plan to make this one transaction, you might as well
open an account with one of the deep-discount online brokers. A few
charge $10 or less per trade. However, some require you to deposit
substantial amounts of stock or cash before you can open the
account. They spell out their ground rules on their Internet Web
sites.

 Federal, state surpluses yield tax breaks for investors,  students,
parents, renters 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
If you are one of the 80 million Americans who haven't yet filed an
income-tax return for 1998, you may find the normally
nerve-jangling task less costly than you expected.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Congress and the California Legislature passed
laws last year that offer many taxpayers substantial tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, the legislators take away at least as much as
they give in tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a rare exception, thanks to the federal and state
budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   If those surpluses are sustained in the future, we could soon
see another wave of benign tax legislation, predicts Ali Farhat, a
certified public accountant with Coopers &AMP; Lybrand in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The principal beneficiaries of the new federal tax rules include
parents of children younger than 17, people who realized capital
gains on sales of securities or other assets, people who paid
tuition to colleges and graduate schools, people who have student
loans outstanding and people with Individual Retirement Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Many taxpayers will be surprised to learn that they now can
deduct interest paid on their student loans and can buy precious
metals for their IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislators helped large families last year by greatly
increasing the tax credit for dependents. They also aided renters
by restoring the renter's credit.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the major changes.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CHILD TAX CREDIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  For 1998, you are entitled to a $400 credit on your federal
return for each child under age 17 that you claim as a dependent.
The new credit reduces your income tax dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Someone with two dependents younger than 17 _ which might
include children, grandchildren, step-children and foster children
_ would get an $800 benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, the credit rises to $500 per child starting this
year.
</P>
<P>
   If you have one or two qualifying dependents, your child tax
credit cannot exceed your tax liability. If you have three or more,
you may be able to claim credits exceeding your tax liability,
entitling you to a refund. You can determine this by filling out a
complicated worksheet that comes with your tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   There are income caps on the child tax credit: $110,000 of
adjusted gross income for married couples filing jointly, $55,000
for married people filing separately, and $75,000 for single
people. For every $1,000 of income above that, you lose $50 in
credits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TAXES16 (13603 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  (The new credit does not affect the $2,700-per-person exemption
for each member of your household.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; CAPITAL GAINS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  The holding period required to qualify for long-term
capital-gains tax rates was reduced, across the board, to 12
months. Previously, assets sold after July 29, 1997, had to be held
at least 18 months to qualify as long term.
</P>
<P>
   That's a significant improvement, because the maximum tax rate
on long-term capital gains for people in the 28 percent income
bracket and higher is only 20 percent. Their maximum rate on
short-term capital gains is 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For every $10,000 worth of capital gains, the difference between
long-term and short-term treatment amounts to $800 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For people in the 15 percent bracket _ those with adjusted gross
income no greater than $42,350 on joint returns and $25,350 on
single returns _ the maximum capital-gains tax is 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For short-term capital gains, those taxpayers must pay 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, sales of collectibles _ such as antiques, coins and
sports memorabilia _ do not qualify for the lowest tax rates no
matter how long you hold them, notes Bill Schulte, a certified
public accountant with Burr Pilger &AMP; Mayer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Both long-term and short-term gains on such sales will continue
to be taxed at a maximum of either 28 percent or your regular tax
rate, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; EDUCATION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Many people pursuing post-secondary education can choose from two
new tax credits _ the Hope credit and the Lifetime Learning credit
_ that can be used to offset part of their tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   Because these are credits rather than deductions, they are
subtracted directly from your tax obligation. (Deductions are less
valuable because they are merely used to reduce the amount of your
taxable income.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Hope credit, taxpayers can reduce their tax bills by up
to $1,500 apiece for themselves and for each eligible dependent.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of TAXES16 (13603 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  To be eligible for this credit, students must be a college
freshman or sophomore working on a degree or other academic
credential and must be free of any felony convictions for
possessing or distributing controlled substances. (People convicted
of other types of felonies presumably can claim the credit.)
</P>
<P>
   The maximum credit is equal to 100 percent of the first $1,000
in tuition and fees, plus 50 percent of the next $1,000 _ for each
student.
</P>
<P>
   This benefit is not available to married taxpayers filing
separately.
</P>
<P>
   It is available in full to married taxpayers filing jointly
whose income does not exceed $80,000 and to single taxpayers whose
income does not exceed $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The amount you can deduct decreases in stages as your income
rises above those levels, with the deduction eliminated entirely
for joint filers with $100,000 in income and single filers who earn
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   All expenses paid or incurred in 1998 are eligible for the Hope
credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime Learning credit has the same income limits as the
Hope credit.
</P>
<P>
   It can be used for expenses up to $1,000 per year paid by all
students in your family after June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Hope credit, it is available to students in any year
of study at college or graduate school _ and there is no drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime Learning credit is calculated by taking 20 percent
of the total amount of tuition the taxpayer shells out _ up to a
maximum expense of $5,000 for all family members.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the maximum credit for a family in any given year is
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   You can't use both the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits in the
same year for the same student. But you can use the Hope for one
student and the Lifetime for another.
</P>
<P>
   Students or their parents also can get tax relief by opening an
Education IRA _ another legal innovation that took effect last
year.
</P>
<P>
   You can make nondeductible contributions of $500 per year to an
Education IRA for a child under age 18, provided your income is no
greater than $150,000 filing jointly or $95,000 for singles.
</P>
<P>
   The permissible contribution is reduced as your income exceeds
those levels and phases out completely at $160,000 and $110,000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of TAXES16 (13603 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The investment gains in an Education IRA accumulate tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Money can be withdrawn from an Education IRA without tax or
penalty to pay for the child's tuition, fees, books, supplies and
equipment at a college or graduate school. However, the withdrawal
must not exceed the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Warning: You cannot withdraw money from an Education IRA to pay
a student's expenses in the same year that the student uses either
the Hope or Lifetime Learning credit.
</P>
<P>
   Another warning: Any amount you contribute to an Education IRA
counts against your $2,000 maximum annual IRA contributions for
that year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you contribute the full $500 to an Education
IRA, you cannot contribute more than a total of $1,500 to other
IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also looked kindly upon students who already have
graduated. Many of them now are allowed to deduct from their 1998
income part of the interest they paid &UR;  &LR; last year on their student
loans.
</P>
<P>
   An especially appealing thing about this new rule is that you
can deduct your interest even if you don't itemize your other
deductions. You can add the student-loan deduction to your standard
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   The student-loan deduction can be used only for interest paid
during the first five years in which interest payments are
required.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum deduction for the 1998 tax year is $1,000, but it
moves up to $1,500 for this year and increases $500 more in each of
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   You can take the full deduction if your adjusted gross income is
no greater than $60,000 for married people filing jointly and
$40,000 for singles. The deduction phases out completely at $75,000
and $55,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Starting with the 1998 tax year, IRA holders were permitted to
take money out of their accounts penalty-free before age 591/2 to
pay for a first home or for higher-education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   However, all the money withdrawn from a deductible account, and
earnings withdrawn from a nondeductible account, will be taxed at
the taxpayer's regular rate.
</P>
<P>
   As of last year, IRAs are permitted to invest in gold, silver,
platinum and palladium bullion, and in platinum coins. All those
investments previously were off limits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; STATE TAXES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  On state returns, people who rent rather than own their homes
will save some money, thanks to the restoration of the renter's
credit.
</P>
<P>
   The credit _ subtracted directly from your tax obligation _
amounts to $120 for married couples filing jointly, and $60 for
singles, provided you lived in California during the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   If you lived in California for less than a full year, you can
claim a credit equal to one-12th the maximum amount for each month
of your residency.
</P>
<P>
   The credit cannot be used on joint returns if your adjusted
gross income is $50,000 or more or on single returns if your income
is $25,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with multiple dependents will save big money because
of a substantial boost in an existing state tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   If your adjusted gross income is less than $233,556 (for joint
returns) or $116,777 (for singles), you can reduce your tax
obligation by $253 per dependent on your 1998 return _ up from $68
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a taxpayer with three dependents who is below the
income thresholds would save an additional $555.
</P>
<P>
   However, for every $2,500 by which your income exceeds those
thresholds, your credit for each dependent will be reduced by $12
on joint returns and $6 on single returns.

 Video Card Firm Bets on Voodoo
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
3dfx Interactive, whose Voodoo brand has become synonymous with
high-performance 3-D graphics cards, today is unleashing an all-out
effort to turn its technology into a de facto standard for
mainstream PCs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, 3dfx will
announce a $20 million campaign aimed at bolstering its already
strong retail sales while persuading big PC-makers to put its
technology in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   3dfx's goal is to challenge Canada's ATI Technologies, the
leading seller of graphics cards _ circuit boards that go inside
PCs and provide enhanced video for games, the Internet and
graphics-intensive software.
</P>
<P>
   In girding for the battle, 3dfx of San Jose is changing its
logo, redesigning its Web site and launching a worldwide
advertising blitz using the tag line ``So powerful, it's kind of
ridiculous.'' The campaign will include three television ads
devised by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, the agency known for its
``Got Milk'' commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing push will be accompanied by the introduction of
three new video cards based on Voodoo3, the third generation of the
Voodoo chip technology.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time, 3dfx will make its own cards, using
manufacturing capabilities gained in its pending acquisition of STB
Systems, a maker of video cards. Until now, Voodoo cards were made
under license by other companies, among them Creative Labs and
Diamond Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging in price from $130 to $250, the new cards will offer
both 2-D and 3-D graphics enhancements _ an improvement over
previous high-end Voodoo cards, which were 3-D only.
</P>
<P>
   The new cards could give 3dfx a boost in selling directly to
PC-makers, something it's had trouble doing with its 3-D-only
cards. 3dfx sells to just a few PC-makers, while ATI, whose cards
are both 2-D and 3-D, has contracts with nearly the entire top 20.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ATI controls some 35 percent of the total PC
graphics market, compared to just 6 percent for 3dfx.
</P>
<P>
   In the much smaller retail market _ selling directly to PC
owners _ 3dfx dominates. According to PC Data, 73 percent of
high-performance cards sold in the fourth quarter of last year were
powered by Voodoo chips. And last month, three of the five
top-selling cards were Voodoo-based.
</P>
<P>
   By increasing sales to PC-makers, 3dfx hopes to raise awareness
of its technology _ generally considered the best in the business _
to the point where game developers will routinely optimize new
games to work best on Voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of 3D16 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  That could help establish the technology as a standard. Moreover,
if one or two hot games were written exclusively for Voodoo, ``3dfx
could really have a stranglehold on the market,'' said analyst
Charles Boucher of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers called 3dfx's moves bold but also risky, with
no guarantee of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATI is going to be tough to crack in the PC market,'' said
Mike Feibus of Mercury Research. ``Even if 3dfx gets some design
wins from PC-makers, it's going to pale by comparison to what ATI
is shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is some concern that PC-makers already tired of
having to put ``Intel Inside'' on their systems may balk at the
prospect of promoting the Voodoo brand as well.
</P>
<P>
   Feibus also noted that Creative Labs and Diamond Multimedia plan
to bring out new video cards with non-Voodoo technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamond and Creative aren't going to curl up and die,'' he
said. ``3dfx is going to have competition from two big guys who
used to be its allies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL;

   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL;

   Scope out the course beforehand, says Ilene Sokoloff, who used
to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in
advance so the client understands he's your guest. Have a gift
waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scrimp on anything. If the client needs golf balls, don't
buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a foursome. Invite two other people who will interest or
be of help to your client and who will help keep the conversation
moving, says Rhame. Or let the client bring someone, says Bill
Storer, who runs Business Golf Strategies in Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Pulitano, CEO of Computing Concepts, a computer integrating
company, played with a client who was a purchasing agent, and the
client brought his father, who was a purchasing agent for another
company. ``We picked up another account,'' says Pulitano, who pays
for his employees to attend Storer's seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your
client a team, calling each other partner and working off each
other's success, says Rhame. &QL;

   Remember _ during the game, you're being watched as closely as
you are watching. Storer tells the recent story of a salesman who
made the mistake of drinking during a round and tipped the cart on
a sharp turn. His client fell out and was knocked unconscious.
After recovering, the client didn't stick around to do more
business. The salesman was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Woo, who runs Golf 101, encourages women to play off the
middle tees, where men usually start, instead of the forward tees,
which used to be called the ladies' tees but are now less
chauvinistically referred to as the beginners' tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there trying to build a relationship, you don't
want to be coming in and out of the conversation,'' she says. If
the more difficult drive holds a woman's game back, she should tell
the other players she'll move her ball from where it lands to where
theirs land, to keep the game moving.
</P>
<P>
   If you're playing with someone who plays from the forward tees,
don't sit in the cart and wait for her to tee off, says Rhame.
``Give her the courtesy to get out of the cart, and go stand with
her like she stood with you.'' &QL;

GORE, STILL UNANNOUNCED, MAKES FIRST OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore began laying a
platform Monday for his all-but-announced presidential candidacy,
appealing to both harried suburbanites and more traditional
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered a continuation of President Clinton's policies,
with only minor tinkering. He said, for example, that he wanted to
hire enough teachers to reduce the size of classes in all grades
through high school, not just through eighth grade as Clinton has
proposed. And he wants to make preschool education available in all
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he did little to separate himself from his political
benefactor as he took one more step in his long slow march toward a
presidential candidacy by taking his first official campaign trip,
paid for by his election committee. He is not expected to announce
his candidacy officially until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to build on the wisdom that we've all gained in the
last several years,'' he said at a rally New Hampshire before
flying here, paying homage to the two states that vote the earliest
in the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore put special emphasis on what he calls ``quality-of-life''
issues _ easing traffic congestion, for example _ that some have
ridiculed as unpresidential because they are local issues, but that
Gore defends as integral to strengthening families by creating more
free time. They are also aimed squarely at an important block of
swing voters, especially frazzled parents, who live in the suburbs
and could decide the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who deserves to be our next president is the one
who understands how tired working parents are,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Gore's identification with the Clinton
administration, particularly the nation's economic prosperity, he
seemed quite ambiguous about how strongly to associate himself with
it. He did not mention Clinton by name, and he seemed to want to
create distance by describing not a policy divide but an epochal
divide _ a natural break in the calendar in the year 2000 that
would leave Clinton in the past and put Gore in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the beginning of a new century and a new
millennium,'' Gore said. ``It's the beginning of a whole new era in
human history.'' And that, he added, posed a new set of challenges
with ``new approaches for the new century.''

<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf

<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Scope out the course beforehand, says Ilene Sokoloff, who used
to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in
advance so the client understands he's your guest. Have a gift
waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scrimp on anything. If the client needs golf balls, don't
buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a foursome. Invite two other people who will interest or
be of help to your client and who will help keep the conversation
moving, says Rhame. Or let the client bring someone, says Bill
Storer, who runs Business Golf Strategies in Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Pulitano, CEO of Computing Concepts, a computer integrating
company, played with a client who was a purchasing agent, and the
client brought his father, who was a purchasing agent for another
company. ``We picked up another account,'' says Pulitano, who pays
for his employees to attend Storer's seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your
client a team, calling each other partner and working off each
other's success, says Rhame. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Remember _ during the game, you're being watched as closely as
you are watching. Storer tells the recent story of a salesman who
made the mistake of drinking during a round and tipped the cart on
a sharp turn. His client fell out and was knocked unconscious.
After recovering, the client didn't stick around to do more
business. The salesman was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Woo, who runs Golf 101, encourages women to play off the
middle tees, where men usually start, instead of the forward tees,
which used to be called the ladies' tees but are now less
chauvinistically referred to as the beginners' tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there trying to build a relationship, you don't
want to be coming in and out of the conversation,'' she says. If
the more difficult drive holds a woman's game back, she should tell
the other players she'll move her ball from where it lands to where
theirs land, to keep the game moving.
</P>
<P>
   If you're playing with someone who plays from the forward tees,
don't sit in the cart and wait for her to tee off, says Rhame.
``Give her the courtesy to get out of the cart, and go stand with
her like she stood with you.'' &QL;

interest that your client casually mentioned. Follow up with a
phone call to set up an appointment to do business.

   ``People take my calls more frequently after we've played a
round of golf,'' says Dave Lakhani, director of sales at Cougar

BENCH COULD FIT RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ One of the top 3-point shooters in NBA history is
playing in long relief off the Lakers' bench and that could be
where Glen Rice remains for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In two games since joining the Lakers, Rice has struggled to
regain his magic touch. He's hit 12 of 33 shots from the field
(36.4 percent) and just 1 of 8 attempts from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   It's not entirely unexpected considering Rice hadn't played in
10 months, following the NBA lockout and arthroscopic elbow
surgery. But even once he regains his shooting stroke, Rice won't
necessarily become the starting small forward. Coach Kurt Rambis
might keep starting Robert Horry and let Rice come off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about that (Sunday),'' Rambis said. ``It
depends on if he likes coming off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept has merit. The Lakers' starting lineup already has
the scoring punch of Shaquille O'Neal (26.9 points per game) and
Kobe Bryant (19.5), but they have few reserves who can sustain a
scoring run when those two take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like punches off the bench,'' Rambis said. ``Teams have a
tendency to put all their other guns out there on the floor. . . .
It's something I was thinking about, but I don't know what
direction I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, meanwhile, is confident his shots will start to fall soon,
as he regains his game legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting good shots, I'm just not getting the lift that I'm
capable of getting,'' he said. ``Those shots are gonna be there all
year, so I've just gotta keep stepping up and taking them. . . . I
know for sure everything's going to fall into place perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Unguarded: The absence off Derek Harper (sprained ankle) on
Sunday underlined the Lakers' suddenly shaky backcourt situation.
When they traded Eddie Jones for Rice, the Lakers were left with
only one proven shooting guard, starter Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant needs a breather, the Lakers turn to small forwards
Rick Fox and rookie Ruben Patterson, or the 37-year-old Harper,
whose minutes are usually consumed by his duties as starting point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   With Harper out, matters were worse. Derek Fisher, who's
struggled this season, started at point guard. That left only
Bryant, already starting at off guard, available to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers last week waived veteran guard B.J. Armstrong, a
throw-in in the Rice trade, who could have provided some
flexibility and depth. Instead, look for one of two scenarios:
increased minutes for defensive specialist Patterson at shooting
guard, or the activation of rookie point guard Tyronn Lue from the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, meanwhile, participated fully in Monday's practice and
is probable for tonight's game against the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   __ Worm watch: ESPN reported that Dennis Rodman, who left the
team to attend to ``personal business,'' was seen Sunday night
playing blackjack at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive vice president Jerry West wouldn't comment on
the report, saying he had no direct knowledge of Rodman's
whereabouts. He reiterated that the team would deal with Rodman's
absence, excused or unexcused, internally.
</P>
<P>
   The team remains uncertain when Rodman will return to action.
Rodman's agents did not return phone calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quote me: After Friday's game, in which Rice tried to shake
off the rust by shooting as often as possible, 21 times in all, he
told reporters, ``When you've got just about everyone on the team
telling you to shoot, you've got to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis, responding Sunday: ``I wasn't telling him to !ital!shoot
it, I was telling him to !ital!make it.''

 DAN BARRY with MARJORIE CONNELLY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the aftermath of the shooting death of Amadou
Diallo, fewer than a quarter of all New Yorkers believe that the
police treat blacks and whites evenly, with blacks in particular
viewing the police with fear and distrust, according to a New York
Times poll.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9 out of 10 black residents questioned in the survey said
they thought that the police often engage in brutality against
blacks, and almost two-thirds said that police brutality against
members of minority groups in general is widespread. Also, more
than two-thirds of blacks said the policies of the Giuliani
administration have cause an increase in police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The survey suggests that police matters and race relations _
along with a growing dislike for the assertive style of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani _ have combined to give him the lowest
job-approval rating of his five-year tenure, 42 percent, reflecting
a sudden, precipitous drop in his popularity. Just five months ago,
a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 63 percent of city
residents approved of Giuliani's performance.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, one issue overshadowed all others: the death of
Diallo. The 22-year-old African immigrant was hit with 19 bullets
during a 41-shot fusillade fired by four white police officers as
he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building in early
February. Diallo was unarmed, and had no criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has since become the focus of a grand jury
investigation and has prompted protests and rallies that continue
to this day. The protests are organized by black leaders who charge
that the shooting reflects a persistent and dangerous distrust of
minorities by white police officers. It has also led to sustained
criticism of Giuliani's tough-on-crime policies and perceived
failure to establish working relationships with many of the city's
elected black officials.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is considering a run for the United States Senate
next year, has countered that the city's sharp reduction in crime
and its improved economy have benefited the city's black and
Hispanic populations and that his critics are engaging in
race-baiting. Although he has defended the Police Department in
general, he has repeatedly expressed his regrets over Diallo's
death. On Sunday, he and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended
a prayer service in Brooklyn that was held in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the latest survey suggest that the city's
black and Hispanic residents do not think the mayor has done enough
to control the police or improve the city's tenuous race relations.
Sixty percent of those surveyed said that in his public responses
to the Diallo shooting, Giuliani had made matters worse. That
figure includes 47 percent of white residents, 61 percent of
Hispanic residents and 79 percent of black residents.
</P>
<P>
   The results point to a sharp disparity between blacks and whites
over how the police have affected their sense of personal safety. A
third of blacks said they had been in situations where they feared
a police officer, while only 11 percent of whites said they had
felt that way. In contrast, 62 percent of whites said they had been
in situations where they felt safer in the presence of a police
officer, while 57 percent of blacks said they had never felt that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Giuliani, his press secretary, Colleen Roche,
suggested that the poll results exaggerated the reality of
attitudes in the city. ``The poll numbers seem to be driven by
false perceptions about police brutality, due in large measure to
the intense media and public scrutiny of the Amadou Diallo case,''
she said. ``The fact remains that the New York City Police
Department is among the most restrained in the nation. As times
passes and perspective returns, the poll numbers will once again
reflect reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Taylor, 59, a black man from Brooklyn who participated
in the survey, disagreed when contacted after the poll was
completed. The police ``don't give the minority neighborhoods a
chance to explain themselves,'' Mr. Taylor, a food-production
worker, said. ``They will stop you for no reason and ask for
identification. Giuliani may not be responsible for this kind of
behavior on the part of the police, but he can certainly do
something about it. He could start by not always taking the side of
the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times poll was conducted by telephone last Monday
through Sunday and surveyed 915 adult residents of New York City.
The margin of sampling error for all New Yorkers is plus or minus
three percentage points; for white residents it is five percentage
points, and for black or Hispanic residents it is six points.

 (editors: Corrects date in 12th graph to Jan. 29 instead of 26)   Kaiser Faces Suit Over Membership Drive 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A consumer group backed by Ralph Nader is filing a novel lawsuit
today that alleges Kaiser Permanente made false advertising claims
about its quality of care to recruit new members.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which will be filed in California Superior Court in
San Francisco, alleges that Kaiser was supposedly forcing doctors
to cut costs at the same it was spending $60 million a year to
attract new members with ads claiming that doctors, not
administrators, were in charge of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a lie, I don't know what is,'' said Jamie Court,
with Consumer's for Quality Care, a Santa Monica group that is
affiliated with Nader. The case is being handled by the San Diego
law firm of Milberg Weiss, which has specialized in filing class
action lawsuits against high-tech firms for alleged stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials, who have not yet seen the suit, reacted
angrily to the charges. ``Anyone can file a lawsuit,'' said Francis
J. Crosson, executive director of the Permanente Federation, the
partnership that governs the 10,000 doctors who practice at Kaiser
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, doctors are in charge of care at Kaiser Permanente,''
Crosson said. ``This outrageous lawsuit attacks the hard-earned
reputation of thousands of Kaiser Permanente physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer and health industry groups, the lawsuit is
apparently the first of its kind involving allegations of
misleading advertising by an HMO in a membership drive. In this
case, the suit charges that Kaiser has recruited 500,000 new
members since it launched its $60-million-a-year ad campaign in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which allegedly represented a 700 percent increase
over Kaiser's 1992 ad spending, used television and other media to
get across the message that, as one ad said: ``At Kaiser Permanente
your medical care is between you and your doctor, with no
interference from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the suit will allege, while Kaiser was advertising
noninterference, its administrators were reducing the HMO's medical
budget and talking about other cost-cutting steps.
</P>
<P>
   The suit cites two incidents to support the allegations. The
first is a December 1995 budget-cutting speech allegedly given by
Kaiser official Dr. John Vogt.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Vogt allegedly implied that Kaiser had
changed the protocol that doctors follow when deciding when to send
a patient to the hospital after complaints about chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit quotes Vogt as saying ``The reason we're revising
that protocol now is because our (hospital) utilization exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cites a Jan. 29, 1996, e-mail from 56 Kaiser
doctors who allegedly complained about ``drastic cost-cutting and
sweeping changes ... that negatively affect patients and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Court said attorneys are also prepared to call several unnamed
Kaiser doctors as ``expert witnesses'' to substantiate allegations
that executives interfered with patient-care decisions by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is filed on behalf of new Kaiser members who were
supposedly wronged by the allegedly misleading ads. It seeks
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, an immediate halt to
Kaiser's current ad campaign and corrective advertising to set the
record straight.

of those questioned said that life in the city had improved in the
last four years, a figure that was nine points lower than five
months ago, but still significantly better than the 34 percent
reflected in a March 1997 poll. Residents also overwhelmingly
approve of the mayor's handling of crime, although that support
dropped 20 points in five months, from 82 percent to 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cares about the welfare of the people,'' said Linda Glaze,
39, white housewife from Staten Island. ``He's more than a
politician. He's looking out for the people in terms of the
economy, jobs, education.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked to cite the worst thing that Giuliani had done as
mayor, 22 percent cited his handling of the police; 15 percent of
whites and 28 percent of blacks cited that issue. The only other
category to receive a double-digit response, 11 percent, was Mr.
Giuliani's outspoken personality; 15 percent and 10 of blacks felt
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also conveyed a concern among residents about the
behavior of the city's police officers that is more pronounced than
the reaction that followed another police encounter: the alleged
brutalization of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, by police
officers in a Brooklyn precinct station house in the summer of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of those surveyed last week said that the
policies of the Giuliani administration had caused police brutality
to increase, compared with 31 percent who answered the same
question in October 1997, shortly after the Louima case became
public and just before Giuliani was overwhelmingly re-elected to a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 70 percent of those polled recently said that the
police ``often engage in brutality'' against blacks, compared with
53 percent who felt that way in October 1997. And two-thirds said
that the police also brutalize Hispanics; a similar question was
not posed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, only 12 percent said they believe that the police
brutalize whites.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, more than half of those recently surveyed said they
believe that the police use excessive force, rather than necessary
force. But once again, their attitudes seem shaped by race. A third
of whites say the police use excessive force, compared to
three-quarters of blacks, and two-thirds of Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 43 percent said they believe that police brutality
directed against minorities is widespread. But only 24 percent of
the white residents felt that way, compared with 63 percent of the
black residents and 55 percent of the Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also demonstrated the inextricable link between the
mayor and law enforcement, a link that he has nurtured for most of
his public career. While the survey reflected public's interest in
reducing crime, with 20 percent saying it should be the mayor's top
priority, 19 percent said that police behavior should be his main
concern instead. That represents a sharp spike from the 4 percent
who answered the same way in October 1997, in the wake of the
Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the police are compassionate enough, especially
towards minorities,'' said Robert Altym, 48, a white hardware
technician from Queens. ``They don't hear them when they ask them a
question. I don't think the police are as familiar or comfortable
with the ethnic diversity of the city as much as they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``I think the mayor has to insure that the police
are trained more with this in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Young, a securities salesman from Coney Island, said
he sympathized with the challenges faced by the police. ``In terms
of brutality, I think some of it is exaggerated,'' he said. ``When
your life is on the line, you have to be extremely cautious. I'm
not condoning brutality, but in many cases the criminals are better
armed than the police themselves. Sometimes being over-cautious
makes you do things you don't intend to.''

   We, a nation of TV enthusiasts, have placed our faith in the
idea of the little black set-top box, an accoutrement that, as a
cable box, turned out feeble network options into a viewing
Shangri-la.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from TV, some Internet providers soon spawned the
notion of content personalization through ``channels.'' Then came
the idea that we could reap television-like enjoyment from
``viewing'' these Internet channels on our TV. When we signed on,
we envisioned a web of TV; what we got was WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have reached convergence: ReplayTV. A step beyond
WebTV, ReplayTV has taken the personalization features of Internet
portals like Yahoo! and Excite and adapted them to what we want to
see emanating from our tubes _ namely, television programs.
</P>
<P>
   A small, sleek black box with the savvy of a PC yet commanded by
the familiar click of a remote control, ReplayTV lets us believe
again in the idea of personalized channels.
</P>
<P>
   Its Replay Channels _ tailored by show, entertainer, or theme,
be it ``The Simpsons,'' ``Jeff Gordon,'' or ``fishing'' _ act like
a set of earmarked mailboxes (you've got ``Friends''!), where
specific types of programs of your predetermined choosing are found
and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees fan could set up a ``Yankees Channel'' and, whenever
he wanted, check for Yankees games and related programming on the
on-screen program guide. Just punch up that channel when it's time
for marathon viewing.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: Let's say that during ``Frasier'' we decide we'd
love to have a permanent record of David Hyde Pierce's future work.
Just press the ``Record This Show'' button on the Replay remote.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will ask, ``Record just this episode or record all
episodes?'' If you decide on the latter, the most recent show will
always be in the on-deck circle, ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Because its hard-drive storage (anywhere from 6 to 20 hours) is
random-access, ReplayTV can record and play a show at the same
time, allowing you to pause, rewind, and fast-forward during
currently airing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each night ReplayTV dials into the free Replay Network Services
to update itself with the latest channel-guide info.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the top-of-the-line ``enthusiast version'' is available
from Replay Networks for $995. But various manufacturers have
licensed this technology, so coming down the pike will likely be
$500 versions with an emphasis on simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bells and whistles are one thing, but as Replay Networks
director of marketing Jim Plant explains, the core of the issue is
always that ``the number-one problem people have is missing their
favorite television show.'' &QL;

UNCOMFORTABLE SPOTLIGHT IS ON JUDGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Williams has attended fights for as long as she can recall
and trained to box as a teen-ager before women were accepted in the
sport. A referee introduced her to judging amateur fights, and by
1989 she was licensed by New Jersey and sanctioned by the
International Boxing Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing's in my blood,'' she said Monday by telephone from her
job at City Hall in Atlantic City, N.J., where she works as an
accounts clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday night, Williams' name was no more famous than a
typical civil court judge's. And if her scoring during the Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification fight had not
ignited a public uproar, she might have collected her $5,150 fee,
left Madison Square Garden and gone home to Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   But her 115-113 score for Holyfield _ combined with another
judge's 116-113 decision for Lewis and the third judge's 115-115
verdict _ turned the fight into a draw, and Williams was labeled
inept by critics who wondered what she was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' scorecard is more than fodder for sports talk radio.
Her decision is calling into question the qualifications of judges,
the procedures for approving them by states and sanctioning bodies
and the sometimes incestuous relationships of promoters,
sanctioning bodies and judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did something wrong, I'd be upset,'' Williams said
Monday. ``I know I didn't. And I don't want people to think I did
anything illegal. I'm offended by the idea that people think I
didn't know what I was doing, but everyone's entitled to their
opinion. I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to the questioning of Williams' scoring was an admission
by the British judge for the fight, Larry O'Connell, that he erred
by scoring the bout a draw. ``Judged on the weight of public
opinion, I would say I was wrong,'' he said in Monday's London
Evening Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lee, the IBF president, said, ``That's a hell of a time to
admit you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The vehement reaction to the draw provoked the New York State
Athletic Commission to launch a weeklong investigation Monday.
Eliot L. Spitzer, the state attorney general, and state Sen. Roy
Goodman also scheduled hearings Thursday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if what happened Saturday night was an honest error,
there is a perception by the public that there won't be an honest
evaluation of a fight,'' said Spitzer, who is working with U.S.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on federal boxing legislation. ``At
minimum, the sport is tainted by the appearance of corruption, and
a reality of impropriety at the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said, ``We're going to explore the connections between
the promoters and sanctioning bodies with a great deal of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what they will discover is that promoters pay the
judges' fees, airfare and lodging and that written tests are not
always required to become judges. The New York and New Jersey
athletic commissions require a background in amateur judging, but
do not mandate a written test for a license. Nevada judges must
have extensive amateur experience and pass a written test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't license anyone without five years in the amateur
ranks,'' said Larry Hazzard, the New Jersey athletic commissioner,
``and that includes recommendations from amateur officials.''
</P>
<P>
   To become licensed in New York, applicants practice scoring at
bouts, and their scores are compared with those of the official
judges' cards. If their credibility is established, they get more
individual experience, said Scott Trent, a spokesman for the
athletic commission. In Nevada, judges move steadily higher from
scoring four-round fights up to 12-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, commissions require that judges attend annual seminars
to review films and be updated on anything that may affect their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With a license, judges can apply to the alphabet soup of
sanctioning bodies from best-known ones like IBF, the World Boxing
Council and World Boxing Association to lesser lights like the
North American Boxing Federation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no licensing procedure for the sanctioning organization
to accept the judges into their fold. ``We rely on what their
commission sends us, and they must attend a seminar,'' said Lee, of
the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had 90 judges to choose from for the Holyfield-Lewis fight
and selected Williams. ``She met the criteria,'' he said. ``She
gave me a list of 27 fights, including nine IBF title fights. I
have the utmost confidence in her.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If Jean put down a score for Holyfield, that's what
she saw. I wouldn't tell her what to do. Whatever happens,
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the state athletic commission chooses judges from a
list submitted by the sanctioning bodies. ``We don't let them say
who they want,'' said Marc Ratner, the commission's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said that while he believed that promoters' paying for
the judges is a conflict, ``I don't know how to get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to how a judge scores fights is how he or she applies
the rules to his or her scoring. Harold Lederman, the on-air judge
for HBO and TVKO, which carried the fight, said judges should score
four elements equally: clean punching, effective aggressiveness,
ring generalship and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to give them all equal weight, but in
professional boxing, most judges go 95 percent for clean
punching,'' said Lederman, who scored Lewis the winner of the
fight, 117-111.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the judges at the Holyfield-Lewis fight _
Williams, O'Connell and Stanley Christodoulou _ were in different
places around the ring. Williams said she was farther from the ring
than she preferred, unable to lean on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I couldn't see,'' she said. And during
the fifth round, which Williams scored for Holyfield and the other
judges scored for Lewis, she had a view of Lewis' back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he moved to the side, Holyfield took over in the
later part of the round,'' she said. ``I couldn't judge what I
couldn't see. The other judges may have seen what I couldn't see. I
couldn't go to the other side. I even hit my head on a camera when
I tried to get closer.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I didn't do anything wrong. I made a judgment
call.''

 &HT;    Questions arise over freighter crew's involvement in Hatian
immigrant disaster
 &HT;    By Larry Hobbs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Coast Guard officals wonder if the crew
of a Maltese freighter could have done more to rescue the victims
of a deadly Haitian immigrant smuggling disaster offshore from West
Palm Beach last week.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Adm. Norman T. Saunders is asking for an
investigation by the government of Malta, the country where the
ship Tomis Faith is registered, petty officer Scott Carr said. The
Coast Guard rescued three men and confirmed four women dead after
Tomis Faith crew members contacted it at about 1 a.m. on March 6
and said they heard screams coming from the water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol officials believe anywhere from 15 to 43
people drowned when at least one, and possibly two boats sank 26
miles offshore. Details remain sketchy because of conflicting
accounts from the survivors, Border Patrol agents said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing screams, the crew of the Tomis Faith shined a
light into the water, but saw nothing, Scott said. They continued
on and later reported the incident to the Coast Guard via telex,
Scott said. The telex went to the Coast Guard's communications
center in Virginia, and was then passed on to the Coast Guard
station in Miami, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Saunders wonders if the crew violated international
maritime laws by not remaining in the area until a search and
rescue crew arrived, or by not calling the Coast Guard immediately
on its radio, Carr said. Because the incident took place in
international waters, it is up to the ship's registered country to
conduct an investigation, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, Tomis Faith left its port in New Orleans
against orders to remain because of problems with the boat, Scott
said. The ship is en route to Spain, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteenth-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert loathed that
newfangled contraption, the steam locomotive. When there was talk
of laying track in his peaceful hometown of Croisset, he scoffed,
``What's the point? It will only bring in more people to be stupid
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Flaubert never wandered into an Internet chat room.
Online chat rooms _ basically, the real-time, typed equivalent of a
telephone conversation _ are open forums haunted by an assortment
of people with time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical chat room, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Lonelyhearts
pretend to have sex while pretending they're someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment chat rooms aren't much of an improvement. (To
find these places, do a quick search on the keywords ``Stock+Chat''
using an engine like Yahoo!)
</P>
<P>
   I've visited several of them, usually to discover that I'm the
only one to show up. The only time I encountered another virtual
creature, it dropped a hint about some suspiciously cheap,
unheard-of stock, then darted off. No wonder sites such as
InvestorExchange.com have closed their chat areas in favor of
bulletin boards, where investors don't converse but post and read
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is par for the course. As one Silicon Valley
investor points out, ``If the people who inhabit these places and
give advice on stocks were taking their own advice, they'd have
better things to do than hang out in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the dismal run of chat rooms is the scheduled
variety hosted by legitimate Web sites, where investment movers and
shakers take real-time questions from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network's Investor.com, for example, regularly sets up
scheduled chats with Wall Street stars, such as the recent seminar
``Investing for Growth and Income,'' sponsored by Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. and featuring Robert Natale, a managing director at Bears
Stearns Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Also higher on the evolutionary scale are the newsgroups and
other threaded discussion forums _ bulletin boards focused on a
fairly narrow topic _ offered by the big online services and
portals, such as America Online, Microsoft Network, Compuserve,
Netscape, and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Business and Finance message board
(http://messages.yahoo.com/yahoo/business_and_finance/index.html)
is typical of the genre, with discussions on such topics as
brokerage firms, upcoming initial public offerings, fund-trading
strategies, and overvalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The boards aren't without their share of hype and nonsense, but
practiced participants learn to separate the signal from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take time to read with an unbiased eye, you can find
employees and insiders posting good information,'' says Michael
Burry, a physician in Palo Alto, Calif., who also writes an online
investment newsletter, ``Valuestocks.net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he joined a Yahoo! group focused on the titanium
industry. ``There was a guy named Acroti, who said he was an
insider in the titanium business,'' Burry recalls. ``He told us
where the trends in titanium were going and that it would soon be
in a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events showed Acroti to be ``dead on,'' says Burry,
and he now looks for postings that, like Acroti's, are delivered
with authority but without an apparent ax to grind. ``He posted
what he needed to post and didn't get involved in arguments,'' says
Burry.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based or monitored Web sites are also good for weeding out
the riffraff. Burry's favorite site, Silicon Investor, charges a
$10 monthly fee, but he says the price is worth it. ``It's really
amazing to see the time and thought that some people put into their
posts, '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites tend to do a better job of shooing away the hucksters
than the open forums on sites such as Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   In open discussion groups where users can create multiple
identifiers for themselves, stock pushers can create what looks
like a group discussion, usually around a small stock, when in fact
the entire conversation is the fabrication of a single person with
an interest in hyping the stock.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting discussion groups, look for sites that post
clear ground rules and for discussions that stay on-topic. Don't
become embroiled in passionate debate right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, study the posted messages in various areas. If the site
appears to lack serious, concentrated discouse, lists several
postings by the same person (identified by a nickname), or allows
users to carry multiple nicknames, keep several grains of salt
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the better sites:
</P>
<P>
   SILICON INVESTOR (www.siliconinvestor.com) is a members-only
club for investors in high tech. The $10-per-month price tag (or
$200 or a lifetime membership) discourages the weirdos and phonies.
More than 300,000 messages are posted monthly, some of them,
admittedly, of the amuse-and-schmooze variety but many of them
serious analyses of market events. There's also private E-mail for
members.
</P>
<P>
   THESTREET.COM (www.thestreet.com) also charges a $10 monthly fee
($100 a year), which buys access to the site's rather uneven news
coverage as well as to a portfolio tracker, a useful SEC Filings
feature, and plenty of intelligent debate. The Talk section offers
threaded discussions on travel and culture as well as investing.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOTLEY FOOL'S (http://boards.fool.com/) discussion boards,
which are free, let participants post questions on message boards
and receive replies. There are plenty of instructive tales as well
as a weekly roundup of the best postings.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian firm StockGroup Interactive Media posts a free
forum, INVESTOR EXCHANGE (www.investorexchange.com). The monitored
discussions cover all aspects of investing, with a focus on
Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT NETWORK INVESTOR (http://investor.msn.com), which
offers free and pay services, features forums plus scheduled and
open chats. A section called MoneyCentral
(http://moneycentral.msn.com) provides discussion groups on such
topics as retirement, credit, taxes, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch's STOCKCHAT (www.stockchat.com) is a free,
wide-ranging forum. You can search for discussion threads
alphabetically or by stock ticker symbol. The discussions are
monitored for obscenity and other breaches of netiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the INVESTMENT FAQ (www.invest.faq.com) culls some of
the best postings from investment newsgroups, compiles the combined
wisdom into straightforward articles, and provides links to outside
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even Flaubert would probably consider it a vast improvement over
live chat rooms. &QL;

FLEET TO GET LION'S SHARE OF EXECUTIVE JOBS IN NEW BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group Inc. moved quickly to put its
stamp on the proposed $178 billion banking powerhouse formed by its
acquisition of archrival BankBoston Corp., despite official
descriptions of the deal Monday as a marriage of equals.
</P>
<P>
   Six of nine top executive slots at the new institution, Fleet
Boston Corp., are slotted for Fleet managers, the companies said in
a press conference to announce the deal. Fleet chief executive
Terrence Murray will head the new institution, and ``most staff
positions will report to me,'' Murray said. BankBoston chief
executive Chad Gifford will become chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, Gifford would take over as chief
executive at the end of 2001 when Murray said he hopes to retire.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's Gifford and Fleet's Murray _ known as bitter rivals
with nearly opposite personalities and management philosophies _
took pains Monday to portray the deal as a partnership employing a
``sprinkling of talent from both companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lopsided management appointments are part of a pattern,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can talk all they want about this being a merger of
equals, but let's make no bones about it: This is Fleet's deal,''
said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc. in Boston.
``Take a look at all the deals Fleet has done over the years. Fleet
people are always the ones who survive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Monday's announcement Fleet's Eugene McQuade will
become chief financial officer; Jay Sarles will be chief
administrative officer; David Eyles will be chief risk officer,
Michael Zucchini will head technology and operations; and Robert
Higgins will head commercial and retail banking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BankBoston's Henrique Meirelles will head
international banking, corporate investment banking, and investment
services. Joseph Smialowski, also of BankBoston, will help lead
technology and operations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $16 billion stock-for-stock transaction shocked the
local banking world when word of an impending deal began to spread
Sunday. In creating the nation's eighth largest financial
institution, by far the largest in New England, it seeks to combine
radically different cultures. Despite its recent merger with
BayBanks, BankBoston retains an air of patrician old Boston, while
Fleet Fleet arrived in town at the beginning of the decade as an
aggressive, acquisition-hungry upstart.
</P>
<P>
   The deal received an unenthusiastic reception on Wall Street,
where Fleet shares fell 5.7 percent, or 2 9/16, to 42 3/16 a share
on the New York Stock Exchange. BankBoston nudged up less than 1
percent, or 1/8 cents, to 47 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks, however, sought the deal in part because each was
vulnerable to an acquisition from outside the region, possibly from
a suitor such as North Carolina's First Union Corp., said Cassidy,
the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these guys are very proud of their New England
heritage,'' he said. ``Neither of them wanted to be the one to let
a Confederate flag fly over their insititution.''
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's announcement, the executives said joining the two
institutions will take at least a year. Ultimately, about 5,000
positions are expected to be eliminated as the new institution
slashes jobs and looks for ways to cut costs, officials said. About
3,000 slots should be taken care of through an immediate hiring
freeze and attrition, they said. In all, 60,000 people now work for
the two banks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is likely to shutter neighboring branches, especially
in southern New England where BankBoston and Fleet branches often
overlap, officials said. In addition, the bank will close 24
branches and sell an as-yet-unspecified number of its automatic
teller machines and branch offices to a competing bank to satisfy
antitrust regulators concerned with preserving competition in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Fleet is currently negotiating with regulators to
determine the ``size and type'' of the banks who would be offered
the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet will keep BankBoston's extensive operations in Latin
America, where political and economic instability have contributed
to BankBoston's recent weak stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a bigger balance sheet, we can better exploit the
strengths and better withstand the perceived volatility,'' Gifford
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank also plans to greatly expand its base of some
500,000 customers who bank on line with personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the Internet age is a tremendous springboard and
something we're going to take advantage of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have spoken out against the merger, saying its
sheer size leaves Fleet with a virtual monopoly and the power to
charge higher fees for banking services.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's press conference, Fleet's Murray said consumers can
expect some higher fees but also improved services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average household today is probably not consciously aware
of the fact that banking services are better,'' he said. ``What
they probably are aware of is that they're paying for them. The
fact is the world is demanding these services, and we intend to
provide them while reflecting those costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials Monday sought to allay criticism from community groups
that have worried BankBoston's practice of lending liberally in
poorer communities could be swallowed by Fleet's historically more
reluctant approach to community lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``BankBoston will take the lead on that,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, US Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat who serves on the House Banking Committee, said he expects
to meet with community leaders in New Bedford and Fall River, the
poorest urban areas that Frank represents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he wanted to be sure the merged bank conforms with
federal regulations meant to ensure loans and bank services in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to doubt it, but no reason to take it for
granted, either,'' said Frank, who is the senior Democrat on a
House Banking subcommittee on community development.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said the merger presented ``a tradeoff'' for the region. A
deal between two banks from the same area probably produces more
layoffs than if one of the banks was not based in New England, he
said. But merging two in-region banks also keeps the business under
local control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your main goal is to preserve the absolutely largest number
of jobs in our region, you want one or both of the banks to be
bought from outside'' the Boston area, he said. ``The tradeoff is
that versus lack of local control. But that's not up to the
government to decide. That's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments of levity at Monday's press conference
between Murray and Gifford, whose differing backgrounds have often
pitted each against the other.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding a question on the possible location of the new
institution's headquarters, Murray said his rival's downtown
building is ``by far is the most attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford blurted out, ``I think we've just made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray, speaking over him, added: ``From the outside it's
more attractive. From the inside, ours is much better.''

<P>
   Nineteenth-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert loathed that
newfangled contraption, the steam locomotive. When there was talk
of laying track in his peaceful hometown of Croisset, he scoffed,
``What's the point? It will only bring in more people to be stupid
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Flaubert never wandered into an Internet chat room.
Online chat rooms _ basically, the real-time, typed equivalent of a
telephone conversation _ are open forums haunted by an assortment
of people with time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical chat room, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Lonelyhearts
pretend to have sex while pretending they're someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment chat rooms aren't much of an improvement. (To
find these places, do a quick search on the keywords ``Stock+Chat''
using an engine like Yahoo!)
</P>
<P>
   I've visited several of them, usually to discover that I'm the
only one to show up. The only time I encountered another virtual
creature, it dropped a hint about some suspiciously cheap,
unheard-of stock, then darted off. No wonder sites such as
InvestorExchange.com have closed their chat areas in favor of
bulletin boards, where investors don't converse but post and read
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is par for the course. As one Silicon Valley
investor points out, ``If the people who inhabit these places and
give advice on stocks were taking their own advice, they'd have
better things to do than hang out in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the dismal run of chat rooms is the scheduled
variety hosted by legitimate Web sites, where investment movers and
shakers take real-time questions from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network's Investor.com, for example, regularly sets up
scheduled chats with Wall Street stars, such as the recent seminar
``Investing for Growth and Income,'' sponsored by Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. and featuring Robert Natale, a managing director at Bears
Stearns Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Also higher on the evolutionary scale are the newsgroups and
other threaded discussion forums _ bulletin boards focused on a
fairly narrow topic _ offered by the big online services and
portals, such as America Online, Microsoft Network, Compuserve,
Netscape, and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Business and Finance message board
(http://messages.yahoo.com/yahoo/business_and_finance/index.html)
is typical of the genre, with discussions on such topics as
brokerage firms, upcoming initial public offerings, fund-trading
strategies, and overvalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The boards aren't without their share of hype and nonsense, but
practiced participants learn to separate the signal from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take time to read with an unbiased eye, you can find
employees and insiders posting good information,'' says Michael
Burry, a physician in Palo Alto, Calif., who also writes an online
investment newsletter, ``Valuestocks.net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he joined a Yahoo! group focused on the titanium
industry. ``There was a guy named Acroti, who said he was an
insider in the titanium business,'' Burry recalls. ``He told us
where the trends in titanium were going and that it would soon be
in a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events showed Acroti to be ``dead on,'' says Burry,
and he now looks for postings that, like Acroti's, are delivered
with authority but without an apparent ax to grind. ``He posted
what he needed to post and didn't get involved in arguments,'' says
Burry.

 &HT;    Motorola, MIT seek to improve consumers' home environment
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. is hoping a marriage between high
tech and higher education will create tools to make your home more
user friendly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the communications company announced a $5 million
grant to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create a lab
focused on a new line of ``smart'' products for the home. Examples
are clothing with computerized labels that can tell a washing
machine which cycle to use and dishwashers that communicate with
other household appliances about noise levels and energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola DigitalDNA Laboratory at MIT's Media Lab will be
completed in 2003 as a new 5,000-square-foot building next to the
current lab. It will develop products to complement Motorola's
semiconductor division, headquartered in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Schaumburg, Ill., company, which has about 10,000 employees
in Austin, said the technology to create smart products already
exists, but isn't geared toward consumers. The hope in creating
smart products would be that they could be linked together in the
home to make a more efficient, more responsive environment.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products
Sector, said the devices will make life easier by simplifying tools
like remote controls. Instead of using several remotes or a
universal remote, a home entertainment center might be controlled
by a central device that could control not only electronic devices,
but air conditioning and home security.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, Motorola and MIT said, was born after market
surveys found consumers think many technological advances are
useless to the average person, and that many products are hard to
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should people have to read a 2-inch-thick manual to do
something simple?'' Ruiz asked. ``These are things at the low end
of the (technology's) application, things that make the consumer
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Motorola heralded the new devices as revolutionary,
Motorola is one of many companies racing to get network devices
into the home as bandwidth improves. While phone and cable
companies introduce new technologies to bring faster Internet
access into the home, companies including Microsoft Corp., Intel
Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have announced initiatives to get
homes wired.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in January,
Cisco Systems Inc. showed a prototype of a networked home in which
air conditioning, music and lighting could be monitored and changed
on a Web page, even from outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, however, is betting that its investment into the
400-person MIT lab will pay off in low-cost products that will
enable people to customize their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front door can open as it sees you coming with a load of
groceries,'' said Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Media Lab director, who
also serves on Motorola's board of directors. ``Or it can let the
dog out but not let 10 dogs back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has recently been billing itself as a solution provider
for the growing convergence of technologies in the home. At the
Consumer Electronics Show, the company introduced Streamaster, a
platform for companies to create set-top boxes that could handle
cable, video games, video-on-demand and home theater.

   PARIS _ He has been in fashion long enough for his thick black
hair to gleam white _ with some artful help from powder dusting. He
has seen bell-bottoms come and go and come back. He has lost his
label, been abandoned by Chloe for a younger woman, and that outre
business of posing with a fan has gone on a little too long.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Karl Lagerfeld should be working somewhere
stress-free, proposing pearls and navy sweaters as the look of the
new season. But on the contrary, with his latest collection for
Chanel, Lagerfeld showed that he is more than capable of keeping up
with Tom Ford at Gucci, Miuccia Prada, the Americans and the young
Belgians who are redefining style.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another important bit of news that emerged as the
Paris shows for fall 1999 ended on Monday: the bid by American
designers to gain more creative credibility by showing first,
rather than last, on the international calendar, has worked. From
the perspective of a month's runway shows in New York, London,
Milan and Paris, American design looks incredibly strong.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a startling reality that, while France is
unquestionably a center of world fashion, it will take the French
years to reclaim the kind of hegemony they enjoyed just five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The situation isn't improving. French designers continue to be
marginalized in their own country. Nicolas Ghesquiere at Balenciaga
is one of the few French talents who still matter. At Nina Ricci, a
French woman, Myriam Schaeffer, has been replaced by Nathalie
Gervais, a Canadian who worked at Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Alber Elbaz moved in at Yves Saint Laurent this season, and
Thierry Mugler, who ended Paris fashion week Monday with a series
of small shows in his ceiling-to-floor powder-blue work space, is
now an afterthought in some fashion circles.
</P>
<P>
   Mugler's twin as a guru of 1980s power fashion, Claude Montana,
is embroiled in business troubles and did not show at all. The
French can't quite figure out what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Lagerfeld to spell it out: D-R-E-S-S D-O-W-N. Before
Bernard Arnault of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton installed
Alexander McQueen of Britain at Givenchy, before Tom Ford revived
Gucci, there was Lagerfeld, the German expatriate making Chanel
incandescent. Chanel is no longer white-hot, but thanks to
Lagerfeld, it remains relevant and prestigious.
</P>
<P>
   The designer put Chanel into a dangerous but necessary
metamorphosis last year, which made some retailers and editors
nervous. This season, Lagerfeld cannily blended the house's legacy
and the future. The young can keep wearing Chanel, and the mature
customer can feel comfortable in feather-light jackets with
ruffles, leather vests and knee-length skirts, easy cardigan coats
and Goth-style Chanel dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the metal belts big enough to chain a gate. I liked
the flat, soft leather boots, which brought to mind the astronaut
footwear in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' The death during show week
of Stanley Kubrick, the director of that film, made vivid the
influences of designers who are looking forward to the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness someone is thinking about the future. John
Galliano certainly is not. He made his runway into a construction
site, and left one observer wondering what on earth shards of
glass, rubble, a demolished car and police barricades had to do
with a grand 1920s Poiret-style coat, sweeping skirts inspired by a
trench coat and 1940s bias gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was as if Cate Blanchett playing Elizabeth had lost
her way and wandered onto the set of ``Cruel Intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   You would not have been surprised if a police officer had
appeared from behind a barricade and ticketed Galliano for failure
to heed a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano knows how to make a woman look seductive, as he did in
claret-colored bias dresses slit up the leg, or a peacoat etched in
white appliqued tribal markings. But there were conceptual
stumbling blocks in this collection.
</P>
<P>
   Little was new or exciting. The preponderance of wools looked
heavy, the huge proportions retrograde. A spectator could feel
positively embarrassed for models with too much eye shadow like
Stella Tennant as she preened as if in a burlesque show.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of fashion and beauty are changing, and those who
viewed Galliano's show, it seems, have changed more than he has.
When the audience is ahead of a designer, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Galliano needs to refresh his vision. He could take notes from
Lagerfeld _ or he could just hang out with Dave, the proprietor of
one of this city's restaurants, a favorite with the fashion pack.
</P>
<P>
   Like taxi drivers and hair stylists, it is the restaurateurs,
particularly ones as well connected and fashionably astute as Dave,
who have their own way of calibrating shifts in the spirit of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   As he surveyed his clientele the other night, Dave observed in
Franco-Asian tones, ``In six months, the people at companies have
completely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He's exaggerating a bit _ it is, after all, Dave who tells
patrons he's reserving a table for them, and there isn't actually
one available when they arrive. That's because Stella McCartney is
occupying a table; Robert Forrest, creative director of Ungaro, is
in another corner with Bonnie Pressman, now at Ralph Lauren, James
King, the model, is near the fish tank, and Joe Boitano of Bergdorf
Goodman is tucked in with the English designer Eskendar.
</P>
<P>
   But the kernel of truth is there. The look and names that are of
interest in France have switched, seemingly overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A textbook case: Christian Lacroix, who continues to struggle to
look current. He's having some success as he pares down his shapes
and denudes some fabrics of his trademark pattern mixes and
festoons.
</P>
<P>
   A few pretty pieces surfaced in his collection: a coral quilted
coat in taffeta, jersey T-shirts printed with fanciful themes, a
black skirt trimmed with colorful sequins.
</P>
<P>
   To Lacroix, the phrase ``a little goes a long way'' means
nothing. But Gilles Dufour, Balmain's new designer and Lagerfeld's
former design associate at Chanel, appreciates it completely.
</P>
<P>
   To the hem of a pair of loose trousers, Dufour appliqued a
charming spray of felt flowers; and to a small purple tweed jacket,
he added discreet touches of embroidery and sequins. The collection
lacked a strong statement, but it must have made Georgina
Brandolini, the creative director who hired Dufour, happy. It was
not fusty old Balmain. Immediately, a consistency has been
established between the ready-to-wear and Balmain couture designed
by Oscar de la Renta.
</P>
<P>
   Brandolini, scion of the powerful Agnelli family of Italy, can
wear these clothes, and so can Catherine Deneuve and Lee Radziwill,
both of whom sat in the front row to cheer Dufour.
</P>
<P>
   In a cathedral setting with soaring ceilings and cavernous
rooms, Dries van Noten's solemn collection was unveiled: flowing
skirts peeking out beneath flowing rough-hewn coats, and sparkling
velvet rustling beneath a brown flannel dress. The designs were
ethereal and monastic, a mood that was the polar opposite of
Veronique Leroy's.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy was at her wry best with split trousers that look like
skirts, swooping black coats and a carnation adorning a white
shirt. There was a new version of the ponchos that she showed for
spring. She is early out of the gate with a lot of ideas. The
late-1970s and '80s Mugler-Montana power look that designers like
Jeremy Scott are doing now and that Alexander McQueen at Givenchy
plumbed two seasons ago Leroy did first.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be we're heading toward a Mugler moment? Foxy Brown in
a leather and chrome bikini in the ``Hot Spot'' video from her hit
CD looks as if she'd been channeling old Mugler shows. And Scott's
pink collection this season was reminiscent of Mugler. But the
problem with doing Mugler is that no one can do the dangerous-woman
look better than the designer who invented it.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Scott's show, Mugler himself showed seriously
tailored pink suits and candy-pink dresses. It's a good idea to
wait until the designer is no longer in business before the homages
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered if it gives someone the opportunity to go a step
further,'' Mugler said on Monday. ``If it's a copy or a cheap
imitation of what I did, then I think it's very negative. It's not
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, what goes around comes around. But as we see the
last of the first collections for the next century, designers must
understand that not everything from the 20th century should come
around again so soon.

<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged that the road to real
money and mind-boggling returns is small-company stocks. But just
try following the path.
</P>
<P>
   Why have small stocks been so disappointing?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many investors searched so hard to find so little?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that only one small-stock fund beat the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index over the past 15 years _ and then by less
than one-tenth of one percentage point?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that more than 600 managers, scouring the most obscure
nooks and crannies of the known stock universe, seem to be falling
further and further behind, Internet fever notwithstanding?
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to examine a deep belief _ the idea that
small-company stocks will, in the long run, provide a higher return
than large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It has a remarkably diverse array of adherents. Mavericks
believe because there is a romance attached to finding a small
company that will transform an industry _ or create one.
</P>
<P>
   Quantitative types believe because the largest and most revered
database, the virtual bible of modern portfolio theory, says small
stocks provide higher returns than big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And commonsense types believe because it seems so logical: At
some point, a big company's ability to grow should be constrained
by its already massive size.
</P>
<P>
   Actual events, however, don't support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the small-company stock creed are to be found in
the aforementioned bible: ``Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation,''
the Ibbotson Associates yearbook that provides data on asset
returns from 1926 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 yearbook shows that large-company stocks _ as
represented by the S&AMP;P 500 _ have delivered a compound annual
return of 11 percent while small-company stocks have returned 12.7
percent. That extra return isn't free, however.
</P>
<P>
   Small-stock prices are more volatile than large-stock prices _
investors have to live with greater price risk while waiting for
their higher return.
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff is substantial. Put $1,000 into large stocks, and
the Ibbotson data say it will grow to $184,565 over 50 years. Make
the same investment in small stocks, and it will grow to $394,635
over the same period. Twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   The problem starts with the actual results of the professional
investors who are paid to capture that extra return.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1981, just months before the start of the stock
market's long rise, there were only 17 small-company funds. FPA
Capital, which Robert Rodriguez has run for 14 years, is the
best-performing fund in that group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that ended October 31, the fund provided a
compound annual return of 17.20 percent, enough to edge out the S&AMP;P
500's 17.11 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn Fund, managed by Ralph Wanger and Ralph McQuaid, was
second-best, returning 15.56 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, both funds beat the Russell 2000 _ a broad index
of small companies _ by a wide margin. Indeed, the two funds
performed so well that they lifted the 15-year average for the
entire small-stock category above the Russell index.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the number of small-company funds has burgeoned to
682. Their track record, measured against the Russell 2000 index,
hasn't been bad. On average, they beat their index in three of five
measuring periods. What they haven't done is come close to the
returns on large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the persistent faith in small stocks is that over
the past 15 years some companies have grown from tiny, struggling
start-ups into industry leaders, while some large companies that
were once seen as invincible have suffered devastating declines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, to cite just one example, Eastman Kodak had the
seventh-highest market value among U.S. stocks. Today it ranks
117th.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft had yet to go public in 1977, and neither
Dell Computer nor Compaq Computer had even been founded. Today,
Microsoft has the largest market capitalization of all U.S. stocks;
Dell and Compaq rank 31st and 45th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the divergent fates of Microsoft and Kodak represent the
general triumph of the small and entrepreneurial over the large and
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two respected observers offer different, but related,
reasons. In ``Stocks for the Long Run,'' finance professor Jeremy
Siegel points out that small stocks' edge over large stocks
virtually disappears if the 1975-83 period is excluded from the
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While some might object to simply removing a block of years from
a time series, it happens that small stocks lost 31 percent of
their value in 1973 and an additional 20 percent of their value in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that small stocks did relatively well from
1975 to 1983. They were recovering from virtual obliteration.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the price volatility of small stocks means that
market makers increase their bid/ask spreads _ that is, to
compensate for the added risk, they charge a higher markup when
buying or selling small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel cites a study showing that even in modern times the
spread on small stocks has been 2.65 percent, compared with 0.40
percent for large stocks. That wider spread wipes out the entire
long-term advantage of small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation comes from value manager David Dreman. An
asterisk in the 1998 ``SBBI'' yearbook notes that the 12.7 percent
annual return of small-company stocks includes 1933, when their
total return was a stunning 142.9 percent. Large stocks have never
enjoyed a comparable one-year jump.
</P>
<P>
   Dreman found that trading in the 1931-35 period was very light,
with some 58 percent of the small-stock group not trading at all on
any given day. Not surprisingly, bid/ask spreads were enormous,
averaging 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We'll let the academics worry about the fine details. The
practical message is that market realities may hinder any investor
from reaping the benefits of small-stock investing _ if those
benefits exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what's an investor to do? Forget size _ it's just too
limiting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the median company on the Russell 2000 list has a
market capitalization of $220 million. If and when its market value
exceeds $1 billion, it will cease, by most conventional
definitions, to be a small stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stick strictly to small stocks, then, are
voluntarily limiting their potential gains to what Peter Lynch
would call a ``five-bagger.'' That's giving up a lot of potential
upside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most doctrinaire small-stock investor would probably
regret selling the likes of Cisco Systems ($125 billion in market
capitalization as of Dec. 8), Dell ($85 billion), or Oracle ($34
billion) when they became ``too big.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything to be learned from following the contrails
of these highfliers, it's that size doesn't matter. Good stocks
do. &QL;

 &HT;    Motorola, MIT seek to improve consumers' home environment
 &HT;    (EDS: Was previously sent out as MOTOROLA-MIT-COX.)
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. is hoping a marriage between high
tech and higher education will create tools to make your home more
user friendly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the communications company announced a $5 million
grant to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to create a lab
focused on a new line of ``smart'' products for the home. Examples
are clothing with computerized labels that can tell a washing
machine which cycle to use and dishwashers that communicate with
other household appliances about noise levels and energy use.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola DigitalDNA Laboratory at MIT's Media Lab will be
completed in 2003 as a new 5,000-square-foot building next to the
current lab. It will develop products to complement Motorola's
semiconductor division, headquartered in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Schaumburg, Ill., company, which has about 10,000 employees
in Austin, said the technology to create smart products already
exists, but isn't geared toward consumers. The hope in creating
smart products would be that they could be linked together in the
home to make a more efficient, more responsive environment.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products
Sector, said the devices will make life easier by simplifying tools
like remote controls. Instead of using several remotes or a
universal remote, a home entertainment center might be controlled
by a central device that could control not only electronic devices,
but air conditioning and home security.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership, Motorola and MIT said, was born after market
surveys found consumers think many technological advances are
useless to the average person, and that many products are hard to
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should people have to read a 2-inch-thick manual to do
something simple?'' Ruiz asked. ``These are things at the low end
of the (technology's) application, things that make the consumer
happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Motorola heralded the new devices as revolutionary,
Motorola is one of many companies racing to get network devices
into the home as bandwidth improves. While phone and cable
companies introduce new technologies to bring faster Internet
access into the home, companies including Microsoft Corp., Intel
Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. have announced initiatives to get
homes wired.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in January,
Cisco Systems Inc. showed a prototype of a networked home in which
air conditioning, music and lighting could be monitored and changed
on a Web page, even from outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, however, is betting that its investment into the
400-person MIT lab will pay off in low-cost products that will
enable people to customize their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front door can open as it sees you coming with a load of
groceries,'' said Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Media Lab director, who
also serves on Motorola's board of directors. ``Or it can let the
dog out but not let 10 dogs back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has recently been billing itself as a solution provider
for the growing convergence of technologies in the home. At the
Consumer Electronics Show, the company introduced Streamaster, a
platform for companies to create set-top boxes that could handle
cable, video games, video-on-demand and home theater.

 &HT;    Catholics reach out to gays
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Archdiocese of Cincinnati is starting a
ministry that will reach out to gays and lesbians, their families
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry will ``offer compassionate love and concern of
Jesus Christ and the teachings of the church,'' said Dan Andriacco,
archdiocese spokesman. ``It will be faithful to those teachings and
embrace the universal call to holiness in seeking to include all in
the community of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk will inaugurate the pastoral care
initiative in the Miami Valley at a prayer service April 14 at St.
Peter Church in Huber Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry may consist of prayer groups, days of prayer and
reflection, providing resources or other support. It also will work
to remedy discrimination against gays and lesbians. The archdiocese
has no data on the number of gay and lesbian Catholics registered
at Miami Valley churches.
</P>
<P>
   The head of one gay and lesbian advocacy group expressed concern
that the ministry might be an attempt to convert homosexuals to a
heterosexual lifestyle, similar to some controversial Protestant
ministries. The Catholic Church does not view homosexuality as a
choice, according to the 1997 U.S. Catholic Bishops pastoral letter
Always Our Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as this being a conversion effort, I have talked to
</P>
<P>
   the archdiocese and that approach would fly in the face of the
pastoral letter, which says that homosexuality is not a choice,''
said Ann Wilger, regional director of Parents, Families and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group within the Catholic Church called Courage
which feels that people can be converted, but I have talked with
the archdiocese and I've been told that it has not modeled this
ministry after Courage,'' Wilger said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Margaret Black, director of the Archdiocese Family Life
Office, which would oversee the Catholic Ministry with Gays and
Lesbians, ``I've been on the telephone all morning talking to
people who are asking tough questions: 'Is the ministry going to
try to convert people?' 'Do we have a hidden political agenda?' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the purpose,'' Black said. ``We're here to nurture
them and to help them from a spiritual sense to understand what is
God's will for them, and to help them to fulfill that will.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriacco said the ministry was formed in response to sessions
that the archdiocese sponsored in 1998, in which Auxiliary Bishop
Carl K. Moeddel met with parents of gays and lesbians to hear their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Those sessions followed the 1997 pastoral letter which
reconfirmed the church's teaching that homosexual acts are a sin,
but urged the church to treat gays and lesbians with compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ministry is not outside the teaching of the church about
homosexual acts, but that's not its purpose,'' Andriacco said
Monday. ``Its purpose is the other area of church teaching, which
is that they have to be accepted and respected with sensitivity and
love.''

SEATTLE RESIDENTS FACE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF SAVING THREATENED
SALMON

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal officials will formally declare on Tuesday
that nine wild salmon species in the Pacific Northwest are
threatened with extinction, the first listing under the 26-year-old
Endangered Species Act that affects an entire urban region,
</P>
<P>
   But while that stark announcement deals with fish, it is people
_ especially the three million of them who live in the greater
Seattle area _ who will have to face the consequences of halting
the decline of these once mighty salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   They will almost surely pay more in taxes, to acquire land
around waterways and to buy out floodplains so that rivers can
reclaim areas where the salmon once spawned. They are already being
urged by their local leaders to stop using fertilizers and
pesticides, voluntary efforts that may eventually become mandatory,
county officials said on Monday. They will likely face sharp new
restrictions on building, especially near streams and other
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of all these measures will be these questions:
Will people decide that these are all steps toward a better quality
of life in a region already consumed with worry that its lavish
natural splendor is under attack? Will they find, as Mayor Paul
Schell of Seattle likes to put it, that ``in working together to
save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon saves us''? Or
will the listing, which in many ways dwarfs the impact of the 1990
listing of the northern spotted owl that set off its own
environmental controversy, spawn an angry backlash against the
Endangered Species Act?
</P>
<P>
   The salmon listing on Tuesday is a bombshell, though not an
unexpected one. Officials from Gov. Gary Locke on down have been
formulating plans for months in anticipation of the announcement,
and now they will be forthcoming. Under the Act, governments and
even private citizens can face criminal penalties unless steps are
taken to protect the affected species. But so far, unlike the
spotted-owl fight, in which many leaders in logging and timber
towns bitterly opposed the listing and even mocked the owl, there
has been little opposition to the proposed listing. And no one is
belittling the salmon, a revered icon of the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is recovery of the salmon,'' said Ron Sims, the King
County executive, who oversees an area that includes the city of
Seattle and who has repeatedly said that he believes residents here
are willing to pay more in taxes and take other steps to protect
the fish. ``However, our ultimate purpose is to restore our
environment so that we may provide for the co-existence of people
and fish in the Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials on Monday said they believed that salmon
restoration could amount to ``life by a thousand stitches instead
of death by a thousand cuts.'' But the devil will be in the
details, and some political and business leaders have already said
that some of the contemplated steps are far too Draconian to pass
public muster.

CALIPARI FIRED AS NETS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whole scene was like something out of Mario Puzo. The Nets
team bus, with its players and assistant coaches, went one way.
John Calipari and his boss went the other way in a limo, the
luggage in the trunk, his future in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   That was Sunday, shortly after the Nets had lost for the 17th
time in 20 games, a depressing, humiliating 102-76 loss to Miami
aired for all to see on NBC and for the Nets' suits to see in
person at Miami Arena. It turned out to be Calipari's last game as
New Jersey head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Nets were ready to leave for practice at the
University of Toronto, still not knowing for sure who would be
calling the shots for Tuesday's game with the Raptors. They soon
found out. Calipari, who had flown in earlier in the day, addressed
the players and wished them well. It was over.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Cal's 2 1/2-year stewardship of the Nets is finished. He
compiled a 72-112 record. Former Celtics assistant Don Casey, who's
been at Cal's side through good and (mostly) bad in New Jersey,
will run the club on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after meeting with the players, Calipari, team owner
Lewis Katz, and team president Michael Rowe met reporters in an
atmosphere of almost gallows humor. While Rowe noted that Calipari
has accepted full responsibility, Calipari quickly quipped, ``I'd
like to share some of it.'' Rowe added, ``(Calipari) has been a man
of his word and his character throughout has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz all but called the decision a mercy killing in the meeting,
saying, ``I kept hoping against hope something would change. But I
watched every game and saw the pain and the misery and realized it
was not the fair thing to keep the train rolling. It didn't look to
me like it was going to turn around. I'm not talking about winning.
I'm talking about being competitive. When do you say, `Enough is
enough'?''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari has been told he can stick around in some sort of
advisory capacity and said he would help in any way. But he's a
coach, and expect him to look to those ranks for future employment.
He said Monday that he came in with a five-year plan and ``I felt
we could move this thing to where we needed to be in five years. In
a selfish way, I want them to turn it around and win and show they
can be what I believe they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reports out of New York and New Jersey had the Nets
interested in Phil Jackson, a former Jersey player, assistant
coach, and radiohead. He also had some success with the Bulls.
Jackson's agent, Todd Musberger, did not return a phone call
Monday. The Nets said they have not contacted Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Calipari's dismissal does not qualify as a stunner.
When you have promise and hope and start out 3-17, someone, usually
the coach, has to pay. The players were passive, almost waiting for
the ax to fall. Newcomer Stephon Marbury ripped into the club's
defensive schemes after the Miami fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has lost seven straight and 12 of 13, the sole
victory being its last-second win over the Celtics eight days ago.
Since then, they were embarrassed at home by Charlotte and
bludgeoned on the road by the Bulls. As the losses continued,
Calipari's firing soon became a question of `when' rather than
`if.' The conspicuous presence of New Jersey's management team on
Sunday in Miami only added to the sense of doom.
</P>
<P>
   Big things were expected from the Nets this season. They
finished strong last year, making the playoffs, and playing three
tough games with the Bulls. Michael Jordan, for one, urged Calipari
to keep the team intact because good times were around the corner.
ESPN predicted a Pacers-Nets Eastern Conference final. No one
envisioned a total collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries, mainly a sprained ankle to point guard Sam
Cassell, crippled the team. Its shooting touch disappeared.
Calipari seemed to turn inwards as the losses piled up. Cassell,
widely seen as Calipari's pet, eventually was traded in the deal
for Marbury and once the deal went down, there were reports that
Calipari soon would be dismissed. But ownership waited four more
days before pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new beginning,'' said Nets general manager John Nash.
``Hopefully, we can turn it around and get some wins. This has been
a very tough four days for all of us, from the trading deadline, to
the re-signing of (Kerry) Kittles to the decision to replace Cal.
We're all exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari had two years and $6 million remaining on his
five-year, $15 million contract. There are some attractive college
vacancies: Notre Dame, Georgia, San Diego State, and Iowa come to
mind. He made his name, of course, in the college ranks at
Massachusetts, but left in June 1996 as reports of improprieties
started to surface. The school eventually returned its share from
the 1996 Final Four after Marcus Camby admitted to taking money
from an agent while still on the team.

STUDY GIVES NEW TIME LINE FOR HUMAN POPULATION SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Wis., Utah, Calif., Mass.)  (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ancestors of Africans and non-Africans split apart almost
200,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought, a study of
DNA in living populations has found.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is so early that it precedes by some 70,000 years
the first known fossils of modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study say they cannot tell in which branch of
the split population the genes that shape modern humans first
developed, but they believe the genes spread quickly throughout the
other branch because of the advantage they conferred.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in Monday's Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, also reports the first fixed DNA difference
between African and non-African populations. The difference, which
may be rendered less absolute when more people are tested, is in a
single chemical unit of DNA that has no functional significance.
Several geneticists said the finding does not alter the
well-established fact that different ethnic groups differ very
little at the genetic level.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding, if sustained, is surprising in the light of two
widely held assumptions about human origins. One is the view that
modern humans evolved in sub-Saharan Africa and, in a later split,
a small band then emigrated to populate the rest of the world. The
other is the expectation that only a handful of minor genes
underlying superficial characteristics like hair and skin color
would show sharp differences between major population groups. The
gene under study is part of an enzyme, known as pyruvate
dehydrogenase, which controls an important step in glucose
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report, by Dr. Eugene E. Harris and Dr. Jody Hey of
Rutgers University in New Jersey, suggests that the archaic human
population split first, probably in Africa, and that the modernity
typical of people today developed later.
</P>
<P>
   Hey said that he and Harris selected the pyruvate gene purely
for reasons of convenience: It lies on the X chromosome, and by
studying the gene in men, who have only one copy of the X
chromosome, they had to determine the sequence of DNA units only
once in each individual.
</P>
<P>
   They sequenced a 4,200-unit long segment of DNA from the
pyruvate gene in 16 Africans, 19 non-Africans and two male
chimpanzees. The forebears of chimps and of humans are believed to
have split into separate species some 5 million years ago, which
yielded a time scale for measuring the rate of mutation in the DNA
segment. Though the number of DNA samples was small, the
researchers said their statistical analysis produced a meaningful
result.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers biologists noted 25 positions in the DNA segment at
which their human subjects tended to have different chemical
letters from the chimp sequence. The differences are caused by
successive changes or mutations in units of DNA, allowing a family
tree of the changes to be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the mutations occur at regular intervals, like a
steadily ticking molecular clock, the Rutgers biologists concluded
that the ancestral hominid sequence is 1.86 million years old. This
is about the time of an archaic human species known as Homo
habilis, and confirms the idea that much of the genetic variation
in living populations is very old.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, at about 189,000 years ago, the researchers said,
the gene tree split into African and non-African branches, a point
marked by a new mutation found only in the non-African subjects. At
a place in the gene where Africans have the chemical sequence GCG,
non-Africans have GCA, the letters standing for different units in
DNA. In the genetic code, both GCG and GCA specify the same amino
acid unit of a protein, so the difference has no practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   However the date it implies for an African/non-African split is
substantially earlier than estimates so far derived from other
parts of the human genome, which range from 100,000 to 156,000
years ago. Hey said these estimates did not, as his does, take into
account the subsequent flow of genes between the separate branches,
an omission which lowers the apparent splitting date.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers biologists cannot say from their study where the
split took place, though presumably it was somewhere in Africa. But
from the amount of variability seen in their DNA sequences, they
can estimate the effective size of the ancestral human population,
which they put at a mere 18,000 people. Estimates from other genes
range from 11,000 to 18,000, numbers thought not to have been
greatly exceeded until a population expansion began some 50,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hey said that 18,000 people, even hunter-gatherers, do not take
up a lot of room, and that the African/non-African population split
could still have left the two groups close to each other, even if
geographically separated. When the gene changes that led to
modernity evolved, they would have reached and quickly spread
through the other because of the powerful selective advantage they
conferred.
</P>
<P>
   Hey said his genetic data give no clue on whether the genes for
modernity first evolved in the African or non-African
sub-population. Given that the transitional fossils and many of the
earliest modern fossils appear in Africa, the African population
seemed to him the likelier candidate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the established view that modern humans arose from
archaic hominids in sub-Saharan Africa may wait for confirming
evidence before changing their minds. In a commentary on the new
report, Dr. Rosalind M. Harding, a geneticist at the John Radcliffe
Hospital in Oxford, writes that true dates could be twice or half
the estimates derived at present from genetic data, such is the
range of uncertainty in genetic dating methods.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Population genetics is a rigorous science but is statistical in
nature and depends on several general assumptions that may not
always perfectly mirror actual events. Those who study human
origins from the fossil evidence believe their dates, usually based
on radiocarbon, are more firmly grounded than the geneticists'
molecular clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Klein, an archeologist at Stanford University, said he
gave even odds on whether the African/non-African split occurred
before human modernity, as the new study says, or after. ``In the
end the genetics will have to accommodate the fossil and
archeological records, not the reverse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ofer Bar-Yosef, an archeologist at Harvard University, said
the archeological record supported the geneticists' calculation
that the early human population was very small. But the
archeological evidence is silent, he said, on whether there was a
population split 200,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Henry C. Harpending, a geneticist at the University of
Utah, said he too had seen signs, from study of a different genetic
region, of splits in the pre-modern human population. ``I like the
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second surprise in the Rutgers report relates to the
well-established finding that humans as a species show very little
genetic difference between their various subpopulations. All people
have exactly the same set of genes, as far as is known, but the
genes come in slightly different flavors, embodied by minor
variations in the DNA sequence. Overall, there is much more
variation among people within a subpopulation than between
populations.
</P>
<P>
   The gene fragment studied by Hey and Harris is unusual in that
the versions of the gene found in Africans and non-Africans are
quite different. Hey said he viewed the gene as an anomaly and that
``our data cannot be interpreted as supporting the idea of very
distinct races or populations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Human biologists have always known that there would be some
genes out there that would show this pattern, such as those for
hair color, so finding this gene doesn't change the overall story
that most genes do not show this kind of pattern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pyruvate gene has no obvious correlation with any known
difference among major population groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is surprising to find this all-or-none difference when
previously we would have expected just frequency differences,''
said Dr. James F. Crow, a geneticist at the University of
Wisconsin. He described the pyruvate gene finding as a ``striking
exception'' to the rule that different versions of a gene tend to
be present to varying extents in all populations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hey believes that Africans and non-Africans may have distinctly
different versions of the gene because of a ``genetic sweep'' that
erased much of the variability in the non-African version of the
gene. A genetic sweep occurs when some gene or element of a gene
confers so large a survival advantage that a wide region of DNA on
either side of it becomes embedded in the whole population. Since
none of the mutations found by the Rutgers group make any practical
difference, Hey believes the point of selective advantage may lie
in another part of the gene or even in a neighboring gene.
</P>
<P>
   The selective advantage, whatever it was, may have conferred an
edge against some threat _ perhaps a disease or climatic change _
confronted only by non-Africans. ``It was some kind of
environmental difference but I don't have a clue as to what,'' Hey
said. &QL;

   PARIS _ The question of why people come here for fashion, rather
than mere clothes, was answered this weekend by two starkly
different shows, one by Jean Paul Gaultier, who sent his audience
screaming ``Ooh-la-la'' toward the new millennium, and the other by
Jeremy Scott, whose all-pink revue literally sent his howling into
the night, but wondering, What if he is right? What if this
funny-looking youngster from Missouri is talented after all?
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's show, played out on a long runway with an digital
millennium clock blinking in the background, was wildly inventive.
This is Gaultier's year, what with his strong haute couture showing
in January and Friday night's reverent ready-to-wear ode to the
power of love. That was his message for fall as a Noah's ark of
couples came trooping down the runway _ now dressed in Eskimo
regalia, now in swanky his-and-her glittery knits and tartan kilts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there were no futuristic cliches made Gaultier's
show all the more potent. Male couples came out in pinstriped suits
with the trouser legs creased four ways, as if to form a box, while
women wore jumpsuits that could be transformed into long dresses
with the pull of a zipper. ``Ingenious'' describes this collection,
particularly Gaultier's hilarious take on motocross leathers
(superwide). The show ended with a traditional bridal couple: old
and gray, but still in love.
</P>
<P>
   What can one say about Scott's pink farce except that it brought
to mind a scene from that Hollywood romp ``What a Way to Go,''
starring Shirley MacLaine, in which a guy named Pinky spends every
last dime to paint everything pink? Scott, whose previous
collections have also been devoted to one color, must be of the
same mind. There were shorts and trouser suits with enormous
``Dynasty''-era shoulder pads, and some evening ensembles, if one
can call them that, with skirts that looked as if they had been
blown up to float in a children's pool.
</P>
<P>
   With his buzzed hair and sly smile full of gold-capped teeth,
Scott, who is 24, seriously bugs people, but in a world easily
intimidated by raw talent, nobody can write him off just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The theme at Michael Kors' Celine show on Friday was ``disco
lodge'' _ as in luxe ski sweaters, racy white satin chinos, rabbit
fur and leather trench coats of the '60s French film-star genre,
all warmed by T-shirts encrusted with ruby-red stones. It was
Charlotte Rampling meets Ursula Andress, with Diana Ross belting
out the high notes. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being impeccably styled with a casual elegance that
fulfills some people's idea of modern taste, Kors' collection was
invariably practical. No space-age hokum or divinely trashy rocker
gear for him. He avoided all the high-tech futuristic business by
sticking to the classic fabrics he knows best, like double-faced
cashmere and good old cotton duck, all simply executed as narrow
pants and duffel coats. A hooded zip-front jumper, a kind of
dawn-patrol dress in tan cotton, evoked some of fashion's
utilitarian madness, but without its muffled sex appeal, while a
coat doused with tiny gray and brown feathers looked as if the
model had been blown through a henhouse, except that the feathers
were all arranged in an understated tweed pattern. Marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   While almost anyone can understand this kind of jet-set allure,
there is a built-in problem when European houses like Celine and
Loewe hire American designers to modernize their images: no matter
how far they spread the glamour, the clothes still look like
American sportswear. This was the case at Narciso Rodriguez's show
for Loewe on Saturday. Rodriguez started out impressively enough
with minimalist black leather separates _ sleeveless tops, sheaths
and so forth _ all cut gloriously close to the body. There were
sheared raccoon jackets and pullovers worn with trousers and
sequined tops and colored a garnet hue that looked almost brown;
suede camisoles with filigreed cutouts, and other separates
lathered with stones in semiprecious shades of amethyst and rose
quartz.
</P>
<P>
   But any way Rodriguez sliced it, the underlying message of this
slick collection was still American sportswear basics. Of course,
one could say that Rodriguez, a former Calvin Klein assistant who
went on to distinguish himself at Cerruti, was providing a
venerable Spanish leather goods house with some of his commercial
know-how. But in a season of strong individual separates, that
logic doesn't wash. Anyway, it's not why one comes to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Herve Leger cuts a mean dress, as everyone knows, but apart from
a bondage-wrapped bustier that looked like giddy censor bars
dancing over the bosom, there was little new here. Cerruti, by
contrast, drew a firm line for modern clothes without futuristic or
arty effects. The designer, Peter Speliopoulos, presented one of
the smartest collections of the week, with glossy nylon shifts
embroidered in a grid of squares, pony skin coats and colors in
corrosive tones of orange and green.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one Valentino, the perennially tanned Roman
designer who caters to the world's rich and titled. Yet this season
the ever-chic Valentino seemed to abandon the sense of hidden
luxury that had made his January haute couture collection look so
modern for a style that was almost ... well, '80s over-the-top
passe would not be putting too fine a point on it. Out came
skintight jeans with flaming red stitching, animal-print pouches
dangling from belts and metallic halter tops. There were some
graceful Valentino touches, like gowns in gray and cloud pink
chiffon, but one had the impression that Donatella Versace had
sneaked into the designer's workrooms, played around with the
clothes, and, what the heck, someone at Valentino actually liked
it.

FLEET BOSTON CORP.: HOW THE DEAL GOT DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was a negotiation conducted over secret breakfast
meetings and cheeseburger dinners with California pinot noir at
Terry Murray's tony but understated Four Seasons apartment across
from the Public Garden.
</P>
<P>
   For five months, starting last November, Murray, the head of
Fleet Financial Group, and Chad Gifford, his counterpart at
BankBoston, met often in private to see if they could agree on a
deal that had eluded them before: the merger of their banks.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfasts and dinners at Murray's apartment opened the door
to dozens of other face-to-face sessions between the two executives
and key lieutenants. They met at Florida resorts and a Waltham
hotel and, finally, at a New York law office on Sunday where they
ironed out sticking points, including a provision that would make
it difficult for the new bank to remove Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., Murray and Gifford shook hands, agreeing that Fleet
would acquire its longtime rival BankBoston for $16 billion. Then
they telephoned the news to Gifford's ailing, 87-year-old father, a
Rhode Island banker who, according to legend, once turned the young
Murray down for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point,'' said a senior executive close to the
negotiations, ``we were absolutely married.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's moves to buy BankBoston began last November at the
Marriot Copley Place in Boston, where Gifford chaired a
million-dollar fundraiser for the American Ireland Fund, a favorite
local cause, according to sources who provided a detailed account
of the meetings leading up to a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Murray waded through 1,500 guests to approach Gifford to suggest
the two meet soon for an informal lunch. It was a difficult time
for Gifford, whose patrician, 215-year-old bank had been battered
by a downturn in emerging markets, especially in Latin America,
where the bank has extensive operations.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the event, Gifford had lunch at Murray's
antique-filled apartment. The two men could not risk being seen
together even in their corporate dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, the two rivals, who had discussed merging with
each other as far back as late 1994 and as recently as last April,
spoke only about broad industry issues like consolidation and
deregulation. Murray made no proposal to buy BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The New Year came and went. BankBoston disappointed investors by
reporting more quarterly losses, while Fleet charged ahead, earning
plaudits from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, Gifford and seven top BankBoston executives
traveled to Vanderbilt Hall in Newport, R.I. to discuss the
company's strategic alternatives. Soon Murray began making the kind
of aggressive, masterful moves he is known for.
</P>
<P>
   First he invited Gifford back over to his apartment for a
one-on-one dinner of cheeseburgers, French fries, and two bottles
of wine from Murray's cellar. It was the first time the two men had
met since their brief lunch two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, sources said, Gifford was interested in at least
exploring the possibility of merging with his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions intensified, with in-house acquisition specialists
at both banks producing reams of charts and graphs showing what a
deal might mean for both companies. In early February, key
strategists _ Peter Manning of BankBoston and Jay Sarles of Fleet _
signed a confidentiality agreement. The document stipulated that
both banks would keep strategic corporate information confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Then Murray began playing the host again.
</P>
<P>
   During the first two weeks of February, over four breakfasts at
his apartment, the Fleet chief served Gifford and a handful of key
executives from both banks croissants, coffee and juice, along with
a hefty dose of rhetoric on why the two companies should merge. The
gatherings, which began around 8:30 a.m., lasted until lunch time.
At one meeting, Sarles and Manning joined Gifford and Murray, and
the four men, all golfers, agreed to play a round soon at Augusta
National, the site of the Masters golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-day weekend in late February, BankBoston's
executives, as well as 16 board directors and spouses, convened at
Fisher Island, an exclusive _ and reclusive _ Florida resort.
BankBoston executives from Argentina and Brazil were also present.
In meetings lasting five hours a day, according to a person who
attended the sessions, executives and directors pondered
BankBoston's future. During breaks, some executives played golf at
the Indian Creek and Deering Bay country clubs, while others toured
local mansions.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, ``the BankBoston board was still thinking it
could remain independent,'' one participant said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The executives would soon find themselves in less plush
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, at the Wyndham Hotel in Waltham, top executives from
BankBoston _ including president Henrique Meirelles, regional bank
head Brad Warner, corporate bank head Paul Hogan, and chief
financial officer Susannah Swihart _ met with their Fleet
counterparts. The Fleet team included president Bob Higgins, chief
financial officer Gene McQuade, vice chairman Jay Sarles and
strategic planning head Brian Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a Motel-6,'' said one source who attended the
meeting. ``It was the last place anybody would expect us to be. And
that's why we went there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Wyndham, Murray and Gifford were absent _ and for a
reason. ``We wanted to see if we liked each other and could work
together, and we decided we did and could,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   From March 7-9, Fleet's board and key executives met in Palm
Beach, Fla. Unlike BankBoston's board, which still had qualms about
losing independence, Fleet's was keen to do a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BankBoston decided to step up talks with Fleet and
sent a team of 50 executives, in-house acquisitions specialists and
lawyers to New York, where Fleet's lawyers were ready to begin
crafting a deal. BankBoston also sent its corporate jet to Palm
Beach to pick up four Fleet executives and fly them to South
America, where they spent two days touring the bank's offices in
Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   With BankBoston's jet in service, Fleet offered its own jet to
fly Gifford and other BankBoston executives to New York on March
11. The team checked into the Four Seasons Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   That day, for the first time, Murray and Gifford called in their
investment bankers _ Goldman, Sachs and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette for Fleet, and Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter for BankBoston. A deal seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the next several days, teams from the two banks met in
all-night sessions to iron out several key sticking points before
drafting a formal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gifford was worried about what had happened to
David Coulter, the BankAmerica chief who sold his company to
NationsBank but was eventually pushed aside. Gifford, worried about
such a scenario, insisted on a guarantee that he would take over
the reins of combined Fleet-BankBoston when Murray retired in 2001.
In an unsual move, Murray agreed to amend Fleet's charter so that
any attempt by the board of directors to remove Gifford would
require an 80 percent supermajority.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Gifford also agreed to a board structure that would
make it dificult to attain that majority. The board of the merged
company has 22 members _ 12 from Fleet and 10 from BankBoston. Even
if all 12 Fleet members against Gifford, it would still take around
5 BankBoston members to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hard-wired Chad into the contract,'' one source said.
``He can't be Coulterized.
</P>
<P>
   Late on March 12, Murray and Gifford, along with an army of
lawyers and accountants, began discussing price for the deal,
finally agreeing on $53 per BankBoston share. That amount
represented a 13 percent premium over the closing price of the
bank's stock that day. Both sides met in the law offices of Fleet's
law firm, Wachtell Lipton Rosen &AMP; Katz, to begin drafting a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m Sunday morning, after lawyers for both sides had
settled 13 key issues, including executive compensation, a copy of
the merger agreement was delivered to each Fleet and BankBoston
executive's hotel room. Several BankBoston executives read the
draft and headed to St Patrick's for an early Mass, but were turned
away after a bomb scare at the famed New York cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., in the Wachtell Lipton offices, Gifford and Murray
shook hands on a final deal. Two hours later, Gifford and his team
flew to Boston for a meeting with the BankBoston board, which
approved the deal on Sunday night. Fleet's board also back the
acquisiton that night.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday night, Gifford was back in New York, where he met
Murray again at the law offices. The two formally signed the
agreement and then called Gifford's father.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston Corp. was born.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking on an issue that has always exposed the gulf
between haves and have-nots in the nation's capital, Mayor Anthony
Williams on Monday proposed moving the University of the District
of Columbia from its current location in northwest Washington, near
embassies and expensive homes, to Anacostia, the poorest section of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams suggested that the move would spur economic
development in both locations, the idea sparked instant and
widespread outrage from people who claimed that it reflected an
overwhelming insensitivity to the needs of low-income blacks, who
regard the university as a way out of neighborhoods that have been
ravaged by crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is upset about this. It's awful,'' said Lawanda
Johnson, a senior at the school who attended Williams' news
conference Monday to protest the plan. ``People are fighting to get
away from places like Anacostia. Where we go now is a way out. We
don't want to go back to look at crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said the proposal would primarily benefit real estate
developers who might buy the current property. Williams disputed
that contention, saying he was committed to keeping the university
open and thriving.
</P>
<P>
   The University of the District of Columbia was created 22 years
ago as the city's version of a state university, and as an
alternative for high school graduates who cannot afford more
expensive private institutions and older students who have
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the university's curricula expanded to
accommodate almost any subject imaginable, from aviation to gospel
singing, in an effort to help students earn a college degree. But
the city's financial troubles in the early 1990s forced a scaling
back that not only reduced course offerings but fueled speculation
that city leaders would prefer to close the school.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, defenders of the university have contended that
the need for a low-cost institution of higher learning, similar to
those available to state residents, offers city residents the best
chance to overcome generations of poverty. They also say the
university's location has reflected a symbolic assurance that city
leaders regard its students with the same respect accorded those
attending private universities in the city, like George Washington,
Georgetown, American, Catholic and Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning here for mayor last year, his first bid for elective
office after several years as the district's chief financial
officer, Williams supported those perceptions and promised to keep
the University of the District of Columbia as a four-year
institution, even though the undergraduate population fell by
nearly half, to 5,029 this year from 9,179 in 1996, because of
budget cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' idea of moving the university caught the city by
surprise, angering many who said the proposal reflected a larger
scheme: to marginalize the university for the benefit of real
estate tycoons who could make a fortune developing the property.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Williams said he was committed to
helping the school thrive. But as part of his first budget, he
proposed selling the school and using tax revenues from new
businesses at the current location to support a new campus in
Anacostia, which in turn would spur economic development in a
region of the city that needs it most.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have to think outside the box,'' Williams said. ``We have
to boost UDC up to a higher level of performance. We have to think
how we can do that in the overall concept of better government.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams brushed aside questions that suggested that his
proposal reflected a political naivete on his part, for wading into
an issue that touched raw nerves involving class and race.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that many district residents had questioned his
political instincts even when he was a mayoral candidate.
Nonetheless, he easily won the Democratic primary last September
and carried every precinct in the city in the November general
election, something his popular predecessor, Marion Barry Jr.,
never did in four terms as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get elected to adjust the air-conditioning,''
Williams said. ``I was elected to make some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took a swipe at Barry. ``I think it's important to send
a signal that this administration is ready to wade into areas where
others have feared to tread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While many other proposals in his budget suggested that other
city agencies face changes, few packed the emotional wallop of the
one concerning the university.
</P>
<P>
   On campus Monday, many students said they were angered by the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is nothing more than another attempt to shut us
down,'' said Diallo Sumbry, president of the senior class. ``If you
look at our history, we had our budget cut by 50 percent, then they
wanted to sell the school,''
</P>
<P>
   Lenox Yearwood Jr., the university's director of student life, a
1994 graduate and a former student government president, said: ``It
is racist at the core. They systematically dismantled our budget,
faculty and morale. This is back-door politics at its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would Georgetown students feel if we told them to leave
their home?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same view was shared by university leaders, past and
present. Roger Wilkens, a history professor at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., was a member of the University of the
District of Columbia's board of trustees from 1986 to 1991. He
lives in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was disappointed by Williams' proposal, arguing that
young people who have grown up with crime, drugs and shabby housing
need a beacon of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you create a first-rate institution in a city, then you
give parents and teachers the opportunity to say to little kids,
`Look up there on Connecticut Ave. Look at where you can go in
life,''' he said. ``It's a terrific place.''

LAYING THE GROUNDWORK

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Shigetoshi Hasegawa is a major-leaguer now, his
lifelong dream fulfilled. But it took some clever planning for the
onetime Japanese League player to make the jump across the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa, about to begin his third season with the Angels,
didn't want to be the first Japanese League player to attempt to
make the move. If he failed, it might close the door on others who
wanted to try.
</P>
<P>
   So Hasegawa sought out Hideo Nomo, at the time one of Japan's
best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come here before he did,'' said Hasegawa. ``I
talked to him and gave him the idea. I thought if he came here and
had success, I could try. Of course, he was the best pitcher in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa's plan worked. Nomo was the National League Rookie of
the Year in 1995 with the Dodgers. After Hasegawa pitched his sixth
season with the Orix Blue Wave in 1996, he signed with the Angels
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels don't regret it it all. The right-hander has become a
vital part of their bullpen. With Rich DeLucia, he'll be relied on
to set up closer Troy Percival. Last season, Hasegawa led all
American League relievers with 971/3 innings pitched and eight
victories. His durability has been a big plus, but he's anything
but a power pitcher. He's slight of build, listed at 5-foot-11 and
171 pounds, though he's probably closer to 160. He relies on good
control and outguessing the hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But it took time. Hasegawa struggled in his first year with the
Angels as he learned the hitters and the major-league game in
general. Hasegawa pitched in 50 games in 1997, including seven
starts, and went 3-7 with a 3.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first year, he kept pitching down-and-in to left-handed
hitters, because it's a good pitch in Japan,'' Percival said. ``I
asked him about it and he said `Down and in . . good pitch.' I said
`No, lefties here kill that pitch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Hasegawa made the necessary adjustments. On top of
that, he had hit the weights hard, something Japanese players don't
believe in as strongly as player in the U.S. The result was an
increase in velocity on his fastball from about 87 mph to 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand, Shige is very special,'' Percival
said. ``He's very strong mentally. Japanese players have a
reputation for that, but look at the problems (Hideki) Irabu had.
(Hasegawa) doesn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation Hasegawa made last year _ becoming one of the
Angels' most reliable relievers _ meant many more opportunities to
pitch. Maybe too many.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' starters completed only three games all season,
fewest in the American League. The bullpen was overworked at times
and Hasegawa was often in the middle of it. Angels manager Terry
Collins said he isn't worried about a carry-over effect on his
bullpen this year, except for possibly Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one guy we're going to have to wait and see about,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season alone probably would not have a negative effect on
Hasegawa, but Collins knows Hasegawa pitched six years in Japan,
all as a starter, compiling 903 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa, though, says he feels fine. And he's well-adjusted to
life not only in the majors but in the U.S. He bought a home in
Newport Beach and lives there year-round with his wife, Erie, and
2-year-old son, Kohto, who goes to preschool and is learning to
speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa also has become just one of the guys in the clubhouse,
which means he gets ribbed as anyone might. And he can dish it out
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season, the movie ``Midway'' was being shown in the
Angels clubhouse one day after Nomo and the Dodgers had beaten the
Angels. During the movie _ about one of the World War II battles
between the U.S. and Japan _ one Angel yelled at Hasegawa, ``How
about that, Shige?'' as U.S. planes bombed a Japanese ship.
</P>
<P>
   To which Hasegawa replied: ``Too bad you couldn't do that to
Nomo yesterday.''

NBC NAMES A NEW PRESIDENT FOR ITS ENTERTAINMENT DIVISION
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC on Monday named Garth Ancier, the former
president for entertainment at the WB network, as its president for
entertainment. The appointment, which had been expected, completes
NBC's plans to reshape its entertainment division under Scott
Sassa, as president of NBC's West Coast division, and Ancier.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa will replace Don Ohlmeyer in that position starting May
10, when Ancier joins NBC. Ohlmeyer, who led NBC to a dominant
position in prime-time ratings over the last five years, will move
into a new role starting in June, Sassa said. Ohlmeyer is expected
to stay at NBC, which is owned by General Electric, through the end
of this year, fulfilling his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ancier and Sassa said Monday that they intended to maintain
NBC's leadership position in television entertainment by focusing
on the identity the network has built over the last two decades.
Ancier called that identity ``the smart network.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier has deep roots at NBC, where he started his career in
1979. He left NBC in 1986 to become the first programmer for the
Fox network. He worked there until 1989, when he joined Walt Disney
as its top television production executive. After that, he served
for a time as an independent producer, creating the Ricki Lake talk
show for syndication.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said he and Ancier were longtime friends. ``For a lot of
reasons, he was an easy choice for this job,'' Sassa said.
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said he looked forward to the opportunity to return to
NBC not only because of his previous association with the network
but also because it meant a return to ``a full-service network
after helping start up two niche networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said NBC would remain a broad network, even in the face
of increasing competition, sticking generally with its appeal to
adult viewers younger than 50. ``It certainly will never be as
narrow as the WB or Fox, but in the future it will be impossible
for a network to be all things to all people,'' Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa said in January that he hoped to move NBC toward more
family shows and fewer shows set in New York City. Sassa said he
interpreted that directive as meaning NBC needed shows with ``more
nuclear families'' in them. ``Right now virtually every show takes
place in the workplace arena,'' he said. But he argued that NBC did
not necessarily need to be less urban.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have smart writing in a show even if it's not set in
an advertising agency,'' he said. ``Look at `Cheers.' That was set
in Boston, but it was more of a blue-collar show. My sense of NBC
is that they've tried to keep the network a cut above. They give
the audience more credit.''
</P>
<P>
   As for why he would leave WB, which he helped put on the
television map during the last three years with teen-age-oriented
hits like ``Seventh Heaven,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and
``Dawson's Creek,'' Anicer said: ``I just think there's a
difference between a full-service network and a niche network. NBC
has the most powerful distribution system in the business. It's
great to be a broadcaster and have that kind of broad cultural
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, NBC executives on Monday played down an article in
The New Yorker this week that pointed at a possible deal with the
Sony Corp. that would give NBC access to Sony's television studio
while providing Sony with a network outlet for its programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both NBC and Sony executives said that top executives of both
companies met last month in Tokyo but that no deals, or even the
framework for future deals, emerged from that meeting. No talks are
taking place now, they said.

 SEATTLE: public muster.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The state agriculture commissioner, Jim Jesernig, said recently
that state officials were getting ``beaten up by all sides''
already _ by tribal leaders and environmental groups who believe
that the likely measures will not do enough to protect the fish,
and by irate homebuilders and farmers, some of whom, he said, were
already calling state officials ``jack-booted Nazis'' for trying to
impose new regulations on how they use their land.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon species, including the Puget Sound Chinook, or king,
salmon, have been hurt in all kinds of ways by human development in
recent decades, by pollution and runoff that includes sewage and
chemicals from fertilizers, and by construction that in many cases
has simply closed off ancient waterways. Further inland, their runs
have been dramatically reduced by the huge dams that provide the
region's famously cheap and abundant hydroelectric power, and yet
another looming battle in the whole salmon-restoration issue will
be whether those dams should be modified or even taken down
someday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many local officials here said they are convinced that
there is a way to help the salmon and help people at the same time,
especially since many people here list ``runaway growth'' or
``sprawl'' as one of their dominant concerns. And they think there
is a way to do it without the kind of legal rancor that has
attended endangered-species listings elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked very hard at many of those cases,'' Tim Ceis,
director of the Endangered Species Act policy coordination office
for King County, said in a briefing on Monday. ``The lawyers were
the ones making the money. Nobody was spending any money on the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits may be inevitable, from both sides. Washington
state's Building Industry Association, representing developers,
says that the salmon issue is being used to stop growth and that
the likely proposals for building restrictions show that local
regulators have ``lost all common sense.'' With the Seattle
metropolitan area projected to add as many as one million people to
its population total in the next 25 years, some skeptics say the
fish do not stand a chance, no matter what regulations are put in
place now.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, on the other hand, say that the issue can
be a win-win for the both salmon and human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special-interest defenders of the status quo who oppose real
action to save salmon would have you believe the listings will
produce a shattered economy, a Cuba-on-the-Sound,'' said Tim
Stearns, executive director of Save our Wild Salmon, an
environmental group. ``That kind of thinking is laughable, and in
fact, the opposite is true. If our governor and state legislature
get serious about salmon restoration, we would see enormous gains
in our quality of life and real economic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Tuesday, by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, will extend Endangered Species Act protections to wild
salmon found in nearly every watershed in Washington state, as well
as in parts of Oregon's Willamette Valley. The endangered fish
include the Puget Sound chinook, the Lower Columbia River chinook,
Upper Columbia spring chinook, Lake Ozette sockeye, Hood Canal
summer chum, Lower Columbia chum and the Mid-Columbia steelhead.
Decisions were delayed for six months on four other salmon runs in
California and Oregon.

PHOTOGRAPHERS STAGE A WALKOUT AT THE GAULTIER SHOW  
 THE NATURAL LOOK

   PHOTOGRAPHERS PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hundreds of photographers who swooped down on Paris
from around the world to cover the fall 1999 fashion shows left
without film from Jean Paul Gaultier. At Gaultier's show Friday
night, a number of photographers blocked the entrance and shouted
to protest their difficult working conditions. Others refused to
cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions had begun building earlier in the week at the Chloe
show, where photographers were made to stand in a sweltering room
on a platform that several of them said was dangerous. The
situation boiled over when the Gaultier house issued credentials to
80 photographers but had room for only 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just glad everyone stuck together,'' said one American
photographer, who insisted that his name not be used for fear of
retaliation, underlining the uneasy relationship between designers
and the photographers who disseminate their work. ``We're
professionals who travel around the world to work, and they make us
wait in the rain and stand for hours without water.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Gaultier said backstage: ``I think it's very
wrong when you have worked months and weeks, preparing the show.
They came three times this week to this same place to see other
shows. I'm a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists will have to make do with images provided by the
company, or they won't run any pictures, a loss to all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Klensch, a producer and the host of ``Style With Elsa
Klensch'' on CNN, said the situation had changed drastically since
she began covering for the cable news service in 1980. ``When I
first started, there were about three cameras in Milan and 20 at
most in Paris,'' she said. ``There's been an enormous change in the
way fashion's covered, and I don't think the fashion industry has
kept up.''
</P>
<P>
   NATURAL MAKEUP
</P>
<P>
   Women will be happy to hear that the trend toward natural
makeup, which took off for spring, will continue for fall. Loewe,
Chanel, Valentino, Gaultier and Celine all showed little makeup but
for dark ruby or deep red lips and a pale face, perhaps influenced
by all the Elizabethan films.
</P>
<P>
   Blow-dry looks, lightly crimped hair and braids, a mix of the
homey and the exotic, were also popular. ``It's more CBGB than
Studio 54,'' said Narciso Rodriguez, the designer for Loewe. Dick
Page, who did the makeup for Loewe and Celine and for Calvin Klein
in New York, said he achieved the look using Rouge Baiser No. 117,
an old French lipstick found in Paris drugstores. ``The rest of the
face is very smooth and clean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ONE GLOVE CLAPPING
</P>
<P>
   A passionate advocate for shoes as the root of all fashion,
Benoit Meleard, is the new designer for the Loewe shoe collection.
During show week, Meleard staged a show with his shoes, which can
only be described as weird. They are certainly provocative with
their square box shape and, often, no heel.
</P>
<P>
   His black leather shoes with red buttons down the side are an
ode to Patrick Kelly. His red and black glove _ Meleard does
gloves, too _ with a heel where one of the fingers should be, is a
homage to Michael Jackson in his ``Thriller'' days.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilling though the glove may be, even Isabella Blow, the
fashion editor of the Sunday Times of London magazine and an
epicure of the avante-garde, refused to wear it. She has supported
the talented Meleard by wearing his box shoes, which she swears are
comfortable, and was at his showroom on Sunday to be fitted for
another pair. Meleard was impatient with Blow about the glove. But
it was he against her and Andre Leon Talley, the imposing Vogue
editor, who had also dropped by. ``It's a bit too kitsch for me,''
Blow said, pushing her short blue hair off her face.
</P>
<P>
   At that, all eyebrows in the room shot up.

 Column: Common Sense to Reign in Choosing a Name for
Robertson  Stephens 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One of the various and sundry things that annoy me about bank
mergers is having to traffic in their balkanized monikers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Fleet Financial's $15 billion buyout of Beantown
rival BankBoston yesterday, what in the devil are they going to
call what's left of the former Robertson Stephens? 
Fleet-Financial-BankBoston-Not-Quite-Nations-Bank-Almost-BankAmerica
-Once-Upon-a-Time-Robertson-Stephens Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   Gratefully not.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, cooler chowderheads may prevail. In what might be
construed as an ample dose of old fashioned New England
sensibility, Fleet's brass is expected to call its newly acquired
investment banking boutique ``Robertson Stephens.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchy, eh? How much do you suppose Fleet needed to fork over to
corporate identity titan Landor Associates to come up with that
one?
</P>
<P>
   As much as I applaud this return to simpler times, I think Fleet
shouldn't be so hasty. I respectfully submit that they borrow some
branding moxie from a multimillion-dollar one-man music corporation
in Minneapolis and call their new division ``the San Francisco
investment banking boutique formerly known as Robertson Stephens.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one warped person's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   You have to admit that the firm that Sandy and Paul built has
been through its fair share of deals. Starting with the original
buyout by the old BankAmerica in 1997, Robbie Stephens now will
have been subjected to four takeovers in less than two years. That
kind of frenetic pace is enough to make Gordon Gekko break for
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the 225 people employed by BancBoston
Robertson seemed unfazed by the news, employees at the firm say. As
one would expect, the firm has experienced employee and client
turnover as a result of the distracting mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbie Stephens hasn't fallen victim to churning to the same
extent that the former Montgomery Securities has seen under
NationsBank, investment bankers say. What's more, most of the
bankers and analysts who were unhappy with the mergers have already
left for greener pastures by this point, investment banking sources
say. ``I've been here for every one of these mergers and I'm pretty
numb to it,'' says one BancBoston Robertson Stephens employee.
</P>
<P>
   While BancBoston Robertson Stephens chief executive Michael
McCaffery admits that his firm has suffered from employee turnover,
he was not willing to quantify how much. However, McCaffery says it
is ``less than the industry average.''
</P>
<P>
   ```The transaction is an awesome opportunity for our firm ...
and is an excellent deal for shareholders and for the New England
region,'' McCaffery says.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good deal for Robbie Stephens employees who have
stuck around, especially top executives. While some of the firm's
equity partners have been bought out twice, the Fleet deal does not
make for a triple-dip. Robbie was a unit of BankBoston and not an
independent entity this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robbie employees make out OK. A retention pool of
BankBoston stock options worth $100 million is now worth about $150
million. The premium paid by Fleet for BankBoston's shares accounts
for the bump. What's more, those stock options become vested
immediately after Fleet closes its buyout of BankBoston, which is
slated for later this year, says a person familiar with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in short, Robbie employees get paid more for their
options, plus they get to cash them out sooner, as most shares were
previously slated to become vested in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; REBUTTAL: &LR;  Occasionally, we at Street Smarts hear from subjects of
the column who, well, putting it mildly, have a different
perspective than ours.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, such disparity of opinion and analysis is espoused
with venom and spite. Other times, it is conveyed in a more civil
and constructive tone.
</P>
<P>
   A recent response by Dr. Neil Gesundheit, vice president and
chief medical officer at Vivus, falls under the latter category. In
a thoughtful yet pointed retort, Gesundheit raises two issues with
last week's column that warned investors about the volatility
surrounding Vivus' shares. (Vivus is a Mountain View maker of male
impotence treatments that last week announced it won a patent that
could lead to a treatment for female sexual dysfunction.)
</P>
<P>
   Gesundheit articulated two basic beefs. The first involved a
financial analyst's view that Vivus' patent was ``broad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When a patent protection is described as `broad,' it typically
means that it encompasses a significant amount of intellectual
property. Thus, a `broad' patent is powerful, whereas a `narrow'
patent provides little protection. I believe that you
misinterpreted the word `broad' in your article by implying that it
was easy to circumvent a broad patent. The opposite is true: A
broad patent implies that the inventor has been granted significant
protection under patent law,'' Geshundheit argues.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the analyst we spoke to, Sergio Traversa of
Mehta Partners in New York, says he meant what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad, I meant it covered a big product area. Not that it
brought broad protection,'' emphasizes Traversa.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I meant it differently than (Geshundheit),'' Traversa
says. ``I see the patent as vulnerable to attack by large amount of
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The second issue Geshundheit raises has to do with my comment
about Vivus' staying power in the face of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra clearly is, as you have described it, a pop-culture
phenomenon. But the less glamorous story about Viagra is that its
use has been associated with the death of more than 200 patients.
The FDA has documented these events in their numerous safety
updates,'' Geshundheit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety record of Muse (Vivus' rival treatment to Pfizer's
Viagra) is pristine, and what motivates us at our small company is
to make the public aware of the dramatic discrepancy between the
safety records of the two drugs. If your father had impotence,
there is no question about which drug you would want him to take.
We are motivated at Vivus to be true to the Hippocratic oath of
`primum non nocere' (above all, do no harm). That is what drives us
to keep slugging away at the Viagra Goliath,'' Geshundheit states.
</P>
<P>
   Got me there. Perhaps, the reported dangers and health risks of
Viagra should be a bigger drag on Pfizer's shares or should give
Muse a competitive boost. Unfortunately for Vivus shareholders,
that hasn't always been the case. Vivus closed yesterday at $3.75,
up 25 cents.

   Winter coat weather persists in many parts of the country, but
thoughts of spring have already stirred fashion-conscious shoppers
to snap up the coming season's cover-up of choice, the poncho.
Stores report that many styles have already sold out, but some are
still in stock.
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, there are nylon rain ponchos from Steve by
Searle in black or stone ($225) and from Adrienne Landau in

ANOTHER PEN PAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ For better or worse, the Dodgers are
trumpeting the pitching of left-handed reliever Onan Masaoka. He
struck out three Houston Astros in two innings Monday afternoon,
including Ken Caminiti and Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Masaoka, that part of the game could be a possible role
for him,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I wanted to see
how he takes to situations. So far he's scored well. He's passed
some tests. I figured he might get his lunch (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   That Masaoka is making a serious run for the left-hander's job
in the bullpen is both good and bad news for the Dodgers. It means
someone is finally beginning to distinguish himself in that role,
but it also means the Dodgers might have to count on a 21-year-old
with nothing more than Double-A experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the organization wants him to start in Double-A,''
Johnson said. ``But there's discussion on whether his best role
will be in starting or relieving.''
</P>
<P>
   When spring training began, Masaoka was the least-likely
candidate for the left-hander's job. Instead, the Dodgers brought
in veterans Greg Cadaret, Chris Haney and Pedro Borbon. Cadaret
(five innings, five runs, two earned) hasn't been sharp and Borbon
(four innings, two runs) has been erratic. Haney has allowed one
run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Masaoka hasn't allowed a run in three appearances and
opponents are hitting .053 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's really dominating so it's still up in the air,''
Dodgers pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``Right now, for me,
Masaoka has the best stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka is also new to the bullpen, converted from a starter
late last season in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer relieving, just going (to a game) and knowing I have
a chance to pitch,'' Masaoka said. ``I know they're looking for a
left-handed reliever. I like coming out of the bullpen, throwing
hard and going one or two innings.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the week Johnson will begin setting up his bullpen.
He said he was sure about Jeff Shaw closing and Alan Mills setting
up, but Hough voiced concern over Mel Rojas, struggling with his
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starting slow: Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort might be
the Dodgers' fifth starter, but he's not feeling good about it yet.
Dreifort threw 75 pitches, allowing two hits and three runs and
walking five in three innings against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he worries about his position, Dreifort said, ``All the
time. If you get complacent there's going to be someone younger
than you, doing better than you, working harder than you. There's
someone who will take your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is 1-0 with a 5.63 ERA in three spring outings, but he
isn't completely comfortable with starting. A year in the rotation
doesn't offset a career's worth of relieving, and Dreifort is
struggling with how to pace himself in starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I'm still learning,'' he said. ``It's
something I don't really believe, but everyone talks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson said he'll wait until today
to decide whether catcher Todd Hundley will make his first
Grapefruit League appearance behind the plate. . . . Hough said
Shaw will make his spring debut either Thursday or Friday. Hough is
hoping to get Shaw into six or seven games before the season.

COMMISSIONERS OF EUROPEAN UNION RESIGN AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF
CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The entire executive leadership of the European Union in
Brussels, 20 highly paid members of a powerful bureaucracy
appointed by the 15 member countries, resigned early Tuesday
morning after an independent panel accused the group of chronic
cronyism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the light of the report, the members of the commission have
unanimously decided this evening to collectively submit their
resignation,'' said Jacques Santer, president of the European
Commission, who announced the move hours after he and his
colleagues received the report Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The mass resignation was the first since the original European
Economic Community was founded 42 years ago. It was an outgrowth of
the increased power of the elected European Parliament, whose
investigations of alleged wrongdoing by the bureaucracy in Brussels
led to the appointment of the panel at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A new 626-member European Parliament will be elected in early
June. Long regarded by leaders of the member countries and by the
commissioners they appoint to five-year terms as a toothless
assembly of politicoes, the Parliament has been given increased
legislative power in recent years and repeatedly asserted its
willingness to use that power.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a European Parliamentary investigation of reports of
corruption and malfeasance by commission members led to a vote of
censure, but it did not win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Elected legislators had long demanded greater accountability
from the faceless ``bureaucrats in Brussels'' long railed against
by such European leaders as Margaret Thatcher, who denounced their
power when she was prime minister of Britain from 1979 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European Union rules, only the commission can propose
European-wide legislation, and last year it proposed measures the
member states will debate later this month to change
decision-making procedures and rein in expenditures in the European
Union's $100-billion annual budget, almost half of which goes to
agricultural price supports to benefit farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners were also regularly denounced for issuing
directives and decrees that range from regulating the permitted
size of bananas to deciding whether unpasteurized milk can be used
to make cheeses like Camembert (yes in France, but soon maybe not
in Britain).
</P>
<P>
   The commission also sits in on trade bodies and consults with
the European Central Bank that administers the new common European
currency, the euro, introduced at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Elected European leaders from Mrs. Thatcher to more
Europe-friendly government chiefs like Germany's former chancellor,
Helmut Kohl, have periodically criticized the perception of
untrammeled power by meddling bureaucrats on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected demise of the commissioners at the hands of the
independent five-man investigating committee set up after last
January's unsuccessful censure vote will make this spring's
European Parliament election campaign a crucial one.
</P>
<P>
   Santer, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, was named by the
leaders of member states in 1994 to a term that was to expire at
the end of this year. The leaders are scheduled to meet in Berlin
in two weeks and could name a new commission then.
</P>
<P>
   The independent panel's 140-page report was shown to the
commissioners Monday evening before being released to the public.
Earlier accounts said that it detailed cronyism and financial
irregularities at the top of the European Union's executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited several commissioners for lax control over aid
and other programs for which they were responsible, accusing them
of putting friends and relatives on their payroll and pleading
ignorance when asked why they did not act sooner to stop waste and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The report said fraud and corruption passed ``unnoticed'' at the
top of the institution that runs the European Union's day-to-day
affairs, and dismissed the defense by some commissioners that they
had been unaware of how bad things were.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Cresson, a former French prime minister who was the
commissioner for research, education, youth and training, had been
accused by members of the European Parliament of favoritism in
hiring outside consultants, giving contracts to a dentist from her
home town and his son. ``Should we only work with people we have
never met?'' Mrs. Cresson responded when questioned about the
propriety of these contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent independent report concluded: ``It is becoming
difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Green, leader of the Socialist group in the European
Parliament, which sits in Strasbourg, France, and Brussels, spoke
after the report was released of a ``collective responsibility for
mismanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilfried Martens, leader of the Christian Democrats in the
Parliament, said that European Union commissioners had lost control
of management.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud report was harshest on Cresson, who it said ``failed
to act in response to known, serious and continuing irregularities
over several years'' in educational and other programs for which
she was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that when informed of fraud and waste by an
outside contractor who squandered $160 million meant for a youth
training program, she failed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   She also was criticized for getting a short-term European Union
research job for a friend in 1995 for which the man was later
judged to be unqualified. He was paid for 10 months but was
allegedly out sick for nine.
</P>
<P>
   The report condemned others for cronyism, too, The Associated
Press reported from Brussels on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Development Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies of
Germany, and Portugal's Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner for
relations with developing nations, put friends and relatives on the
European payroll, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It cited Development commissioner Manuel Marin, a Spaniard, for
lax control over the running of an aid program for Mediterranean
nations, for irregularities in hiring, and for doing too little too
late to stop fraud in the European humanitarian aid budget in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was no evidence any commissioner ``was
directly and personally involved'' in fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners, who are paid about $200,000 a year, had
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The report found no irregularities in the office of Santer, the
commission's president. But it did express dismay he did not act
sooner on allegations of fraud in security contracts for European
Union buildings in Brussels dating back to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud report stemmed from testimony last December in the
European Parliament by Paul van Buitenen, a Dutch auditor, who
complained about the failure of the commission to eradicate fraud.

 &HT;    New Senate sounds like old House
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This year the Georgia Senate and House have undergone
a widely noted role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where party hostilities used to crackle, bills
routinely pass with large bipartisan majorities and party leaders
rise, more often than they did before at least, to thank the other
party for its cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   It's the other side of the building, where members of the two
parties used to get along in such chummy fashion, that has become
the partisan arena.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans in the Senate had their first quarrel
over the disputed election last fall that Democrat Sonny Huggins
won in a recount over Republican Jeff Mullis, and have skirmished
throughout this session over issues ranging from committee
assignments to bill sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   This spells trouble for the legislative pay raise bill, which
passed the House last week on a comfortable 118-57 vote. About a
third of the House Republicans voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   In another year, passage by the Senate would only be a victory
lap for the bill, which follows a citizen panel's recommendation to
raise legislators' pay from $11,347 to $16,200 after the next
election. But Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor has warned the bill will have to
have bipartisan support to get anywhere in the Senate, and Minority
Leader Eric Johnson said Monday he can't give an accurate tally of
Republican support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   With relations as strained as they are in the Senate, it's hard
to see how the bill could get the level of bipartisan support it
received in the House, although Taylor said he thought the part of
the bill granting pay raises to state constitutional officers might
be another story.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has not been shy about his intention to run the Senate in
a different way from his predecessor, Pierre Howard, who shared key
committee assignments with the GOP. ``Cry me a river,'' he said
recently after Republican Sen. Sonny Perdue complained he'd not
been properly recognized as sponsor of a bill.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday, however, that he thinks he's being ``a very fair
presiding officer,'' and that Republican legislation and budget
projects are moving through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a split within their caucus between those who want to
be more partisan and others who want to be more bipartisan, and
that's for their caucus to work out. They're divided and we're
united,'' Taylor added.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, on the other hand, believes Taylor is unfairly
punishing Senate Republicans for his bitter race last year against
Mitch Skandalakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all defended Mark when specific constituents called us''
over allegations about drug use and other matters that came up in
the campaign, ``but he apparently feels like we should have called
a press conference and blasted our own nominee,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the House-Senate role reversal, House Minority Leader Bob
Irvin thinks it's really a matter of perception. Irvin did credit
new Chairman Calvin Smyre with opening up the Rules Committee
process, allowing more Republican-sponsored bills to get on the
calendar than in years past, but he was skeptical whether the House
had really become less partisan than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is about like it always was, and the Senate has
become the House,'' he said.

   BC-NATO-POLAND-SCENE-NYT (moved on Friday, Mar. 12)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Friday, Mar. 12,
about the celebration in Poland on joining NATO misstated the date
of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, an event commemorated on the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, where the NATO ceremony was held. It
was April 1943, not October 1944.
</P>
<P>
   BC-OBIT-STRAX-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Mar. 10)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Dr. Philip Strax, sent by the New York Times
News Service on Wednesday, Mar. 10, misstated the date of an
interview in which he explained that a good physical examination of
the breast included instruction in self-examination. It was in
1986, not 1966.
</P>
<P>
   BC-OBIT-MENUHIN-NYT (moved on Friday, Mar. 12)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Yehudi Menuhin sent by the New York Times News
Service on Friday, Mar. 12, omitted an honor he received from the
British throne and thus misstated his title. In addition to
granting him a knighthood in 1966, Queen Elizabeth II made him a
life peer in 1993. So he was Lord Menuhin, not Sir Yehudi.
</P>
<P>
   The obituary also misspelled the surname of his first wife. She
was Nola Ruby Nicholas, not Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   BC-OBIT-SAYAO-NYT (moved on Friday, Mar. 12)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Bidu Sayao sent by the New York Times News
Service on Friday, Mar. 12, misstated her age. She was 96, not 94.
The obituary also omitted Ms. Sayao's most celebrated recording.
The piece, ``Bachiana Brasileira No. 5,'' is a vocalise _ an aria
without words _ transcribed for her by the Brazilian composer
Heitor Villa-Lobos.

U.S. CHARGES INVOLVING SALE OF BODY PARTS ARE DISMISSED
</HEADLINE>

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal charges against two men accused of conspiring
to sell human organs taken from Chinese prisoners were dismissed on
Monday by a judge who sharply criticized the government for
building its case on an informant she denounced as ``a fraudulent
opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Deborah A. Batts of the U.S. District Court here said the
informant, Paul Risenhoover, had been seeking to overthrow the
Chinese government and might have entrapped the two defendants. She
said Risenhoover was now refusing to return from abroad to appear
at the trial, which denied the defendants their constitutional
right to cross-examine him.
</P>
<P>
   While Batts did not rule on the merits of the charges against
the defendants, Cheng Yong Wang and Xingqi Fu, she seemed to agree
that Risenhoover had orchestrated much of the illegal activity in
the case, and had pushed the defendants to join the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Risenhoover, Carlyle R. Hatfield, said his client
denied any wrongdoing and had refused to return to testify because
his wife is Chinese, and Risenhoover feared that Chinese officials
might retaliate against her extended family in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Risenhoover is one of the most patriotic people I know,''
Hatfield said. ``This is his country and he loves it very deeply.
His motivations are based on historical precedent and religious
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in New York would not say Monday night
whether they would appeal the judge's decision, but they defended
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government believes that its investigation and prosecution
of this case was responsible and well founded,'' said Herbert
Hadad, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney. ``We
respectfully disagree with the judge's analysis and conclusion, and
we are reviewing her opinion and assessing our options.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had been widely watched because the charges
appeared to confirm dissidents' allegations of a thriving trade in
China in which kidneys and other organs taken from executed
prisoners are sold for use in transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which suggested that the activity had reached the
United States, had also received attention because it resulted from
a kind of private sting operation run by a prominent human rights
advocate, Harry Wu, who made his findings available to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, which then conducted its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Wu declined to comment on the dismissal of the case because of
the possibility of an appeal, but he reiterated his view that the
organ trade ``is a violation of human rights, and you cannot
dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 155-page opinion, Batts also attacked the government's
investigative work, charging that some records had been submitted
to the grand jury with pages missing and that a secretly taped
conversation of a meeting between Wang, an FBI agent and
Risenhoover had been mistranslated by Risenhoover. In what she
called ``the most egregious'' example, the judge quoted an
undercover FBI agent asking Wang whether unclaimed bodies of
Chinese prisoners are ``buried'' or ``sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang replies in Mandarin Chinese that they are buried, not sold,
the judge said. But Risenhoover translates as if Wang has indicated
that the bodies were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has described himself as a former Chinese prosecutor on
Hainan Island, China, and Fu is a Chinese citizen who runs a
laundry in New York. Their lawyers praised the judge's ruling
Monday.

<P>
   TORONTO _ The Canadian House of Commons passed legislation on
Monday intended to protect the country's magazine industry from
American competition for advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials from both countries are trying to negotiate a
compromise and prevent a trade war.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which essentially prohibits advertising in Canadian
editions of U.S.-owned magazines, can be amended before it is sent
to the Canadian Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect the bill as it stands now to become the law of
the land,'' said Richard W. Fisher, the deputy U.S. trade
representative, adding that talks with Canadian officials had been
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The United States contends that the legislation in its current
form violates the North American and world trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the two countries, each other's largest trading
partner, are expected to meet again in Ottawa on March 19.

NETS JETTISON CALIPARI
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Less than two months ago, John Calipari had every
reason to believe he was on the verge of leading the New Jersey
Nets to their best season in the National Basketball Association
and, in doing so, would solidify his image as a program builder who
could take teams from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, after losing the ear of his players somewhere
along the way to an almost unexplainable 3-17 record, it all came
crashing down, with Calipari being dismissed as the Nets' head
coach and executive vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   A drawn-out series of events that strongly hinted at Calipari's
demise came to a conclusion Monday when Lewis Katz, the Nets'
principal owner, officially relieved the third-year coach of his
duties. Calipari, 40, who joined the Nets amid praise and high
expectations on June 7, 1996, has more than two seasons and $6
million left on his contract. He will receive the remainder of the
money owed to him, and in a strange twist, was offered another job
by Katz in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have high regard for John Calipari as a friend and as
someone I have come to respect as a basketball professional,'' Katz
said in explaining the unexpected gesture. ``I offered him a
position as an adviser to myself with specific reference to
basketball-related issues. I hope he will consider this and remain
with the organization in some capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz's offer seemed to be an attempt to save some face for
Calipari, and while it seems unlikely that Calipari will remain
with the Nets in any capacity, he said he had not made a decision
one way or the other. For now, he was left to contemplate the utter
disaster his team became in only 20 games of a shortened NBA
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a part of coaching,'' said Calipari who had a 72-112
record with the Nets. ``When you're 3-17, that falls onto the
coach, and I understand that.'' Don Casey, who has been Calipari's
first assistant for the past two and a half seasons, was named the
Nets' coach on an interim basis. While there is at least a
possibility that Casey could eventually become the permanent head
coach, the club has been pursuing Phil Jackson, who coached the
Chicago Bulls to six championships this decade, for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Casey will coach his first game Tuesday at Toronto, but his
first move as the head man took place Monday night when, following
Katz's orders, he dismissed the remaining members of Calipari's
coaching staff _ the assistants Johnny Davis, Kenny Gattison and
Jack Haley _ as they were boarding the bus to go to a team practice
at the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   When the ax finally fell, Calipari and his three unemployed
assistants sat down in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel here on
Monday evening, looking battered and stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari and Katz had flown in from New Jersey on the owner's
private jet only an hour earlier, with Calipari then meeting with
his former players in an apparently unemotional session that lasted
only about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal said, `Thank you,' and that's about it,'' said Jayson
Williams, the Nets' outspoken center who often clashed with
Calipari. ``I'm glad that he came up. It's never easy to see
anybody go. A lot of people are going to think that because of me
and Cal's relationship that I had something to do with it. But that
was the total opposite. I don't like to see anybody lose their
livelihood, lose something they love.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Calipari sat between Katz and the Nets
president Michael Rowe and addressed reporters. It was an unusual
news conference in that Katz and Rowe spoke as if they had done
Calipari a favor by releasing him. They claimed that the constant
losing had dogged Calipari so much that he needed a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there was any determining factor, but it was
pretty obvious that he was in his misery as he watched the season
slip away when there had been such high expectations when the
season started,'' Katz said. Rowe, whose relationship with Calipari
has been strained from the beginning, said he realized how much of
a toll the disappointing season was taking on Calipari when the
coach wondered out loud a few weeks ago why his players were not
performing better, why his plans were not being followed.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to be polite even as he was being fired, Calipari
accepted their statements of sympathy. But in his own remarks he
made it clear that he was not happy to be losing a chance at
finishing what he had started three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that they care about me,'' Calipari said of Katz
and Rowe. ``But I came in with a five-year plan and I have
two-and-a-half years left. We hit a bump in the road, but I wanted
to push forward and get over it.''

LOS ANGELES LIKELY TO GET 32ND FRANCHISE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ National Football League owners appear ready to select
Los Angeles as the site for the league's 32nd club, which would be
expected to begin play in 2002. But in a twist, the owners would
hold open bidding for new groups in Los Angeles to toss in their
hats for team ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a group in Los Angeles led by the real estate
developer Ed Roski and the construction and insurance magnate Eli
Broad wants to obtain a team in Los Angeles to a refurbished Los
Angeles Coliseum. Another group, headed by the Hollywood mogul
Michael Ovitz, wants to put the team in Los Angeles and build a new
stadium in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But owners here say there are trouble spots in both plans. At
the Coliseum, owners are concerned about the project's being tied
into a mall, the area surrounding the Coliseum, parking and other
infrastructure issues. In Carson, roads and public support are the
chief concerns.
</P>
<P>
   So, the league might award Los Angeles a franchise, take control
of the franchise for six months to a year and then present the
opportunity to the current groups bidding and to any others
interested. According to several owners, there is more interest in
Los Angeles, parties who have arrived late in the game and need a
backdoor to enter. This would be it.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that some owners were more
concerned with ``what kind of partner they will have,'' and others
think the discussion should end at which group ``makes the highest
bid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league also discussed these items on Monday:
the collective bargaining agreement, stadium projects including new
buildings in Denver, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, NFL properties
and enterprises, and the Internet and its role in the future of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   The league meetings continue on Tuesday with more discussions on
expansion and on the proposed sale of the Washington Redskins to
Howard Milstein. The competition committee and the owners will
begin discussions on instant replay and a vote among the owners
will most likely follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Replay has gained another advocate in Bill Walsh, the former
49ers coach and Hall of Famer, who recently rejoined the 49ers'
front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes are so high, so costly, why not have a way to correct
it?'' Walsh asked. ``And its going to be easy to facilitate. I
think its going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue agreed, adding that the competition committee, led by
Coach Mike Holmgren of Seattle and General Manager Rich McKay of
Tampa Bay, had indicated to him that the votes ``appeared to be
there'' for instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   A decision could be made on Tuesday concerning the exiled 49ers
owner Eddie DeBartolo. Last year, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a
felony charge of failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by
former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in connection with DeBartolo's
bid for a riverboat gambling license.

TEXAS GIRLS' FAMILIES CALL ORDEAL `FIVE WEEKS OF HELL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTI MUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE JACKSON, Texas _ As police and prosecutors considered
charges against a trio of adults who drove two runaway teen-agers
to Mexico, the families of the girls described their time away as
``five weeks of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of Harmony Olachia and Nicole Conrad, both 14, on
Monday declined to answer questions about the ordeal, citing ``the
sensitive nature of the traumatic experiences the young girls have
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston lawyer Guy Womack, asked to represent the teens and
offer support during their weekend interviews with law enforcement
authorities, said that the girls spent several days in a cave in
Mexico, eating whatever they could find and virtually living off
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The girls remained quiet during a Monday press conference as
Olachia's youth minister, Greg Pickering, read a statement from the
families, saying in part: ``Nicole and Harmony have been through
five weeks of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls called home hungry and homesick Thursday from Parral,
Mexico. They were flown back to the Houston area Saturday, where
investigators began piecing together the story of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The pair had left behind handwritten letters telling their
parents that God told them to leave, and their youth minister said
Olachia also told other members of her youth group that she was
going to Mexico. The friends, however, did not think she was
serious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It all started after the arrival of a longtime family friend to
the Olachia home. Tara Burmeister, also known as Tara Nelson, was a
friend of Harmony Olachia's older sister and grew up in the Lake
Jackson area, the family said. She visited the family at Christmas
with James Paul Nelson, whom she introduced as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, the pair returned to visit unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the couple started talking to the teens about the
so-called ``Y2K'' computer problem and the potential for the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was talked about that the central part of Mexico was
a safe haven,'' said Lake Jackson police Sgt. Harold Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe James Nelson's uncle, Richard Eugene Brown, was
also staying in the Lake Jackson area that weekend and left with
the couple and the teens.
</P>
<P>
   According to Womack, the five left in a pickup with a camper
attachment, but abandoned the camper as they drove into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Jackson police were talking with the Brazoria County
district attorney's office late Monday about filing charges of
enticing a child and harboring a runaway against all three adults.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of Brown, 39, James Nelson, 27, and Tara
Burmeister, 21 _ all of whom had addresses in Milton, Fla. _ were
unknown Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' homecoming was a welcome development to authorities,
but the investigation about the initial disappearance as well as
the three adults' roles in that disappearance continued. Police
hope to talk more with the teens later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The families contend Brown escorted the teens to Parral last
week and encouraged them to call their parents after Nelson and
Burmeister said they were going for food and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   The teens also have been interviewed by FBI agents, who continue
to investigate the case to determine whether kidnapping charges
will be lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city workers Monday were taking down numerous yellow
ribbons tied to trees throughout the streets of Lake Jackson since
the girls' disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazoswood High freshmen are both soccer players, and their
good health when they left obviously served them well during days
with little or no food, said Womack.
</P>
<P>
   When they stopped Saturday for their first meal back in the
United States, Womack said they ate more pancakes than he had ever
seen consumed in one sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were extremely hungry,'' he said.

HOUSING PRICES IN L.A'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CLIMB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Housing prices in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley
remained strong during February, soaring 22 percent from year-ago
levels, even as sales fell for the third consecutive month, a trade
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed on 704 single-family homes last month, a decrease
of 85, or 10.8 percent, from February 1998, the Southland Regional
Association of Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the median price, the point at which half the homes
sold for more and half for less, hit $210,000, a jump of $38,000
from the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that a sales decline during the first two months
of the year is typical and that the first two months' results do
not usually foreshadow the market's performance for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to reach any conclusion about trends with the
February numbers because the purchase patterns are different,''
said John Karevoll, an analyst for Acxiom/DataQuick, a real estate
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year brings investors into the market because
prices are usually about 7 percent lower than during the prime
buying months in the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-owner-occupied part of the market is always stronger''
this time of year, Karevoll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are out there now,'' he said. ``There is a bit of a
bottom feeding going on out there and we can tell that by how they
finance the properties and how fast they close.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the number of buyers paying cash for a home is
typically higher in January and February than during the rest of
the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we still should have a great spring. I don't know
if it will be as great as last year's, but it definitely will be up
there,'' said Beth Sommer, president of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   And a tight inventory of product on the market is helping to
slow sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are more cautious today and the inventory of choice
homes for sale is still thin, which slows the race to buy,'' Sommer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Karevoll said that even with rising prices, housing
affordability remains high because interest rates are low and
financing is readily available.
</P>
<P>
   This helped keep the condominium market firm last month with
escrow closing on 227 units, up 2.7 percent from a year ago. The
median price of $117,500 increased 13 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller Santa Clarita Valley market, escrow closed on 154
single-family homes, an increase of 2 percent from February 1998.
The median price was $220,000, up nearly 16 percent from a year
ago.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE GURU IS WAITING FOR A CALL
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greetings, basketball fans, from Woodstock, N.Y., sabbatical
retreat, where the snow is fresh and the air is clean, and on a
clear day, you can just about pick up the NBC signal coming out of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I have much use for television, given my meditations as
Big Chief Triangle, which is what the coach of the Knicks took to
calling me a few years ago. Clever little guy, that Gumby, though
he should have listened to the fellow in The New York Times, who
advised him to ease up on Ewing's minutes before he got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the mess he's in: Peter Vecsey reporting on the
halftime show the other day that a Knicks coaching change would
have been imminent had they lost that night to Charlotte. They
didn't, but, sure as Jerry Garcia's gone, I'm figuring that, as a
student of Knick history, Van Gundy's going unless the Knicks win
big. Which is sure nice to know before I've even agreed to succeed
John Calipari over in Jersey with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   As a spiritual man, I don't want to come off the intellectual
snob but to quote Paul Valery, ``The best way to make your dreams
come true is to wake up.'' Gumby and Ernie Grunfeld and Dave
Checketts have been in snoozeland for the last two or three years.
Patrick Ewing, hardwood warrior that he is, couldn't lead his team
to the mountaintop five years ago, when we didn't have my man
Michael in Chicago, when Ewing was 31, when Charles Oakley was 30,
when John Starks and Derek Harper and Anthony Mason were all better
fits than the players they have now.
</P>
<P>
   What have those guys been smoking, bloating their team with
contracts like Chris Dudley's? Twenty-eight million for a backup
center? We gave Bill Wennington two pair of Air Jordans and free
family passes, and he was thrilled. Ernie's a great guy and all,
but if you really think about it, the three best players the Knicks
have had in the '90s _ Ewing, Oakley and Starks _ all came from the
'80s, from previous management teams.
</P>
<P>
   What am I saying here? Consider this a koan. (In other words,
figure it out for yourself.)
</P>
<P>
   I don't see these Knicks getting past the second round, if they
get that far, this season, or in any other season, but before
everyone tickets me for New Jersey, let's think out loud. Suppose
Minnesota can't sign Terrell Brandon next summer, and the Knicks
offer a package _ say Latrell Sprewell and Charlie Ward _ in a
sign-and-trade. There's your point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Now I haven't talked to Michael about this, but he always did
fancy the idea of playing in Madison Square Garden. For one year,
maybe two, who knows? Whatever the Knicks couldn't pay him under
the salary cap, Phil Knight could. I must have David Falk's number
somewhere around here. So now we _ I say ``we'' most hypothetically
_ move Allan Houston to the sixth-man role and bring in Dennis on a
one-year deal. He's already bolted the Lakers, proving once again
that I'm the only coach he'll play for.
</P>
<P>
   I admit, this whole scenario is unlikely, but then, maybe we
just start cleaning house, drop this championship-now pipe dream
and begin the heroic process of returning fluid basketball to the
Garden, the game I learned from the master, Red Holzman. Anyway,
leverage is leverage. I've got to consider the Knicks, if only for
the sake of dollars and Zen.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of me being intrigued by the Nets are accurate
because, let's face it, if you're going to be a savior, the
absolute bottom is the best place to begin. After Calipari, the
players will look at me and see Gandhi. Well, they probably don't
know Gandhi, so let's go with Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of commanding respect, I'm afraid Calipari was finished
the night Michael stared him down in front of his bench in our
playoff game in New Jersey last spring. Maybe I should feel guilty
about that, but, what the heck, to quote Thich Nhat Hanh, ``Our own
life is the instrument with which we experiment with the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Failed pro that he is, Calipari will get another college job
and, in all likelihood, I'll take his. This is a fine young
nucleus, though even with Sam Cassell playing his best ball last
season (his numbers, by the way, were better than Stephon
Marbury's), the Nets barely made the playoffs. But I like the idea
of philanthropic owners. I love Keith Van Horn. If Kerry Kittles
cut down on his jumpers, he could be a smaller Pippen. I know all
about the Nets' jinx but, what the heck, as Ursula K. LeGuin said,
``It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the
journey that matters, in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your bidding. I'm all ears. In the meantime,
the word up here in Woodstock is that Young is joining Crosby,
Stills and Nash on tour. Talk about a team.
</P>

AMERICA'S SECRET PAST IN CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday, March 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the lingering mysteries about Gen. Augusto Pinochet of
Chile is whether Washington aided in the 1973 military coup that
brought him to power and how much it knew of the murders and forced
disappearances committed by his government. Beginning with an
investigation by a Senate committee in 1975, tantalizing bits of
information have emerged about failed Central Intelligence Agency
efforts to keep the Socialist Salvador Allende from becoming
president of Chile in 1970, and the CIA's ties to Pinochet's
intelligence organizations. Now, if the Clinton administration
carries out a well-designed plan to declassify its information on
Chile, the details of America's role may be known.
</P>
<P>
   The administration ordered the review because of a surge of
interest in Pinochet that developed after his indictment last year
by a Spanish court. The plan was released to the public at the
prodding of the National Security Archive, a non-governmental
group. It directs the State, Defense and Justice Departments, the
CIA and the National Security Council to search their files for
information on human rights abuses and terrorism in Chile,
beginning with the period from 1968 to 1978. The directive asks the
agencies to complete their initial release of documents by mid-May.
All documents will be treated as if they were more than 25 years
old, making them much easier to declassify.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has led the move toward openness, but
cooperation from the Pentagon and CIA is a question mark. The
Defense Department has lagged behind other agencies in releasing
documents in the past, and probably holds a trove of important
information regarding Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's reluctance to declassify documents on Chile in the
files of its Operations Directorate is particularly unfortunate.
The 1975 Senate investigation of CIA activities found that the
agency had run numerous covert operations to keep Allende from
becoming president. Declassified documents show that in 1970
President Nixon instructed the CIA to organize a military coup. The
Senate report also mentioned the agency's ties to the most sinister
of Pinochet's secret police organizations. The CIA recently
released crucial documents on its role in Guatemala's violence. It
should now reveal the truth about all its activities in Chile.

SENATORS HAVE BLUEPRINT FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they fight to salvage a dreary season, as they preach
patience to fans whose patience understandably is wearing thin, as
they wait for their recent draft choices to develop (they hope)
into top-flight NHL players, the Los Angeles Kings might gain
inspiration from the team they faced Monday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, as a much different Kings team was heading toward
the Stanley Cup finals, the Ottawa Senators were completing a
dismal expansion season.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, the Kings are waiting for a new generation of
prospects to develop, while the Senators are savoring the rewards
of their methodical building program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very patient,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said.
``They've stuck to their game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators have also been smart. They have the second-best
record in the NHL (Dallas is first), but at $21 million they have
the third-lowest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics are quick to say the Senators became good by being bad
and it is true that several of their players _ centers Alexei
Yashin and Radek Bonk, left wing Marian Hossa and defenseman Chris
Phillips _ are recent high first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senators also have unearthed some gems, such as
third-leading scorer Andreas Dackell (the 136th player chosen in
the 1995 draft), fourth-leading scorer Magnus Arvedson (119th in
1997), free-agent signee Andreas Johansson (five goals in 95 NHL
games before this year but 19 this season), and star right wing
Daniel Alfredsson (133rd pick in 1994). Coach Jacques Martin has
done an outstanding job of molding this group of relative unknowns
into the NHL's most pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, Ottawa's success story could be in peril. The
Senators lost $7 million last season and are expected to lose more
than that this year. Owner Rod Bryden is facing a $7.2-million tax
assessment on the team's 3-year-old Corel Centre and had to pay $38
million for the highway off-ramp leading to the building.
</P>
<P>
   Bryden is making noises about selling the team or moving it if
he doesn't get some relief from the Canadian government, a case of
Senators asking for help from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators have their house in order on the ice. But the
financial realities of the NHL in the 1990s are threatening to
remove the Senators from Ottawa just as the fun is getting started.
</P>
<P>
   __ Too much too soon?: It remains to be seen whether
Philadelphia will regret trading 20-year-old winger Dainius Zubrus,
a former first-round draft choice, to Montreal for right wing Mark
Recchi, 31, who is anxious to sign with the Flyers this summer as
an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Zubie,'' Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said
following last week's trade. ``You guys saw him in his first year.
He looked like he was going to be great. . . . I think the problem
with Zubie is that he was a young kid who had a pile of money
thrown at him and hockey became second (in his priorities). Only
the fast cars and women caught his attention.''
</P>
<P>
   As an 18-year-old rookie in 1996-97, Zubrus had eight goals and
21 points in 68 games. This season, the native of Russia has only
four goals and nine points. Clarke attributed Zubrus' decline to
laziness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him weigh in at training camp and the guy was 227
pounds,'' Clarke said of Zubrus, who stands 6-foot-3. ``That's 10
pounds heavier than he'd been (last season). I said, `You can't
play at 10 pounds heavier than you were,' and he started talking
about his mother being here now and making dinners. I said, `Push
yourself away from the (expletive) table.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grounded Flyers: Speaking of the former Broad Street Bullies,
they have tied a club record with an 11-game winless streak, and
are 2-11-5 since going 16-1-7 between Dec. 12 and Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 50 percent of the game at the pro level is mental,''
said Flyers chairman Ed Snider. ``And I think this team has had a
complete mental collapse. I don't think we've had a physical
collapse. . . . I've never seen anything like it. To see a team
play so well and then play so poorly _ the same team _ for such
long stretches, I've never seen this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on the road to the 1993 Stanley Cup finals, the Kings
enjoyed some amazing highs and endured some distressing lows. That
season, they were 20-8-3 in the first 31 games. They then went
4-17-4 in their next 25. But in the end, they righted themselves
and almost won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' questionable defense, however, will make it
difficult for them to match the Kings' turnaround in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Chicago general manager Bob Murray said his
Flyers counterpart, Bob Clarke, continues to pursue a trade for
defenseman Chris Chelios. But Chelios has a handshake no-trade
agreement with Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz. . . . If Montreal
misses the playoffs, it will be just the second time since World
War II that the Maple Leafs have made the playoffs in a year when
the Canadiens missed. . . . Phoenix defenseman Teppo Numinen has
been playing with a fractured foot for nearly three weeks. . . .
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy missed scoring a goal last week when he
fired a rink-length shot into Philadelphia's empty net just after
time expired. ``I didn't know how much time I had, but I tried to
get rid of it as quick as I could,'' he said. ``I was very
disappointed to see there was no time left on the clock. I was
wishing they'd stop the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Show me the roster: Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was leaving the
Forum last week after the Kings-Detroit game when he saw a Red Wing
standing outside the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you doing, man?'' Gooding said. ``Good to see you. Great
game out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding didn't realize he was addressing defenseman Uwe Krupp,
who hasn't played since Christmas because of a back injury.

A DUBIOUS VERDICT AT THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somebody once called boxing the sweet science, but there was
nothing sweet about last Saturday night's Evander Holyfield-Lennox
Lewis heavyweight title bout or scientific about the collective
wisdom of the three judges who called it a draw. Lewis was clearly
the superior fighter for most of a dreary evening, and one judge
actually awarded him the fight. A second judge called it a draw
while a third, astonishingly, gave it to Holyfield. Holyfield and
Lewis will continue to share the title. The only clear winners were
the promoters, who will stage a rematch in six months.
</P>
<P>
   This bout was supposed to be a big shot in the arm for boxing in
New York _ a fight that would establish one clear champion in the
heavyweight division and bring back the glory days of Madison
Square Garden. When it ended the way it did, the state's leading
politicians were furious and not a bit bashful about raising the
possibility of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who watched the bout on television along
with more than a million others who paid $50 for the privilege,
called the result a ``travesty'' that could lead reasonable people
to conclude that ``someone had altered the honest judgment of the
judges.'' Gov. George Pataki ordered an inquiry by the State
Athletic Commission, while Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney
general, began a separate inquiry. Spitzer suggested that the
judges were guilty of ``tampering or incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   These responses are heartening. The usual reaction to bad boxing
decisions is a shrug of the shoulders, but that will not do here.
The fight generated more than $50 million in TV revenue alone, and
the fighters earned nearly $30 million between them. The vast
television audience and the 21,284 spectators on hand in Madison
Square Garden have every right to know whether they got the fair
fight they paid for.
</P>
<P>
   The official who ruled in favor of Holyfield, Eugenia Williams,
stands by her verdict. She said she had ``scored by the blows that
connected,'' even though the television audience saw, and the
official computer recorded, a lot more blows by Lewis than by
Holyfield. Her views deserve a fair hearing, but so too do the
suspicions of those who believe that the people who control boxing
had much to gain from a draw _ not least Don King, the promoter who
organized this bout and stands to benefit from a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   If either the Athletic Commission or the attorney general turns
up evidence of fraud, then other law enforcement figures, including
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, should be prepared to take the
investigation further. Boxing is suffering from widespread public
mistrust. A good fight and a fair verdict in Madison Square Garden
would have done it worlds of good. That did not happen, and it is
important to ask why.

DINKINS, RANGEL ARRESTED IN PROTEST OVER POLICE SHOOTING

 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Former Mayor David Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel and a
dozen others were arrested Monday as they staged a protest at
Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan over the police killing last
month of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, along with acts of civil disobedience
intended to provoke arrests, have become weekday ritual at One
Police Plaza since last Tuesday, when the Rev. Al Sharpton led the
first group of 12 protesters in a sit-in that ended with their
arrests. Sharpton, who was also arrested Monday, has vowed to
continue the protests each day until the four officers involved in
the Diallo shooting are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens, and two City
Council members, Margarita Lopez and Bill Perkins, both of
Manhattan, were also among those arrested Monday and charged with
criminal trespassing after they entered Police Headquarters and
refused a request to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the police appeared reluctant to arrest Dinkins and
the others. The protesters at first knelt in front of the entrance
to Police Headquarters, an act that had led to the arrest of
earlier protesters on charges of disorderly conduct. But officers
declined to intervene, prompting Monday's protesters to go a step
further and enter the building.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood in the lobby waiting to be arrested, Dinkins
criticized the Giuliani administration, saying it tolerated acts of
police misconduct as the price for lowering the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if the street unit were to shake down 10 people
and find one dirty,'' he said, ``they would think that the other
nine whose civil and human rights were violated, that that was OK,
that that justified it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins was referring to the street crimes unit whose officers
were hunting for a rapist on Feb. 4 when they shot and killed
Diallo, an unarmed street peddler with no criminal record, in the
lobby of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   After Dinkins stood in a circle with the other protesters and
joined arms, a police officer, Lt. Kevin Mullen, addressed the
crowd through a megaphone, telling the people that they faced
arrest if they did not leave. When nothing happened, he said, ``Now
that you have refused to leave, I'm ordering that you be placed
under arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor that
can carry a more severe penalty than disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   One by one they were asked to put their hands behind their
backs, and they were put in plastic handcuffs known as flex-cuffs.
A brief discussion followed among police officials, who considered
taking the protesters out a back door, away from the photographers
waiting outside the front door. The officials decided not to, and
Dinkins and the other handcuffed protesters were led out the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said that police
procedure requires officers to handcuff the people they arrest with
their hands behind their backs, except in extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesters were released a little more than two
hours later with summonses to appear in court at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the station house, Rangel said he hoped that more New
Yorkers of all backgrounds would protest the shooting of Diallo,
who was black, by four white officers. ``I don't want to believe
that my adult son is more susceptible of being shot down merely
because of his color and where he lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the protests as a
``publicity stunt.''

   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 16: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The death of two-month-old Tyler Walrond from malnutrition in
1997 has been made more tragic by the prosecution of his mother,
Tabitha Walrond, who goes on trial in the Bronx for manslaughter
Wednesday. If convicted, she could face up to 15 years in prison.
Ms. Walrond, who breast-fed her son, is charged with recklessly
causing her baby's death by failing to feed him sufficiently and to
seek medical care when he became sickly. No other signs of abuse
were found.
</P>
<P>
   One can sympathize with Tyler's father, who has urged
prosecutors to go forward in the belief that Ms. Walrond was
reckless in not heeding obvious signs that the baby was starving.
But expert testimony on how difficult it is for many nursing
mothers to recognize the danger signs by themselves and evidence
that the medical system let this young woman down suggest that this
is not a case that should be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic tangles and mistaken computer rejections made it
hard for Ms. Walrond, who was covered by Medicaid, to get medical
attention for her baby. Ms. Walrond tried to get the baby seen
through a Medicaid managed-care plan at the Health Insurance Plan
of New York, where she herself had received prenatal care. Although
the infant was entitled to Medicaid automatically at birth, Ms.
Walrond says she was led to believe that coverage would not start
until various documents were received and processed, and she was
turned back in efforts to make an appointment for the infant. Two
different Medicaid cards for Tyler eventually arrived in the mail
after he died.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's death could have been prevented by a more alert medical
care system. His mother should have had follow-up consultations
with lactation nurses, particularly since earlier breast-reduction
surgery and childbirth complications put her at risk for
insufficient breast milk. A routine checkup for the baby should
have been automatically scheduled before discharge from the
hospital but was not. Instead, an inexperienced young mother was
sent home with little advice about the sometimes tricky nature of
breast-feeding or about how to get her child plugged into the
medical system. Punishing that mother with prison is an
inappropriate response to a tragedy that arose out of ignorance
made deadly by fissures in the health care system.

$3.5 MILLION BONUS FOR CHIEF OF PHILIP MORRIS
</HEADLINE>

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geoffrey C. Bible, the chairman and chief executive
of Philip Morris, received a $3.5 million bonus from his company's
compensation committee for his participation in talks that led to
the $206 billion settlement between cigarette makers and 46 states,
according to a proxy statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said, ``A primary factor in determining the size
of the award was the committee's desire to reward Bible for his
leadership in helping to obtain a nationwide settlement of health
care cost recovery and other claims of the states against the
company's domestic tobacco subsidiary and other domestic tobacco
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonus, nearly twice the $1.9 million bonus Bible, 61, got
last year, came in addition to his $1.5 million salary. Yet, his
overall compensation appeared to decline, however, because last
year he was awarded $6 million in stock that is given to company
officers every three years, said a company spokesman, Bob Minkoff.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers of the company also received larger bonuses
because Philip Morris' worst fears were allayed when the settlement
became official last fall. They included Murray H. Bring, the
general counsel, who received a $2.1 million bonus, up from just
over $1 million last year; William H. Webb, the chief operating
officer, whose bonus rose to $1 million from $825,000 last year;
Louis Camilleri, the chief financial officer, whose bonus rose to
$1 million from $725,000 last year, and Michael E. Szymanczyk, the
president of Philip Morris' domestic tobacco company, whose bonus
rose to $750,000 from $525,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reasonable amount, given the alternative that could
have come out of these cases at trial,'' said Martin Feldman, a
tobacco analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, referring to Bible's
bonus. ``While important litigation remains, I think Bible deserves
the bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Philip Morris' compensation committee is John S.
Reed, himself well acquainted with the concept of a generous bonus.
As co-chairman of Citigroup, Reed pocketed a bonus of $7.8 million,
on top of his $1.7 million salary and took home stock options worth
more than $16.9 million.

ST. JOHN'S AIMS TO KNOCK MARYLAND OFF ITS BEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Duke's Shane Battier knows what it will take for St. John's to
beat Maryland in Knoxville, Tenn., on Thursday in the South
Regional semifinal of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever controls the tempo will win that game,'' said Battier,
whose Blue Devils beat St. John's in overtime earlier this season
and also gave the Terrapins two of their five losses. ``If it's
going to be up and down, racehorse style, it's Maryland's game. If
St. John's can execute their halfcourt offense, they'll win it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland (28-5), seeded second in the South Regional, St.
John's (27-8), seeded third, will face a team much like itself:
athletic and fast, not too big _ Maryland's tallest starter is the
6-foot-9 forward Terence Morris _ with a preference for running and
pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has averaged 85.2 points a game; St. John's has
averaged 79.3. Many of Maryland's points come off turnovers created
by a suffocating press. Maryland's opponents average 22 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gary Williams of Maryland said: ``It's an interesting game
from the fans' point of view to see how much you can press a team
as quick as St. John's, or how much they can press us given our
quickness. A lot depends on how the game goes and how much courage
you have going in as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, which has been to the Round of 16 in four of the last
six years but has not advanced since 1975, seldom deviates from its
plan. The Terrapins run and press, loft alley-oop passes with great
success and do not switch up the game plan. That presents an
opening for St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm is imbued with confidence that it can make the
adjustments in its game to win, as St. John's did against Samford
and Indiana last week. Although the Red Storm has not played much
half court this season, the team has played well in halfcourt
situations in beating Miami and Indiana and used a zone defense to
dismantle the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can run with them,'' forward Ron Artest said
of Maryland. ``If I had to say who was more athletic, Steve Francis
or Erick Barkley, it's Francis. Terence Morris or me, Morris. You
don't want to get up and down with them because their legs are
stronger than ours. But I've never seen them play a solid halfcourt
game. I've seen us play a solid halfcourt game.''
</P>
<P>
   When St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis was at George Washington last
season, his Colonials beat Maryland. The Colonials took Maryland
out of its game by using point guard Shawnta Rogers to break the
press and get his teammates to score off it.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers scored 16 points in the first half and the Terrapins
called off their pressure. In the second half, George Washington
prevailed in a slowed-down, physical, halfcourt battle, and won,
70-66. George Washington had only 15 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   When Jarvis' St. John's squad opposes this season's Terrapins
the teams will be much different. For one, Maryland did not have
Francis, the explosive guard who averages 17.2 points. But for St.
John's, chunks of strategy can still be lifted from last season's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run when you can, like always,'' Jarvis said. ``Do you
turn it into a track meet? We're not going to win a track meet. I
feel this team will adjust when it has to.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, which has not faced fullcourt pressure often this
season, averages 13 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With George Washington, Jarvis expected Rogers to dribble
through the press, which the coach said was the ideal way of
breaking it. But Jarvis cannot do that this time.
</P>
<P>
   With his so-called two-headed point guard _ the freshman Barkley
and the sophomore Artest _ Jarvis will want his team to pass over
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said the toughest press he faced this season was against
Providence. In two games against the Friars, Barkley had only one
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erick really can see what's coming at him,'' Artest said.
``Against Connecticut, Richard Hamilton was faking the press and
most guards would have picked up the ball. He kept his dribble.
With me and Erick, it's hard to press us. We can bring it down.
We'll get the ball over, it may take a few seconds, but you've got
to be patient.''

UAL SAYS EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, said on Monday
that strong domestic sales and the spillover from last month's
sickout by pilots at rival American Airlines would help lift its
earnings above Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came on the heels of the industry's
second broad fare increase this year, sent airline stocks soaring.
UAL rose nearly 10 percent, or $6.6875, to $73.75, while the other
major carriers all posted substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Dow Jones transportation average rose on UAL's
announcement, setting a new high of 3,404.65, after rising 137.14
points or 4.20%.
</P>
<P>
   UAL said in a government filing that its first-quarter earnings
would likely be $1.35 a share, 23 cents higher than $1.12 expected
by industry analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp. UAL also said
it expected to earn between $10 and $12 a share for the year, above
the First Call consensus of $9.12.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts raised their first-quarter
estimates Monday but some still remained cautious about the outlook
for United as well as for other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Donofrio, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said that UAL did
not disclose exactly how much of the first-quarter profit
improvement was the result of American having to cancel more than
6,600 flights in February. She and others have estimated that the
benefit will be equal to 15 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I do think it is a piece of positive news,'' she said,
referring to the company's higher estimate, ``I wouldn't assume
that the increase is solely from improving domestic revenue
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have seen their sales decline in recent months
after four years of record profits. Analysts say that many carriers
have been having difficulty selling premium-priced tickets intended
for business travelers, which have gone up in price nearly 30
percent in the last three years. As a result, many companies are
either reducing travel or buying cheaper advance-purchase tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also concerned that the introduction of new
airplanes by many airlines this year will lead to overcapacity and
erode profits. They say that broad fare increases can be easily
countered by more generous corporate discounts, fare sales and
other incentives. Finally, jet fuel, which is the industry's
second-largest expense after labor, appears to be moving up in
price from its current low level.
</P>
<P>
   But UAL said in a statement that United, which is the world's
largest airline, is seeing a ``reversal'' of the recent revenue
decline and that it ``is expecting strong domestic performance''
during the first quarter. The company also said that there has been
a modest improvement in its profits in Asia, where United gets
about 20 percent of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Donofrio was not impressed by that either, recalling assurances
made last year that passenger traffic in the Pacific was turning
the corner. ``While we are certainly encouraged with the way Asia
has been going,'' she said, ``we are going to wait for a few more
data points before we assume there is meaningful improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian A. Harris, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New
York, is more bullish on UAL. He said that United is ``the
strongest long-term fundamental story in the industry'' because of
its strong position at airports in Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver,
San Francisco and Washington's Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   UAL now trades at a discount compared with the other major
airline stocks but Harris believes that over time, as it grows its
hub airports, it should trade at a premium.

EX-COLUMNIST FOR BOSTON GLOBE GETS A NEW OUTLET
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Barnicle, the columnist who resigned from The
Boston Globe last summer amid charges of plagiarism and slipshod
reporting, will begin writing a column for the opinion pages of The
Daily News' Sunday editions at the end of the month, according to
senior news executives at the New York paper.
</P>
<P>
   The executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Barnicle's first column has been scheduled to appear on March 28,
the day that the redesgned Sunday issue is launched. Reached at
his home in Lincoln, Mass., on Monday, Barnicle said ``no comment''
when asked about the new job.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Barnicle's appointment received mixed reviews within
the newsroom of The Daily News. ``The feeling is that they're
looking for somebody to make a splash and he's on Imus,'' one News
executive said. Don Imus, the acerbic radio and television
talk-show host, supported Barnicle during the columnist's final,
ragged days with The Globe last August and has featured his
commentary on the air several times since then.
</P>
<P>
   But, the executive continued, ``there is a large body of opinion
that worries that having an alleged plagiarist on the staff is not
the smartest thing for our paper to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kramer, the editor of the new five-page Sunday opinion
section, did not return messages left late Monday afternoon.
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the newspaper's owner, was in Moscow and
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, 54, who often wrote of the lives of police officers,
firefighters and poor families, developed a fiercely loyal
following in Boston, a city where some people still cling to the
old ethnic loyalties that once divided Irish immigrants from Yankee
Brahmins, and both from poor and middle-class blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's departure last August from The Globe, which is owned
by The New York Times Co., was the culmination of a wrenching
series of events that began when The Boston Herald, The Globe's
rival, reported that the columnist had plagiarized the jokes of the
comedian George Carlin in one of his columns.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's resignation was requested by Matthew V. Storin, the
editor of The Globe, who was vacationing in Italy. Before Storin
returned, Barnicle had defied his request, and a wave of reader
support for the blunt-spoken storyteller overwhelmed The Globe's
switchboard. When Storin returned, he reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve was short-lived. Eight days later, Barnicle
tendered his resignation after he could not immediately provide
evidence that two young cancer victims he had described in a 1995
column actually existed. Some weeks later, The Globe published a
final column by Barnicle explaining that he had retold a story he
had heard from others.
</P>
<P>
   Richard P. Gulla, a spokesman for The Globe, said Monday
evening, ``We have said all along that Mike has been very good for
The Globe over two and a half decades, and The Globe has been good
to Mike over two and a half decades, and we parted over a
particular situation and we wish him well.''

HASKEL SALE INFLATES STOCK TO HEAVYWEIGHT CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pump up the volume indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Haskel International Inc. zoomed Monday after the
maker of industrial pumps announced it is being bought by
investors. More than 208,000 shares changed hands, about 30 times
the issue's 30-day average volume, lifting the price $3.0625 to
$12.125.
</P>
<P>
   Haskel officials said Monday that a group led by private
investment fund Tinicum Capital Partners LP will pay $72.8 million,
or $12.90 per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of the
Burbank firm. The price represents a 42 percent premium over the
stock's Monday opener of $9.0625 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Haskel makes high-pressure gas and liquid pumps used in
industrial and military applications. In October, the company
retained financial advisers Schroder &AMP; Co. to help evaluate options
to enhance growth opportunities. The Tinicum purchase has been
approved by both companies' boards of director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first concern was improving shareholder value, and I think
we've done that,'' said Malcolm Graves, Haskel's president and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Haskel's share price had been in a slump since fiscal 1997, when
it wrote off $7.5 million from an underperforming electronics
division that it eventually sold. From a high of $16 in September
1997, Haskel shares fell as low as $6.625 last September.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based company has 340 employees and annual sales of
about $50 million.

<P>
   Admit it. You were warned.
</P>
<P>
   We touted Gonzaga. We told you about Stanford. We hinted that
this might not be another blue-chip season for Utah, and we pretty
much promised you that Kansas was a bad investment coming out of an
overvalued Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we talked up Arizona and George Washington, too. And,
yes, we figured Ohio State wasn't up to its rating and that
Arkansas would foreclose on Iowa in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Southwest Missouri State never came up.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's perfect, particularly in these turbulent times. If
there is a moral to the story after the first weekend of this NCAA
Tournament, however, it may be this:
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to play the bracket market, you can't just bet
the blue chips. To win big, you have to diversify a little, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a Duke or a Connecticut is nice to have in your portfolio.
Once in a while, though, you have to take a flyer on some guys
working out of gyms in places like Spokane, Wash.; Springfield,
Mo.; or Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone saw this trend coming, of course. Some paid dearly
for loading up on some old, familiar brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Adios, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   So long, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   No Sweet 16 for you, either, North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In a maddening opening weekend, the offbeat outfits and small
investors had their way. Sure, the top four conglomerates _ Duke,
Connecticut, Michigan State and Auburn _ made money, too, but
consider the carnage below.
</P>
<P>
   Three No. 2 seeds _ Miami (Fla.), Stanford and Utah _ folded.
</P>
<P>
   Two No. 3s _ Cincinnati and North Carolina _ went bust.
</P>
<P>
   Three No. 4s _ Arizona, Arkansas and Tennessee _ lost their
seats on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   How unusual is all this?
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, no more than
three double-digit seeds previously had made it to the second
weekend. This year, three No. 10s (Gonzaga, Miami of Ohio and
Purdue) move on, joined by a No. 12 (Southwest Missouri State) and
a No. 13 (Oklahoma).
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 16 seeds, only eight survived, the lowest total since
1990. In four weird and wonderful (if your stock is on the rise,
that is) days, 19 teams defeated a higher seed, another record
since the field grew to its current size.
</P>
<P>
   Only the South, where the top four seeds all advanced, was
impervious to this fluctuation. Half of the West (No. 1 UConn and
No. 5 Iowa) played close to form, but the other (No. 6 Florida vs.
No. 10 Gonzaga) is a bit of a mess.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, things are even more unstable as No. 1 Duke gets
No. 12 Southwest Missouri State in the semifinals, while No. 6
Temple and No. 10 Purdue make up the other side of the skewed
bracket. And in the Midwest, No. 1 Michigan State is a little
surprised to see No. 13 OU coming, but not much more than No. 3
Kentucky is to be confronted with No. 10 Miami (Ohio).
</P>
<P>
   Some will advance while others decline as we move on to the
Round of 16. Before we do, a look back at those who went boom and
those who went bust after a volatile week on the floor:
</P>
<P>
   Winners
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma _ Who would have thought it when the Sooners barely
made the cut on Selection Sunday? Even Warren Buffett couldn't see
these guys coming.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis _ The Iowa coach, whose contract is not being renewed,
is cashing in that 401(k) with the feel-good story of the
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Alford _ Considered the favorite to take over Davis' job,
the Southwest Missouri coach may have upped his stock with two
wins, including a 30-point stunner over Tennessee. Everyone talks
defense, but the Bears play it, yielding just 83 points in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak _ Where would Miami (Ohio) be without him?
Home, watching CNBC, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten _ Of the seven teams that opened play, four (Michigan
State, Ohio State, Purdue and Iowa) are still in the market. Only
Minnesota and Wisconsin heard the closing bell after the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Conference _ Each of the six entries won at least
one game, and Auburn, Kentucky and Florida are still around. Only
the Big Ten can match the SEC's 9-3 record so far.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Valley _ Everybody had Southwest Missouri State in the
Sweet 16, right? Evansville lost in the first round to Kansas, but
Creighton's win over Louisville and respectable (75-63) loss to
Maryland didn't hurt the league's stock a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-American Conference _ Miami (Ohio) is in the Sweet 16, and
Kent made a decent account of itself in a 61-54 first-round loss to
a Temple team that is still around.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed returns
</P>
<P>
   Big East _ UConn and St. John's moved on, but more was expected
from Miami (Fla.), a second-round loser to Purdue. Syracuse and
Villanova both lost openers as No. 8 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Coast _ No big surprise that Duke and Maryland are
still on the big board, but North Carolina's first-round loss to
Weber State hurt the argument that the league deserved a better
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 _ Oklahoma, generally considered the last team selected
for the field of 64, has been a pleasant surprise, but Texas and
Missouri lost first-round games as higher seeds and Oklahoma
State's win over Syracuse is nothing to get excited about. Kansas
had a chance to take out Kentucky, but the Jayhawks go home early
again.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic 10 _ Temple lives, but Rhode Island and George
Washington declared no dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Losers
</P>
<P>
   Bob Knight _ Black Saturday _ a 25-point second-round humbling
by St. John's _ was his worst day ever in the Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA _ Of the four teams invited, only Cincinnati and
North Carolina Charlotte made it to the second round, and those two
have cashed out as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific-10 _ More trouble in the West Coast markets. As
expected, Stanford carried the banner the furthest, but that was
only into the second round. UCLA, Arizona and Washington all washed
out in their openers, and the Cardinal _ last year's hot commodity
_ was schooled in the second round by Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Western Athletic Conference _ Utah went out in the second round
as a No. 2 seed. Tulsa and New Mexico won openers, but each was
embarrassed in second-round losses to Duke and Connecticut. Trading
is suspended as the league loses half its members.
</P>
<P>
   What's next
</P>
<P>
   East _ Cincinnati was the only team to beat Duke in the regular
season. The Bearcats are gone, and so is any chance that the Blue
Devils won't have a profitable weekend just across the river from
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri may slow Duke down but won't be able to stop
everyone. The Temple-Purdue winner will wrap up a nice season by
being able to say it didn't cash out until the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest _ Michigan State's slow starts may catch up to the
Spartans at some point. Is Oklahoma on a fluky run, or finally
playing up to decent talent? The Sooners shouldn't be a problem
here, but then again, they should be off the board by now, too.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (Ohio) has had fun, but Kentucky knows how to win at this
level. That could come into play in a Michigan State-Kentucky final
where the old money may prevail.
</P>
<P>
   South _ This might be the most interesting regional of all,
since the four blue chips all prospered. Auburn still has some
convincing to do and may not be able to do it against an Ohio State
team that mauled Detroit (75-44) in the second round. St. John's
embarrassed Indiana, jeopardizing the trendy pick of Maryland
emerging from this group.
</P>
<P>
   West _ If Jim Calhoun doesn't cash in on a Final Four trip this
year, he may lose his seat (on the exchange, not the bench). The
Huskies like to play up-tempo, and while Iowa managed to keep pace
with Arkansas, UConn has some inside muscle to go with the speed
and quickness elsewhere. The Florida-Gonzaga winner has the
potential to come down with a bad case of ``happy to be here,''
further lightening the Huskies' load.
</P>
<P>
   With only four issues sure to remain on the upswing by Sunday
night, the blue chips still could be the safe way to go.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like the safe route, Duke is as close to a
can't-miss commodity as this market has seen for a while.
Connecticut isn't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer a little risk, the big board is open, and
some bargains with potential remain.

MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Troubled MGM will pay Warner Bros. $225 million to
regain control of video rights to its movies, nearly a decade after
they were sold off at a fire-sale price by financier Giancarlo
Parretti.
</P>
<P>
   The video rights will revert to MGM in February 2000, 39 months
earlier than they would have under the $125 million deal Parretti
struck in 1990 to raise money for his ill-fated $1.5 billion buyout
of the once-legendary studio.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Warner was able to recoup costs from the deal,
which gave it video rights for all MGM films released after 1985,
in less than two years. Parretti lost control of the studio in 1992
after defaulting on loans to a French bank, which sold MGM to
financier Kirk Kerkorian in 1996 for $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's agreement means MGM will receive video and DVD revenues
from its major 1999 title, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the 19th
James Bond film, and its key 2000 title, ``Birdcage II.'' The Bond
titles have traditionally performed well in the ``sell-through''
side of video, according to analyst Arthur Rockwell, a former MGM
executive. ``MGM now has more flexibility in leveraging and
repackaging its library,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paying $225 million, MGM gives Warner back the
video rights to pre-1948 Warner titles and pre-1986 MGM films 15
months early. Ted Turner, now the vice chairman of Warner parent
Time Warner Inc., had licensed those rights to MGM following his
purchase of MGM's library.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, which will continue to handle MGM's video and DVD
product through January, said regaining control of the older titles
_ including ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``2001,'' ``Casablanca,'' ``The
Maltese Falcon'' and ``The Wizard of Oz'' _ will enable it to
maximize their value in the explosive DVD market.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which has been unimpressed with Kerkorian's
ownership of MGM, knocked 6 percent off the stock Monday as it
dropped 69.75 cents to $11.0625.

 &HT;    Taft's budget proposal includes spending surplus on schools,
technology
 &HT;    By William Hershey and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft released a two-year budget Monday
that calls for record spending on primary and secondary education,
but ignores the potential impact of a court ruling that could force
Ohio to scrap how its pays for schools.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term Republican governor also called for increased
state spending for colleges and universities, prisons, economic
development and health care for the working poor and senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget reflects increased revenues from an expanding
economy,'' Taft told more than 100 reporters, lobbyists and state
employees who packed a hearing room in the downtown Riffe Office
Tower.
</P>
<P>
   His budget calls for spending nearly $40 billion in the state's
general fund during the next two years, up from the $36.4 billion
in the current two-year budget. The Legislature will immediately
begin committee hearings on the budget. The Ohio Constitution
requires it to be approved by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   State spending would increase by 6.1 percent in the first year
and 5.5 percent in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also called for spending all of this year's budget
surplus, estimated at $415.7 million, for school construction and
technology, with $325.7 million going for construction and $90
million for school technology. Local districts would have to put up
a share of the money for construction to qualify for state aid.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $13.2 billion for primary and secondary schools
would be the most ever spent on education. It would provide
``resources for an adequate education for every child,'' Taft said.
The total includes $10.6 billion from the general fund, as well as
money from the Ohio Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Taft crafted his basic school spending using the formula
developed last year by the Legislature _ a formula Perry County
Judge Linton D. Lewis threw out as unconstitutional on Feb. 26
because it did not overhaul the funding system as called for by the
Ohio Supreme Court in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   State leaders have said they will appeal the decision to the
Supreme Court, and the governor is confident the high court will
uphold the formula, Scott Milburn, Taft's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Budget Director Tom Johnson acknowledged that the administration
did not take the pending Supreme Court's decision into
consideration, but said the budget helps poorer school districts
get more money, reduces the growth of state aid for affluent
districts and provides money for school buildings, ``all steps in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, was among those who
blasted the governor as being short-sighted for ignoring the
potential impact of Lewis' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very arrogant of the governor,'' McLin said. ``No one
knows what may come out of the school funding case and the state
isn't prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   William Phillis, executive director of the school coalition that
brought the funding lawsuit, was disappointed but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is that at some point there's going to be
a day of reckoning,'' he said. ``Then they'll have to go to work
and overhaul the system. Just saying they overhauled the system
doesn't mean it's overhauled.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg, who helped design the
school funding formula, said Taft did the right thing by ignoring
Lewis' decision, and Rep. J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton,
praised Taft's spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that the formula will be upheld,'' Jacobson
said. ``The only way to take Judge Lewis into account is to hook up
an IV to the taxpayers' wallet and give Judge Lewis the button.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mottley: ``I think he correctly identified the state's
problem and opportunity _ the gap between what our public schools
do and what we need for them to do to make Ohio competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft said the budget fulfills his commitments to make schools
the state's top priority and provide them with adequate funding
without increasing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He highlighted his $25 million OhioReads program, which calls
for making sure all students can read by the fourth grade, using
the help of 20,000 volunteer tutors. Taft today will put his
emphasis on reading into action by reading to students from Xenia
while touring a dairy goat farm in Bellbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly no goal is more important than reading,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   While primary and secondary education constitute his top
priority, Taft said improving access to higher education also is
one of his major goals.
</P>
<P>
   His budget would increase direct financial aid to students and
also provide more money to two-year and four-year colleges in an
effort to keep down increases in tuition. His proposal would
increase general funding spending on higher education from $2.3
billion this year to $2.41 billion next year and $2.51 billion in
the second budget year.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes a 25.8 percent hike in the special
supplement for Central State University. The supplement would be
$9.7 million in each year, up from the current $7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic State Rep. Dixie Allen of Dayton, a Central State
graduate, said the proposal was ``fantastic'' and a ``show of
confidence'' in Central State President John Garland who has worked
to restore the school to sound financial footing .
</P>
<P>
   Taft's proposal to provide health care to 27,000 additional
children from families of the working poor won praise from Mark
Real, director of the Childrens Defense Fund - Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest complaint in the past was that when people worked
they didn't get ahead. You had an incentive not to work. This is an
incentive to work. It's a significant number of kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was pleased with Taft's plans for increased
spending. The budget unfortunately conforms to the
State-of-the-State speech in which Taft called for increased
spending in 40 programs, said Richard C. Leonardi, president of the
Dayton-based Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's consistency in the wrong direction,'' he said.

MIDDLE CLASS MOVES UP, BUT ELITE HANGS TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before anyone discovered that Gonzaga was a small Catholic
school in Spokane, Wash., before anyone was welcomed to Wally's
World by a sweet-shooting 6-foot-8-inch forward, before Southwest
Missouri State got a ticket to a regional semifinal in New Jersey,
a coach from down on Tobacco Road offered up a couple of
predictions about how the 1998-99 college basketball season would
play out.
</P>
<P>
   It was October and Duke's Mike Krzyzewski was talking about how
dramatically the college game had changed in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues were not just recruiting against each
other, but against the National Basketball Association as well.
That was because more high school players went straight to the
pros, or treated the colleges as they once did prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading for the military academies to get their
grades up, the players now stop in the Atlantic Coast or other
conferences for a year or two to work on their crossover dribbles.
Krzyzewski saw the early exodus of super talents depleting the
number of elite teams and diminishing the level of play while at
the same time bringing greater parity to college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Look at which teams advanced over the weekend to the Round of 16
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and it
is clear Krzyzewski's theory holds _ though he may have overcounted
the number of superpowers. The No. 1-seeded teams all moved on:
Connecticut in the West, Auburn in the South, Michigan State in the
Midwest and Duke in the East.
</P>
<P>
   But three No. 2 teams, two No. 3 teams and three No. 4 teams
have been elbowed out by college basketball's new middle class. A
record five double-digit seeded teams advanced two rounds: No. 13
Oklahoma, No. 12 Southwest Missouri State and three No. 10's,
Purdue, Gonzaga and Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Not to take anything away from Oklahoma; the Sooners earned
their way to the Midwest Regional semifinals with two poised and
gritty performances. But they and Weber State, which bounced No. 3
North Carolina before losing to Florida in overtime, best
illustrate how early exits to the NBA can bring an elite team back
to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   What if Mike Bibby had returned for his junior year to run
Arizona's offense? Or if Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter remained
to man the Tar Heels blocks?
</P>
<P>
   Both teams may still have lost, but it is a good bet the games
would have been played differently.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of star power left in the college ranks
even if it shines from unfamiliar sectors. Before the tournament,
only NBA scouts and hoops junkies knew about the world of skills
Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak possessed. But after lighting up
Washington for 43 points and saving the game with a blocked shot on
defense, then turning 11 shot attempts into 24 points and a victory
over No. 2 Utah, Wally's World went national.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Redhawks were pretty good too, and showed some
tournament truisms remain infallible: A solid cast can jump on the
back of one terrific player and run pretty deep in the tournament.
Remember, Danny Manning and a no-name bunch of Kansas Jayhawks cut
down the national championship nets in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags from Gonzaga showed what a well-coached team with a
fierce will to win can do. They outmuscled one of the nation's
biggest and most physical teams in ousting No. 2-seeded Stanford.
And Southwest Missouri State Coach Steve Alford, one of college
basketball's greatest shooters in his days at Indiana, demonstrated
with his Bears that he listened to Bobby Knight's lectures on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The other observation Krzyzewski had back in preseason is even
more pertinent heading into the regional semifinals. He said he
believed this edition of the Blue Devils would compete for the
national championship. They were among his most talented ever,
which is saying a lot from a coach who has been to the Final Four
seven times and won two national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Only UConn can approach Duke's talent level, and the Huskies'
list of super talent goes only two deep, Richard Hamilton and
Khalid El-Amin. So there is still quite a bit of ground for the new
middle class to cover before they reach elite status. But
Krzyzewski knows the more things change in college basketball, at
least one thing stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the closer you get to having a chance to win a
national championship the harder it gets,'' he said Monday.
``That's why a lot of teams have been eliminated. This is not the
regular season; it's totally different. People believe in miracles
in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the teams are probably going to need one to get by
Duke.

 &HT;    OSU freshmen the key to team's success
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ A month or so ago, Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien
wasn't sure how important freshman guards Brian Brown and Boban
Savovic would be in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The two had ``hit a wall,'' O'Brien said, and he wasn't sure how
soon they'd bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a kind of malaise,'' he said. ``They didn't seem
to be as aggressive, as physically strong, as physically fit. They
both seemed to be not as mentally fit or as aware as they were
earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Buckeyes, Brown and Savovic have snapped out
of their freshman funk just in time to contribute to OSU's
postseason success. The two combined for 25 points and nine assists
in Ohio State's first and second round NCAA tournament victories in
Indianapolis last week. Their five 3-pointers vs. Detroit on
Saturday helped bury the Titans by 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has played very well both offensively and defensively,''
O'Brien said. ``And Boban, with his instinct and intelligence,
seems to find himself in the right spot a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brown, a 6-3, 190-pound guard from Bishop Loughlin
High in Brooklyn, N.Y., will be making just his third start of the
season when the No. 4 seed Buckeyes (25-8) face No. 1 seed Auburn
(29-3) in the NCAA Sweet 16. The game will tip off at approximately
9:55 p.m. at Thompson Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Savovic, a 6-6, 230-pound native of Yugoslavia, will be a key
player off the bench for Ohio State, especially with senior guard
Neshaun Coleman still recovering from strep throat. (After missing
last week's games, Coleman is expected to be available on
Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who averaged 17.4 minutes as a reserve during the regular
season, played for 28 and 30 minutes in OSU's first two NCAA games.
His tenacious defense and ball-handling skills makes it a
``no-brainer'' to start him again, even if it means a smaller
lineup, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way that we've played with Brian,'' the OSU coach
said. ``When Brian's in the game, we can push (point guard) Scoonie
(Penn) off the ball, allowing him to be a little bit more tuned in
to scoring some points. Brian is the only guy on the team who
affords us that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn said he likes the extra flexibility Brown's presence gives
him. He also thinks having another guard on the court, especially
one as quick as Brown, has helped the Buckeyes' transition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the last two games we may have had more fast breaks
than we've had all season because I can just run the floor and
Brian can just run it and we can just pass (the ball) up,'' Penn
said. ``So having Brian, not only helps on the defensive end but
the offensive end, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he learned he would start in place of sophomore
forward Jon Sanderson a couple of days before OSU's first round
NCAA tournament game against Murray State. He said making his first
start in such an important game didn't intimidate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I have a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Savovic, who was slowed by tendinitis in his achilles tendon
earlier this season, has healed enough to provide the Bucks with a
consistent outside threat. His four 3-pointers in last week's NCAA
games helped compensate for the absence of Coleman, OSU's most
dangerous 3-point threat. The Bucks will look to Savovic again
Thursday.

INSIGHT ON UCONN: INEXPERIENCE, INCONSISTENCY, INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Connecticut captain, Amy Duran, put it best before the start
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association women's basketball
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really been immature at a time when you need to be most
mature, and our inexperience is starting to show,'' said Duran, who
should know since she is the only front-line senior on a Huskies
team that meets Iowa State in the Mideast Regional semifinals on
Saturday in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   That immaturity and inexperience on a team that starts two
freshmen, two sophomores and one junior _ Shea Ralph, who is
playing only her second season after missing last season because of
a knee injury _ showed Sunday night when Connecticut had to score
the last 8 points to overcome unheralded Xavier, 86-84.
</P>
<P>
   UConn Coach Geno Auriemma feels that ``something has been lost''
since his team won the Big East championship on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having a tough time doing some things quickly and
changing from one task to another,'' he said recently, words that
proved prophetic when Connecticut's season nearly came to a
stunning end on its home court.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth remembering, of course, that Connecticut is 29-4 and
within one victory of winning 30 games for the sixth straight year.
But it's also true that injuries have left the Huskies without a
true point guard and center, and that has led to inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Sue Bird was the starter at point guard for the first
eight games but then was sidelined for the season with a knee
injury. Knee problems have also sidelined her freshman replacement,
Keirsten Walters, for three of the last four games and left her
availability in doubt for the rest of the tournament. As a result,
the Huskies have had to rely on sophomore Marci Glenney, who
averages 4 points a game and had only 1 field goal and 4 assists
against Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, UConn's two best players _ Svetlana
Abrosimova and Ralph _ have controlled the ball during fast breaks,
a team hallmark, along with a trapping defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrosimova, a sophomore who has a tendency to try to do too
much, has committed as many turnovers _ 125 _ as she has assists,
and leads the Huskies in both categories. Connecticut has been
turning the ball over at an alarming rate _ 22 times in routing St.
Francis of Pennsylvania by 51 points in the opening round last
Friday and 19 times (6 by Abrosimova) against Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   The team's post play has also been inconsistent, although
another freshman, Tamika Williams, filled in admirably against
Xavier with team highs of 19 points and 9 rebounds and sank two
tie-breaking free throws with seven seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 foot 2, Williams is supposed to be a power forward. But a
lack of production _ in part because of a sprained ankle and
bruised tailbone _ by the 6-5 junior Paige Sauer has forced
Auriemma to use Williams and yet another 6-2 freshman, Swin Cash,
at center from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ralph, an outstanding all-around player, can play the
point well _ she had a season-high 10 assists, along with 19
points, in the Big East championship game against Notre Dame _ her
main strength is as a scorer. She leads the Huskies with a 17.2
average, a notch ahead of Abrosimova, who is averaging 16.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph became a starter only nine games ago. But then in the
scheme of things under Auriemma, it's not who starts, but who
finishes on a team with 12 players who average 11 minutes or more.
And Ralph, who may be the team's best player, is always there at
the end of a close game.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is Duran, who was a starting guard until she broke her
right hand on Jan. 20 in a game against Miami. Since her return on
Feb. 20 after missing eight games, the 5-11 swing player has been a
major contributor as the first one off the bench. In the first two
Mideast Regional games against St. Francis and Xavier, Duran,
playing 57 out of a possible 80 minutes, scored 22 points on
8-of-18 shooting, including 6 of 14 from 3-point range, while
distributing 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa State, which is ranked 19th in the Associated Press
poll, Connecticut will be facing a 24-7 team that ranks second to
Xavier in 3-point-shooting percentage (39.6 percent) and in 3-point
field goals a game (7.6) and that has the nation's leading
perimeter shooter in junior guard Stacy Frese, who during the
regular season connected on 79 of 161 shots from 3-point range (49
percent). That is hardly good news for UConn considering how
Xavier's perimeter sharpshooters nailed 9 of 15 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inexperience sometimes shows, and we've been hurt by a lot
of injuries,'' Auriemma said. ``But we're a good team. In the
Xavier game, we played a great team, but our defense came up big at
the end and we made some big shots when we had to.''

 &HT;    Szczerbiak a Cinderella sensation
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Wally Szczerbiak isn't one to shy away from the
spotlight. Good thing, because there's no escaping it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into my first class today I got a standing
ovation,'' Miami University's all-everything forward and likely NBA
lottery pick reported Monday in a conference call with the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a line of ticket-buyers cheered the sight of coach
Charlie Coles less than 24 hours after Miami played its way into
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament, where Kentucky awaits Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a standing 'O,' `` Coles said. ``But it
was an 'O' ``
</P>
<P>
   The adulation shows no sign of subsiding for the RedHawks, whose
triumphant weekend in New Orleans included upsets of Washington and
Utah, each a stunner. A throng of screaming fans greeted the team's
campus return late Sunday night, and when Szczerbiak got his first
look at Monday's USA Today, his own winsome smile flashed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A CBS guy showed it to me,'' Szczerbiak said. ``I thought (a
picture) might be in the sports section, but it was on the front
page. Obviously, Miami is getting its name out there. I was pretty
excited for myself and my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three points against the University of Washington on
Friday went a long way toward establishing the 6-foot-8 Szczerbiak
as a household name, even if nine out of 10 households probably
couldn't spell it if you spotted them the z's. Basically playing
the role of decoy against Utah, he still managed 24 points Sunday,
meaning he was responsible for more than half of the RedHawks'
two-game total of 125.
</P>
<P>
   Living up to his ``Wally World'' nickname, Szczerbiak indeed has
been a world apart in two games, spearheading the RedHawks to their
most successful NCAA run ever. He's had help, but when the history
is written, no matter what happens next, upstart Miami will be
remembered as Szczerbiak's team, much like North Carolina-Charlotte
was Cedric Maxwell's team long ago and Navy belonged to David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as getting here, this is what I've worked for my whole
career in college,'' Szczerbiak said. ``For it to be coming true
the way I dreamed is extra special and I'm just grateful for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky poses the biggest challenge yet, and the days of Miami
sneaking up on opponents have passed. Still, Szczerbiak can't wait
for Friday's tipoff in St. Louis and another chance to ``try on the
glass slipper,'' as he likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenge of playing against players who are well
known and have gotten a lot of respect,'' he said. ``I don't know
how we're going to match up, but I think we match up favorably at
every position, except they're bigger at center. We're just going
to have to find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles said he plans an exhaustive videotape study of Kentucky,
and if that doesn't yield enough clues, he might have to resort to
other tactics. Whatever plan emerges, you can bet Szczerbiak
figures prominently, whether physically or emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to come up with something, but I don't know what
we'll do,'' Coles said. ``We can't take (Kentucky's) experience or
great tradition away, but we can be spirited and work together as a
team. We'll try to win one for the Gipper and anyone who knows the
Gipper.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't strike a responsive chord with the team?
</P>
<P>
   Said Coles, ``Maybe I'll just get Wally mad.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Joe Torre moved from one end of the 80-foot
clubhouse to the other while he talked to the Yankee players
Monday, speaking confidently, mixing in jokes _ like an entertainer
working the room, one player said. In this manner, the manager
educated them about his prostate cancer and his impending
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is scheduled for surgical removal of his cancer Thursday
at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Dr. William Catalona, with
whom Torre met Friday, will perform the operation. ``Basically, I
want to get this out of me,'' said Torre, who could have chosen
radiation treatments instead.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and club officials said Torre's recovery could take as
little as three weeks or as long as three months. Torre declined to
offer any time frame for his return to the dugout, acknowledging to
reporters that he really had no way of knowing how he would react
to the surgery and rehabilitation, or how he would feel about
managing.
</P>
<P>
   Torre offered no promises that he would continue with the
Yankees, though right now he said he had ``no doubt'' he would
return; in speaking to his players, Torre used the word ``soon''
repeatedly in reference to his return.
</P>
<P>
   Torre's 3-year-old daughter, Andrea Rae, sat on a couch in his
office, wearing a blue dress and pushing through a coloring book
with her tiny hands. Her father answered questions in a low voice
nearby. ``My concern is being around for her,'' he said, nodding
his head in her direction. ``And that's my goal. Getting back to
baseball is beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre's PSA test, which is used for the detection of prostate
cancer, registered at 2.6 last year, and when that increased to 4.6
in a physical examination last month, Torre assumed the worst; he
would rather have been pleasantly surprised, he said. Doctors
confirmed his cancer to him late in the afternoon last Tuesday. He
and Ali Torre, his wife, spoke late into the night. (``She is a
strong lady,'' he said Monday. ``If she is going to hang out with
an old guy, she's going to have to put up with this sort of
thing.'')
</P>
<P>
   Torre said his mind was like scrambled eggs. He stayed awake and
couldn't get his mind off the news. ``It was terrible,'' he said.
``It's like laying in bed and not being able to get comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Torre asked some of his veterans to
disseminate word of his cancer to other players. But they wondered
about his treatment, his long-term prognosis and when he might be
back. Torre knew they needed to hear from him directly, once he
made his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Torre entered the clubhouse at about 2:15 p.m., and for the next
15 minutes he told them in detail about his various examinations,
the diagnosis and the surgery he would have. Torre's tone was
optimistic and his delivery even, which was surprising to those who
had heard how subdued he had been last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams said Torre spoke to them in the same way he
always does; it was just like every other meeting, other than that
he was talking about his serious illness, rather than changing
base-running signs. Torre told them what he expected from them, how
they needed to approach the game the same way they did last year,
when they won a record 125 games.
</P>
<P>
   Torre walked over to Derek Jeter _ who has been joking about how
bench coach Don Zimmer, who will run the team in Torre's absence,
has forced him to make every road trip this spring _ and put his
hands on the shortstop's shoulders. ``Don't come to me and
complain,'' Torre told Jeter. ``Zim is the guy now.'' Everybody in
the room laughed.
</P>
<P>
   It was just like Torre to find a way to end the meeting in an
upbeat manner, David Cone said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just so classy,'' Cone said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He gave everyone a sense of confidence about this, and that
was good for everyone to hear,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see him in good spirits,'' Scott Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, who is coming back from colon cancer, stopped
Torre in the clubhouse and wished him well. ``He sounded good,''
Strawberry said. ``He knows the whole situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre says he feels terrific, better than he has in a couple of
years, perhaps because he increased his workout regimen during the
off-season. The diagnosis, he said, ``is frightening, there's no
question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot better now than I was a week ago, and a lot better
now than I was last Friday,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to it
at this point. I hope it's going to be all right, and I have
confidence in the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will follow the Yankees closely; Zimmer has made a point
of calling Torre and keeping him informed daily. The staff and the
front office will make the final decisions regarding the roster,
Torre said, because they will have seen the players perform this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has other matters to worry about now. You think that
baseball is your life, he said, and then something like this
happens. You have a 3-year-old daughter and now you are fully
dedicated to being around for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to feel like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Torre asked that those wishing to send flowers or cards instead
make a donation to their favorite charity or to the Starlight
Children's Foundation, c/o Joe Torre, 1560 Broadway, Suite 600, New
York, N.Y. 10036.

SYDNEY LEWIS, 79, ART COLLECTOR AND PATRON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sydney Lewis, a leading collector of contemporary art, Art
Nouveau and Art Deco, and a major benefactor of the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts in Richmond, died on Friday at Medical College of
Virginia Hospitals in Richmond. He was 79 and had been ill for some
time, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Frances, Lewis founded Best Products in 1958, an
early and highly successful showroom catalog business that
specialized in household appliances, jewelry, toys, sporting goods,
cameras and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple found their true calling in the early 1960s, when
Lewis' doctor told him that he was working too hard and needed a
diversion. Acting on a lifelong common interest in the arts, the
Lewises turned to collecting contemporary art, concentrating at
first on Pop Art and Photo Realism.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years they amassed an enormous collection and
became close friends with many artists. They frequently acquired
art through trades of Best Products goods, enabling many struggling
artists to furnish their lofts with appliances and televisions and
to live in relative comfort, sometimes before they were selling
much work.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, the Lewises began traveling to Europe and
building substantial collections of Art Nouveau and French Art Deco
works. They were known for buying masterpieces, but also for
representing important artists in depth, including Charles Rennie
Mackintosh, Eileen Gray, Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann, Emile Galle and
Louis Majorelle, as well as Louis Comfort Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises gave their first work of art to the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts in 1969, and in 1971 they established acquisition
money for contemporary art and Art Deco objects. Lewis served on
the board for most of the 1980s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the couple donated more than 1,500 artworks to the
museum, making it the home of the most important collection of Art
Nouveau outside Paris and of an especially beautiful selection of
Tiffany lamps. With Paul Mellon, they donated money for the
museum's West Wing, completed in 1985, which houses the Sydney and
Frances Lewis Galleries and the Paul Mellon Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was born in 1919 in Richmond, where his parents owned a
small publishing company. He graduated from Washington and Lee
University in 1940 and spent two years at the university's law
school. He married Frances Aronson, whom he had met during his
sophomore year in college in 1942. While serving in the Army during
World War II, he was sent to Harvard University for a military
program in business administration. Completing his law degree just
after the war, he practiced law briefly in Richmond and then worked
in his father's business until he decided to start his own.
</P>
<P>
   Best Products was incorporated in 1958 and at its height had
more than 200 showrooms in 27 states and annual sales of $2
billion. The company's stores offered further esthetic
possibilities; the Lewises began commissioning designs for them
from the New York firm of SITE, which specialized in trompe-l'oeil
architecture. They subsequently had their Philadelphia store
designed by Venturi, Rauch &AMP; Scott Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was also a board member of the Whitney Museum of American
Art in New York and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in
Washington. He served on the trustees' committee for architecture
and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where he and
his wife established a fund that enabled the Modern to acquire
several architectural models, including that of Frank Lloyd
Wright's Fallingwater.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises' philanthropies included $1.5 million to help
establish Eastern Virginia Medical School; $2 million for a
business school at Virginia Union University, where Lewis was a
trustee, and $9 million to Washington and Lee for a law school
building and the development of a legal studies center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Lewis is survived by two sons, Sydney
Lewis Jr. of Miami Beach and Andrew Lewis of Richmond; a daughter,
Susan Lewis Butler of Washington, and six grandchildren.

 &HT;    Ballooning duo still gunning for record
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Long before earth's eyes were turned on
Bertrand Piccard, soaring now above continents and oceans in
pursuit of a world ballooning record, the Swiss adventurer had to
brave a much harsher scrutiny _ fellow 4th graders at Riviera Beach
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   To the jeans-wearing, sneaker-scuffing kids of ``Ruh-vera''
Beach in 1968, a boy with a French accent, European clothes and
floppy blond hair was natural prey, no matter how famous his father
and grandfather were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of tough for him,'' said Florida Power &AMP; Light
engineer Craig Terrana, who was 10 at the time and young Bertrand's
only connection to this odd new world. ``I was kind of his
ambassador at Riviera Beach Elementary. He spoke English enough to
get by, but he was obviously very, very different _ he showed up
for school in almost lederhosen.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bertrand Piccard is grabbing attention again _ the hard
way. He and British copilot Brian Jones are steering their balloon
across the Pacific Ocean and expect to reach the coast of Mexico
Wednesday. They hope to become the first to fly a balloon nonstop
around the globe. Already, they are closer to it than anyone has
been before.
</P>
<P>
   As boys, Piccard and Terrana were linked by the work of their
fathers, a multi-million dollar scientific mission that temporarily
put the Port of Palm Beach on the world oceanographic map.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Piccard was an internationally known scientist and
explorer who had a contract with Grumman Aircraft to design a
medium-depth submarine to drift the Gulf Stream from Florida to
Newfoundland. Piccard and another scientist had claimed the world
record _ 35,800 feet _ for ocean diving in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Terrana was Grumman's project engineer for the PX-15,
later christened the Ben Franklin submersible. The Terrana family
moved from New York to Lausanne, Switzerland, for two years while
the craft was being built. Then the project team moved from
Switzerland to Riviera Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a dramatic culture change,'' Craig Terrana
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Month after month, the team tested the Franklin off Riviera
Beach, trying to solve the problem of electrical shorts in cables
connecting 378 batteries covering the outside of the hull.
Hurricane season was closing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to do it or postpone it for a year, so we said
let's do it,'' said Donald Terrana, retired and living in Venice,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Franklin's crew of six finally locked the hatches and were
towed out to sea in July 1969. The Grumman-Piccard Gulf Stream
Drift Mission began July 14 and ended 30 days later and 1,440 miles
northward off the coast of Maine. It logged 5 million pieces of
oceanographic data, and provided NASA with 50,000 photos of crew
life in a confined area that were used in designing manned
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Piccards returned to Switzerland in 1970, after which
Jacques Piccard used his knowledge and fame as an advocate for
protecting the ocean environment. Bertrand Piccard survived the
culture shock of Riviera Beach and grew up to be a psychiatrist and
adventurer in the mode of his forefathers _ most notably his
grandfather Auguste Piccard, who once held a world altitude record
for flying 55,000 feet high in a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bertrand Piccard's third try for the ultimate ballooning
record. He and Jones set off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the International Aeronautical Federation govern how
the world record can be claimed. A balloon must:
</P>
<P>
   _ Not land during its flight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reach or go beyond the longitude from which it took off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Travel a distance equal to two-thirds of the earth's
equatorial circumference _ in other words, stay within a zone
extending from the equator to about 40 degrees north.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, beermaker Anheuser-Busch announced it would award a cup
and $500,000 to the first team to succeed, plus $500,000 to a
charity chosen by the team. The prize is small, compared to the
millions of dollars that go into the balloon expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   To be first is the real goal and what keeps the handful of
world-class balloonists doggedly risking their lives and fortunes.
Bertrand Piccard's first attempt ended embarrassingly after only
six hours into the flight, so short that a local French newspaper
called it un saut de puce _ a flea's jump. He was not deterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it was only a dream, I don't care,'' he told The
Guardian newspaper afterward. ``People need dreams, they need
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have dreams that carry us forward.''
</P>

ROCK HALL OF FAME INDUCTS SPRINGSTEEN, JOEL AND MCCARTNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Springsteen, a regular at the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame's annual ceremonies since its first members were named
in 1986, was inducted himself Monday night, along with Paul
McCartney, Billy Joel, Dusty Springfield, Curtis Mayfield, Del
Shannon and the Staple Singers.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney and Mayfield had already been inducted as members of
the Beatles and the Impressions.
</P>
<P>
   In ceremonies over the years, Springsteen paid tribute to Roy
Orbison, Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival; he has jammed
with Mick Jagger and Jerry Lee Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his award from Ray Charles, Joel said, ``I grew up in
Levittown, not exactly the epicenter of soul in America. We found
out later that they did not sell Levitt homes to African-American
families. So where were we going to get soul? We got it from the
radio, we got it from rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Current stars _ including Lauryn Hill, the winner of this year's
Grammy Award for best album, as well as Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt
and Elton John _ were on hand to praise their idols at the ceremony
and jam session at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians are not eligible for the Hall of Fame until 25 years
after their first recording, and this year's members include
musicians with long blockbuster careers, like Springsteen and Joel,
as well as those who spent only a few years at the top of the
charts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Hall of Fame is in Cleveland, all but one of the
annual ceremonies have been held in music-business capitals, like
New York and Los Angeles. Like rock 'n' roll itself, the annual
event been transformed from a loosely organized party to a media
event; this year's induction ceremony is to be broadcast on
Wednesday at 9 p.m., on the cable channel VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gently mocking the notion of becoming an elder statesman, before
a room full of music-business figures in black-tie who had paid
$1,500 to $2,500 per seat, Joel opened the ceremony with ``Only the
Good Die Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel praised rock's black pioneers, and teased his critics. ``I
know I've been referred to as derivative,'' he said. ``I'm
derivative as hell. If anybody that's derivative was excluded from
this institution, it would mean there wouldn't be any white people
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill praised the Staple Singers, the soul and gospel group
best remembered for ``I'll Take You There.'' She said the group had
``unmistakably proven that speaking of faith and spirituality and
God is in accordance with being `fly' and commercially
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The hall also recognized two of rock's early influences. Bonnie
Raitt paid tribute to Charles Brown, a suave and heartbroken urban
blues singer who died in January. She praised ``a voice like brandy
and molasses dripping down that laid-back sultry, laid-back
groove.'' She told the music-business executives at the Waldorf,
``If they sell the records, give them the money. If they can sing
and play, put them on your shows.''

<P>
   Bob Wills, whose Texas Playboys were the best-known band in
Western swing, was also named as an early influence on rock, and
the producer George Martin, best known for working with the
Beatles, was honored, though he was not a performer.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John paid homage to Dusty Springfield, who died on March
2. ``When I first heard that voice, I fell in love with that
voice,'' he said. ``I think she's the greatest white singer that
there ever has been.'' He added that when Springfield first came to
America, hearing Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers had ``changed
her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Springfield's manager, Vicki Wickham, said, ``She was never
really quite sure that people appreciated her or knew about her.
This meant a lot.''

   The museum reorganized its management in December. Its new chief
executive, Terry Stewart, said that the museum is trying to raise
money to build a library and archive, and expand its performance
space. Ahmet Ertegun, the co-director of the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Foundation, said the museum would soon announce an exhibition
of rock 'n' roll fashion in conjunction with the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.

NFL OWNERS REMAIN UNDECIDED OVER EXPANSION IN HOUSTON, L.A. 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Though Los Angeles continues to have the look of a
champion for NFL expansion, team owners remained at odds between
that city and Houston on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he
expected the Expansion Committee to reach a conclusion in the
afternoon, leading to speculation that Los Angeles would get the
nod.
</P>
<P>
   But because the 14-member committee remained split, NFL
officials put the matter before the entire ownership group for 1
1/2 hours without a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners argued for Los Angeles because it is an important
television market. But a forceful case was made for Houston because
it is a done deal, while the two Los Angeles bids are far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Under NFL rules, expansion must be approved by 24 of the 31 team
owners. The league hopes to have a decision when their annual
spring meeting ends Thursday at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Bob McNair is proposing building a $310
million, retractable roof stadium using $195 million in public
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate developer Ed Roski and businessman Eli Broad would
spend $350 million in private funds to renovate the L.A. Coliseum.
Hollywood deal maker Michael Ovitz proposes spending roughly the
same amount of private funds to build a new stadium atop a waste
dump in nearby Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a challenge,'' said a visibly exasperated Jerry
Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers and committee
co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have 24 votes currently to go from 31 to 32
(teams),'' said Richardson. ``We don't have 24 votes for Houston.
We don't have 24 votes for Carson, nor do we have 24 votes for the
L.A. Coliseum. We don't have 24 votes for Bob McNair. We don't have
24 votes for Michael Ovitz. And we don't have 24 votes for Eli
Broad.''
</P>
<P>
   A strident bloc of owners that includes Tennessee Titans owner
Bud Adams opposes any expansion. The group includes owners with
stadium problems and those who don't want to risk sharing TV
revenues with a new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a difficult decision,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming owners agreed to expand this week, Richardson said he
could not yet envision a middle ground that would attract support
of 24 owners.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have been pushing a plan to give Los Angeles up to
10 months to come up with a workable stadium deal and ownership
team. If the deadline passed, Houston would get the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that possibility was discussed Monday, ``but as
we stand here today, I would say we're not even close to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The delay was a pleasant surprise for McNair, who has said he
will seek to buy an existing franchise and move it to Houston
unless he gets some type of NFL arrangement giving Houston an
expanision team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our support hangs in with us, the (32nd) franchise won't go
anywhere _ it takes 24 votes,'' McNair said. ``I think they will
have to come out with some solution satisfactory to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league will neither expand to 33 teams nor
promise to move a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to expand to a 33rd (team), that's clear,'' he
said. ``Los Angeles ... is a large television market, but there are
still question marks. Houston is also a large television market,
though not as large. But it has a good stadium plan.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he will push a new scenario calling for Los Angeles
to get a shorter time frame than 10 months to put together a deal.
McNair said one NFL official told him that perhaps Los Angeles
would get only until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be delighted if they would tell Los Angeles, `you've got
the deal, just come back at the May owners meeting and prove you
can do the deal,''' McNair said. ``I think I'd go put a shovel in
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he still believes that Los Angeles will get the
expansion team. ``We've been working on this three years,'' he
said. ``Waiting another day or two doesn't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue said Roski's proposal has problems because a
renovated Coliseum would not have enough parking nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Roski later countered that the Coliseum currently has 25,000
parking spaces. However, many of those are up to one mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   One of Houston's biggest supporters Monday was Pittsburgh
Steelers owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played there, we had a great rivalry with them (Houston
Oilers),'' Rooney said. ``(Former Oilers coach) Bum Phillips used
to say the Super Bowl goes through Pittsburgh and that he was
coming down to break down the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold out in both towns and I really enjoyed going to
Houston. I thought it was a great city for the NFL.''

 &HT;    Death of hosts' son cancels Clinton luncheon
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ President Clinton's visit to Sewall's
Point tonight will be subdued by the death during the weekend of
the 25-year-old son of Palm Beach County supporters Melvin and Bren
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's luncheon in Manalapan was canceled Monday after Joshua
Jeremiah Simon died in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bren Simon was told of her son's death while visiting the White
House to make plans for today's lunch at the oceanside estate,
according to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will still visit Sewall's Point tonight for a $5,000 per
person dinner at the home of attorney Willie Gary. The money is
going to the Democratic National Committee for the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Joshua Simon's death were sketchy Monday. The
family is in seclusion and a spokesman for the Simons declined to
comment. One family friend said the son, who would have been 26 on
April 30, died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd had no problems, nothing, this was just out of the
blue,'' said the family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Simons are in Indianapolis, the family's hometown, preparing
for their son's funeral. Simon's company, which is run by his son,
David, owns shopping malls throughout America including the
Treasure Coast Square Mall in Jensen Beach, the Palm Beach and
Boynton Beach malls, and Town Center Mall near Boca Raton. He
recently signed a contract to operate malls in Europe. Simon 71,
also is the owner of the Ritz Carlton in Manalapan.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One is expected to land at Palm Beach International
Airport at about 6:45 p.m. When Clinton steps off the plane, he
will be greeted by Palm Beach County Commission Chairman Maude Ford
Lee and Commissioner Carol Roberts as well as leaders of some of
the county's Democratic clubs. Also on hand will be Monte Friedkin,
chairman of the county Democratic Party and a major contributor to
the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrival, Clinton will board Marine One for a
helicopter ride to Witham Field in Martin County. After dinner, he
will return to PBIA and take off about 10:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen supporters from the canceled Manalapan event are
expected at Gary's house, said his aide, Stacey Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion is getting a fresh coat of paint, and painters hope
to complete the rest of the home's exterior before Clinton touches
down in Stuart.

ROBERT Q. MARSTON, 76, DIES; DIRECTED INSTITUTES OF HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Quarles Marston, a leading medical educator and
researcher who fought for the separation of science and politics
while he directed the National Institutes of Health in the Nixon
administration, died on Sunday at a hospice in Gainesville, Fla. He
was 76 and had lived on a farm in nearby Alachua.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to the University of Florida,
which Marston helped gain national stature before retiring as
president emeritus in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Marston, a former Rhodes scholar from Virginia, had a meteoric
rise and abrupt fall in the federal government's medical hierarchy.
He was chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to serve as
the ninth director of the health institutes, which are largely
autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded the celebrated Dr. James A. Shannon, during whose
13-year stewardship the agency had become one of the world's
foremost centers of research and education in medicine, biology and
public health. Its reputation for excellence had flourished along
with manifold increases in budget, staff, training programs and
laboratories devoted to various facets of human health.
</P>
<P>
   Marston took over at a crossroads for the agency, which was
facing congressional unwillingness to finance basic scientific
investigation rather than research that paid off quickly at the
patient's bedside. Medical education in the country was in dire
financial straits.
</P>
<P>
   Further clouding the picture for the institutes' comprehensive
approach to health issues was the all-out war against cancer
declared by President Richard M. Nixon. By the early 1970s
scientists like Marston registered their doubts about singling out
cancer, heart disease or any politically resonant illness to the
detriment of other areas, like child care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Marston drafted an internal memorandum to warn that the
shift in financing was curtailing important biomedical research.
Nixon, he advised his political superiors at the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, should be made aware of the
long-range impact this would have on the nation's health.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement over allocations and priorities spilled over
into the public arena in the 1972 election year. Marston was
abruptly dismissed that December, prompting an outcry from the
scientific community. Other administrators, managers and scientists
in the department were forced to resign as well in the ensuing
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Toano, Va., Robert Quarles Marston graduated from the
Virginia Military Institute in 1943 and from the Medical College of
Virginia in 1947. At Oxford, he studied under Dr. Howard Florey, a
developer of penicillin and winner of the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   He completed his training at Vanderbilt University Hospital and
the Medical College of Virginia, where he started his academic
career in 1954. He was vice chancellor of the University of
Mississippi and dean of its medical school in 1966 when the health
institutes named him associate director of its regional medical
programs on heart, cancer and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of the University of Florida in 1974. In 10
years at the helm, he oversaw a sizeable growth in endowment,
enrollment and campus building, and he laid the groundwork for the
university's admission to the Association of American Universities,
which gave it national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Marston's survivors include a daughter, Ann Wright Peace, of
Tappahannock, Va.; two sons, Robert D., of Newport News, Va., and
W. Wesley, of Gainesville; and six grandchildren. His wife, Ann
Carter Garnett Marston, died last July after 51 years of marriage.

DEL CLOSE, 64, A COMEDIAN WITH A FLAIR FOR IMPROVISATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Del Close, an actor, improvisational comic and mentor to such
comedians as John Belushi, John Candy and Bill Murray, died on
March 4 at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago. He was 64 and
lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said Charna Halpern, his partner for
the last 15 years at Improv Olympic, a theater school and
performance space.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong devotee of improvisational comedy, Close was one of
those show business legends whose influence was felt far beyond his
limited fame. As one of the founders of the Committee, the San
Francisco comedy troupe of the 1960s; as a longtime performer with
and director of the Second City troupe in Chicago, and as a
resident coach of the ``Saturday Night Live'' troupe during its
early years, Close played guru to many of the most prominent
comedians of the last quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurial and hard-living, he had a dark _ some said morbid _
sense of humor, which was evident on the night before he died. Some
50 of his friends, including Murray and the director Harold Ramis,
gathered in his hospital room for a raucous farewell, during which,
among other things, Close bequeathed his skull to the Goodman
Theater and telephoned his final instructions to the group he had
been coaching, the Upright Citizens Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Close never married and leaves no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a jeweler, Del Close was born on March 9, 1934, in
Manhattan, Kan. He was a second cousin of Dwight D. Eisenhower. As
a teen-ager, he left home to join a traveling carnival, learning to
swallow fire and survive as the target of a knife thrower. In the
mid-1950s, he joined the St. Louis company of the Compass Players,
an improvisational troupe created by Mike Nichols and Elaine May.
The troupe was a direct ancestor of Second City, which was founded
in 1959 and which Close joined in 1962. By then he had performed on
Broadway in a comedy about beatniks called ``The Nervous Set.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two decades, he had an on-again, off-again
relationship with Second City, which grew ever rockier as his own
predilection for improvisation clashed with the troupe's scripted
sketches. He finally left in 1983, joining Ms. Halpern at Improv
Olympic, where they developed a method, which they called the
Harold, for creating extended comic improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Close created two comedy albums, ``How to Speak
Hip'' and ``The Do-It-Yourself Psychoanalysis Kit.'' He acted in
many films, including ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' ``The
Untouchables'' and ``Fat Man and Little Boy.'' He also appeared
onstage, most recently in the 1995 Steppenwolf revival of Sam
Shepard's ``Buried Child,'' and in Peter Sellars' 1994 production,
at the Goodman, of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' which was set in
Venice Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shakespeare sounded a continuous note in Close's life.
In 1975, he played Polonius in a production of Hamlet, at the
Wisdom Bridge Theater in Chicago, directed by Robert Falls, and in
his second album, he imagined Sigmund Freud with Hamlet as a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   He underscored the theme with his deathbed bequest to the
Goodman, where Falls is now the artistic director. ``It was so he
could play Yorick in their next Hamlet production,'' Ms. Halpern
said. ``But he was also willing to be an extra, you know, a desert
skull if they needed one for a western. That's the quintessential
Del. He's still getting laughs even when he's gone.''

EDITORIAL: THE MOST LOCAL OF FISHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 16:
</P>
<P>
   When the blue pike began to disappear from Lake Erie in the
1950s, it took with it a major regional fishery and a cornerstone
of the Friday fish fry, a thriving culinary institution in the
heavily Catholic towns and cities that line the lake shore in Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New York. Other fish filled in once the blue pike
was gone _ it was declared extinct in 1975, when the Great Lakes
themselves seemed moribund _ but nothing really replaced it. It is
odd to think that no one under the age of 45 is likely to remember
tasting blue pike, though it was a staple of their parents' diet
and a vital element in their parents' religious observance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a long search, scientists have found a well-preserved
specimen of blue pike whose DNA will allow them to judge whether
the claims of blue pike sightings in other lakes are true. The
specimen was kept for decades in the freezer of Jim Anthony, a
barber in Conneaut, Ohio. Nearly every serious fisherman finds a
long-forgotten fish in the freezer now and then, but Anthony _ a
man as persistent as he is sentimental _ caught his blue pike in
1962 and has preserved it ever since. A frozen blue pike is even
rarer than a living coelacanth, a prehistoric fish once thought to
be extinct but which has been caught from time to time in the
Comoros archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk, if blue pike still survive somewhere, of
reviving the blue pike fishery in Lake Erie. That will depend upon
the well-being of the blue pike's chief prey, the lake herring, and
the lake herring's chief prey, and the chief prey of the lake
herring's chief prey, and so on down to a microscopic level. But it
will take something else as well _ a renewed appetite for blue
pike.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the trend in this country was toward a
nationalizing of our foodstuffs, with the steady loss of locally
important foods. A good example is the general triumph of
chain-restaurant burgers over the ``beef on weck'' sandwich in
Buffalo, N.Y., which was once also a great blue-pike city. It
sounds remarkable to imagine eating local fish fresh from the water
in a shoreline restaurant overlooking the broad expanse of Lake
Erie. But there was a time, not that long ago, when it happened
every Friday night. &QL;

NEW GRADUATION STANDARDS WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR MANY, STUDENT SCORES
INDICATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With just a year to go before high school students must pass a
tough new English Regents test to graduate, New York state
education officials released test results on Monday showing that
more than a quarter of all seniors _ and more than a third of those
in New York City _ would have failed if the requirement had been in
place last year.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome made little difference to those students, because
they were able to graduate with non-Regents diplomas. But this
year's 11th graders will have to pass the English Regents this year
or next with a score of 55 or better.
</P>
<P>
   And the new version of the test, to be given for the first time
this June, will be harder, lasting six hours over two days and
putting more emphasis on analytical writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to conclude that this still isn't good enough,'' said
Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner. ``We have a
long haul ahead of us, and it's going to be particularly
challenging for the high-needs school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who has led a statewide drive for higher standards, did
say he was encouraged that nearly three-quarters of last year's
12th graders would have met the standard. And he and other
officials called for stronger efforts to help students prepare for
the tougher Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents results were among a welter of test scores released
on Monday by education officials in Albany and New York City, with
mixed news for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew in his own campaign to
raise citywide achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Results from last year's statewide reading and math tests showed
that third-and sixth-grade scores had stayed about the same
throughout the state but had dropped by four percentage points in
New York City. (The city's scores were released in the fall; the
statewide scores that put them in context were released on Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   None of the results released on Monday involved the
much-heralded, much-maligned reading and writing test given to all
the state's fourth graders in January. Those results are expected
by May.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the many standardized tests that have been added to
students' plates in recent years, the new English Regents has
received particularly close attention because the stakes are so
high. In the past, students could take a basic-skills competency
test to graduate; by next year, the vast majority will need to
score 55 or better on the more rigorous Regents exam, which was
intended for those going on to college.
</P>
<P>
   Exams on other subjects will be added in subsequent years, and
the passing score will be raised to 65.
</P>
<P>
   The state reported that 73 percent of last year's 12th graders
had passed the English Regents exam at some point, whether in the
12th or in earlier grades. The figure for New York City was 63
percent. This means that of last year's seniors, 27 percent
statewide and 37 percent citywide did not pass the exam before
graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those numbers will improve this year is hard to tell.
The state, which administers the test in January, June and August,
has not finished compiling results from this year's first round of
testing. On Monday, the New York City Board of Education released
its own early results showing that nearly 80 percent of the 11th
graders who took the exam had passed it.
</P>
<P>
   But those results were from a limited sample: just 55 percent of
the city's 49,260 high school juniors took the exam in January;
those who did not take it were deemed not ready for it by their
school's administrators or skipped it for personal reasons.

<P>
   It's time for the first Sports on the Net awards for
sports-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, because the Academy Awards are less than a week away
... and some of us have already been eliminated from the March
Madness office pool.
</P>
<P>
   So, in no particular order, here is one Web surfer's winners
based on what's cool and functional:
</P>
<P>
   BEST MAINSTREAM SPORTS SITE: CBS SportsLine
(cbs.sportsline.com).
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine, ESPN.com and CNN/SI have practically the same
format and features. The difference? CBS SportsLine's major
presence on America Online combined with its quick access to its
superstar sites, featuring Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and
Shaquille O'Neal. CBS SportsLine also has a big international
section in cooperation with the London Daily Mail's Soccernet site,
which should delight soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: ESPN.com, CNN/SI.com, MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FAN SITE: Andrew's Dallas Stars Page
(rampages.onramp.net/(tilde)markstep/stars.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Of the many thousands of fan pages out there, few compare to
this father-son creation. Mark and Andrew Stepneski of Plano keep
this site's content and design fresher than some official sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: Forty Niner Faithful (www.armanini.com/niners),
a clearinghouse of everything about the San Francisco 49ers; Packer
Palace (home.earthlink.net/(tilde)norbertn/packerpalace), with its
deco design, is the most entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL PRO TEAM SITE: San Jose Sharks
(www.sj-sharks.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of official team sites have quicker load times, but
once the San Jose Sharks' official site gets in place, it's a
worthy visit. The non-frames site includes complete club
information, tons of interaction, submit-your-own-fan-site contests
(not something the holier-than-thou official sites usually do) and
multimedia connections. Of course, one would expect a team based
near Silicon Valley to produce a killer site.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: Yankees.com taps into its tradition effectively;
DenverBroncos.com pulls together its content and merchandising
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL SPORTS SITE FOR A SINGLE LEAGUE: NHL.com. The NHL
has great content and interactivity for the hardcore hockey fans,
along with features for young users (NHL4kids.com).
</P>
<P>
   BEST UNOFFICIAL SITE FOR A SINGLE SPORT: In The Crease
(www.inthecrease.com). In The Crease covers hockey from top to
bottom. It's a must-visit site for serious hockey fans, foreign and
domestic.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL COLLEGE SPORTS SITE FOR A SINGLE EVENT:
FinalFour.net (www.finalfour.net). If you're chained to the work
station, FinalFour.net offers an escape to March Madness, provided
your personal computer is powered with multimedia plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   BEST UNOFFICIAL COLLEGE SPORTS SITE: Greatest College Football
Finishes (www.nd.edu/(tilde)tmandell/finishestable.html). Ted
Mandell of South Bend, Ind., has brought together descriptions of
fantastic finishes, several with original broadcast audio files.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the awards that's usually given backstage:
</P>
<P>
   BEST MULTIMEDIA SPORTS SITE: Broadcast.com
(www.broadcast.com/sports). Dallas-based company has the market
cornered on multimedia, from March Madness to live bull riding.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FANTASY SITE: Pure Sports (www.puresports.com). Top
resource for fantasy geeks.
</P>
<P>
   BEST USE OF GRAPHICS: Packer Palace
(home.earthlink.net/(tilde)norbertn/packerpalace). Discover the
many uses of Vince Lombardi's head as a graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OUTDOORS SITE: The Mountain Zone (www.mountainzone.com).
Not a resource for anglers or hunters, but for things to do while
careening off the sides of mountains.

IN WAKE OF SPY CASE, LEADING SENATORS DEMAND U.S. LIMIT HELP FOR
BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS grafs 1-2 to recast lede, emphasize threat to block
diplomatic effort rather than demand to limit trade policies; ADD
Shelby quote in new 5th graf of 2nd take, Shelby was unmoved ...)

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Influential senators threatened Monday to block the
Clinton administration's leading diplomatic effort to improve
fast-deteriorating relations with China, and they urged the
suspension of some scientific exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said
they would move to stop any effort by the White House to help China
become a member of the World Trade Organization this year,
reflecting congressional anger over President Clinton's response to
suspicions that China stole nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, urged the president or Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to put a moratorium on visits by
scientists from countries like China and Iran to American national
weapons laboratories, and on reciprocal visits by American
scientists to foreign installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our labs are not as secure as they should be,'' Shelby told
reporters after an hourlong, closed meeting with CIA Director
George Tenet. ``This perhaps is just the tip of an iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department last week fired a Taiwan-born scientist at
Los Alamos National Laboratory for security breaches, after the FBI
questioned him in connection with the suspected theft of nuclear
weapons designs. Investigators say they believe the scientist, Wen
Ho Lee, gave the Chinese sensitive information on nuclear
detonations during a visit there for a 1988 seminar. Lee has not
been charged with any crime, but is the prime suspect in the case.
China denies any theft and has called the allegations of nuclear
espionage outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House and Senate have criticized the
administration for not tightening security quickly enough and
failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the seriousness
of the possible breaches at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Monday night the administration would work with Congress to resolve
the WTO issue, but the official rejected Shelby's proposal.
``There's no evidence the visitors program has contributed to any
damage to national security,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The double-barreled attack from Capitol Hill came as Richardson
and Tenet, in separate closed briefings, tried to contain the
political fallout from the administration's handling of the spy
case by explaining steps the administration has taken to prevent
any more thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet announced that a retired four-star admiral, David
Jeremiah, will head an independent panel of experts to review the
possible harm to national security resulting from suspected thefts
that took place in the 1980s and that were discovered by nuclear
arms experts at Los Alamos in 1995. Jeremiah is expected to report
by early next month.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the administration stepped up its defense of its
response to the spy case, the White House took a blow on its trade
policy with China. The warning from Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, and Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Commerce Committee, was issued in a letter sent to all senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations,
espionage and possible technology transfers,'' they wrote,
``suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter
the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two weeks ago, in Beijing, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright assured China's leaders that the question of whether China
was ready to enter the WTO _ a decade-long aspiration for China and
a move that could prove enormously beneficial to the country's
economy _ would be decided solely on commercial grounds. It would
not hinge, she said, on China's human rights record or other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that even
if that is the administration's plan, the atmosphere in Congress is
rapidly changing. And congressional approval will be necessary,
because China's entry would require a major amendment of the law
that allows Congress to review, each year, whether to extend ``most
favored nation'' trading status to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a poisonous issue,'' one of the president's
top economic advisers said the other day. ``And it could blow up
the whole deal, if there is a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Sens. Helms and Hollings, which was reported in
Monday's Wall Street Journal, mirrors conditions that the House
Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, has made and portends
a tough fight for China to join the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as anger in Congress grows on the trade front, there is
greater anxiety over security at Los Alamos and other national
weapons labs. The labs had long resisted FBI and congressional
pressure to tighten their security policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, which oversees the labs, has been lax in
its supervision. The department, for example, never filed a
congressionally required annual report in 1998 on the status of
security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over as Energy secretary last fall,
Richardson learned of the urgency of the spy case and reinstated
background checks on all foreign visitors, but it was a move the
FBI had recommended 17 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby was unmoved Monday, saying, ``The president or the Energy
Secretary should put a moratorium on the exchange of people coming
into our labs, and our scientists going to their labs, and perhaps
giving them information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, of Nebraska, the Intelligence Committee's
ranking Democrat, distanced himself Monday from Shelby's suggestion
of a moratorium noting that ``it's not a situation where foreign
visitors are the problems, it's the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, in a statement Monday night, said
rigorous screening and security measures were in place to insure
foreign visitors could not gain access to classified material.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey expressed concern over security at the laboratories,
even with the improvements Richardson has put in place, including
doubling the counterintelligence budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I no longer have any sense of security that we're doing the
right thing,'' Kerrey told reporters after meeting with Tenet.
``What I have right now is a considerable amount of nervousness
over our counterintelligence efforts and their effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans pounced on the spy case as evidence that
the administration's policy of engaging China turned a blind eye to
national security, a top Republican analyst, William Kristol,
accused congressional Republicans of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have largely supported the president and Sandy
Berger on engagement and trade above all else in China,'' Kristol
said Monday, referring to the president's national security
adviser, Samuel Berger. ``Ultimately, it looks like, hey, something
hit the headlines and let's take advantage of it.''
