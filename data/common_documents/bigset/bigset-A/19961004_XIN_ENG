<HEADLINE> Patten's Final Policy Address Disappointing: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Governor Chris
Patten issued his final policy address on Wednesday, demonstrating
once again his opposition to the establishment of the provisional
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking office in 1992, Chris Patten introduced his
"political reform" and damaged the "through-train" arrangements,
stirring up a dispute between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
After four years he not only failed to examine his mistakes,
but tried to seek every possible means to defend himself, saying
that "political reform" has nothing to do with any issues that
contravene the "Joint Declaration" or the "Basic Law", regardless
of facts.
</P>
<P>
In the policy address Patten again hurled attacks upon the
provisional legislature, and pledged to draw a demarcation line
with it.
</P>
<P>
As for the reason why he is so hostile to the provisional
legislature, one newspaper pointed out in its editorial that the
decision to establish a provisional legislature smashed his
"political reform" as well as his fond dream to extend the
three-tier political framework designed by himself beyond 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the final address, Patten said that he would give all-out
support to the chief executive-designate upon the establishment of
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, and he also claimed that he would offer the "best
cooperation and assistance".
</P>
<P>
But when the Preparatory Committee submitted ten requirements
to seek cooperation from the British Hong Kong government, Patten
abandoned his commitment.
</P>
<P>
Britain's colonial rule over Hong Kong will terminate on June
30. 1997. The question of how Hong Kong is administered from July
1st 1997 will be entirely the affair of the SAR government within
the scope of its high-degree autonomy.
</P>
<P>
However, Patten deliberately regarded the chief executive of
the future Hong Kong SAR as his successor and outlined ten items
for the work of the SAR executive body.
</P>
<P>
From his address, his attempt is obviously exposed: the smooth
transition is not his only aim, and all what he needs is a
successful transition, which tries to extend the colonial rule
beyond 1997 and influence the operation of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
To people's indignation, the address made much criticism and
maliciously attacked the people who love the motherland and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
With only nine months to go before Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, Sino-British relations are progressing to the
direction of the continuous improvment.
</P>
<P>
In the final and critical stage of the transitional period,
increasing cooperation between China and Britain, and guaranteing
a smooth transition has become the common aspiration of the all
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
As the policy address goes against the wishes of the Hong Kong
people, and is widely divergent from the British government's
repeated expression of restoring and developing the Sino-British
cooperative relations, it has once again aroused new disputes in
Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia have decided to establish diplomatic
relations, French President Jacques Chirac announced today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will soon exchange ambassadors, said Chirac
at a joint press conference with Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who held
their first summit meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is
composed of Serbia and Montenegro, were parts of the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had bad relations during the Bosnian civil
war as Serbia allegedly supported the rebel Bosnian Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Bush Fire Threatens Kruger National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A raging bush fire has
devastated at least a quarter of South Africa's premier tourist
attraction, the Kruger National Park.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of animals and birds are feared dead in the
conflagration in the southern part of the park, the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The park draws 700,000 foreign tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which was still burning this morning, was sparked
by lightning one week ago.
</P>
<P>
Park officials said the blaze was made worse by this week's
high temperatures and gale-force winds.
</P>
<P>
The park, founded in 1926, covers 20,000 square kilometres and
is one of the greatest diversity of wildlife in the world. enditem

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Multinational Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Benazir Bhutto, the prime
minister of Pakistan, called on Thursday for a multinational
conference in South Asia, that will include the five permanent
members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the 51st General Assembly, Bhutto noted that
while Kashmir dispute has led to four direct or indirect wars
between India and Pakistan, South Asia lacks a regional security
system.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, saying that it
is exactly the kind of global measure for non-proliferation and
disarmament. She noted, however, India chose to veto the treaty in
the Geneva Conference on Disarmament and oppose the treaty in the
U.N. General Assembly last month.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to propose to this
august Assembly that it endorse the convening of a multinational
dialogue for peace and security in South Asia, including the
participation of not only Pakistan and India, but the five
permanent members of the Security Council and other major powers
like Germany and Japan," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the multilateral conference could cover three critical
areas, the first of which is the resolution of the Kashmir dispute
and other bilateral problems between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The second is the promotion of conventional arms control and
confidence building measures and the third measure is to promote
nuclear restraint and arrest the danger of a nuclear arms race in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that such multilateral talks offer a frame-work for
genuine negotiations which can lead to a resolution of disputes,
arrest the nuclear threat, and promote prosperity in South Asia,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> China Selects Students to Study Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- About 1,400 Chinese people will
be able to study abroad with government aid after successfully
competing under a new and open system for government-supported
overseas study.
</P>
<P>
They have become the first group of the students to win the
honor since China launched a new system in January to encourage
fair competition in selecting excellent students for overseas
study.
</P>
<P>
The 1,399 people are expected to be sent to study in 53
countries after signing agreements with the State Foundation for
Overseas Study, a governmental organ which will fund their study
abroad.
</P>
<P>
All those selected will be visiting scholars, including 28
percent who will be senior scholars. And 68 percent have earned
master's or doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
The new system was highly welcomed when it was announced early
this year. Thousands of people from across the country asked for
application forms.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, applicants are evaluated by experts organized
by the foundation, and are finally selected by the State Education
Commission.
</P>
<P>
They are required to sign agreements with the administrative
committee of the foundation to make sure that they return to
China. Otherwise they have to pay compensations.

PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pascal Weber was really shocked
when ordered to pay 115,352 francs (23,100 U.S. dollars) in tax
arrears accumulated since 1988.
</P>
<P>
.....He was not in France until April 1995!
</P>
<P>
He was threatened by the September 16 notice with the
confiscation of all his properties if he refused to pay the money.
</P>
<P>
Only after the Luxemburg shopkeeper went to the local tax
department did he learn that he had the same name, same birth date
and same security number as another man wanted for evading taxes.
</P>
<P>
His quandary didn't stop there. Eight days later, he found his
bank account had been frozen by the government.
</P>
<P>
Outraged, Weber launched a lawsuit at a local court in Moselle.
</P>
<P>
He called for the annulment of the freeze order, which is still
in force, and demanded 10,000 francs (2,000 U.S. dollars)
compensation for material losses and mental distress.

CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's security forces shot dead
three gunmen today in a village near Malawi, Minya province, some
220 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The security forces killed the gunmen after exchanging fire
with them, according to Egypt's new agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted a security source as saying that a number of
unidentified gunmen opened fired from a nearby cemetery at the
security forces, who were searching in plantations near the site
where two policemen were killed by gunmen Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The security forces returned fire and killed the three gunmen,
MENA said, adding that two automatic machine guns and a pistol
were found near the bodies of the gunmen, believed to be Moslem
militants.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's security forces have fiercely cracked down on Moslem
militants, who have waged a violent campaign against the
government since 1992 in an attempt to install strict Islamic
rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
Recently, there have been terrorist attacks by suspected
Moslem militants on police and civilians in southern Egypt almost
on daily basis.

<HEADLINE> Doctor's AIDS Infection Was Labor Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A French court today recognized a
report by a committee of experts who described the infection of a
doctor by the AIDS virus when he was conducting a surgery as "a
labor accident."
</P>
<P>
Doctor Patrick Cohen cut his finger during an operation on a
patient in May 1983, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye Hospital in Yveline,
west of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later, Cohen, who was then 43 years old, began to
suffer from mono-nucleus infection, which is one of the
preliminary syndromes in AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
"At that time people did not really know about the
virus. Today, people would call it sero-conversion," Sabine
Paugam, Cohen's lawyer, told the court in Versailles.
</P>
<P>
"The recognition of the professional disease today has been
made without objection," the Tribunal of Social Security Affairs,
under the Versaille Tribunal, announced.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal had selected a new committee of experts in
February after a former committee rejected the thesis of a labor
accident.
</P>
<P>
Paugam said that the cause-and-result relationship between the
wound and the disease was "extremely well established" by the new
experts. Their report was submitted in early September to the
local authorities in charge of disease insurance.
</P>
<P>
After Cohen was found to be HIV-positive, the hospital
authorities contacted about 8,000 patients he had operated on from
1983 to 1994, and 3,000 of them had been tested for the
AIDS-causing virus.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is now under treatment at home by an AIDS expert,
has launched a lawsuit against the government and the hospital for
"insufficient protection measures."

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in Balkans to Be Completed Soon: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav press said Thursday
the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia has indicated that the
implementation of the peace process for the former Yugoslavia
would soon be concluded.
</P>
<P>
The press said the lifting of the sanctions was the logical
consequence and result of the years of constructive and peaceful
policy of Yugoslavia and in particular Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to lift
the sanctions against Yugoslavia. The overall trade embargo,
imposed in May 1992, was suspended last November but has crippled
the Yugoslav economy.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade daily Politika said a great injury had been done
to Yugoslavia through the imposition of the sanctions, and their
lifting was crucial for the entire Balkans because they had
incurred great losses on Yugoslavia and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
According to rough estimates, Yugoslavia suffered a direct loss
of 50 billion U.S. dollars and indirect loss of 150 billion U.S.
dollar due to the sanctions. Per capita income is now 1,000 U.S.
dollars, half of what it was in 1987. Foreign debt stands at about
8 billion dollars and almost half of the workforce are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia has every right now to expect that it will soon
secure the place that belongs to it in the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other
international organizations and institutions," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said one should not be too optimistic, however, about
further developments at this point, saying there was a lot to be
done before Yugoslavia finally returned to international financial
and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, although lifted the comprehensive embargo,
does not release Belgrade's assets frozen abroad. The U.N.
Security Council also reserved the right to reimpose the sanctions
if the parties to last year's Dayton peace agreement fail to
adhere to the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti said Yugoslav people had
borne the brunt of the sanctions, going through tribulations
unrecorded in the recent history. The country's economy was
devastated, many people lost their jobs, while the society's most
sensitive strata -- the children and the elderly -- were severely
punished, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Borba, a Belgrade-based daily, stressed the importance of
Yugoslavia's consistent and constructive policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia's reintegration into the United Nations and other
international organizations and institutions will soon be on the
agenda," the paper predicted.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has secured a great diplomatic victory, but has to
make great diplomatic efforts to put everything into order, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Dnevnik, a daily in Yugoslavia's northern city Novi Sad, said
Yugoslavia has again become a key factor of peace, stability and
good-neighborly relations in the turbulent Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all ill-meant wishes, pressure and the blockade,
Yugoslavia has been and will continue to be a country of
prosperity and a country with the future," the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today criticized Amnesty International for interfering in
Afghanistan's internal affairs, said a report coming from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Amir Khan Muttaqi, minister of Information
and Culture of the Taliban interim government in Kabul, as saying,
"When the world says the Taliban shouldn't chop off hands of
thieves, sentence murderers to death, and stone adulterers, it is
interference in our internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi's comments followed a statement issued in London by
Amnesty International that hundreds of Afghan people who
sympathized with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were at
risk of torture, ill-treatment or worse.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Taliban guards are busy implementing a reign
of terror in Kabul," Amnesty International was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi noted that such criticism was "an aggression against
Islam" and could not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
In the new Islamic State of Afghanistan there will be no
compromise to secular laws about penalties for crimes such as
theft, murder and adultery, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured the Afghan capital last Friday after three
days of fighting with troops loyal to Rabbani.

BRUSSELS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Down Sharply in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
dropped by 1.9 percent in August, the largest decline in two and
a half years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline was seen by many analysts as a fresh evidence
of an economic slowdown in the second half of the year, because
factory orders are considered a key gauge of the manufacturing
strength in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for both durable and nondurable
goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 311.1 billion dollars in the
month, down from a revised 317.3 billion in July when orders had
jumped 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline was the steepest since a 2.2 percent drop in
January 1993.
</P>
<P>
The report said that factory orders for durable goods fell by
3.2 percent, the largest since a 3.4 percent drop in April 1995.
Nondurable goods such as food and fuel also fell by 0.4 percent,
the second decline in three months.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders decreased by 7.9 percent, led by falling
demand for both aircraft and automobiles. Electronic and other
electrical equipment were down by 5.6 percent and primary metals
by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders decreased 0.3 percent, the first
decline since April. A shrinking backlog suggests businesses will
not have to increase production facilities and manpower to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, managed an small 0.1
percent increase, compared to the 1.1 percent July advance.
Inventories rose by 0.3 percent following a 0.1 percent increase
in July.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve have been expecting that the U.S. economy
will moderate on its own and kept interest rates steady later last
month.
</P>
<P>
But recent economic data have been mixed. The new homes sale
soared by 8.3 percent in August, the largest in 10 years. And the
Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a gauge of future economic
activity in U.S., rose for the seventh straight month in August.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Beef Labeling Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of the European
Union (EU) today adopted a proposal calling to label beef and beef
products so as to restore market confidence, said a spokesman of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the proposal suggested to introduce a
computerized database in each EU member states and a passport for
each animal which will allow the animal to be traced back to the
holdings it has been on.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU said the decision on whether or not to label
beef and beef products was optional for operators and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The label may include information concerning the animal, the
method of fattening and other information in relation to feeding.
</P>
<P>
By adopting these measures, the EU hopes to rebuild consumer
confidence in beef and beef products which has been seriously
damaged by the crisis of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE) or the "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
"If this identification and labeling system had been in
operation prior to the BSE crisis," Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler, the designer of the proposal, said, "it is unlikely that
we would have seen the huge drop in beef consumption which
resulted from the scare."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Requests WTO Panel over Film Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
formally requested the World Trade Organization (WTO) to establish
a panel against Japan, accusing it of discriminating against
imports of photographic film and paper.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement
Body (DSB), the U.S. said the Japanese government "has established
and has maintained a series of interrelated measures over the past
three decades that have thwarted imports of photographic film and
paper."
</P>
<P>
According to it, Japan has adopted measures including
nontransparent restrictions to minimize or block market access by
foreign products through distribution system, failing to commit
itself to obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said it made the request after formal bilateral
consultations in July failed to produce "a mutually acceptable
solution".
</P>
<P>
At the DSB meeting, Japan asked for further consultations with
the U.S., saying it believed that "the United States has not yet
exhausted all possibilities for a solution" through consultations
and that it "is not in a position to agree today to the
establishment of a panel."
</P>
<P>
Trade sources said that a panel would be established after the
next DSB meeting scheduled for October 16, unless a consensus
would be reached at the meeting against the U.S. request.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Role Key to China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China deems teachers' role key to
its social and economic development, making efforts including
legislation and income-raising measures to improve their living
standards and social status.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, China issued the teachers law to ensure professional
qualification and rights of its teachers, who account for one
fifth of the global total.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, Deputy Minister of State Education Commission,
Thursday told the 45th session of the International Conference on
Education from September 30 to October 5 in Geneva that
particularly, the law lays principles concerning teachers' pay and
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In order to enhance teachers' living standards, the government
has for several times raised their wages and granted them special
allowance as well as preferential treatment concerning housing,
medical care and pension, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, in a way to enhance teachers' social status,
China's mass media has provided continued and extensive coverage
of outstanding teachers.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, China's teacher education and training
institutions have been funded by the government. Over the past
decade, these institutions provided over 4 million new teachers
for the country's primary and middle schools, while running
re-training programs for many of the in-service teachers.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts arise from a full awareness of the importance
of education to the country's future. Liu said China's goal at
present, as stated by Chinese Premier Li Peng in 1994, is to
achieve universal nine-year compulsory education and adult
literacy by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers and education experts from some 150
countries attending the education meeting are trying to define
ways to improve teachers' recruitment, training and career
opportunities. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) voiced concern over the decline worldwide in
teachers' living standards and social status.
</P>
<P>
Such a trend threatens to derail the promising gains in basic
education made since the start of this decade, said UNESCO, which
sponsored the meeting.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO estimated that by the year 2000, 9 million more
qualified will be needed in order to achieve universal primary
education globally.

MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor

Zeimkhan Yandarbiyev on the establishing of a joint commission,
which is to deal with further Chechen settlement.
</P>

According to television reports here, the commission will be

</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Chernomyrdin as saying that the commission
will engage in the extremely broad scope of activities, from the
implementation of President Boris Yeltsin's decrees on Chechnya
to the restoration of Chechnya's economy.
</P>
<P>
After signing ceremony, Yandarbiyev told reporters that the
Chechen separatists are going to adhere to previous military
accords signed in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt by Lebed and
Chechen military chief Aslan Maskahdov.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev said the settlement of political issues including
Chechnya's status has been postponed for a maximum of five
years. But the parties might reach an agreement before that, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev arrived in Moscow earlier today for talks with
Chernomyrdin and Lebed over further Chechen settlement.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Yeltsin met with Lebed to discuss Chechen
settlement. During the meeting, Yeltsin reportedly urged Lebed
to continue performing his duties and to work more assiduously
with the government.

<HEADLINE> Addis Businessmen Demonstrate to Oppose Directive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen here
demonstrated for the second time today opposing the directive
issued by the Addis Ababa Regional Council fixing the prices of
verandahs, stalls and shops owned by it.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Ethiopian News Agency, the
demonstrators took to the major roads of Addis Ababa and shouted
slogans against the directive. They said the directive was devoid
of the consent and participation of the persons concerned.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators submitted their demands to parliament, the
House of People's Representatives and the Addis Ababa Regional
Council. They said their business should not be snatched away
for being kind to the have nots.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of People's Representatives Dawit
Yohannes said, evaluated in contrast with the price situation in
the world market, the price fixed by the Regional Council is
minimal.
</P>
<P>
He urged members of the business community to seek ways of
heightening their competitiveness in the free market.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa businessmen held a demonstration on September
3, 1996 demanding the lifting of the directive. Later, Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi came out to defend the steps, saying
the measures taken by the the Addis Ababa region to fix the
prices of state-owned business centers in the capital were just
and correct.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa to Create Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The East African
Cooperation (EAC), which comprises Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, is
planning to create a regional free trade and investment zone.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the three-day EAC trade conference
held in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, Samuel Sitta,
Director General of the Tanzania Investment Promotion Center,
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The region, with a population of over 80 million people, is
potential for a single trade and investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by trade officials and businessmen from
the three east African countries, also recommended establishing
an east African Business Council and a special tribunal to settle
business disputes among the three EAC member countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Lake Victoria region has been identified as one of the
zones as a special development corridor," said the Tanzanian
official.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the market will not be closed to foreign
competitors, but, it is expected that east African businesses
will have a competitive advantage of the home market," said EAC
Executive Secretary Francis Muthaura after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Details about the free trade zone would be worked out by a
technical committee under the EAC secretariat, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha meeting also recommended reviewing and updating
trade and investment codes of the three countries by June 1997 to
speed up business registration procedures.
</P>
<P>
Other proposals were stepping up the development of the
infrastructure including roads, railways, ports, energy supply
and telecommunications, and promotion of cross border trade.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is very fruitful," said Muthaura, explaining that
his organization, born six months ago, would be targeted at
harmonizing polices of the three governments to create a
conducive environment for economic integration in the region.

<HEADLINE> Labor Leader Defuses Serious Challenge to His Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND, October 3 (Xinhua) -- British Labor leader
Tony Blair came through his only serious challenge of the Party
Conference last night as the call for higher spending on pension
was defeated by a three-to-two majority, according to the formal
result of the card vote released this morning.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Castle, the former Social Services Secretary, vowed at
the eve of the Conference to fight for higher pension during the
annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
She brushed aside a bid by Labor leaders asking her to give up
the proposal over her call for the restoration of the link between
pensions and earnings.
</P>
<P>
The threat of defeat for Tony Blair on pensions receded at the
second day of the Conference which opened on September 30, after
two of the larger trade unions decided to back the party
leadership's commitment to create a commission that would review
the future of the state pension "as a matter of urgency" if it
wins the general election.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the general union (TGWU) and Unison, the public
service union, agreed to back the proposal and remit two more
radical motions to the national executive committee for further
consideration.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Barbara Castle criticized Harriet Harman,
the Shadow Social Security Secretary, and Gordon Brown, the Shadow
Chancellor. Attacking Brown's ambition to cut the rate of tax to
10 percent for low earners, she said it would not give a penny to
the three million pensioners who were too poor to pay income tax.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labor leadership was tough on Castle's demand for
a 3.5 billion pounds (5.25 billion US dollars) package to increase
the income of all pensioners.
</P>
<P>
A statement released today by the Labor Party's National
Executive Commission stresses "the Labor Party can and will give
no manifesto or other commitments on finance for any decisions
that could only be made in the light of economic circumstances".
</P>
<P>
The statement also says the promised review will examine the
proposals of the National Pensioners' Convention "as well as other
reforms of our welfare state in the light of the public finances
at the time".
</P>
<P>
Announcing the statement, Harman said Labor was determined to
improve the position of pensioners but "would not make promises it
could not keep".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the pension debate, the British paper The Daily
Telegraph said "Lady Castle wins hearts of the delegates but not
the vote of them". "Governments are starting to realize that a
decline in the ratio of workers to pensioners means that
earnings-related pensions funded on a pay-as-you-earn basis cannot
be sustained into the next century," the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Cyprus to Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Cyprus will hold two
joint military exercises from October 4-8, it was confirmed here
today.
</P>
<P>
After two-hour talks with his visiting Cyprus counterpart
Costas Iliades, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopulos told
reporters that the joint military exercises, code-named
"nikiforos" and "toxotis" will be held as scheduled on an
"enlarged basis with the participation of all the services of the
Greek armed forces".
</P>
<P>
The exercises will be held in Greece and in the government-
controlled areas of Cyprus respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of the exercises will contribute in the best
possible way to safeguarding the effectiveness of the two
countries' defense capabilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos announced that he would visit Cyprus in November
in order "to shape the basis for more determined steps in the
defense cooperation between the two countries, in order for the
relevant political agreement to be put into practice, since this
is the top priority of the Greek government".
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus signed a joint defense pact in 1993, which
provides for the holding of joint military exercises and other
cooperation in the military fields.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot defense minister said that the implementation of
the joint defense doctrine "is aimed at deterrence and
strengthening Cyprus' negotiating position in any political
dialogue for a peaceful and viable solution to the Cyprus
problem."
</P>
<P>
Iliades also said that Nicosia accepted dialogue also at a
military level, but only on the condition that it was with the
Turkish commander of the occupation forces in northern Cyprus and
without the participation of the Turkish Cypriot military
commander.

<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) today fully normalized their
relations by agreeing to establish diplomatic relations at
ambassador's level and solving all problems over the succession of
the former Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic signed a common declaration in the Elysee
Palace in the presence of French President Jacques Chirac and many
journalists, burying a history of hatred in the past five years
between the two former Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to guarantee the freedom of travel
into each other's country by the people of Bosnia and FRY with the
cancellation of visa requirement, and to push forward economic and
trade relations between them.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia and the FRY will also support a two-year international
plan to consolidate peace in Bosnia, which will be formally
adopted by the international community before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that the FRY wishes to turn the page of
confrontation with Bosnia and open a new page of cooperation and
progress, while his Bosnian counterpart said that he has signed a
document which is full of substance and which he wishes to put
into work soon.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his joy over the normalization of relations
between Bosnia and FRY, Chirac expressed his wish that the FRY
fully reintegrate into the international community, while Bosnia
can maintain its full territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic and Milosevic held two meetings today in the state
guest house of Hotel de Marigny before signing the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The summit was held after Bosnia held its presidential election
in which Izetbegovic was elected head of a collegiate presidency,
while the United Nations has lately lifted its economic embargo on
the FRY.
</P>
<P>
Technical experts of the two countries will finalize the
agreements reached at today's summit in accordance with the

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Disabled
Persons Federation received here today the 1996 Alexander Gralnick
Memorial Award for its work in promoting community-based care and
rehabilitation for over 200,000 mentally ill citizens with serious
mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time China won the award from the World
Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation. In 1993 and 1994,
Professors Yan Heqin, Zhang Minyuan and Chen Yanfang received the
Alxander Gralnick Memorial Award, according to Martin Gittelman
advisor to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that China has developed an effective system for
mental illness with village doctors serving patients directly,
experts providing guidance for village doctors and the China
Disabled Persons Federation offering assistance to the experts. In
treatment, China has combined traditional therapy with modern
medicine, achieving good results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in the past five years, over 200,000 mental ill
citizens have been rehabilitated. In the next five year, China
plans to rehabilitate 1.2 million patients.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the China Disabled Persons Federation at
the awards ceremony of the World Association for Psychosocial
Rehabilitation today, Zhang Fengkun of the Chinese Permanent
Mission to the United Nations said China has about 60 million
people with disabilities, including 2 million with mental illness.
The Chinese government and the federation always showed concern to
the status of those people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has adopted series of measures and the
comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation of mental illness in
an open and socialized way for treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, over 450,000 people with mental illness
received rehabilitation and social service through the community
based rehabilitation project. China was implementing a new program
on disability in the current Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
China would work closely with the World Association of
Psychosocial Rehabilitation towards the common goal, she said.

<P>
LUANDA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi has been slated for failing to attend the
just-concluded Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Summit held here.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the ruling People's Liberation Movement today
accused Savimbi, leader of the former rebel movement, National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), of "lacking
political will and zest" for furthering the Angolan peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Luanda that Savimbi disappointed
all the SADC leaders, including South African President Nelson
Mandela, who gathered for the first time in the Angolan capital
on Wednesday to discuss the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi had sent a letter to the meeting explaining why he
could not attend. But he was not pardoned by the regional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the SADC leaders were briefed
about the recent progress of the Angolan peace process as well as
the major obstacles that stalked the formation of a union
government and army.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique, the regional organization urged Savimbi
to abide by the peace accord signed two years ago to finally
bring peace to Angola torn apart by nearly 20 years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Praises Talks with Chechen Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin has praised his talks with Chechen separatist leader
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev held here today, noting that the two sides
agreed to intensify bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local reporters following his meeting with
Yandarbiyev, Chernomyrdin described today's decision on the
formation of a mixed commission of high-ranking leaders from both
sides as a big step forward in the process of a peaceful
settlement in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"A big step forward was taken in the direction we defined,"
Chernomyrdin said, adding that "on a number of matters we came to
a common opinion."
</P>
<P>
However, he went to say, "there also remain differences in
approaches." "We do not agree on everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a special commission is being formed and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will approve the list of its
members and commission regulations in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the mixed commission is to resolve the
problems related to the establishment of normal living conditions
for thousands of citizens of Russia and Chechnya, the Russian
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting also focused on matters related to the
withdrawal of federal (Russian) troops and the demilitarization of
Chechnya, the prevention of persecution on political and ethnic
grounds, and combating criminal groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin stressed, however, that Russia's territorial
integrity, the inviolability of its frontiers, including
administrative dividing lines, and the operation of the federal
constitution cannot be used as bargaining chips.
</P>
<P>
He said military matters must be settled on the basis of the
June 25 presidential decree with due account to the security of
Russia and its borders.
</P>
<P>
"Chechnya is an internal affair of Russia," he said, adding
that a balanced policy of all branches of power in Russia should
result in a comprehensive set of measures to restore peace and law
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and Akhmed Zakayev, one
of the Chechen separatist leaders, also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev and his team came to Moscow for the talks earlier
this morning.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Arrives in Naples for Summit Meeting on Lire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Naples this afternoon for a summit Friday with Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, which is expected to be focused on
the entry of lire into the European Monetary Union (EMU),
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Lire became the center of a quarrel earlier this week between
France and Italy after Chirac repeatedly rapped the monetary
policy of Italy, particularly what he called "competitive
devaluation" of lire.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides made some gestures of appeasement before
Chirac set off for the Italian resort city lying beside the Vesuve
volcano which destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro hosted a dinner in honor of Chirac this evening in a
18th century palace built by the former French Bourbon royal
family on a hill overlooking Naples and the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said today that the
fundamental interests of Italy and France are "similar" with each
other and that the two countries can play a supplementary role to
each other.
</P>
<P>
Prodi will show Chirac the "dynamism" of the Italian economy in
international market and will stress the fact that the value of
lire has risen by 10 percent in the past one year, said local
observers.
</P>
<P>
He will also expose to Chirac Italy's 1997 austerity budget
plan which he said will allow Rome to meet the criteria set by the
Maastricht Treaty for entering the EMU on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Italy also wishes to return to the European Monetary System by
spring next year, but Prodi said that this issue will not be
discussed at the Naples summit because it concerns the 15 European
Union members.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse quoted former Italian Prime Minister
Lamberto Dini as saying that the Naples summit will be "excellent"
and that beyond the differences over Italy's monetary policy,
there is an overall agreement between the two countries over
European issues.
</P>
<P>
France canceled its annual summit meeting with Italy last year
because of Rome's criticism of its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Among other things to be discussed at the summit, there could
be the reform of European institutions, Italy's expected entry
into the Schengen treaty in March next year, reform of NATO, the
fight against organized crimes, the Middle East problem, Bosnia
and cooperation among Mediterranean countries.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Welcomes Arbitration Agreement with Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Yemen expressed welcome for the
signing of an arbitration agreement today between Yemen and
Eritrea for resolving the conflict over the disputed Greater
Hanish Island, and its appreciation of the French mediation
efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement by Yemeni Deputy Foreign Minister
Abdou Ali al Rahman to the Yemeni news agency.
</P>
<P>
Al Rahman said that the agreement stipulated the establishment
of an arbitration court in conformity with international law,
adding that the two parties had pledged to respect the court's
verdict and to refrain from any action or military activity by
one party against the other until the ruling was made.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni deputy foreign minister pointed out that the
agreement stipulated that the commitments of the two parties
shall be effective until the court ruling was implemented.
</P>
<P>
The court is to be composed of five judges, with each party
appointing two, and the fifth, the chairman, will be chosen by
virtue of an understanding between the four judges, according to
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Al Rahman added that Yemen and Eritrea had jointly agreed that
the arbitration court would be seated in London, Britain, for
practical reasons. But he did not elaborate on the reasons.
</P>
<P>
He added that today's signing of the related agreement in the
French capital of Paris is the outcome of what he called as
persistent efforts on the part of Yemen and the French government.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea signed an agreement in France in May to
settle a clash last December over three Red Sea islands --
Greater Hanish, Lesser Hanish and Zuqar -- claimed by both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have credited France with helping to broker the
agreement through shuttle diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands are about 160 kilometers (100 miles)
north of Bab el-Mandeb at the southern entrance to the Red
Sea.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not Optimistic About Peace Process Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that Egypt, like the Palestinians, was not
optimistic about the Middle East peace process following a
four-way summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who returned home today after leading Egypt's
delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly in New York, said
that many European and Asian countries were sharing that view
with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The only indication that some progress could be made in the
peace march lay in the fact that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed at the
Washington summit to resume Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
Sunday, Moussa said in statements carried by Egypt's news agency
MENA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu failed to reach agreement on any
outstanding issues at the summit which was also attended by
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the two-day summit, which ended Wednesday, in
an effort to save the Mideast peace process following an outbreak
of violence in occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the Washington summit was due to the Israeli
stance at the meeting, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs would not give anything for free, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's decision
not to participate in the summit was a strong sign of the Arab
rage and protest against the Israeli government's backtracking on
the peace process.

Peninsula will report its finding next week, the News Agency of

Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has been mediating the dispute.

<P>
The team also made a trip to the disputed area. Its head Omar
Halim had said that the team had come not as a judge, but only to
help maintain peace and security in the area before the

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin today outlined four aims of the country's army
reform, and admitted that economic and social-political
difficulties had exacerbated the situation in the army.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency said the Prime Minister was chairing a
military meeting to consider economic problems in the armed forces
and their combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the first task was to adjust the composition,
structure and size of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The second was to knit a personnel core for a technically
well-equipped, flexibly controlled and professionally trained
military capable of removing threats emerging in key strategic
directions and creating conditions for mobilizing bigger forces to
repel large-scale aggression.
</P>
<P>
The third task was the full and unconditional equipping of the
armed forces with funding depending on budget resources.
</P>
<P>
The fourth task was to keep troops in high readiness for
purposes of defense and other direct functions.
</P>
<P>
The premier was quoted as saying that serious financial
problems had resulted in a shortage of funds for servicemen's
pay, food, energy and other supplies. These problems had become
chronic.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of government officials, the structure of the
armed forces needed serious reform, and to be brought in line with
the military-political and economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin was absent from today's meeting because
of illness and his coming heart bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by the presidential chief of staff, Anatoly
Chubais, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Defense Minister Igor

<HEADLINE> China's Olympic Medal Winners Begin Hong Kong Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's double Olympic table
tennis champion Deng Yaping joined officials from the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch and local celrities to meet the country's
Olympic medal winners who arrived here Friday for a week-long
visit.
</P>
<P>
On the 48-member delegation are 32 Chinese Olympic champions
and silver-medalists and some of their coaches, who came here
aboard an Air International flight from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, China's minister of the State Physical Culture and
Sports Commission, said that the victories oof the Chinese
athletes at Atlanta also bore the mark of concrn and support by
the compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Province and
overseas Chinese worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"It gives our current visit to Hong Kong very special meaning
as this year is the last before the handover of soveignty of Honng
Kong to China," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister also congratulate woman windsurfer Lee Lai
Shan, who won Hong Kong's first ever Olympic gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"Afte the handover in 1997, Hong Kong sports will develop still
faster than ever before and do better for more Olympic honrs," Wu
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Among the star Chinese athletes visiting Hong Kong are veteran
man shooter and wommen's double gold-medalist diver Fu Mingxia.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who, arrived in Atlanta after long illness, fainted after
firing his final shot in the men's free pistol event at the Atlanta
Olympics. He had to settle for a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Wang became the hero of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still receiving medical treatment and I feel better now
than before the Olympic Games," the veteran shooter said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to continute training and cometing when my health
improves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who has been described as "the latest productout of China's
star diver production line", would soon begin her studies in
information and communication management in Beijing-based Qinghua
University. Although she had for times expressed her desire to
retire after the Atlanta Olympics, things seem to change anyway.
</P>
<P>
"She knows she has been brought up and trained into a world-known
champion diver by her country. So she can not just say 'I want to
retire. That's it,'" said Yu Fen, her coach for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think she was anything better than before at the
Atlanta Games. It was a demonstration of what she had learned and
had been trained for after so long," she said.
</P>
<P>
Yu thinks Guo Jingjing, another teenager diver under her
instruction, failed to perform well enough for a medal at Atlanta
just due to huge ressure on herself.
</P>
<P>
"She can improve herself year by year and I hope she would be
really ready by the year for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney," Yu
said.

<HEADLINE> Non-Bailable Arrest Warrant Issued Against Rao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A Delhi court today issued a
non-bailable arrest warrant on former Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao for his involvement in the St Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
The case was reportedly an attempt to defame former Prime
Minister V.P. Singh and his son Ajeya Singh in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and additional sessions judge
Prem Kumar today took cognizance of the charge sheet filed by the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) last week against Rao.
</P>
<P>
The CBI in its 15-page charge sheet filed on September 26
alleged that Rao, the then external affairs minister, and others
conspired to forge documents to defame V. P. Singh by purporting
to show that his son maintained a secret account in the First
Trust Corporation in St Kitts Islands in the West Indies.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the charge sheet was filed, Rao's counsel
made an appeal to the Delhi High Court for anticipatory bail,
which, if granted, protects an accused against arrest.
</P>
<P>
Today's action by the Delhi court is another setback for Rao
who was also involved in a 100,000 U.S. dollar cheating case,
which is under trial by the Delhi High Court.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Turkey Urge Israel to Refrain from Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Turkey today urged
Israel to refrain from any acts that could damage and jeopardize
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued at the end of talks between Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and his visiting Turkish
counterpart Necmettin Erbakan, the two countries demanded that
Israel close the tunnel which it opened near Al Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on Israel to abide by its commitments
under the signed Palestinian-Israeli agreements and resume peace
negotiations in accordance with what was agreed upon at the 1991
Madrid peace conference and relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers urged Israel not to resort to use of
force, according to the statement carried by Egypt's news agency
MENA.
</P>
<P>
Israel's opening of the tunnel triggered several days of
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops, which left more
than 70 people dead. The situation in the Palestinian territories
has remained tense.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Erbakan criticized what he called Israel's
provocative actions in Jerusalem, saying that these actions could
undermine the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's opening of the tunnel was unacceptable to
Turkey and the whole Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who ended his visit to Egypt today, also met with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Turkey today signed four agreements on economic,
trade, judicial and investment cooperation following the talks
between Erbakan and Ganzouri, also attended by government
ministers and officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first leg of Erbakan's three-nation African
tour, which will also take him to Libya and Nigeria.

<P>
YANGON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government today
expressed deep regrets at a U.S. decision to impose visa
restrictions on certain Myanmar nationals and retaliated by
suspending the issuance of visas to U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement issued here, the Myanmar Foreign Ministry
said the United States is giving undue and unwarranted pressure on
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in reaction to the U.S. government's
proclamation Thursday that entry into the United States by certain
Myanmar nationals was suspended.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the U.S. proclamation negatively affects
the existing bilateral relations and can be considered as an
attempt to interfere in Myanmar's internal affairs and a means of
exerting pressure.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the allegations included in the U.S.
proclamation are not in conformity with the real situation and the
progress achieved in the country and are ignoring the positive
political, economic and social development taking place in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government categorically rejects the proclamation,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement stated that Myanmar has suspended the issuance
of all types of visas to U.S. citizens except as required by
treaty obligations and officials and other supporting staffs
assigned to the U.S. mission in Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Says No More Yasukuni Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto has decided not to visit Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine because
his July visit touched off widespread protests from other Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
"I must be careful in future if (my visiting the shrine) would
cause suspicion of, or trouble to, Japan," Kyodo News quoted
Hashimoto as saying. He was being interviewed by the local press
as president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ahead of the
October 20 general election for the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto visited Yasukuni in July, becoming the first
incumbent Japanese prime minister to do so since Yasuhiro Nakasone
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni is the place where memorial ceremonies are held
for Japan's war dead, including class-A war criminals such as
militarist leader Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
Visits to the shinto religions place by incumbent cabinet
members have always caused criticism from Japan's neighboring
countries, such as China, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, and South Korea, which suffered bitterly under the Japanese
militarist empire before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
China has lodged protests against the LDP, the dominant force
within the tripartite ruling coalition, over the party's election
platform that favors visits by cabinet ministers to Yasukuni,
and asserts Japanese claim to China's islands in the East China
Sea.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Sharp Improvement in Engineering and Housing Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China has greatly improved the
quality of various engineering and housing projects, due to the
effective implementation of the engineering supervision and
monitoring system nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on engineering quality here
today, vice-minister of construction Tan Qinglian said large
groups of China's key projects and large-sized urban public
facilities as well as nearly one billion sq m of newly-built
housing residences have come up to the advanced world standards or
reach the State-set targets in terms of construction quality.
</P>
<P>
A national survey on construction quality shows that the
qualification rate of the country's engineering and housing
projects has increased by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, breakthroughs have been made in the planning,
designing and construction of the country's engineering and
housing projects and great headway achieved in protecting
environment and in completing the infrastructural facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, more than 90 percent of
China's cities and counties have set up engineering quality
supervision stations, which cover 88 percent of the country's
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's 29 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have practised the engineering monitoring
system, establishing a total of 1,500 construction monitoring
institutes, which effectively handled or prevented some 60,000
hidden construction hazards and troubles in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress made in improving construction quality,
however, many loopholes still exist, particularly in the
construction of residential housing, the vice-minister said,
adding that much still needs to be done in this respect.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition Inter-Party
Alliance has resolved to field one presidential candidate in the
general elections scheduled for later this year, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached at a meeting of leaders of the
seven-party alliance in Lusaka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Roger Chongwe, the alliance chairman and Leader of the Liberal
Progressive Party, said in an interview that the alliance members
had agreed on an electoral pact based on ''one alliance candidate
in the areas where the parties are popular.''
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''The agreement is on one presidential candidate
representing the alliance rather than all the parties fielding
candidates. Negotiations for selecting candidates from the
opposition alliance members who may have an equal chance of
success will depend on the quality and calibre of the
aspirants.''
</P>
<P>
He added that the secretaries of the alliance would work out
modalities of the strategies for the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Kaunda, former republican President and leader of the
major oppition party, the United National Independent party, said
in the meeting that he would contest the republican presidency
despite his being disqualified by a controversial constitution
ammendment because of his Malawian parentage as his party's
national council had adopted a resolution on his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are urging for the repeal of the
constitution amendment which bars Zambians of foreign parentage
to contest the republican presidency. But the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy maintains that the constitution amendment
is a law as it was adopted in parliament and signed by the
president and everybody should abide by it.

ozone hole over the Antarctic has increased to more than 20
million square kilometers, twice the area of all Europe, the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the WMO Antarctic ozone bulletin, the increase
occurred earlier this year than in the previous few years.
</P>
<P>
In the past two or three days, ozone concentrations have
slipped to a more than 45 percent deficiency over nearly the
entire Antarctic continent.
</P>
<P>
Satellite data showed that south of 65 degrees south, the ozone
concentration was the lowest in the past four to five years. In
the 17 to 22 km layer above earth, all ozone was practically
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
WMO experts believed that with the increasing
chlorine in the stratosphere, the ozone destruction would
become worse with certain circulation patterns,
especially when stratospheric temperatures were very low.

<HEADLINE> Attention Called for Preventing Rheumatic Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A new survey has shown that the
incidence of rheumatic diseases in some parts of China has risen
to over 18 percent, a new threat to people in cold and damp areas.
</P>
<P>
A special committee on rheumatic diseases under the China's
Chinese-Western Medicine Society started the survey of four types
of rheumatic diseases in 17 provinces, municipalities, and
autonomous regions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the committee have visited 87,127 people in the
areas, and found 16,004 rheumatic patients, accounting for 18.64
percent. Rheumatic arthritis was the major ailment, accounting for
16.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that in the country's very cold province
Heilongjiang, the incidence of rheumatic diseases was as high as
30 percent, while in damp areas like Hainan province, it
went up to 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
It showed that the incidence of the diseases among officers and
soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, and workers in textiles,
alloys, chemicals and petroleum was 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The data achieved from the survey has provided valuable
information for preventing and treating the diseases, according to
the committee.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Eyes Broad Alliance After Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said today he wants to seek a broad ruling alliance
after the October 20 general election for the House of
Representatives, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to shut out ways of cooperating if important
policies can be united in such fields as social security,
economic, financial and administrative reforms," Kyodo quoted him
as saying in an interview with the local press at the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also said, however, "It is a matter of course that a
political party aims to win a majority."
</P>
<P>
According to political analysts, it will be difficult for the
LDP or any other party to win a majority in the new 500-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated he will not change the
government's plan to raise the current three percent consumption
tax to five percent next April, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Inflation Rate Hits 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's inflation rate, as
measured by consumer prices, increased to 4.7 percent as of the
end of last month, surpassing the government control target for
the entire year of 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and Economy said today that in
September alone, the inflation rate rose 0.3 percent, bringing the
nine-month total to 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the prices of gasoline and other oil products increasing
by an average of 2.04 percent this month, the rate would continue
to increase for the remainder of the year, a ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the inflation rate exceeded the price control target
for the year as of the end of September, a bumper harvest was
expected to contribute to comparatively stable prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government would continue its price stabilization
efforts during the rest of the year, said the official.

<HEADLINE> China to Focus Attention on Rural Surplus Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China is working to provide jobs
for its huge force of rural surplus labor, in a bid to further
develop the rural economy and narrow the gap between it and the
urban economy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics put the size of rural surplus labor
currently in China at 130 million people.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today in Beijing, Wang Zhe, vice-director
of the Employment Department under the Ministry of Labor, said
that there are two solutions for the employment problem of China's
excess workforce.
</P>
<P>
"One is to help them find jobs at or near their homes. The
other is to shift some of them to new places that are short of
labor, like the cities," he explained.
</P>
<P>
But the latter solution is not always satisfactory, he pointed
out, as cities have only limited job opportunities and are
currently under great pressure to re-employ laid-off workers from
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He added that government macro-control over the labor market,
which can coordinate urban and rural employment and keep a
"reasonable and orderly" labor flow from the countryside to the
cities, is still necessary in China.
</P>
<P>
He praised a pilot project for rural employment, which was
launched jointly in 1991 by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of
Agriculture, and the Development Research Center of the State
Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The project now covers over 100 cities and counties in eight
provinces across China, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei,
Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years, all the areas that carried out the
project have seen a noticeable drop in rural surplus labor, as
well as a general rise in the income of the farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries and the research center will convene a
national meeting in Beijing in mid-October to help spread the
experiences of these labor and agricultural officials across the
country.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first national meeting on rural employment since
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"After the meeting, the whole country will focus attention on
the employment issue of rural surplus labor," said Wang Zhe.
</P>
<P>
China's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) maintains that the
country should be able to shift 40 million people among the rural
surplus labor to non-agricultural sectors in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, it's a very hard job to reach this target,"
said Wang. "But with enough attention and effort from the
government, the prospects of rural employment are still quite
bright."

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Reconciliation among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
called on Afghan warring groups to stop fighting and seek
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati issued the appeal at a
press conference here, saying: "What is important for us in
Afghanistan is peace and security on the basis of national
reconciliation among different groups."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here hold that Iran felt increasingly worried about
the situation in its neighboring Afghanistan since the militia
Taliban seized Kabul and the Rabbani government fled the capital
on September 28.
</P>
<P>
Velayati noted, "It is not our job to decide the destiny of
the people in Afghanistan and they have to decide by themselves."
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to directly answer the question whether
Tehran would recognize the new government in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Taliban militia appeared to have
brought the capital city Kabul under full control since last week
when it announced to set up an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
As far as Iran is concerned, he said, "Iran doesn't have any
specific priority in any groups. Our principle is to stop
fighting and try to have peaceful settlement in that country."
</P>
<P>
Velayati claimed that none of the ethnic groups can run
the country alone in the absence of contributions from other
groups.
</P>
<P>
He also asked foreign countries to keep hands out of
Afghanistan, asserting, "Foreign intervention in Afghanistan
will aggravate the situation."
</P>
<P>
" History in that country shows that foreign intervention
always fails and would not be in the interests of the Afghan
people," he said without mentioning any country by name.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that regarding the events
there, Iran is in touch with the neighboring countries of
Afghanistan, including China, Pakistan and Russia,
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is neutrality toward Afghanistan and it is not
our job to say who should run the government and who should
not," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out,"We want a government that would have the
support of all ethnic groups and religious factions there."
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly criticized the United States and Pakistan
for their support to the Taliban militant students.
Tehran holds that the Taliban's advancement was not possible
without the logistic and command support from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities called the Taliban a project
masterminded by the United States, partly financed by Saudi Arabia
and implemented by Pakistan with the aim of curbing Iran's
influence.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Death Convicts to Number 300 by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two criminals were
sentenced to death in September, bringing the total number of
death-row inmates to 234 in the country, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of persons convicted of heinous crimes and meted out
the death penalty will top the 300-mark by the end of this year,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
It said at least 87 accused drug traffickers, including 23
foreigners, and some 200 accused rapists will be up as candidates
for the death row for the resolution of courts in the next three
to six years.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government resumed the death penalty in 1994 in
order to stop the increasingly serious crime rate in the country.
However, the first death penalty will not be executed until next
year and social security in the country has not shown any
improvement despite the government's efforts.

<HEADLINE> Interest In Science In Major North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in the North
China port city of Tianjin shows that people there seem just about
as eager to learn about science and technology as are people in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted last December by the Tianjin Science
and Technology Association to find out how Tianjin residents get
scientific and technological information, what their attitudes to
science and technology are, and how much they understand about
science.
</P>
<P>
It involved workers in manufacturing and the commercial
sectors, armed police, students, scientists, technicians, and
government officials, more than half of whom said they knew the
terms 'greenhouse effect', 'molecule', 'computers and software',
and 'information superhighway'.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about what a surperconductor is, 46.3
percent answered correctly; and about which field DNA belongs to,
50.5 percent were correct.
</P>
<P>
The survey did show, however, that nearly half of the
respondents knew little about 'probability'.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Science and Technology Association also compared
the results of its survey with a similar survey conducted in the
U.S. in 1992, and found that Americans pay more attention to
scientific and technological information than people in Tianjin
do, but that the difference was not significant.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that newspapers and television serve as
a major channel through which people in Tianjin learn about
science and technology.

<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference
here that "The failure of the Washington summit was expected from

</P>
<P>
U.S President Bill Clinton succeeded in bringing Israeli Prime

Wednesday in a bid to salvage the faltering Mideast peace
process. But it apparently made no tangible progress in narrowing
the gaps between the Israelis and Palestinians.

Velayati said: "Israel refused to give any concession to
Yasser Arafat and it means that Israel would continue the
violence and crimes against the Palestinian people."

The Iranian government has criticized the Israeli government
for last week's violence triggered by the Israeli decision to open

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Marine Police Shoot at Indonesian Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Marine Police
fired two rounds of tear gas at an Indonesian fishing vessel which
tried to flee after it was caught fishing in Malaysian waters near
Pulau Perak, about 60 nautical miles from Langkawi, yesterday,
police said today.
</P>
<P>
The tear gas shells exploded on the boat and the escaping gas
forced the skipper to stop the vessel, the Langkawi-based Northern
Zone Marine Police chief Zakaria Embi said today.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when the Marine Police on a patrol boat
he commanded spotted the Indonesian vessel about three nautical
miles off the island, and several crew members of the vessel were
seen pulling up a fishing net, Zakaria was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency, Bernama, as saying.
</P>
<P>
When the Marine Police boat attempted to draw alongside, the
fishing vessel suddenly picked up speed and ignored the "stop"
order issued by the chasing police, said Zakaria who ordered his
men to fire the tear gas after a 45-minute chase.
</P>
<P>
The police found about 100 kilograms of fish in the hold of
the 17-meter-long vessel, which is equipped with sophisticated
gadgets including radar and echo sounder. The vessel was later
escorted to a Marine Police base in Langkawi, and the 36-year-old
skipper and his 22 crew members, aged between 16 and 45, were
handed over to the Fisheries Department, Zakaria said.

<HEADLINE> Illiteracy Eradication Drive in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
has been commended by UNESCO for its achievements in eliminating
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
When New China was founded in 1949, more than 90 percent of the
region's population was illiterate. In spite of the progress since
then, people above the age of 15 who could not read or write
accounted for 22 percent of the region's population in 1990.
</P>
<P>
To stamp out illiteracy and improve local people's lives, the
regional government created a program on illiteracy eradication in
1991, which stipulated that nearly all the young and middle-aged
people in the countryside should be given the opportunity to learn
to read and write by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the financially-pinched regional
government has poured more than 16.8 million yuan into the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mass media, women's federations, science workers, and even some
religion workers have helped with the work.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional education department, 234,000 farmers
have learned to read and write, and the rate of the illiterates
over 15 years of age has dropped to 10.54 percent. The per capita
income for farmers increased from 594 yuan in 1990 to 1,037 yuan
last year.

This was announced at a press conference after an agreement was
initialed here by the Sudanese Presidential Advisor Ahmad Mahmoud
Alasi, the Ugandan Foreign Ministry Director General James
Baba, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hussein Sheikholeslan and
a senior Malawian official.
</P>
<P>
The four sides agreed the peace accord will be officially
signed by the foreign ministers of Sudan, Uganda and Iran
sometime in December.
</P>
<P>
Malawi was involved as observer and Iran mediator.
</P>
<P>
The three countries as well as Malawi have agreed to form two
teams of political and military specialists, one in Khartoum and
the other in Kampala to inspect and observe the situation in the
Sudan-Uganda border regions.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at the press
conference that the specialists will keep the parties concerned
informed of what was happening in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the four countries met here today to follow
up the Khartoum agreement signed by Sudan and Uganda on
normalizing relations through mediation efforts by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani who made a tour of Sudan and
some other African countries in September.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question raised by Xinhua, Velayati said that
the new agreement will be officially signed individually or
collectively in December.
</P>
<P>
Both the Sudanese and Ugandan representatives pledged that they
would commit themselves to the agreement, while expressing their
thanks to the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese presidential advisor reaffirmed his government's
support for the peace endeavor, noting "There is no substitute
for peace."
</P>
<P>
"We have long-time relations with sisterly Uganda and there is a
special emphasis on peaceful co-existence with the neighbor in
our history and tradition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "you can not choose your mother, but you have
to live with your neighbor."
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Foreign Ministry director general said, "This is
a very important journey for peace. We would like to thank all
the parties that have helped us in this journey."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the support of his government for the
peace and security with its neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said: "The Tehran meeting was a very important
and valuable step toward the implementation of Khartoum agreement
which has been valued by the heads of the four states that
could bring us closer (to) establishment of peace and stability
between the two countries (Sudan and Uganda)."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran finds itself duty-bound to continue
efforts and has used its good offices at international arenas
to bring about peace and international security and to this
end, it has been the initiator of mediation at some stages.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give more details about the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reportedly to involve the pullout of Sudanese
rebel forces from a 100-kilometer-wide zone from either side of
the Sudanese-Ugandan border.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda have exchanged accusations of each other of
backing respective rebel groups in their border areas.

<HEADLINE> China's Eximbank Guarantees Syndicated Loan for Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China has offered guarantees for a syndicated loan of 103 million
US dollars to finance the building and export of six vessels to
Malaysia, according to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The money, arranged by a syndicate of 14 banks led by Japan's
Sumitomo Bank and Sanwa Bank in the form of structural trade
financing, will be used by China Shipbuilding Trading Co. and the
Jiangnan, Hudong and Dalian shipyards to build for and export to
Malaysia four bulk carriers and two chemical products
carriers. The six ships have a combined tonnage of 329,000
dead-weight tons and a contracted value of 184 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Eximbank has guaranteed a large-sum
syndicated loan for the export of Chinese vessels. The first loan
was issued last year by the Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since it went into operation in July of
1994, the Chinese bank has raised a total of 7.78 billion yuan and
185 million US dollars for the country's exports of oil tankers,
liquefied gas carriers, container ships, bulk carriers, chemical
products carriers, barges, and multi-purpose vessels.
</P>
<P>
The 238 vessels exported with the aid of Eximbank have a
combined tonnage of 4.173 million dead-weight tons and a
contracted value of 3.12 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank's board chairman Tong Zhiguang said that his
two-year-old policy bank will continue to consolidate cooperation
with the international financial community in an effort to boost
China's export of vessels.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank is one of China's three policy-oriented banks designed
to provide financial backing for China's exports of capital goods
including machinery, electronic products and complete sets of
equipment.

<HEADLINE> WFP Distributes Food, Seed to Rwandans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program this week began distributing packages of bean seed and
food to some 75,000 vulnerable farming families in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release received here this morning from
WFP in Rwanda, WFP is providing more than one million US
dollars worth of food aid and 50 tons of bean seed to help
farmers increase their yields over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Hunger often drives farmers to the point where they eat their
scarce seed stocks," said Zlatan Milisic, WFP's Information
Officer in Rwanda. "For this reason, food and seeds are being
distributed simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
The food and seed will benefit families in the prefectures
of Butare, Gikongoro and Kibuye, and the areas of Bugesera and
Nasho, all of which are considered to be "high risk" areas for
crop failure and food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Each family will receive eight kilograms of seed and a 40-kilo
package of rice, beans and vegetable oil. This is enough to
sustain a family of five during the main month of the planting
season.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent assessment by WFP, some 576,000
Rwandans still require food aid support. While Rwanda's
war-wracked agricultural sector has been steadily recovering
over the last two years, crop production remains 23 percent
below pre-war levels. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Completes Assessment of State Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China has completed 1995's annual
assessment of how the value of state property in state-owned
enterprises has been maintained and increased, the State
Administration of State Property (SASP) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 83,315 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
had been examined by the end of July, including 4,326 companies
run by the central authorities, and 78,989 local firms.
</P>
<P>
An initial analysis shows that the account value of the
state-owned rights and interests of the assessed enterprises was
74 percent of the total amount of all state-owned enterprises at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of state-owned assets in the examined enterprises grew
by 3.59 percent in 1995, 0.59 percent higher than the target set
at the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
The analysis shows that 84 percent of the added value was
reported in enterprises run by the central authorities, and the
value of state property appreciated most in the sectors of
automobile, post and telecommunications, tobacco, petrochemicals,
power and petroleum.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the coastal areas and new industrial centers
outperformed the interior areas and old industrial bases in
maintaining and increasing the value of state property.
</P>
<P>
An official at the SASP said that the overall operation of
state-owned property was not satisfactory, as the 3.59 percent
growth rate for the value of state property was far lower than
the interest rates for bank deposits during the same period.
</P>
<P>
A high asset-to-liability ratio and a high ratio of bad assets
are two major elements behind the poor performance of state
property, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors include a lack of liquidity of available assets,
disorder in the management of investments and inadequate measures
to reduce losses, he added.

<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper today quoted Vice President Godfrey
Miyanda as saying that the provision to include one
from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and another
from the opposition will be withdrawn because the government has
realized that it will make the commission partisan.
</P>
<P>
Backbenchers especially from the ruling party earlier attacked the
provision saying it will create confusion and adversely affect the
independence of the commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral commission bill, the commission should
consist of a chairperson and four members, one representing the
ruling party and another the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The members' appointment will be made by President Frederick
Chiluba and the chairperson should have held high judicial office
while members must have experience on electoral matters.
</P>
<P>
Backbenchers of the biggest opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) said that the president should not appoint
the commissioners and suggested that each party selects one
representative.
</P>
<P>
MMD members said that there will be nothing wrong in allowing the
head of state to appointe the commissioners.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Military On Recapturing Kilinochchi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sri Lankan military
officer revealed here today that the government troops had met
with very stiff resistance from the rebels in recapturing the
strategic Kilinochchi town which straddles the A-9 Highway from
Colombo to Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister General G.A. Ratwatte said at a press
conference here this afternoon that the liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) rebels in Kilinochchi town fought very hard in a vain
attempt to prevent the troops from capturing the town, which they
were using as a hub on the northern mainland.
</P>
<P>
Kilinochchi town was a center for the LTTE as it had a
hospital, weapon factories, communication center and several other
important installations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE had rushed in reinforcements from other areas and a
large number of them had been killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
General Ratwatte said everything had gone according to plan and
that they had planned to take Kilinochchi town in a 7-day battle.
The troops spent only one day more.
</P>
<P>
Now, that Kilinochchi town had been liberated, he said, the
rebels took to the jungles and the troops would relentlessly
pursue them until they are defeated.
</P>
<P>
He said 250 soldiers were killed in the fighting while an
estimated 500 rebels had been killed and another 1,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, he said the government was willing
to negotiate with the LTTE either directly or through a mediator
only if they meet the conditions laid down by the government --
laying down their arms.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges China to Reform Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The time is ripe for China to
establish a unified pension system, the World Bank says in a new
report.
</P>
<P>
"China now has a golden opportunity to move toward a unified
pension system that combines defined benefits with funded
individual accounts," according to the report, which was drafted
with support from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry
of Labor.
</P>
<P>
China's existing pension system has two big problems: the
immediate hardship of the pension burden of state-owned
enterprises and the long-term troubles arising from the aging
population, the report says.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of state-owned enterprises is not due to the
overall demographic dependency ratio, which is still low, but to
the fragmentation of the system, generous benefit rates, and a
high rate of exemptions and noncompliance stemming from the high
contribution rates," it says.
</P>
<P>
The long-term problem stems from the aging of the population
combined with incomplete pension coverage, the report says, noting
that the solution lies in expanding coverage and creating a
multi-layered system that combines mandatory social pooling with
mandatory individual accounts and a social insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
The current pension system fails to contribute to economic
development, as it does not encourage labor mobility, provide a
level playing field for different enterprises, expedite
state-owned enterprise restructuring by de-linking pension
provision from enterprise management, nor assist in the term
transformation of savings and the funding of infrastructure and
other long-term investments, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It argues that when compared with other countries, China's
costs of transition are lower and its capacity to bear these costs
is greater.
</P>
<P>
The report identifies four factors that facilitate financing of
the transition in China: the unification of the pension system,
the structural change in the economy, rapid growth of the gross
domestic product and the capital gains in state assets.
</P>
<P>
"These favorable factors will generate resources that will
enable China to pay its obligations to pensioners and workers
under the old system, while making a transition to a new reformed
system," the report says.
</P>
<P>
The formal pension system in China is a pay-as-you-go defined
benefit system that covers mainly the state sector in urban areas,
it adds.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in Hong Kong is
declining and the rate is considerably lower than that in London,
New York or Tokyo, according to a Hong Kong government official.
</P>
<P>
At a function held here today, Secretary for Security Peter Lai
said that during the first eight months of this year, Hong Kong's
overall crime rate dropped 13.7 percent compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the total number of reported crimes in the period
decreased 11.5 percent, and the total number of violent crimes
dropped 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the crimes committed by illegal immigrants (IIs), he said,
the situation was not as serious as some sensational reports
resulting from a number of high profile cases would have it.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the first six months of this year, when
compared with the same period last year, the number of IIs
involved in all crimes decreased from 2,213 in 1995 and from 2,519
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the period, the number of IIs arrested for crimes was 748, a
decrease of 37 percent when compared with the same period in 1995,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Vietnamese migrants (VMs) issue, Lai said that over
9,000 VMs had been repatriated to Vietnam this year, as compared
with 2,600 in the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
As of today, there are about 12,000 VMs in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
From October onwards, he said, the Hong Kong government will
progressively step up the pace of the Orderly Repatriation
Program, from the current rate of 600 to 700 per month to about
1,000 per month.

HONG KONG, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary

<P>
SEOUL, October 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's inflation rate as
measured by consumer prices increased 4.7 percent as of the end of
last month, surpassing the government-set control target for the
entire year of 4.5 percent, the Ministry of Finance and Economy
said today.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, inflation rate rose 0.3 percent, bringing
the nine-month total to 4.7 percent, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
With the prices of gasoline and other oil products increasing
by an average of 2.04 percent this month, inflation rate will
continue to increase for the remainder of the year, a ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the inflation rate exceeded the price control target
for the year as of the end of September, a bumper harvest is
expected to contribute to comparatively stable prices," the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue its price stabilization efforts
during the rest of the year, one of which calls for aggressively

<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in its
administrative reform process, a senior vietnamese official said
today.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of 1995, the government's structure has been scaled
down from 27 ministries to 22, from more than 30 professional
offices to about 20 at the provincial level and from 20 to 10
offices at the district level," said cabinet minister Phan Ngoc
Tuong, head of the government's organizing committee, who is also
chief of the steering committee of an administrative reform
program funded by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The ministries and offices have also begun simplifying

impact on foreign investment, production and business licensing,
land management and other essential areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two new ordinances adopted by the national assembly -- the
country's congress -- have been promulgated to clarify the

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Preparatory Committee Members Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Two proposed methods for
selecting candidates of the first Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive
and the Provisional Legislative Council will be examined at the
fifth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), which opened today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee members will also discuss
qualifications of Selection Committee candidates, whose tasks are
to choose the Chief Executive and the Provisional Legislative
Council members.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the two-day meeting, Qian
Qichen, vice-premier of the State Council and chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, said that the two documents submitted to
the group for examination are of great importance.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong people and the world community are greatly
concerned about the selection process of the first Chief Executive
and the Provisional Legislative Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the two suggested methods conform completely to
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, the relevant decisions of the
National People's Congress and of the Preparatory Committee, and
also to the principles of openness, fairness and justice, and are
feasible and applicable.
</P>
<P>
As for choosing the candidates for the Chief Executive, he said
the Selection Committee has been entrusted with full rights at
every stage of the process, from nomination to election.
</P>
<P>
The method for forming the Provisional Legislative Council also
reflects the universal aspiration of the Hong Kong society,
namely, that those who meet the relevant requirements are capable
of taking part in the election, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the opening session, Qian also reviewed the work of the
Preparatory Committee after the fourth plenary session held nearly
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the Preparatory Committee did not expect so many people
to apply to be Selection Committee members, which shows that the
Hong Kong people are enthusiastic about preparing for the
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, it demonstrates that the Hong Kong people are
confident and capable of handling well the affairs of Hong Kong,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Work reports from the first Chief Executive Panel and the
Provisional Legislative Council Panel were presented at the
meeting, which is being held in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Preparatory
Committee, briefed participants on the application process for the
Selection Committee membership, and explained the two proposals
for the selection process.
</P>
<P>
Henry Ying Tung Fok, vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee,
presided over the opening ceremony.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Removal of Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government welcomes
the unanimous resolution made recently by the UN Security Council
to remove the sanctions against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the sanctions, which have been in place for several
years, have done nothing to settle problems, and have brought only
great disaster to the Yugoslavian people.
</P>
<P>
"In international relations, we have always been opposed to
constantly imposing sanctions against a country, and have made
unremitting efforts for removing the sanctions against Yugoslavia
soon," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution of the Security Council shows that the policy
of peace pursued by Yugoslavia has been widely recognized by the
entire international community," he added.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the sanctions will not only be helpful to the
economic development of Yugoslavia, but will promote the peace
process of the former Yugoslavia region and even peace and
stability in Europe, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the international community will consider, as
soon as possible, the proper solution of the issue of Yugoslavia's
status in the UN and other international organizations," Shen
noted.

<HEADLINE> Gas Stations in Riyadh Close Down Amid Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A savage price war that
broke out in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, among gasoline
stations has caused several stations to close down, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producing country in the world,
and gasoline prices there are lower than in every other country
except Iraq. But some gasoline stations in Riyadh sell 53 halalas
(0.14 U.S. dollar) a liter, seven halalas less than the regular
price of 60 halalas (0.16 dollar), forcing five gasoline stations
in the capital to close down for failure to match the
lower-than-cost prices.
</P>
<P>
Despite official warnings from the government, the price war is
still very much felt in the capital, with many of the gas station
owners aggressively promoting their slashed prices, according to
Saudi English-language daily Arab News.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have asked them to stick to the recommended
price of 60 halalas per liter, but they have failed to heed the
call.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Ibrahim, manager of a gas station, was quoted as
saying that too much investment in this sector has led to the
over-proliferation of gasoline stations, each trying to lure as
many customers as they can.
</P>
<P>
Another gas station manager Siraji Muhammad said that he was
on the verge of going out of business because the competition was
so fierce.
</P>
<P>
All gasoline stations in Saudi Arabia are privately owned.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Palestinians: Do Not Lose Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has appealed to Palestinians not to lose hope
for peace talks, saying the Washington summit was a chance for a
"fresh start" on peace.
</P>
<P>
"I ask you, don't go into mourning, don't lose hope,"
Netanyahu said in an address to Palestinians on Israel
Television Thursday night. "This is an opportunity for a fresh
start for the peace process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu appealed to the Palestinians to remain calm and have
faith in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, scheduled to
resume on Sunday at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
"There are no winners and no losers if we fight each other,"
said the Israeli premier. "If we fight each other and if we
return to bloody riots, we will both be losers. If we walk
together on the process of peace, we will both be winners."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official said that Netanyahu has
assured Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
during their meetings in Washington that he intends to complete
the Erez negotiations within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel Thursday, one day after
the Washington summit, which was called to resuscitate the peace
process following last week's violent clashes in the West Bank,
Gaza and Jerusalem, ended with no significant results.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli and Palestinian sides agreed at the summit
to hold continuous talks at the Erez checkpoint, which would focus
on security issues and the Israeli army's redeployment in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a phone conversation on Thursday night, the prime minister
reportedly told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that if the
Palestinians take what he termed as a practical approach, he has
no doubt that Sunday's negotiations will be productive.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled today to report to the Knesset
(Israel's parliament) and the cabinet about the summit at
special sessions, after he briefed President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister's office is preparing for the
talks at the Erez checkpoint, but it has not yet been decided if
Netanyahu and Arafat will participate in the first meeting
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China's Co-operation Overseas In The Law Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China intends to continue
letting foreign law firms open offices in China, and to encourage
Chinese law firms to establish offices abroad, Vice-Minister of
Justice Zhang Geng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1992, when China began letting overseas law firms
practice law in China, a total of 73 offices have been approved
through a strict process in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Haikou, and Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation has been good, and China plans to expand exchanges
with overseas lawyers on the basis of the past few years'
experience, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation has played a vital role in China's legal
development and improving China's investment environment, and has
helped Chinese lawyers learn directly from their overseas
counterparts, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jisheng, the president of the All-China Lawyers'
Association, says that, since 1986, the association has
established broad contacts with lawyers' associations in more than
30 countries and regions that have involved official visits,
information exchanges, and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the association has reached agreements with the
judiciary in Canada, Britain, Hong Kong and Singapore, on training
lawyers for China. More than 80 Chinese lawyers have received
training in Britain, and Chinese law firms have set up seven
offices in the Unites States, Singapore, and Russia.

<HEADLINE> "Red Tide" Contaminates Shellfish off Sabah, Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A "red tide" occurrence in
the waters off the west coast of Sabah, Malaysia, has contaminated
shelled molluscs which the public has been warned against eating.
</P>
<P>
The "red tide" phenomenon, a seasonal occurrence peculiar to
the sea in Sabah's west coast, is caused by the rapid growth of
planktons which turn the sea surface a reddish color and sea
creatures which consume the planktons produce a toxin which can
kill consumers, an official statement said today.
</P>
<P>
The molluscs, especially bivalves like oyster and cockle, from
the affected areas, should not be sold or eaten, Health Services
Department Deputy Director R. Meganathan warned in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said fishes, prawns and crabs are safe to eat, but should be
thoroughly cleaned before cooking.
</P>
<P>
Meganathan said his department and the Fisheries Department are
monitoring the situation, and the public would be informed of new
developments.

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime minister telephoned
Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak last night apparently in a bid
to patch the strained relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who returned from Washington summit Thursday
afternoon, briefed the Egyptian president on the results of the
summit held on October 1-2, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak, a principal Middle East peace broker,
declined an invitation by President Bill Clinton to attend the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's decision to stay away from the meeting appeared to
be a further indication of the tense relations between Egypt and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
When asked to explain his absence, Mubarak replied: "Our
absence does give an indication that we are not pleased with the
situation and obstinate acts of Israel concerning the
Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
On several occasions in recent weeks, Mubarak could hardly
hide his anger at Netanyahu's inaction in the peace process
despite his promise made during his Cairo visit after rise to
power in June.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that it was a pity that Mubarak did not
participate in the summit, stressing that it is important that
they maintain contacts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised to Mubarak that he plans to ease the
closure on the Palestinian territories. He added that if the
Palestinians adopt a serious approach progress is certain in the
new round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington summit, the Joint Israeli-Palestinian
Steering Committee is due to meet at Erez on Sunday to discuss,
among other issues, the long-delayed Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he would support any progress in the Middle
East peace process.

PARIS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The bank of Credit Lyonnais is going out of deficit after
years of losing money, as it is benefiting from a relentless
salvage program by the state.
</P>
<P>
The bank benefited from 67 million francs (13.4 million
U.S. dollars) of state aid in the first six months of 1996 alone.
The overall aid to save the bank is expected to attain 100 billion
francs (20 billion U.S. dollars), which is equal to the cost of
the tunnel under the English Channel, the state debt of Algeria,
10 times as much as the international aid to Palestine, 30 times
as much as the cost of the Bastille Opera House in Paris, and four
times as much as the cost of Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<P>
-- The Taliban has cut sound and image in the Afghan capital.
The Afghan women are again obliged to wear strict chador. Men and
women are separated on buses in Kabul. The leader of Taliban,
Mollah Mohammed Omar, has ordered the people of Kabul not to leave
the city.
</P>
<P>
The Amnesty International said that the students have imposed a
rule of terror in Kabul by throwing nearly 1,000 people into jail
and destroying everything they considered as "non-Islamic," such
as tape recorders, cassettes, magazines and toys. With the
imposition of the Sharia, Taliban suggests that photographers and
journalists quit their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The plan to reform the social security system by the French
government has caused an open confrontation with the doctors.
Three major trade unions of doctors decided on Thursday to stage a
strike on October 17, following a strike by night-time doctors
last evening.
</P>
<P>
-- As the French-Italian summit started in Naples last evening,
the Italian lire rose to its highest point against the franc and
German mark, with 1,000 lires against 3.412 francs and 1.006
marks. Meanwhile, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro told
Chirac that the "history of our two countries goes much further
than the fleeting quarrels."

<P>
HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has impressively upheld
its policy of reconciliation since independence in 1980, visiting
former British Minister of African Affairs Richard Luce said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Luce, who helped negotiate the end of Zimbabwe's war
of liberation, said he is particularly glad to find Zimbabwe is
one of the few which retained many whites after independence.
</P>
<P>
''It is very impressive that 80,000 whites are still working
here. At independence there were just over 200,000. In some
countries all of them could have left by now, for one reason or
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Luce is in Zimbabwe as Chairman of the Commonwealth
Foundation, to present prizes in Harare on Friday to the best
Commonwealth novelists.
</P>
<P>
''I think it is very impressive that the government of
President Mugabe followed the constitutional arrangements agreed
to in Britain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Luce also noted evidences of strong economic activities, adding
that he sees more new buildings and offices in the capital
of Harere than the last time he visited Zimbabwe in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Young Farmers Get Better Jobs Through Youth League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Young farmer Hao Haiping is
satisfied. Earning more than 1,000 yuan (120 Us dollars) a month
makes him a member of Beijing's middle income population.
</P>
<P>
Many of Hao's friends from the poor Xiyang County of Shanxi
Province came to suburban Shunyi County seeking higher income and
better professional skills.
</P>
<P>
Xiyang, best known for Dazhai, a village established as a model
for the whole country during the "cultural revolution", has sent
840 people to Shunyi during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
They have mailed more than one million yuan (120,000 US
dollars) in savings each year and greatly helped the economy of
their home county.
</P>
<P>
These young people moved to beijing under the organization of
local branches of the Chinese Communist Youth League in Xiyang and
Shunyi, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Leagues in the two counties have signed contracts, in which
Shunyi provides jobs in its rapidly developing township
enterprises and Xiyang is responsible for recruiting employees.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1993, the league helped 25 counties in the
booming coastal Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces
reach labor export agreements with 25 poor inland counterparts.
</P>
<P>
With the help of youth leagues, a total of 150,000 young
farmers found jobs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 170 counties have established similar
relationships.

HARARE, October 4 (Xinhua) --Zimbabwean Parliament Thursday
unanimously passed the 14th amendment to the Zimbabwean
constitution which will enhance gender equality, guarantee more
protection to the property of foreign investors and ensure the

</P>
<P>
The bill amends chapter 11 of the constitution, which mainly

Prior to the amendment, only foreign wives of Zimbabwean men
had automatic citizenship rights, while foreign husbands of
indigenous women could only be granted citizenship when they were
approved as investors or as holders of scarce skills.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new amendment, limits will be placed on the
right of all foreigners married to Zimbabwean citizens to enter

HOHHOT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Tourism on the lush grasslands

In recent years, rapid expansion of service by Air China, the

tourists from neighboring provinces and regions as well as other
countries.
</P>

The airline branch for Inner Mongolia has more than 30 routes,
and takes less than three hours to get to Hohhot, capital of the

<HEADLINE> South China Coastal Real Estate Market Regaining Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The real estate market in the
south China city of Beihai was back on its feet again in the
third quarter of the year, after having gone through a sluggish
period.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 deals, worth 424.8 million yuan (about 51 million
US dollars), have been struck since June in the coastal city's
property market, which has been a barometer in the country's real
estate business. This was the highest in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
To improve the ailing real estate market and turn it into a
pillar of local economy, the city implemented a series of methods
this May to reclaim parcels of land that had been leased
improperly or in excessive amounts, and to standardize the
market. As a result, it has recovered 10.86 square kilometers of
land, providing more opportunities for property development.
</P>
<P>
It has also reduced taxes by 550 million yuan (about 66 million
US dollars) to help nearly 1,000 property developers get out of
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
These policies have had an immediate impact on the real estate
business. One transaction alone was responsible for the sale of
14,000 square meters of flats.
</P>
<P>
Since June, a group of real estate agencies have begun to
increase their investment. Additional investment in the city's
largest property project, the Hengli Ocean Sports Vacationing
Center, hit 25 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also attribute the boom in Beihai's real estate market
to the Nanning-Kunming Railway line, which passes nearby and is
expected to open soon, and to the impending return of Hong Kong to
the motherland.

<P>
HOHHOT, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The second of three projects at
an opencut mine and auxiliary coal dressing plant in the Jungar
Coalfield, in Inner Mongolia, began trial production in late
September.
</P>
<P>
The Jungar Coalfield is one of China's strategic construction
projects for shifting energy development to western areas.
</P>
<P>
The Heidaigou Mine, which has an annual production capacity of
12 million tons of coal and has a coal dressing plant, is the
first large opencut mine developed by China.
</P>
<P>
According to Song Hanfeng, general manager of the Jungar Coal
Industrial Corporation, some 7.85 billion yuan of investment had
been used by the end of August for the first phase of construction.
</P>
<P>
Other projects have included a 200,000 kw power plant that has
been completed and was linked to a local power grid three years
ago, generating 3.08 billion kwh of electricity, and a 264-km
electrified railway for use in the coalfield, that is the first
electric railway line in Inner Mongolia. It will operate from
Datong in Shanxi Province to Jungar.

<HEADLINE> Call For Improvement Of Children's Situation In China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has said that
a greater effort should be made in improving children's situation
in poverty-stricken areas in west China, although marked progress
has been already made.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate for infants and children under five and for
pregnant women in the poor areas is much higher than the national
average, Xu Zhijian, deputy director of the Women and Children's
Working Committee of the State Council, told a press conference
last week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a considerable number of children are dropping out
of school, he said, and something must be done for these children.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the Chinese government has been carrying out
the principles of a summit conference on the world's children, and
on protecting the Chinese children's rights and on improving the
country's legal system, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have also been made to provide funds in the last
several years for this purpose, and most indices for children's
lives in the poor areas have been met, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the mortality rate for infants and children under five
in China was 36.4 per thousand and 44.5 per thousand, a 27-percent
decrease for both figures compared with 1991, while the death
rate of pregnant women was 61.9 per 100,000, a decrease of 36.4
percent from 1990's figure.

</P>
<P>
The organizational polls are considered a major test of
strength of various Congress Party groups which are keen to ensure
their nominees bag coveted posts in the party hierarchy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Adding fuels to fears about an
economic slowdown, India's exports have slid into single digit
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to official data available here today, the exports
during April-August of 1996 was 13.5 billion US dollars as against
12.3 billion US dollars during the corresponding period of the

<HEADLINE> India to Host International Crop Science Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
new Delhi, October 4 (Xinhua) -- India will host the
prestigious 2nd international crop science congress (ICSC) from
November 17 to 24, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Doctor R.S Paroda from India's Department of Agricultural
Research and Education said at a press conference here that the
significance of the meeting lay in the fact that, despite
phenomenal growth in food production, about 20 percent of the
world population was still hungry and malnourished.
</P>
<P>
He said diminishing per capita availability of land and water
resources coupled with land, forest and environmental degradation
further intensified the challenges and he called for greater
resolve on the part of agriculture scientists to ensure synergism
among productivity, profitability and sustainability of major
cropping system.
</P>
<P>
Paroda said for safeguarding food and nutrition security at the
household level, crop intensification and diversification were
needed on an ecologically sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
The new tools of genetic engineering, germplasm enhancement and
crop modeling offered new opportunities for producing better
plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 2nd ICSC would deliberate on the subjects to
provide directions for a new agenda for crop science research
during 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the congress was "crop productivity and
sustainability: shaping the future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Complain Against Indonesia's "National Car" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan may file a complaint with
the World Trade Organization (WTO) later today against Indonesia's
"national car" policy, Japan's International Trade and Industry
Minister Shumpei Tsukahara said today.
</P>
<P>
The complaint isdue to be filed on Friday morning local time in
Geneva, where the WTO headquarters is located.
</P>
<P>
Under Jakarta's car policy, domestically-owned automakers can
enjoy tariff and luxury sales tax exemptions on condition that
they boost the locally-made content ratio to 60 percent in three
years.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between PT Timor Putra Nasional of Indonesia,
controlled by President Suahrto's youngest son, and Kia Motors of
South Korea is the only company that enjoys this status.
</P>
<P>
The venture is allowed to assemble its Timor cars at Kia plants
and export them to Indonesia duty-free for one year until its
local plants are ready.
</P>
<P>
Japan argues that the policy violates the WTO's most favored
nation status and national treatment principles by favoring South
Korean cars, and contravenes the Trade-Related Investment Measures
accord by linking tax privileges to local content requirements.
</P>
<P>
"It is truly regrettable that things have ended up this way"
said Tuskahara.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue "should never adversely affect the friendly
relationship between Japan and Indonesia that has been developed
over many years", he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Contribute to New IMF Emergency Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai central bank is seeking
an government approval to contribute funds to a new emergency
facility for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help boost
the country's image in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kleo-Thong Haetrakul, director of the economic research
department of the Bank of Thailand, Thursday said that the bank
has received an invitation to join the new arrangement to borrow
(NAB).
</P>
<P>
The IMF selected members for the facility based on a country's
general economic strength, including economic growth, balance of
payment and official foreign exchange reserves, the official was
quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to set aside 1 percent of its total
reserves worth 49 billion US dollars for the IMF emergency cash
facility, Kleo-Thong said.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the NAB, which can be tapped by developing
countries to tackle sudden financial crises, will also give
Thailand protection in the world financial system, Kleo-Thong
said.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be used as a tool to ease any possible
economic volatility in the future and give Thailand an opportunity
to borrow funds at a low cost, she said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a number of countries from Asia and Europe,
including Australia, Austria, Denmark, South Korea, Malaysia,
Singapore, Spain, Finland, Norway, and Luxembourg, have agreed to
join the NAB.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Agribusiness Exports Develop Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's agricultural and
livestock sector is now one of the country's most important
sources of hard currency as mechanization and more professional
marketing have paid off.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sector brought in 4 billion dollars in export
earnings, up 50 percent on 1994. With exports reaching 2.718
billion dollars in the first eight months of this year, official
estimates put the total for 1996 at some 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural food sector registered a 764-million-dollar
trade surplus last year, a situation not seen since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The main Mexican agricultural and livestock exports are coffee,
legumes, vegetables, tomatoes, beef, shrimps, fruit, fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 percent of the 20 million hectares of arable land
under cultivation is given over to growing fruit, vegetables, and
flowers.
</P>
<P>
Mexico will export 800,000 tons of horticultural and fruit
products in 1996 worth 600 million dollars, 200 million dollars
more than that of 1995, according to the National Confederation
of Horticulturists.
</P>
<P>
Bananas account for 45 percent of the volume of exported fruit,
followed by lemons with 21.3 percent and mangoes with 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Mexico says tomatoes, of which 465,000 tons were
exported in 1995 worth 585.6 million dollars, was the third
biggest hard currency earner in the agricultural and livestock
sector.
</P>
<P>
Economists here attributed the rapid growth in exports of the
agricultural and livestock sector to government support in
production and the establishment of a new marketing system.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Agribusiness Exports Develop Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican government has launched a number of programs to
promote the production and marketing of agricultural products
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
It adopted a program to provide rural farmers with additional
financial aid to promote production and marketing during 1993 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Support and Services for the Marketing of
Agricultural and Livestock Products (Aserca), a branch of the
Agriculture Ministry, has provided support for vegetable, fruit
and flower producers.
</P>
<P>
It has also assisted other agricultural and livestock producers
by providing them with materials, machinery, equipment and
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been helped to create necessary infrastructure for
regional collection, selection, packaging, storage, transportation
and marketing. Aserca also organized producers into marketing
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In another program, called the System of Commercial Linking for
the Agricultural and Livestock Sector (Secsa), the government
promoted the creation of a direct sales system. It eliminated the
need for middlemen so that most of the profits went to the
producers.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Foreign Trade has also granted producers and
exporters credits at preferential rates to promote the export of
farm products.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector still has many problems, among them an
obsolete and impractical production model and a lack of
organization, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Because of excessive dependence on the U.S. market, Mexico's
agricultural and livestock products for export now face a new
challenge amid increasing trade disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts have proposed that Mexico diversify its product base
and exploit the potential of its other resources.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Adjourns Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate formally
adjourned on Thursday after passing an aviation bill and major
federal parks legislation.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives, whose members have already left
to concentrate on the election campaign, will follow suit on
Friday. That will bring to a close the 104th Congress, the first
run by Republicans in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"We got it done," Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said before
officially declaring the session over. "I believe that the entire
membership of the 104th Congress can leave today proud of their
accomplishments."
</P>
<P>
The 92-2 vote to approve the Federal Aviation Administration
bill, and voice vote on a parks bill to expand and improve more
than 100 sites in 41 states, cleared the last hurdles to ending
the first Republican-led Congress in four decades.
</P>
<P>
After moving on the parks bill, Lott and Democratic leader Tom
Daschle made a ceremonial phone call from Lott's office to
President Bill Clinton to announce that this session of Congress
had concluded its business.
</P>
<P>
The House for the most part finished its work last Saturday,
when it passed a 1997 spending bill. But it scheduled a session
for Friday afternoon, just in case action had been needed on
measures the Senate was to pass at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, whose administration has expressed
opposition to the Federal Express clause, nevertheless welcomed
the FAA bill's passage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this legislation, criminal background checks can
now be conducted on airport personnel, new explosives detection
technology can be deployed, baggage will be checked in more
thoroughly, passenger profiling will be instituted and families
who lose a loved one in an accident will be able to get the help
that they need," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Congress has seen some major accomplishments:
telecommunications, farm support and welfare overhauls, and the
disastrous showdown over a balanced budget deal that resulted in
two partial government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
Wishing to avoid such a debacle this year, the House on
Saturday and the Senate on Monday approved a 389 billion dollar
spending bill for the fiscal year that began Tuesday. The measure,
which included an extra 6.5 billion dollars sought by the
administration for education and other social programs, provided
funds for all the federal departments and agencies not covered by
previously approved spending bills.
</P>
<P>
It contained none of the "killer" provisions that had prompted
President Clinton to veto spending bills last year.
</P>
<P>
Lott said it was a historic Congress, with major achievements
in welfare, health insurance and illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also welcomed one of the last pieces of
legislation to reach the Senate floor: a major federal parks bill
that initiates land exchanges, boundary changes and new
designations in 41 states.
</P>
<P>
The FAA bill includes 19 billion dollars over two years for
airport programs, including 4.6 billion dollars for new airport
grants.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Airlines has boosted its
market share by 12 percent after four years of extensive
restructuring, the local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The market share of the state-owned Vietnam Airlines rose from
31 percent in 1991 to more than 43 percent this year, in the
presence of 24 foreign airlines in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The airlines began to undergo a facelift to improve its fleet
which mainly consisted of Soviet-made aircraft since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the airlines carried more than 2.25 million passengers
and 33,000 tons of cargo, more than five times higher than that of
1991, a report of the Vietnam Airlines said.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of 1996, the airlines transported
over 1.7 million passengers including 700,000 foreigners and
28,200 tons of cargo, representing 80.4 percent of the yearly
target.
</P>
<P>
So far, seven out of the ten airbus 320s leased by Vietnam
Airlines have arrived in this country. The Vietnam Airlines plans
to have a completely new fleet of western aircraft within five
years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Legislators of the National
Assembly, the upper house of the Nepali parliament, Thursday
boycotted the house meeting for one hour in protest of the
government's discrimination in selecting members of a delegation
to the United Nations, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The MPs said that the dignity and prestige of the upper house
had been affected as the Nepali team to the 51st UN general
assembly includes lawmakers only from the lower house, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
They accused the government of attempting to minimize the upper
house's role in the parliament and said the move by the government
had shown disrespect to the members of the house.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Nepali delegation to the UN general assembly, led
by Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, is expected to leave
for new York later today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry sources, on condition of anonymity, said that
it took much longer time than expected for the ministry to
finalize the formation of the delegation to the UN general
assembly, which already began on September 17.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 representatives
from 70 states, international agencies and non-governmental
organizations convened here today on the first day of the
International Strategy Conference on Anti-Personnel Mines.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hosted by Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy, is designed "to galvanize and catalyse international
action to negotiate a global ban on anti-personnel mines."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each year two to five million land mines
are planted around the world, and some 110 million buried in 70
countries as a result of various conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy told the participants that reducing the use of mines
and dealing with the destructive legacy of land mines are two
challenges which required urgent attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
To advance the work of de-mining in different parts of the
world, Axworthy said that Canada will be making additional
contributions, and will sponsoring a Canadian seminar on de-mining
technology and assistance to victims early next year.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the meeting, Canadian Defence Minister David
Collenette announced that his country will reduce its stockpile of
90,000 anti-personnel mines to encourage other countries to ban
them.
</P>
<P>
However, Collenette insisted that Canada will withhold the
destruction of 30,000 anti-personnel mines until an international
ban is in effect.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Keep Troops in Bosnia Until Mid-March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will keep
thousands of troops in Bosnia after NATO's 60,000-strong
international peacekeeping force withdraw from the country in
December, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
Perry told a Congressional hearing that the U.S. plans to
dispatch a new force of 5,000 American troops to Bosnia to act as
a "covering force" to assist the withdrawal. They will stay until
mid-March 1997.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces, which were sent to war-torn Bosnia to oversee the
implementation of last December's Dayton peace accords, will leave
when their mandate ends on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that 10,000
Army soldiers will still be in Bosnia as of December 20 and, by
February 1, the force will be 7,500, with the last of those troops
pulling out by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
U.S. lawmakers have criticized the plan, saying it did
not square with repeated Clinton administration commitments to
have U.S. troops out of Bosnia by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Perry and Shalikashvili defended the covering force, saying
it would be a routine force and not an opening to a follow-up
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Former Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke said Tuesday
that NATO should maintain a peacekeeping force in Bosnia next
year. Otherwise, he warned, there would be a risk of new war
breaking out.
</P>
<P>
European countries with troops in the peacekeeping force are
also willing to keep their soldiers there but insist the United
States participate in any troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton administration will probably not decide
before the presidential election in November whether to keep
U.S. troops in Bosnia on a longer-term basis.

SANTIAGO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza said here this morning that "there should be more
concern about air safety," when deploring the plane crash on
Wednesday that killed all 70 persons aboard including 31 Chileans.
</P>
<P>
The Aeriperu Flight 603 en route from Lima to Santiago went
down early Wednesday morning shortly after it took off from Lima
international airport.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said, "Our aeronautics authorities needed an
investigation because of the number of Chileans involved."
</P>
<P>
Forty-six relatives and friends of the Chilean victims flew to
Lima to look for the bodies of their beloved and would hold
Christian funerals for the dead there.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Forensic Medicine Institute and the Civil
Registration Service of Chile also went to Lima to assist Peruvian
forensic experts to identify the bodies.
</P>

Santiago to attend a meeting, said this morning before leaving for
Lima that he is returning to Lima to speed up the transportation
of the bodies of the victims.
</P>
<P>
This is the second air crash that killed Chileans in a little
more than seven months. In the first fatal accident, 42 Chileans
were killed in February when a Peruvian plane crashed in a

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Plans to Revamp Railway Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka has plans to revamp its
railway services with 89 million US dollars aid from Japan,
Germany and the Netherlands, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's railway services were neglected in the past 20
years and it has now become necessary to revamp the services to
provide a satisfactory customer service, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has to subsidize the railway department to the
tune of 14 million annually.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that to meet the railways immediate needs the
government has allocated funds for the purchase of 12 main line
locomotives and 15 diesel power sets within the next two years at
a cost of 61 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's railway at present has only 20 power sets whereas
it had as many as 45 sets in the 1960's when the passenger volume
was much lower.
</P>
<P>
Considering the present need to serve 35,202 million annual
passenger kilometers the railway needs at least 60 power sets, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the revamping program it is proposed to improve 293
kilometers of long railway track to enable the increase of the
running speed of trains to 100 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the government also has plans to build
an electrified railway system to ease traffic congestion in the
country.

HARBIN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- No major fires have occurred in
the Hinggan Mountains in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province
since May 6, 1987, when a big fire that hit the area, according
to local forestry sources.
</P>
<P>
Mohe County in the province was the victim of the fire which
claimed 211 lives and injured 246, a result from smaller fires
started by a forest worker's improper use of a machine and two
other workers who were smoking.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a memorial hall was built in the county to
increase people's fire consciousness, and May 6 was designated
"Fire Day" and May, "Fire Month". Classes on fire prevention have
also been held in primary and middle schools, and permanent fire
exits put in all residences.
</P>
<P>
A fire prevention network has been set up in the Greater
Hinggan Mountain area. It deals with fire monitoring, fire
control, fire shelters, telecommunications, rescue work, and
education and logistics systems.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Hinggan Forest area covers 8,369,076 hectares of

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Steady In Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's oilfields plan
to annually produce 74 million tons of crude oil by the year 2000,
according to Zhang Hong, deputy general manager of China Oil and
Gas Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The northeast is China's leading oil producer and is where its
most famous oilfield, Daqing, is located, as are the Liaohe and
Jilin fields. Northeastern oilfields produced 74.93 million tons
of crude oil last year, accounting for a half of the nation's
total.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year-Plan period, oilfields there will
work on discovering more oil and gas and plan to get 86.3 billion
yuan from sales and to implement a strategy of stablizing oil
production in the east and exploring oil reserves in the west.
</P>
<P>
They will also make an effort to establish a modern enterprise
mechanism and gradually improve their assets responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have discovered 7.686 billion tons of proven oil
reserves in the northeast, accounting for 44.1 percent of the
total oil potential in China, and 106.84 billion cu m of natural
gas reserves, or 7.6 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
The northeast had produced 1.599 billion tons of crude by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, China's largest oilfield, Last year produced 56 million
tons of crude oil and, according to officials, has mapped out a
plan for future development and will work harder to get 185.5
billion yuan in total output value, 46.2 billion yuan in profits,
and have 29.8 billion yuan in taxes by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Aid to Combat Drugs in Colombia Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
cut aid to Colombia to fight drug trafficking by 90 percent over
the last four years, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The "El Espectador" daily said the U.S. Congress approved a
package of 142 million U.S. dollars in 1992 to help Colombia in
its war against drugs, but that amount had fallen to just 10.6
million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year Colombia invested 985 million dollars to combat drug
trafficking, far from enough to wage the necessary full-scale war
on drugs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia plans to spend 31 million dollars in 1996 on the
"Alternate Development Plan" to help farmers switch from growing
plants used in drugs to other crops. The Clinton administration
said it would contribute 1 million dollars to this program.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution to Colombia's anti-drugs efforts have
been condemned in many quarters. Earlier this year, Colombian
Justice Minister Carlos Medellin Becerra said U.S. assistance was
just "small change."
</P>
<P>
The money it provided was just enough to pay for fuel for the
planes and the helicopters used by anti-narcotics police to spray
illegal crops with herbicides.

<HEADLINE> Intergrated Campaign to Control Soil Erosion in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Erosion control efforts will be
expanded in the Loess Plateau, one of the most eroded areas in the
world, over the next five years, the "China Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to preserve and reclaim arable land will extend
into more counties in Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous region, which are located in west and
north China.
</P>
<P>
The programme will be organized by county authorities to
achieve wholesale improvement of barren land, said Huang Ziqiang,
deputy director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The
commission is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Water
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the counties account for 15 percent of the area
classified as seriously eroded. The effort will demonstrate that
huge social and economic changes can be brought by integrating
erosion control with other measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 square kilometers of eroded land are expected to be
brought back into use. This would help speed erosion-control
measures along the Yellow River water system, where 60,000 square
kilometers of eroded land are scheduled to be treated in the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Pilot projects have been carried out in Changwu County, in
western Shaanxi Province, and neighbouring Jingchuan County in
Gansu Province since the early 1990s. The large-scale water and
soil conservation drive has paid off, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the county government has mobilized
thousands of farmers who revived hundreds of thousands of barren
gullies and hills within different small water river systems by
planting grass, trees and crops and building dams and terraced
farmland.
</P>
<P>
This year, Changwu has prevented 460 square kilometers, 84
percent of its eroded areas, from further soil erosion. The annual
amount of sand and soil washed into rivers in Changwu has been
reduced from 1.35 million tons to 900,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the county's gross value of annual
agricultural output increased by 1.8 times.

<P>
BUCHAREST, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior NATO
military officer today refused to comment on the timetable for
Romania's entry into the western alliance, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The decision on when Romania will be admitted to NATO is a
political one, which shall be made by the 16 member states of the
alliance with Romania, said George Joulwan, NATO's Supreme
Commander of the Allied Powers in Europe, who is on a two-day
visit to Romania on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan held talks with Romanian President Ion Iliescu and
Romania's military officers during the visit.
</P>
<P>
General Joulwan spoke highly of the changes of the Romanian
military in the past two years and its role in the peace keeping
operation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia's opposition against NATO's eastward expansion
can not be changed overnight, Joulwan said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve central and east European nations from the Baltic to
Mediterranean seas, including Romania, have demanded NATO
membership since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But NATO has kept them waiting because of Russia's strong
opposition. Russia insists that the enlargement process will
threaten its national security.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO's eastward expansion process is continuing.
Dialogues with possible candidates for membership have taken place
in the first half of this year, following a visit by NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana to central and eastern Europe
during April and May.

<HEADLINE> Romania Hails Lifting of Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAEST, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Romania today welcomed the
U.N.'s decision to dismantle its four-year economic sanctions
against Yugoslavia, saying the move will help economic cooperation
in the Baltic region and between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Romanian president Ion Iliescu said Romania
also supports Yugoslavia's re-entry into international and
regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council agreed on Tuesday to lift its
economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, now made up of
Serbia and Montenegro, following the general election in Bosnia on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
The security council imposed comprehensive sanctions against
Yugoslavia on May 30, 1992, accusing it of supporting Bosnian
Serbs in the Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions had led to a big fall in trade volume between
Romania and Yugoslavia. Bilateral trade was below 100 million
U.S. dollars in the first eight months, according to the Romania
Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
With the sanctions lifted, the two nations will work hard to

<HEADLINE> Swedish Police to Follow Palme Case to S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Swedish police will go to
South Africa within the next week to question those allegedly
involved in the assassination of the then Prime Minister Olof
Palme in 1986, judicial officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Chief prosecutor Jan Danielsson will meet former head of the
South African secret police Eugene de Kock, his predecessor Dirk
Coetzee and "superspy" Craig Williamson after de Kock revealed
last week that South African apartheid secret agents had been
involved in the killing.
</P>
<P>
De Kock and Coetzee are both former policemen convicted of
carrying out murders under the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
Coetzee also alleged that the murder of Palme, who was a
leading opponent of apartheid, was orchestrated by two other South
African agents, "superspy" Williamson and ex-Rhodesian soldier
Anthony White, who, he claimed, pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
White denied the allegation Monday from his home in
Mozambique. Williamson has also denied any involvement in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish foreign ministry has asked South Africa's justice
department for help and expects a response in two or three days.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said today that the
matter should be thoroughly investigated and justice be done.

<HEADLINE> Growth of Thai Exports to US slower than Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Relative lower competitiveness
of Thai goods has led to a slow growth in their market share in
the United States, according to a Thai Commerce Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of this year, the growth rate for
Thai exports to the U.S. was less than five percent over the same
period last year, as compared to Singapore, Malaysia and the
Philippines which registered a growth of about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that Thailand's export capability has
declined significantly compared with that of its main ASEAN
rivals.
</P>
<P>
The declines indicated that the U.S. is now able to import from
countries and regions where labor and production costs are lower.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imported more food products, including fish, meat
and processed foods, and garments, gems and jewelry, footwear and
leather products, from low-cost countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The United States, as the world's largest importer, is growing
by 10.9 percent annually in its imports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand accounted for 1.5 percent of all imports of the U.S.
in 1993.

JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia may renegotiate a
stalled deal to purchase nine f-16 fighter jets from the United
States next January, Antara news agency today quoted a
high-ranking officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"From what I have learnt from the defense attach at the US
embassy here, there is no problem with the planned sale,"
Indonesian Air Force Chief-of-Staff Vice Marshal Sutria Tubagus
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tubagus said Indonesia's choice of fighter plane to strengthen
its air force under its current five-year development plan (ending
in 1999) was still the f-16.
</P>
<P>
The US had for several times postponed a plan to sell the f-16s
to Indonesia due to the US Congress' objections to how Indonesia
was handling certain domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
Several US senators had feared that Indonesia would use the
planes in dealing with internal security problems, Tubagus said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The rotten wheel of the Hong
Kong-Shenzhen International Marathon Race, greased as the annual
event, has finally found a sponsorship, not for one year, but for
three.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association announced here on
Thursday that it has signed a three-year agreement with Standard
Chartered Bank to sponsor the cross-border sporting event, which
for next year will be held on February 16.
</P>
<P>
This is only the third time the event has been organized since
1992. The race came to a halt after the organizers failed to find
a suitable sponsorship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Chartered Marathon Hong Kong-Shenzhen is expected
to attract some 1,000 runners from Canada, Britain, New Zealand,
the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and other
Asian-Pacific nations and regions.
</P>
<P>
"This time it is run just before the handover of sovereignty of
Hong Kong to China, which gives this event a very special
meaning," said William Ko, HKAAA's president.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to establish the event as Asia's premier
athletic event, along with the line of such as world-class London
and Boston Marathons," said Ian Wilson, Standard Chartered's
General Manager for Hong Kong, China and Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We considered the marathon an important event and will
mobilize our best efforts and resources to make it a bigger
success than ever before," said Tom Owen, president of the
Shenzhen Track and Field Association.
</P>
<P>
Two races will be held for the 1997 event -- the full-length
marathon of 42.195 kilometers and a half-marathon, 21.098.
</P>
<P>
The participants will run some 10 kilometers in Hong Kong
before crossing into Shenzhen through the Huanggang check
point.

HAVANA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Alfredo Deriche, president of the
Arab Union of Cuba, warned today that a popular uprising will
become a choice for the Palestinians with all the roads to peace
closed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The government of Israel "does not want to exchange land for
peace, because it does not want peace and it does not want to
return the land either," said Deriche.
</P>
<P>
Deriche's remarks came after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Tuesday and
Wednesday in Washington without settling their differences after
the recent bloodshed in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu were expected to resume their talks on
Sunday to reach a preliminary agreement of peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Union of Cuba, created in 1979, is calling for a
symposium next week on the Arab presence in America, which will be

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NZ National Party Focuses Attack on Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's ruling National
Party is seeking ways to focus attack on the Labor Party, its
leader Helen Clark in particular, in the current election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Clark as the target is out of the perception
that the Labor leader poses the main threat to Prime Minister Jim
Bolger's effort to retain the prime ministership after the
election, although the Labor's popularity is much lower than the
National.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bill Birch led the attack Thursday by devoting
much of a speech to criticizing Clark.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest con job of the campaign has been the woeful claim
by Helen Clark that she's shaping up strongly now to be the next
prime minister."
</P>
<P>
"She is begging on television for previously sworn opponents to
fulfill her prime ministerial ambition," Birch was quoted by "The
Dominion" newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new tactic came after the failure of what the opposition
parties described as a scare campaign launched by Bolger to
distance voters from the policies of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In the drive, Bolger warned that if the three left-wing
parties, the Labor, Alliance and New Zealand First form a
government after the election, New Zealand will be dragged into
higher taxes, higher unemployment, massive new overseas debt,
declining foreign investments and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
But the warning has failed to work its way with the NZ dollar,
interest rates and the sharemarket all steady. Foreign investors
have been buying heavily into NZ government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The international rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's has indicated
that it sees no risk to NZ's credit rating if there would be a
change of government.
</P>
<P>
It says a new government is unlikely to depart drastically from
the current policies although the economic reform could slow down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attacks against each other intensified among the
parties with the election race entering its final stage.
</P>
<P>
In her campaign tour yesterday, Clark still concentrated her
attack on the National in social areas, accusing the National of
trying to hide the 'social scandal" of poverty. She pledged to set
up a commission to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
Alliance leader Jim Anderton has termed as cynical the
rapprochement yesterday between Helen Clark and former Labor
leader Mike Moore, who once opposed Clark's leadership. He
predicted Moore will take another tilt at the leadership if the
Labor does not perform well in the election.
</P>
<P>
He also charged NZ First leader Winston Peters of preparing the
ground for a post-election deal with the National, asserting that
Peters would be looking for senior cabinet positions for NZ First
MPs.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslims Agree to Leave Serb Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) and Bosnian Muslims reached an
agreement today that all Muslims who entered the Serb village of
Jusici illegally should pull out.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Simon Haselock told reporters in Sarajevo that
the Muslim refugees would leave behind in the village three
representatives to liaise with the IFOR and that 10 others would
be authorized to make daily inspections, according to the Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 300 Muslim refugees who entered into the Serb town
of Jusici near Zvornik in eastern Bosnia on September 20 and 21
had moved out three days before. They said they were repairing
their old houses in Jusici but the IFOR had found and confiscated
weapons from some of these Muslims.
</P>
<P>
About 60 hard-line Muslims have remained, however, threatening
to go on hunger strike and arguing that once they left, they would
not be allowed to return to the village again.
</P>
<P>
IFOR sources said to the effect that the refugees were
guaranteed the right to return under the agreement, which is based
on a proposal by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
It gives the Muslims 72 hours to evacuate the village in order
to allow the UNHCR to prepare everything for their legal return.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR has branded the entry by the Muslims as illegal,
saying many of them had arms with them in an attempt to make
provocation in the Serb land.
</P>
<P>
Under the UNHCR's plan, the Muslims should apply to Republika
Srpska's authorities for permission to settle and submit documents
to prove that they had actually had property in Jusici before the
war broke out in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Republika Srpska insist that returning Muslims
and Croats should sign statements undertaking to abide by the laws
of Republika Srpska.

WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of Egypt and
some international institutions have agreed to set up the region's
first environmental office in Cairo, the World Bank announced here
today.

countries to identity environmental projects, strengthen
environmental capacities and help promote action and effective
policy measures.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Conclude 1996 Annual Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank concluded their joint 1996 annual
meetings here today, and about 46 governors representing nearly
all countries of the world addressed the three-day plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
In his concluding remarks at a brief closing ceremony, Michel
Camdessus, chairman of the Executive Board and managing director
of the IMF, called upon the world's financial officials to join
their efforts to strive for the common goals: "greater stability
in the world, and stronger, more sustained, more broadly shared
and higher quality growth."
</P>
<P>
Both World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF chief Michel
Camdessus raised louder alarm against corruption during the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference, Wolfensohn vowed to pull out of any
project funded by his institution that proved to be tainted by
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Where there are projects to which we are involved and we find
evidence of corruption we will cancel the project," he told
reporters. "We are anxious to put teeth into what we're doing over
issues in which we have control."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief said graft and other practices are a major
barrier to economic progress in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wolfensohn added, corruption may threaten to rob the
World Bank of financial backing in industrial countries as
governments -- and the voters who elect them -- wonder if the
money they have provided is ending up in the pockets of corrupt
officials.
</P>
<P>
The IMF chief also took aim at these practices during a speech
to the plenary session, saying governments must demonstrate that
they have no tolerance for corruption in any form.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank board recently set up new procurement guidelines
for projects financed by its loans. Under the guidelines, the
World Bank can cancel part of a loan if it finds out that corrupt
or fraudulent practices are involved in procurement contracts. It
can also bar guilty companies from bidding on future bank-financed
projects.
</P>
<P>
During his concluding press conference, Wolfensohn noted that
what World Bank can do is to pull out its resources from projects
and that the bank could not become a moral policeman or interfere
in the political policies of countries. Nor, he added, will such
efforts change human behavior overnight.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will not interfere in the political sphere..., but we
can try to create a climate in which people fight corruption,"
Wolfensohn stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn made clear he is not playing any favorites. He noted
that corruption is a worldwide problem in which wealthy industrial
countries, in their efforts to do business in the developing
world, have added to the climate of loose practices.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the strong anti-corruption tune, Camdessus
told reporters today that the outgoing annual meetings have four
predominant features: the expression by governors of all countries
of their optimistic views over their economic performances and
outlook; a strong sense of implementation of common strategies;
the demand for a strong and effective IMF; and an increasing sense
of partnership between the donors and recipients, between
developed and developing countries.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges World Support for Haitian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called upon the international
community to contribute generously to the Trust Fund for the
Haitian National Police.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutro-Ghali said it is
clear, from all indications, that the security situation in Haiti
has deteriorated in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said the attacks and shooting incidents that have occurred
in Port-au-Prince reflect an increase in subversive activities in
which some ex-armed forces' personnel seem to be involved.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Haitian National Police (HNP) has not reached
the level of experience and confidence required to control and
defeat threats posed by subversive groups.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that the recent spate of violence is intended to
test the resolve of the HNP, the government and the international
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, I would like to reiterate my call to the
governments of member states to contribute generously to the Trust
Fund for the Haitian National Police, which, in the coming months
will be needed to respond to the request of the government of
Haiti for a technical advisers program," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Calls for Fair World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today called for
the establishment of a fair world order so that enduring peace can
be founded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the general debate at the current U.N. General
Assembly session, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said that
peace and development are mutually reinforcing. A just and
enduring peace can only be founded on the general socio-economic
progress of all nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is disconcerting to see that while the
countries of the North are becoming more affluent, the countries
of the South which constitute the majority of the world population
are getting more impoverished.
</P>
<P>
Deepening crisis of development in the poor countries "can
undermine a new world order which we seek to create," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to have close cooperation
with Africa which is suffering from heavy external debt and
deteriorating terms of trade. It should also help to carry out the
promises under the new United Nations New Agenda for the
Development of Africa in the 1990s, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he observed, the United Nations has a
central role to play in boosting the global economic development.

JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today that nobody has the right to dictate to
his government on which countries it should have relations with.
</P>
<P>
"No country can dictate to me what to do about relations with
any country," Mandela told a press conference after meeting a
delegation from the South African Jewish Board of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the fact that he had been advised by
"certain western countries" to end its relations with Iran, Libya
and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The advice is coming from western countries," he said without
naming them.
</P>
<P>
"They are the people now saying we should ignore the people
who helped us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Mandela brushed aside the displeasure of
the United States government over his decision to host Iranian
President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had also invited leaders of Libya and Cuba to visit
South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Says No Loser at Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said today that both the Palestinians and the
Israelis came out winners in the Wednesday-concluded summit
meeting because they recommitted themselves to a peaceful future.
</P>
<P>
"I think the conversation that took place, the recommitment to
a non-violent future, the commitment to have intensive, indeed
continuous negotiation is a step forward," Christopher said during
a picture session with Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ban Yahia.
"In that sense everyone comes out a winner," he added.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian officials described the two-day summit of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat as fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that the Israeli side neither gave a date
for the pulling back of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of
Hebron nor agreed to close the newly opened entrance to a viewing
tunnel near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1993 interim settlement between the two sides, the
redeployment was supposed to be carried out five months ago. The
opening of the entrance triggered a bloody violence in the
region, leaving more than 70 people dead.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday in wrapping up the
U.S.-sponsored summit meeting, "We have not made as much progress
as I wish we had." But he also said, "We are in better shape than
we were two days ago."
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, the two sides agreed to continue their peace process by
starting their negotiations Sunday at Erez, a border crossing
between Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced Wednesday Dennis Ross as U.S. mediator in the
talks. Christopher acknowledged that there were difficult times
ahead and he was ready to offer help in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Two Channel Ferries to Merge, 1,000 Jobs at Risk </HEADLINE>

LONDON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Up to 1,000 jobs are at risk
after Britain's P&AMP;O European Ferries and Sweden's Stena Line
announced today that they plan to merge their short distance
Channel ferry businesses between Britain and France, according to
a BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
The move comes amid fierce competition from the Channel Tunnel,
which has taken over a third of cross-Channel traffic on the most
popular Dover-Calais route.
</P>
<P>
The new firm, P&AMP;O Stena line, will operate on the Dover-Calais,
Newhaven-Dieppe and Dover to Zeebrugge routes.
</P>
<P>
P&AMP;O will hold 60 percent of the shares in the new firm, while
Stena takes 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The new company will offer more vigorous competition to
Eurotunnel and improved scheduling, as well as maintaining the
present high standards on the existing ferry services and
providing for eventual future investment," the companies said in a
joint statement.

<HEADLINE> Issue of Elderly Catches UN Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
seeking answers as to how the rights and security of older persons
can be guaranteed with the aging of the world population.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. projection, the world's older population
aged 60 and above will grow from half a billion people in 1990 to
almost 1.5 billion people in 2050. They will mainly be in
developing countries, particularly in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"That demographic transition has skyrocketed the proportion of
older persons within a few generations from about one person in
14, to one in four," according to a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is often the cause of isolation, ill health and even
premature death," said U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali in his message for the International Day for Older
Persons on October 1, which was designated by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1990 in response to the call for the caring of the old
generation.
</P>
<P>
The situation of older women has caught the particular concern
of the world community, according to researchers. Worldwide, women
are living longer than men. But women are more likely to be poorer
in old age than men for various reasons, which include involvement
in home-making and child-bearing, interruption of careers because
of family responsibilities, less investment in training and
education, and labor force discrimination and lower paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
Due to the gradual losses of their ability to work, old people
tend to suffer most economically, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
During a conference called "Challenges to older peoples'
economic security around the world" here today, researchers and
experts agreed that the improvement of the social insurance
systems is to help overcome economic difficulties of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
However, privatization of the social security system advocated
in some countries has created many new problems. Some people in
the United States want to turn the entire social security fund
over to the Wall Street investment companies to run for profit.
</P>
<P>
The ideologues and the profit-seekers have greatly exaggerated
the easily-fixed financial problems facing Social Security, Fred
Solowey, an American researcher and writer, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development, which include mainly the United States, Canada and
major European countries, face a no easy task for securing the
economic conditions of the elderly. It is expected that by 2030
the proportion of these countries will reach a ratio of one person
in three.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the conference, some were at their 80s,
expected that institutional mechanisms will be found out to ensure
that older persons in all societies have economic and social
security that they need.

<HEADLINE> US Federal Government to Support Charter Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Education Department
today announced nearly-17-million-dollar federal grants to help
set up hundreds of charter schools that are not bound by
conventional rules in 19 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
The grants were in the budget for fiscal 1996, which ended
Monday, and the amount was a marked increase over the 6 million
dollars spent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Charter schools, set up by groups of parents, teachers, school
administrators and others, operate without many of the constraints
imposed by local public school districts. A charter outlines what
students are expected to learn, but this can be revoked if the
school fails to meet the goals.
</P>
<P>
Since the first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992, 24
other states and the District of Columbia have started the
program. At the end of 1995, 269 charter schools were serving
60,000 students. An additional 70 schools were scheduled to open
this fall.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Arrests Assassins of Former Belgian Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian police arrested early
this week two assassins of former Belgian Vice Prime Minister
Andre Cools, who was killed on July 18, 1991 near Liege, eastern
Belgium, in a parking lot outside the residence of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian Minister of Justice Sadol Sha'abane said today that
Abdelmajid Almi, 24, and Abdeljelil Ben Brahim, 31, two Tunisian
nationals who had long lived in Europe, admitted that they killed
Cools under a contract signed with a European, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the arrest of the two men
will allow the relaunching of an inquiry into the assassination
whose vicissitude has kept Belgium in suspense for five years.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that piece by piece, the puzzle is taking shape one
month after the arrest of the former Belgian minister Alain Van
der Biest, who was accused of masterminding the assassination, and
five of his associates.
</P>
<P>
Domenico Castellino, an Italian-Belgian who was close to Van
der Biest, admitted after being arrested early last month that he
had recruited Almi and Ben Brahim in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
Belgium will reportedly send a judicial team to Tunisia next
week to question the two men, who are now jailed in the central
prison of Tunis.
