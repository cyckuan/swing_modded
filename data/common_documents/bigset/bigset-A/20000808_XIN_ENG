<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Abide by Moratorium on Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday said it would
abide by its unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests which is
consistent with the spirit of Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
This position was stated by Foreign Office spokesman Riaz
Muhammad Khan in response to several questions on Pakistan's
adherence to CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Khan said Pakistan had supported the treaty in 1996. "We don't
have any problem with the treaty in principle."
</P>
<P>
He said in 1998, Pakistan had declared that it was ready to
adhere to the treaty provided all sanctions were removed against
it as "the sanctions are unjust and unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
He said, "there is an international interest in Pakistan's
signing of CTBT."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's present position is that it would not be the
first to resume nuclear tests and would abide by its unilateral
moratorium which "is consistent with the spirit of the treaty."

<HEADLINE> Drexler Misses Flight for NBA Legends Tour in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Clyde "the Glide" Drexler missed
the flight to Beijing on Monday for the NBA Legends Tour in China,
but team director Mel Davis said the most prestigious player would
not disappoint his Chinese fans.
</P>
<P>
Drexler, one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, is the leading
name of the legendary players from the NBA Retired Players
Association (NBRPA) and the highlight of the 10-day tour in
Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But the former Portland Trail Blazers and Houston Rockets
player failed to catch the flight of the Northwest Airline at
Detroit, which arrived here at 16:50 pm. Until now, there is no
information about where he is.
</P>
<P>
Davis, who arrived the Beijing International Airport at 20:17
pm, said Drexler might be here later tonight or Tuesday morning,
but he also did not know the reason why Drexler missed the
afternoon flight.
</P>
<P>
Drexler, who was one of the three players in NBA league history
to accumulate 20,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and 6,000 assists,
played two NBA Finals for Portland in '90 &AMP; '92 and won the
championships with Houston in '95.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old received the invitation to coach the University
of Houston after his retirement and recently resigned after two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Others big names of the NBA Legends are like Eddie Johnson,
Danny Schayes, Joe Wolf, Buck Williams and Rolando Blackman. Rick
Barry, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member, is the
Legends' coach.
</P>
<P>
But Dominique Wilkins and Charles Smith had missed the Tour,
said Davis, and the team gave no reasons for their pull outs.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Legends will play three games - August 11 in Beijing,
14 in Guangzhou and 17 in Shanghai - against the Chinese national
team.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Returns to Track after Upper Leg Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian Cathy Freeman was back
on the track Monday after pulling out with an injury to her upper
leg in a meet over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 27, is the two-time defending world champion at 400
meters and Olympic silver medalist at the distance. Her coach
Peter Fortune said she ran a light workout Monday near London and
was expected to compete August 18, in a meet in Monte Carlo,
Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Freeman was a last-minute withdrawal Saturday in a meet at
London's Crystal Palace when she complained of pain in her thigh
and hamstring. Australian team trainer Kay Crossley described it
as a "twinge" in a muscle in the groin area.
</P>
<P>
In Monaco, the Australian is likely to race France's Marie-Jose
Perec, who beat Freeman out of Olympic gold four years ago.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Envoy Calls for Muslim Solidarity Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammad Sadr held talks with Syrian officials in Damascus Tuesday
as part of Tehran's effort to rally Arab and Islamic support for
Palestinians, especially over the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Sadr, as special envoy of President Mohammad
Khatami who chairs the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), called for strengthened solidarity among Muslim countries in
their struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Jerusalem belongs to Palestine and all Muslims,
and no concessions should be made to Israel on the status of the
city, holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official was received by Syrian President Bashar Al-
Assad, who said Syria is ready to cooperate with Iran on any
initiative and decision made by the OIC on Palestine and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Sadr said the objective of his visit was to promote cooperation
and unity among Islamic countries in confronting threats from
Israel, the official IRNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the current situation in the Middle East is "delicate,"
as Israel and the United States are exerting pressure on Palestine
to make concessions on Jerusalem following the recent failure of
the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
He urged Muslim countries to be vigilant and monitor the
situation carefully in order to frustrate Israeli and U.S. "
conspiracies."
</P>
<P>
Sadr also submitted Assad a written message from President
Khatami. The new Syrian leader expressed hope to visit Iran in the
near future to further exchange views with Khatami on bilateral
relations and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Sadr also held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
Both reaffirmed support for the rights of Arabs to take back their
lands from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sadr, who arrived in Damascus on Tuesday, had also visited Amman
and Tunis. He will continue his tour of the region to Lebanon and
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Head of Iran's Majlis Cultural Commission to Keep Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Cultural Commission
of Iran's Majlis (parliament) Ahmad Pournejati decided Tuesday to
keep his post after his resignation was turned down, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The prominent reformist, who headed the commission tackling
press matters, had offered to step down earlier in the day to
protest the conservative crackdown on pro-reform publications. But
the offer was rejected by the commission, which urged him to
continue as chairman.
</P>
<P>
Pournejati eventually yielded and decided to remain in his
position, the report said.
</P>
<P>
His resignation came two days after Iran's supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei intervened directly to prevent the Majlis,
now controlled by reformists, to rewrite the restrictive press law
passed by the previous, conservative-dominated Majlis in its fading
days.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's orders met objections from reformist lawmakers ad
sparked scuffles on the floor of the legislature. But the supreme
leader's move dealt a deadly blow to the reformist attempt to push
through any legislation without his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The restrictive press law has been used by the conservative
judiciary to shut down more than 20 pro-reform publications in a
crackdown following reformists' victory in the February
parliamentary elections. The latest victim was the Persian daily
Bahar, which was ordered to suspend publication Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
arrive in Moscow on Thursday for a working visit to Russia, said
Palestinian Ambassador in Moscow Khairi al-Ariedi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit is highly important for strengthening the
bilateral ties between Russia and the Palestinians and enhancing
Russia's role in the Middle East peace process, al-Ariedi told
Voice of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday and
hold talks with Russian chief of general staff, foreign minister
and head of the Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
On the Camp David summit, al-Ariedi said the Russian leadership
believed that the peace process was in need of joint efforts by its
co-sponsors, namely the United States and Russian, with European
support.
</P>
<P>
Arafat started a world-wide diplomatic campaign after the Camp
David summit between him, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.
S. President Bill Clinton failed on July 25 to produce a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He is touring Arab, European, African and Islamic countries to
rally support for the Palestinian position in the talks with Israel
on final-status issues, especially the issues of Jerusalem and
Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Sheltering Illegal Immigrants in UAE Faces Tougher Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior immigration official of
the United Arab Emirates has called for stricter actions against
companies and residents found to be sheltering illegal immigrants
or helping them find jobs in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency WAM on Tuesday quoted Talal Al
Shanquiti, head of the Immigration Prosecution Section (IPS), as
saying that every year, thousands of illegal immigrants, mostly
from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, come into the UAE and
work illegally in the country.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, less than 30 Arab illegal immigrants were
caught last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the IPS, between January and
July this year, 14 cases were filed in court involving illegal
immigrants being sheltered by UAE residents and companies. Fifty-
one such cases were filed last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, anyone found sheltering an illegal
immigrant would face fine of 10,000 dirhams (about 2,700 U.S.
dollars) or one month in jail.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army, Security Troops to Deploy in South on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Interior Minister Michel
Murr issued a resolution Tuesday, ordering Lebanese task force to
begin deployment in the south in the small hours of Wednesday
morning, Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Murr said in his order that the task force, comprising 500
Lebanese army soldiers and 500 security troops, will enter towns
and villages in south Lebanon as of 3 a.m. (1200 GMT) Wednesday
morning. This will be the biggest security consignment to the area
since Israel ended its 22-year-old occupation there in May.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been under pressure to take control of the frontier
from Hezbollah guerrillas, who have controlled the south and the
Israeli-Lebanese border since the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Murr had promised several times to send the troops to the south
but finally made the decision after holding meetings on Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli withdrawal, Lebanon initially sent 100
policemen to the area but has delayed deploying the army, saying it
did not want to give Israel any security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has taken
up 17 positions in the past 10 days along the U.N.-drawn "blue
line" and will take over 11 more in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has agreed to deploy its forces 24 hours after the U.N.
announced the completion of the deployment of the 400-member UNIFIL
in the south.
</P>
<P>
Timour Goksel, spokesman for the UNIFIL, has said that the
UNIFIL had not yet completed its deployment in the south and would
decide with the Lebanese government on the next phase of the
peacekeepers' roll-out. The government has delayed UNIFIL's
deployment several times since the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic violence has broken out in the area, with the latest on
Sunday when four civilians -- including two journalists --were
wounded by Israeli gunfire at Fatma Gate, a defunct crossing
between Israel and Lebanon, in response to Lebanese youths' stone-
throwing.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Keenness on Helping Realize Peace in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Tuesday that his country is keen on helping realize peace
and stability in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after receiving a report submitted by an
Egyptian delegation that has visited Djibouti recently to clear
the "misunderstandings" that had caused troubles to a Somali peace
conference held there, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt supports Djibouti's peace initiative aimed at realizing
peace and national reconciliation in Somalia, Moussa said, adding
that Cairo hopes to see normal life restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
Djiboutian officials have accused Egyptian Ambassador to Somalia
Saleh Amin of disrupting Somali peace process by dissuading
Somalia's influential faction leaders from attending the peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since Former President Siad Barre
was toppled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some 460 Somali representatives opened the reconciliation
conference in Djibouti on May 2 in a bid to select 225 members for
a proposed Interim National Council, which is designed to form a
central government.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Israeli Shas Leader's Anti-Arab Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Tuesday condemned
the anti-Arab statement by Israeli Shas party leader Rabbi Ovedia
Youssef, warning that violence would be caused by the rabbi's "
racist" stance.
</P>
<P>
Youssef in his weekly sermon described Arabs, particularly the
Palestinians, as "snakes" and "accursed people" and said that God
would be sorry for creating them, according to Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League said that Youssef's anti-Arab
sentiment will tarnish Judaism and, consequently, Jews everywhere,
warning that his attitude towards Arabs will stir up violence,
extremism, and contempt of the other.
</P>
<P>
Youssef's statement was aimed at "destroying all efforts to
create a climate of peaceful existence in the Middle East," the
pan-Arab forum said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the rabbi's words "indicated what he personally
thinks of Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians and derided Islam,
Muslims, and the divine self."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, Islam has never called for evil, hatred, or
bloodletting as it is a religion of tolerance, forgiveness, respect
of others, equality and peace," the league said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not to Change Stand on Jerusalem: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here on Tuesday that Egypt will not change its position on the
issue of Jerusalem no matter what kind of pressure is put on it.
</P>
<P>
The position of Egypt and the Arabs is well known and foreign
pressure or intervention will never force Egypt and the Arabs to
change their position, Moussa said in remarks carried by the
official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for the Egyptians and Arabs to be happy to see
Jerusalem delivered to Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
United States press has reportedly criticized Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak for allegedly refusing to accept U.S. President Bill
Clinton's request to persuade Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
make concessions on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa said in the meantime that despite their differences,
Egypt and the U.S. maintain "strong relations" and their
cooperation and consultation will continue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue of Jerusalem, holy to Muslims, Jews
and Christians, should be resolved through negotiations according
to United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
later annexed it, declaring the entire city its "eternal and
undivided" capital, a position not recognized by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state, basing their legal claim on U.N. Security Council
resolution 242 adopted following the 1967 war, which called on
Israel to withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent
conflict."

<HEADLINE> UNFICYP Unhappy With Turkish Cypriots' Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. peacekeeping force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP) will protest against the violation of the maritime
security line by Turkish Cypriot regime, UNFICYP spokeswoman Sarah
Russell said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, seven boats carrying 470
Turkish Cypriots Tuesday landed at Turkish Cypriot village of
Kokkina, an enclave in Greek Cypriots-controlled area, for "
celebrations" to commemorate the bombing of the northwest area of
the island by Turkish fighters in August 1964.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two helicopters carrying Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, "prime minister" of the Turkish Cypriot regime Dervis
Eroglu and nine other "officials", touched down at the village.
</P>
<P>
Russell said "this is a violation of the maritime security line
which will be protested."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
short-lived coup launched by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has told the U.N. it would not allow safe
passage for the about 800 Turkish Cypriots who planned go to

<HEADLINE> High-tech Boosts UK's Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) - Britain's insatiable demand for
mobile phones and computers is keeping the struggling
manufacturing sector afloat.
</P>
<P>
The latest production figures from the Office For National
Statistics (ONS) revealed a better-than-expected 0.2 percent
overall increase in manufacturing output last month, taking the
year-on-year figure to 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
New-technology sectors, such as telecom, computer equipment and
optical and electronic components, enjoyed a boost, although more
traditional businesses, such as car and shipbuilding and the
textile industry, continued to flag.
</P>
<P>
Mobile phone manufacturers increased output 7.5 percent in June,
according to the ONS. Over the past year the industry has expanded
41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Computer manufacturers have also done well over the past few
months. In the three months to June, output in the sector rose 8
percent, while firms supplying components for the sector lifted
output 9.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts said that the production data was judged
neutral in terms of UK interest rates by foreign exchange dealers,
who left sterling broadly unchanged on the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium's retail sales monitor
recorded a slight weakening in growth. Like-for-like sales in the
High Street grew 2.2 percent last month compared with July last
year and 2.8 percent year-on-year in June.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Lieberman Start Campaign Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice-President Al Gore
introduced his new running mate Senator Joseph Lieberman to the
American public Tuesday, vowing to "tear down a mighty wall of
division" with the choice of the first Jewish vice-president in U.
S. history.
</P>
<P>
At a rally in Nashville of his home state of Tennessee, Gore
compared his choice to the election of John F. Kennedy as the
first Roman Catholic president in 1960, and said the Democratic
ticket will make history again 40 years later with selection of
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
"That year we voted with our hearts to tear down a mighty wall
of division," said Gore. "We made history. And when we nominate
Joe Lieberman for vice-president, we will do it again."
</P>
<P>
Gore said he chose Lieberman because he had the experience, the
character and the judgment to become president if needed, and was
a man who shared his values and wanted to fight for the people
rather than the powerful.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said Gore showed courage, character and fairness in
choosing him, and thanked him "for making this miracle possible
for me and breaking this barrier for the rest of America forever."
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, who was one of the first Democratic senators to
publicly criticize President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky affair,
promised to work with Gore "to renew the moral center of this
nation."
</P>
<P>
"He has never, never wavered in his responsibilities as a
father, as a husband and, yes, as a servant of God almighty," said
the 58-year-old senator.
</P>
<P>
"Those are qualities that make him a great man and will make
him the next great president of the United States of America," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Lieberman will campaign together through Friday,
beginning from Gore's boyhood hometown of Carthage, Tennessee, and
then go on to Georgia, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Agency Reports Slowdown in Deforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The destruction of the
world's forests is continuing but there are strong indications
that the rate of deforestation is slowing down, a release from the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that its preliminary analysis of more than
300 satellite images showed that the rate of deforestation in
tropical countries was at least 10 percent less over the past 10
years compared with the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
But while half of the images showed a reduced rate of
deforestation, 20 percent demonstrated an increase, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment
2000, which will be delivered by the end of the year. It will
provide new estimates on the state and change of forests in all
countries.
</P>
<P>
The FAO's last global figures on forest cover indicated that in
1995, there were 3.5 billion hectares of forest, including natural
forests and forest plantations. About 55 percent of the world's
forests were located in developing countries. Only about 3 percent
of the world's forests were plantations.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1990, forest cover change in natural forests
in developing countries was estimated at a loss of 15.5 million
hectares per year.
</P>
<P>
According to the new FAO findings, tropical deforestation
decreased by at least 10 percent annually in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
FAO said that the major causes of deforestation in the tropic
are the expansion of subsistence agriculture in Africa and Asia
and large economic development programs involving resettlement,
agriculture and infrastructure in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over-harvesting of industrial wood and fuel wood,
overgrazing, fire, insect pests and diseases, storms and air
pollution cause forest degradation, FAO added.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Lawmaker Calls for Meeting with Iranian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian lawmaker on Tuesday
called for a meeting between the legislators and the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to remove differences after Khamenei ordered
to cancel a debate on amending the restrictive press law.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shakurirad, a member of the Majlis (parliament) presiding
board, said there will be no other option but for the Majlis
deputies to hold a meeting with the supreme leader when differences
do exist.
</P>
<P>
He said an official from the supreme leader's office also
believes a meeting is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Sunday intervened directly to prevent the Majlis,
now controlled by reformists, to rewrite the press law, citing it
is not in the interests of the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
His orders sparked fierce reactions in the Majlis and even led
to scuffles among the lawmakers. This move is seen as a deadly blow
to the reformist attempt to get rid of the press law passed by the
former, conservative-dominated Majlis in its fading days.
</P>
<P>
The law has been used by the conservative judiciary to shut down
more than 20 pro-reform publications in a crackdown following
reformists' victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday and Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators, in support of
the supreme leader, protested in front of the Majlis building,
demanding expulsion of the defiant lawmakers from the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Shakurirad said that the Majlis would move in line with national
interests, within the framework of the constitution and the
guidelines set by the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the conservative demonstration in front
of the Majlis. "It seems that the protest gathering has been staged
with the backing of certain organs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shakurirad is a key figure of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front (IIPF), a reformist party headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami,
younger brother of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"Now part of the system has organized a gathering against
another part and one can not attribute the adjective 'popular' to
such gatherings," he said, quoted by the official IRNA new agency,
believed to be close to reformists.
</P>
<P>
Effectively silenced by the conservatives through closure of
their papers, reformists complained they are in a disadvantageous
position to stage rallies in support of reform.
</P>
<P>
Shakurirad underlined that efforts should be made to offer
freedom to the press and at the same time to remove the possibility
of "enemy infiltration" into the press corps, which he said is the
prime concern of the leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry announced Tuesday the
conservative gathering in front of the Majlis was illegal since it
lacked required authorization from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the ministry urged the conservative-
dominated state-run television to refrain from giving news coverage
to illegal gathering and rallies.
</P>
<P>
In case such events are covered once again, the matter will be
taken up through legal channels, the ministry warned.
</P>
<P>
Although losing considerable power to reformists, the
conservatives still retain control of most state organs, including
the judiciary, military and the radio and TV broadcast.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Visits Kuwait Ahead of OPEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez arrived in Kuwait on Tuesday to continue his tour to all
OPEC member states ahead of the cartel's first summit in 25 years
in Venezuelen capital Caracas in September.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, the current president of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), flew in from Saudi Arabia, the world
top oil producer. He is on a tour to invite OPEC member states for
the Caracas summit to mark the 40th birthday of the 11-member oil
cartel.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, accompanied by Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Ali
Rodriguez, was greeted at the Kuwaiti International Airport by
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, whose country is the third largest oil producer within
OPEC after Saudi Arabia and Iran, told reporters upon his arrival
that a balanced market with a "fair price" of oil should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason I feel that hiking or reducing output is
related to the market and how it develops," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud, for his part, said the current oil price is fair
and OPEC is trying to maintain it at this level.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark London Brent oil price tag for September was
trading above 28 U.S. dollars a barrel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-
Sabah, Chavez is due to leave for Qatar later on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president plans to travel to Iraq on August 10 to meet Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, despite criticism from the United States.
</P>
<P>
He would be the first head of state to visit Baghdad since the
1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq has
been under international sanctions since its seven-month occupation
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The 10-nation tour of the Venezuelan president would also
include the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria
and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The first, and only, OPEC summit was held in Algerian capital of
Algiers in 1975.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Pierre Pettigrew Tuesday unveiled a military equipment
deal of 330 million Canadian dollars (222 million U.S. dollars)
with Australia.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Police Chief Warns of Rising Right-Wing Extremism in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- There has been a dramatic increase
in right-wing extremist acts in Switzerland, according to the
federal police chief, Urs von Daeniken.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Switzerland's German-language newspaper "
Neue Luzerner Zeitung", von Daeniken said that both the number and
gravity of offences were rising.
</P>
<P>
Von Daeniken told the paper that right-wing extremists are
becoming more dangerous, and that they have access to assault
weapons and explosives. But he said Switzerland's security was not
at risk. "The situation is a concern, but the security of
Switzerland is not under threat," he noted.
</P>
<P>
His comments come a week after the finance minister, Kaspar
Villiger, was heckled by right-wing protesters during his speech
to mark Switzerland's national day on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Von Daeniken said although incidents of extremism were on the
rise in Switzerland, he didn't believe they would become as severe
as in neighboring Germany.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that things are moving in that direction. But in
Germany there are different historical and social forces in
operation. There they have big right-wing parties. The Swiss scene,
on the other hand, is extra-parliamentary, fragmented and on a
smaller scale."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Von Daeniken made a plea for greater
resources to help police tackle the problem, in particular an
increase in personnel.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested introducing travel bans to prevent foreign
extremists from entering the country and stirring up xenophobia in
Swiss cities. According to a report in the "Basler Zeitung", the
Basel cantonal justice department is concerned at an increase in
the number of right-wing extremists active there.
</P>
<P>
Von Daeniken said the police were coordinating actions in the
cantons to deal with the right-wing threat, but he also called on
cantonal authorities to undertake their own actions, such as
imposing bans on marches and other extremist activities.
</P>
<P>
Police say the Internet is increasingly being used by right-
wing groups to communicate with each other and recruit followers.
Thirteen websites run by suspected right-wing extremists have been
monitored or closed down in Switzerland.

UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday expressed his deep concern over the ambush
and murder of seven Afghans who had been working to clear
landmines.
</P>
<P>
The ambush happened Saturday in Herat, in western Afghanistan,
in which seven were killed and another eight injured. At this time,
it is still unknown why there were attacked, or by whom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said he

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills Seven, Injures 53 in Central Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A rush hour explosion that rocked
central Moscow Tuesday afternoon has left seven people dead and 53
others injured, 11 of them critically.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences
to the friends and relatives of the victims of the blast, which
occurred at around 18:00 local time (1400 GMT) at an underground
passage near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square not far away
from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"I express my heartfelt condolences to those who have been hurt
and the families of the victims of the explosion in the center of
the capital," the Interfax news agency reported, quoting the
Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua reporter at the scene saw blood stains in the clearing
below the monument to Alexander Pushkin, the great Russian poet.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agents have reportedly defused a second
explosive device in the passage way as the Federal Security
Service (FSB) warned of more possible terrorist acts in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the blast occurred at one of the kiosks in the
underground passage way.
</P>
<P>
This has been the most powerful blast hitting Moscow this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Moscow was shocked by a series of apartment explosions
that left hundreds of people dead and more others injured.
Authorities linked the blasts to Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers are seen working at the scene but traffic
control has been somewhat eased. Traces of explosives could be
still smelt in the air following a bout of light rain.
</P>
<P>
And smoke could still be seen billowing from the walkway exit
near the monument to Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
A police officer at the scene said the Pushkin Square will be
closed until tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who rushed to the scene shortly
after the blast, branded the incident as a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the bombing occurred in a crowded area during
rush hour is indicative of this, Interfax quoted Luzhkov as saying.
</P>
<P>
City police have been put on alert in the wake of the blast and
the Interior Ministry said underground walkways and other crowded
areas will be thoroughly checked.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FSB and the Interior Ministry have vowed to
beef up the protection of ecologically sensitive installations,
especially nuclear ones, and other targets attractive to
terrorists, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned at Security of Humanitarian Workers in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday voiced his deep concern over the security of
humanitarian personnel following some 18 bombs were dropped near
the U.N.-based facilities Monday in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman here said, "the Secretary-
General is deeply concerned over the security of humanitarian
personnel and facilities belonging to Operation Lifeline Sudan (
OLS)."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "he is particularly alarmed at the
latest incident on August 7, during which some 18 bombs were
dropped in the vicinity of U.N.-based facilities in Mapel, 60
kilometers southeast of Wau."
</P>
<P>
"A United Nations aircraft that had been cleared by the
Government of Sudan to undertake its flight was on the airstrip at
Mapel at the time of the bombing," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General regrets that this latest incident took
place despite assurances from the Sudanese Government that
bombings of locations being used by U.N. and OLS would not occur,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
These assurances came after earlier bombing incidents in late
July that threatened the safety of humanitarian personnel and
relief aircraft in light of these developments, all OLS relief
flights have been temporarily suspended, pending a security
assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General and humanitarian agencies are extremely
concerned with the impact this suspension may have on vulnerable
populations who rely on relief aid to survive," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General calls upon the Government of Sudan and
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) to reinforce as a
matter of urgency the necessary measures to ensure the safety of
humanitarian workers and civilian beneficiaries throughout the
country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He reiterates his call to the Parties to resume the
humanitarian cease-fire that expired on July 15," the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
OLS is a framework endorsed by the Sudanese Government and
SPLM that has allowed U.N. agencies and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) to assist millions of Sudanese throughout the
country over the past 11 years.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Government warplanes Monday bombed two rebel-held
towns in the south of the African country, killing at least eight
civilians, wounding about 200 others, and narrowly missing a U.N.
relief plane, reports said.
</P>
<P>
At Mapel, 18 bombs were dropped, some close to a relief
aircraft parked on the airstrip, said a U.N. official who declined
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
SPLM and other rebel groups have been fighting the Sudanese
Government for 17 years for greater autonomy for the mainly
Christian and animist south. An estimated two million people have
been killed in the conflict and related famines.

<HEADLINE> Car Accident Claims One Life on Brussels Ring-Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A pile-up of three heavy-duty
trucks on the Brussels ring-road on Tuesday killed one driver and
severely injured another.
</P>
<P>
The accident blocked the motorway leading up to the Brussels
airport, where most of the holiday-makers are using to get out of
the country to somewhere else to enjoy the sun.
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the cause at the scene said that
distraction, non-respect of proper distance between motor vehicles
on highway and careless overtaking had caused the pile-up.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the trucks were doing 80 kilometers an hour at
the time when the accident occurred. Police said that the driver's
cabin of the trucks could be indented by as much as two meters at
such a fast speed and the result is fatal.
</P>
<P>
Police warned motorists using the country's highway system to
be careful while driving in that now comes the holiday season and
people prefer to drive out of town to the hilly areas in the east
or the beach in the west or to France and the Netherlands in
either the south or north.
</P>
<P>
It was the second fatal accident within three days near the
capital city of Belgium. On Sunday another traffic accident
claimed the life of one passenger traveling inside a car that was
hit by a truck and rolled off the road.

<HEADLINE> Drought Affects Over 100 Million People Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 million people in
over 20 countries currently suffer the effects of drought and the
number of affected people the United Nations World Food Program (
WFP) now feeds has soared to 16 million this year, from just three
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen an incredible increase in drought-induced hardship
over the last decade," WFP's Senior Humanitarian Advisor Francesco
Strippoli said at a press conference here Tuesday. "Today, we're
literally working in every part of the world to provide emergency
food aid to the people who have lost their crops or livelihoods
due to drought."
</P>
<P>
According to the UN agency, the Horn of Africa remains in the
grip of a severe drought with more than 16 million people facing
severe food shortages. Kenya alone is suffering from one of its
worst droughts in recorded history. With a national maize
requirement estimated at 3.21 million tons, the country will need
to import some 1.4 million tons over the next year.
</P>
<P>
The devastating drought in Central Asian countries including
Afghanistan and Tajikistan has spread to the Caucasus, where
between 55 and 60 percent of crops in Armenia's mountain regions
are at risk of damage.
</P>
<P>
Drought is currently plaguing countries in Central America and
the Caribbean. Crop losses of maize and beans in Honduras are
estimated to be between 80 and 90 percent. In Haiti, drought has
destroyed at least 33 percent of the current harvest.
</P>
<P>
Other countries seriously affected by drought include the
Middle Eastern countries of Jordan, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of our operations is massive," said Strippoli. "
Moving millions of tons of food around the globe and distributing
it in often very insecure and volatile areas in time to save lives
is our greatest challenge."
</P>
<P>
Funding for WFP's drought-related projects for this year alone
represent about 20 percent of total emergency requirements, the
agency said. This is an increase of nine percent compared to 1995.
Taking into account the steadily increasing global emergency
requirements, drought-specific resource requirements have more
than doubled in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Criticizes UNIFIL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh Tuesday accused United Nations peacekeepers of
shirking their responsibility toward keeping Israeli-Lebanese
border quiet.
</P>
<P>
After touring the Good Fence border crossing near the northern
city of Metulla Tuesday morning, Sneh confirmed in an Israel Radio
interview that he did see U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
soldiers cross the border.
</P>
<P>
These peacekeepers have taken over 18 positions in the former
Israeli security zone last week after Israel pulled out in May
after a 15-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Sneh said, these peacekeepers did nothing to
restrain violence against patrolling Israeli soldiers at the border
crossing.
</P>
<P>
Since the May withdrawal, no major violence between Israelis and
Lebanese took place in the border area.
</P>
<P>
"What I saw with my own eyes is that the U.N. is avoiding the
area of the stone-throwers," said Sneh. He added that the UNIFIL is
supposed to keep the law and order in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Sneh threatened that Israel's patience with the continued stone-
throwing from Lebanon would not last indefinitely. "Our people are
acting with great restraint, but our people may have to begin
responding differently to these provocations," he said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, four Lebanese civilians, including two
correspondents, suffered gunshot wounds when Israeli troops opened
fire in response to stone attacks.
</P>
<P>
Sneh added that Israel will complain about UNIFIL's nonfeasance
to senior U.N. officials, even to Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Lebanese government's role in south Lebanon, Sneh
said that at this stage, the Lebanese government army does not
intend to play a significant role in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Sneh hoped that the Lebanese army will send its soldiers to the
south as soon as possible and prevent further terror attacks from
Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
That's what Lebanese army has to do according to U.N. Resolution
245, Sneh reiterated, as Israel soldiers had complied with the
resolution by pulling back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was passed in 1978 after Israel launched a
large-scale aggression against Lebanon in the name of wiping out
Palestinian guerrillas there, had been used by Israel as the
international legal framework for its withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday afternoon, a Beirut spokesman announced that
Lebanon is due to begin the first deployment of its troops, a
combined force of 1,000 soldiers and policemen, along the border
with Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNIFIL also plans to take up positions at 11 more
sites along the U.N.-drawn Blue Line between Israel and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> AmCham: Not to Cancel U.S. GSP Facilities for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- American Chamber of Commerce AmCham)
in Bangladesh Tuesday urged the U.S. government not to stop the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) facilities offered to
Bangladesh in the interest of U.S. business.
</P>
<P>
"It will have negative impact on Bangladesh economy as well as
hamper the expansion of U.S. business here," Forrest Cookson,
President of the AmCham said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has long been pressing the Bangladeshi
government to allow trade union activities in export processing
zones (EPZs under the pressure of the American Federation of Labor
and Congress for Industrial Organization, even threatening to
cancel the GSP facilities offered to the country.
</P>
<P>
AmCham has already submitted its view on the issue of
cancellation of GSP facilities to the Trade Policy Committee of
the U.S. government Cookson said, adding that the U.S. government
should increase market access for Bangladesh instead of reducing
it.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the workers' rights in the export processing zones,
the president noted that the EPZ authorities have already taken
measures to establish welfare committees for workers.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the U.S. government would assist the development of
the newly-established welfare committees and the U.S. Embassy in
Dhaka would monitor the progress of the committees which will
ensure U.S. investment in Bangladesh.

KATHMANDU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra has
relieved Minister for Water Resources and Physical Planning and

Prime Minister Girija Koirala, according to a notice published
Tuesday by the principal press secretariat of the king.

Water Resources and Physical Planning and Works, the notice said,
but did not give the reason for the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said Tuesday Khadka is among the lawmakers
from the ruling Nepali Congress who launched a signature campaign
Monday to remove Koirala either from the premiership or from the
party presidency.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers argued that Koirala should not hold both posts at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
Koirala had declined to comply with the demand, the daily said.

<HEADLINE> Businessman Killed in Bomb Blast in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A businessman was killed in a bomb
explosion in the town of Zumaia in northern Spain on Tuesday,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish media identified the victim as Jose Maria Korta, owner
of a machine tool factory in Zumaia, 25 miles (40 kilometers) west
of the coastal city of San Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
Korta was also the president of an association of local
businessmen. He was said to be a critic of ETA.
</P>
<P>
The blast came after an explosion killed four suspected ETA
members on Monday, an apparent accident when explosives they were
handling in a car went off, police said.
</P>
<P>
Carmelo Barrio, a senior local member of Spain's ruling Popular
Party, said Monday's deaths were "natural justice," and said he
was "satisfied" that "innocent people" had not been killed.
</P>
<P>
Blame for Tuesday's attack was immediately pinned on ETA, which
seeks to unite the Basque in northern Spain and southwest France
in an independent homeland. ETA has killed some 800 people since
it began a violent campaign in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Around 30 ETA members have been killed while manipulating their
own weapons. This year, the group has killed eight people and
injured more than 20 others.

<HEADLINE> Air France Says Too Early to Decide Fate of Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,August 8 (Xinhua) -- Air France said on Tuesday that it
is still too early to decide the fate of the company's Concorde
fleet, which has been grounded since the crash of one of such
supersonic airliners on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bureau of Accident Investigation has yet to clearly
link some key facts concerning the crash, Air France cannot decide
its own policy on Concorde, said Philippe Calavia, general
director of Air France in charge of economic and financial affairs,
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which suspended the flight of five other
Concorde planes of Air France in the wake of the crash, has come
under pressure from some experts and pilots calling for a
resumption of the flight of the planes.
</P>
<P>
Another air company which uses Concorde, the British Airways,
resumed the flight of such planes only one day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
The French Ministry of Transport said that it needs to
establish a scenario of the crash and takes extra security
measures before Concorde can resume its flight.
</P>
<P>
Investigators cannot link the different facts found in the
crash so far, including the discovery of a metal strip on the
runway, the bursting of one or two tires, the outbreak of a
massive fire, the breakdown of one engine and the problem with one
undercarriage.
</P>
<P>
Last month's crash near the Charles-de-Gaulle-Roissy airport
outside Paris killed 113 people, 96 of whom were German tourists.

<HEADLINE> Czech Inflation Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index of the
Czech Republic rose 0.6 percent on a month-on-month basis and 3.9
percent year-on-year in July, the Czech Statistical Office (CSU)
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, net inflation registers a 0.5 percent
increase on a month-on-month basis and 3.1 percent increase year-
on-year.
</P>
<P>
The CSU attributed the growth in the July inflation to a rise
in the prices of housing and leisure.
</P>
<P>
The Czech central bank estimated that inflation was expected to
remain stable in the next few months. It said in a statement that
"the year-on-year growth of headline and net inflation should
fluctuate at around the current level, along with only modest
monthly moves in both indices."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the latest figures released by the CSU showed Czech
industrial output in June grew 6.1 percent year-on-year.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills Seven in Central Moscow, More Blasts Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- An explosion that hit central
Moscow Tuesday afternoon has killed seven people and injured 22
others, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at around 18:00 local time (1400 GMT) at an
underground passage near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public squre
not far away from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agents have reportedly defused a second
explosive device in the passage way as the Federal Security
Service (FSB) warned of more possible terrorist acts in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Six rescue teams are working at the scene and regular traffic
has been blocked.
</P>
<P>
Smoke could still be seen billowing from the walkway exit near
the monument to the poet Alexander Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, who rushed to the scene shortly after the blast,
branded the incident as a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the bombing occurred in a crowded area during a

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimmers Take Diet Supplements of EPO Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- American woman swimmers Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres admitted that they were taking a
nutrition program to the benefits of some banned drugs to help
them stay among the world's elite swimmers, local reports said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, swimmers are requested to take small amounts
of the controversial but legal creatine and about 25 daily
supplements of multivitamins, minerals, amino acids and
supplemental proteins, the Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
"The program which costs more than 500 dollars a month, will
produce the benefits of some banned drugs such as human growth
hormone and erythropoietin (EPO) without breaking any rules or
jeopardizing the athletes' health," the Washington Post quoted
Glen Luepnitz, the Texas-based nutritionist and immunologist as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We know there are all sorts of performance-enhancing drugs
being utilized nationally and internationally," Luepnitz said. "I
'm trying to look for an edge ... We can get their own body to
provide the same type of response in a very controlled manner."
</P>
<P>
Torres' and Thompson's separate disclosures came in response to
questions regarding their training methods and may have been
intended to disassociate themselves from suspicions of banned drug
use.
</P>
<P>
Torres, 33, recently set an American record in the 50m
freestyle despite coming out of retirement just last year after
seven years away from the sport, while Thompson, 27, has long been
considered one of the top Americans in the freestyle and butterfly
with most Olympic gold medals of five, but all from the relays
events.
</P>
<P>
However, neither swimmers were ready to identify their specific
supplement routine, citing a desire to pretect their "trade
secrets at a highly competitive time of year".
</P>
<P>
Both Torres and Thompson train under U.S. Olympic women's team
coach Richard Quick who said that he not only supports Luepnitz's
program, but also is using it for his Stanford swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Quick said Luepnitz's nutritional work is only one part of a
system of trainers, sports psychologists, flexibility experts and
others at Stanford who have helped Thompson and Torres prosper.
</P>
<P>
Luepnitz, a doctor of immunology and nutrition at Austin-based
Lone Star Oncology, said that Torres and Thompson use no over-the-
counter products without his approval, and take approximately 25
bills, powders or other supplements at different times of the day.
</P>
<P>
Glutamine, an amino acid that he said stimulates the body's
natural production of growth hormone, is taken after workouts to
help muscles recover more quickly, and approriate doses of iron
and proper rest are used to maintain a relatively high red blood
cell count, mimicking the action of the banned drug EPO, said
Luepnitz.
</P>
<P>
"I think if both women stopped the program they would still do
fantastically well. But do I think it helps them? Obviously,"
Quick was quoted by the Washington Post.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Former Bidders Prepared to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Salt Lake's bid
for the 2002 Winter Olympics pleaded innocent Monday to federal
charges that they doled out more than one million US dollars in
bribes in their effort to land the Games.
</P>
<P>
Tom Welch, the bid committee president, and Dave Johnson, the
vice president, each face conspiracy, fraud and racketeering
charges that could bring 75 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Magistrate Samuel Alba said that if the sides can
't reach a plea agreement by October 9, the trial will start on
October 16.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Welch and Johnson said that they will ask for a
delay, saying collecting the evidence would take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
If the trial is pushed back a year, it would start just as Salt
Lake City is gearing up for the Games which runs February 8-24.
The federal courthouse is expected to suspend trials and hearings
during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Welch, 55, and Johnson, 41, said they are eager to tell their
side of a story that shook the Olympic movement to its root and
wrought changes in the International Olympic Committee's
membership and procedures.
</P>
<P>
"We did not do anything that violated the law," Welch said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the defense case would implicate, among others,
Utah politicians and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Max Wheeler, the lawyer for Johnson, did not address whether
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever has knowledge that will be helpful would certainly be
on our list," Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
No bail was requested and despite the prosecution's objections,
Welch and Johnson were allowed to keep their passports.

SHENYANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- This capital of northeast China'
s Liaoning Province has decided to celebrate the 2,300th
anniversary of its establishment on September 1.
</P>
<P>
After two years of research, Chinese historians and
archaeologists have affirmed that Shenyang City was set up in 300
B.C.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major cities in northeast China and an important
industrial base in the country, Shenyang was also one of the
cradles of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said that as early as 7,000 years ago, there
were people living on the site of Shenyang City, which has been
proved by the discovery of the Xinle Culture Site.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Fight Export-Credit Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police uncovered a scandal
of fake receipts worth 35 trillion Turkish lira (7 million U.S.
dollars) and 22-million-dollar fictitious documents of exports to
11 countries, Turkish Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Hasan Yucesan of the western province Izmir said on
Monday that the police have launched a two-day operation and busted
a swindling network centered in Izmir but across 15 provinces.
</P>
<P>
He told a press briefing that some 20 suspects had been taken
into custody as of Monday, but slammed the media for leaking
information to the public while the operation was in progress.
</P>
<P>
Yucesan said that "news reports that were published during the
operation led to the destruction of criminal evidence. This
prevents the operation from achieving its aims."
</P>
<P>
But Yucesan refused to name those who had been taken into
custody. It was reported that some businessmen, former municipality
officials and certified financial advisors were being interrogated
in connection with the operation, codenamed "Whale Operation."
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the police throughout Izmir were
warned to be on the lookout for businessman Mehmet Niyazoglu,
allegedly a key figure in the scam, along with approximately 30
others.
</P>
<P>
The police seized two truckloads of documents from companies
implicated in the fictitious exports of textile products to 11
countries.
</P>
<P>
Yucesan said that "not a single penny has arrived in Turkey from
the importers of these goods. There has been no shipment. it's a
hoax."
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that six companies involved in the fictitious
exports were sending cloth scraps to nonexistent overseas-based
companies from which they had earned illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Izmir police have been investigating
similar cases in collaboration with the provincial fiscal
administration and have discovered tax evasion through fictitious
exports worth 1.5 quadrillion Turkish lira (300 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Yucesan said that "the unfolding of these scams is being traced.
The figure is growing. What should actually be done to prevent such
crimes is to rewrite export regulations. Trillions of lira have
been guzzled through abusing export legislation, and these figures
could grow."
</P>
<P>
Some governors and high-ranking officials were implicated in the
scandal, he added without elaborating.

<HEADLINE> 4 Bomb Threats in Indonesian Capital on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Capital on Tuesday
was again jolted by four bomb threats, a week after a powerful
bomb exploded outside the Philippine ambassador's residence on
August 1.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the bomb threats were the buildings of the Bank
Indonesia, the country's central bank, on Jalan Thamrin, one of
the city's main avenues, and the Attorney General's Office, Argo
Pantes business group and the Jakarta District Attorney, all in
South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The bomb threats occurred as the People's Consultative Assembly,
the country's highest decision-making body, entered its second day
of a 12-day annual session and the South Jakarta Public Prosecutor
's Office handed the dossier on former president Soeharto's graft
case to the South Jakarta Court.
</P>
<P>
National Police spokesman Senior Superintendent Zainuri Lubis
told reporters that all the bomb threats had proven empty. Police
anti-bomb squads that were sent to all the threatened buildings
had found nothing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, bomb threats were also addressed to the Great River
building in South Jakarta and Menteng Apartment in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The August 1 bombing killed two persons and injured 22,
including the Philippine ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports, Imports Rise in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports grew 21.3
percent in the first half of the year, while imports soared 23.8
percent, according to a governmental report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that in the first half of this year, exports
rose to 32.9 billion U.S. dollars, while imports climbed to 28.8
billion dollars, resulting in a trade surplus of 4.1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It noted that exports in June alone totaled 5.6 billion dollars,
up 16.5 percent from June of 1999, while imports totaled 5.5
billion dollars, up 18.3 percent, bringing the month's surplus to
100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from exports of agricultural products in the first half
expanded 7 percent, but processed food products fell 1.1 percent
due to a decline in sugar prices, said it.
</P>
<P>
The report also predicted the country's exports in the whole
year will meet the government's target of a 10 to 12 percent
expansion, while the trade surplus will hold up until 2002.
</P>
<P>
However, it warned that rising imports could result in trade
deficit soon, as fast growing imports feed a pick up in
manufacturing activity and stronger local demand.
</P>
<P>
Exports have powered Thailand's return to economic growth after
the worst economic slump in 1997.

PRAGUE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic received 48
million foreign visitors during the first half of this year, up 6.
6 percent over the same period last year, according to the latest
figures published by the Czech National Institute of Statistics.

Over recent years, in a nation with many famous historical

<HEADLINE> France Reluctant to Recruit Foreigners in Informatics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The French government will not
follow the German practice of providing quotas to foreigners with
special skills who wish to work in the country's informatics
industry which badly lacks qualified labor force, Agence France-
Presse (AFP) Tuesday quoted a French government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Michele Debonoeil, chief of the economic service under the
Ministry of Employment, said that it is a "taboo" in France to
recruit foreigners with professional qualifications with quotas,
because France itself has 2.3 million jobless people.
</P>
<P>
She also said that by recruiting foreigners, one can "loot the
qualified labor force of Third World countries" while not solving
the problem of qualification for unemployed people at home.
</P>
<P>
But the government has opened some channels since 1998 for
enterprises in informatics industry to recruit foreigners by
allowing them to deposit documents of candidacy for employing
foreigners from outside the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, some 1,000 foreigners, most of them Indians, were
employed by French enterprises, said the Ministry of Employment.

</P>
<P>
-- Behind President Clinton's blunt warning last spring that
South Asia was the world's most perilous region lay an assessment

conflict had increased significantly, according to officials with
access to the secret intelligence.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Secretary Williams S. Cohen postponed his
recommendation to President Clinton on whether to move ahead with
a limited national missile defense, citing a number of unspecified

</P>
<P>
"One of the major area for Internet growth in Asia is wireless
Internet. The company is a major player in the new 3G," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Nortel is involved in several major businesses like
wireless, optical and data, and now entering ASP business.
</P>
<P>
ASP business is clearly a business leveraging the Internet and
optical is on the heart of ASP, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Nortel's role is enabling our customers to become ASP. So our
focus is on working with service providers and companies that want
to intervene in the ASP market," said Willis.
</P>
<P>
He said Nortel identifies three issues for the ASP expansion,
namely efficient infrastructure, time-to-market and service level
agreement management.
</P>
<P>
An efficient infrastructure will provide the right environment
for applications, he explained, and the time-to-market will enable
the customers to provide service and generate revenue very quickly.
</P>
<P>
He said Nortel has made very significant investment in Asia as
a whole, which is reflected in the number of the companies and
customers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ASP business in China, Willis said Nortel is
at the involving stage and there is a lot of interests in China at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
Nortel sees a lot of companies and customers that demand the
infrastructure to build business plan, he said. "We do believe
China would be a major market force in the ASP business."

<HEADLINE> China Succeeds in Skin Regeneration, Duplication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have fulfilled
the promise of skin regeneration by stem cell culturing in vivo
and in situ, and successfully applied the technology in treating
extensive deep burn victims.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xu Rongxiang, the inventor of the therapy, and his
team introduced the technology here today at a press conference on
"Achievements in Burn Treatment by Skin Regeneration".
</P>
<P>
Some one dozen burn patients with over 90 percent of their
total body surfaces burned and deep burns healed by skin
regeneration appeared at the event to demonstrate the repaired and
regenerated new skin.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xu explained that, subsequent to a burn injury, the
human body has an instinct to trigger residual tissue in situ to
regenerate stem cells, which then are adjusted to give rise to
skin tissue, based on Moist Exposed Burn Therapy (MEBT), also
invented by himself.
</P>
<P>
In the past, once burned, skin-burn wounds usually healed
spontaneously, leaving scars because of the lack of organ repair
and duplication techniques.
</P>
<P>
Surgical excision was performed on the wounds incapable of
healing, and then the wounds healed following skin grafting, which
resulted in disablement.
</P>
<P>
Achievement of stem cell regeneration in situ by Professor Xu
is a breakthrough in stem cell research, the press conference was
told.
</P>
<P>
To benefit all burn patients with this breakthrough and provide
scientific data for medical education, the China National Burns
Association (West-East) has compiled the "Blue Book on Burn
Therapy."
</P>
<P>
The book gives intensive descriptions of the therapeutic bases
of burn skin regeneration techniques and methodology, as well as
other achievements in stem cell regeneration in situ.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xu also gave a detailed presentation on research
directions and prospects for stem cell culturing in situ in the
fields of skin cosmetics, repair of gastrointestinal membrane and
other types of organ duplication, which are expected to
revolutionize the practice of medicine.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Defends Foreign Ministry Personnel Shake-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister and
Acting Foreign Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday rejected accusations
that his move to reshuffle the foreign ministry was intended to
settle accounts with former Former Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Levy resigned last week in protest against Barak's handling with
the peace talks with the Palestinians and a coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who formally assumed the foreign ministry portfolio on
Sunday, announced on Monday foreign ministry Director General Eytan
Bentsur will be replaced by veteran Alon Liel, 51.
</P>
<P>
Barak also recalled three ambassadors considered close to Levy,
including Eliahu Ben-Elissar, ambassador to France, and Uri Oren,
ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Bentsur's departure, which surprised the
ministry, reportedly came just hours after Barak met with the top
staff and was interpreted as Barak's way of doing away with a Levy
appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman, however, said that Bentsur had
indicated upon Levy's resignation that he was interested in leaving
the post and taking up an ambassadorial position in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur is a career diplomat and became director-general when
Levy took over the ministry under former Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In justification of the personnel changes, Barak said on Tuesday
it is perfectly natural for the director-general to change when a
new foreign minister steps in.
</P>
<P>
As for the recalling of the ambassadors, Barak said most of them
were aware of that for quite some time, adding he did not
understand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, Barak said he met Minister of Regional
Cooperation Shimon Peres before and after the latter held talks
with Palestinian official Abu Ala on ways to break the current
impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian talks after the Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said dialogues are being held with the
Palestinians on a number of tracks and Peres is conducting one of
them.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Barak's moves to shake up the government, Knesset
(Parliament) Member from the opposition Likud faction Uzi Landau,
also chairman of the Comptroller Committee, is to convene the
committee for an urgent session next week to discuss what he called
the "purging" of political offices.
</P>
<P>
The legislator claimed Barak is trying to link the government
establishment to the next election.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Quality Government, a non-governmental
organization, has petitioned to the High Court to block the
replacement of Bentsur as foreign ministry director general, saying
Bentsur is a professional appointment, not a political one.
</P>
<P>
In response, Bentsur said he will stay in the post for the
moment. Liel, who was supposed to take over Bentsur's position, is
expected to appear on Wednesday before the Civil Service
Commission's panel of appointment to await the panel's endorsement.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Barak named four cabinet ministers from One Israel to
be temporarily in charge of portfolios vacated in the wave of
coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government has been reduced to a shaky minority one with
40 seats in the 120-member Knesset, and 12 ministers who are barely
enough to sustain the government's daily functioning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who suffered a severe political blow prior
to the Knesset's three-month summer recess by being defeated in the
vote of an early-elections motion by the opposition, embarked on
the tasks of reshuffling the government and pushing ahead the peace
talks with the Palestinians with an aim to clinching a peace deal
to fulfil his election promise.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Allegations on Efforts to Help Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday denied allegations
on its efforts to encourage Palestinian groups to create tension in
the region following the failure of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi termed as "baseless"
the reports by Israeli radio and some other press on the Iranian
efforts, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio and Sunday Times reported recently Iran is trying
to encourage Palestinian groups to get involved in operations
against the Israeli regime and has provided those groups with
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Such a propaganda tool had been previously employed in similar
cases by the Israeli regime in an attempt to exert further pressure
on militant Palestinian forces in the aftermath of the failure of
the recent talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the principled firm stance adopted by the Islamic
world toward the issue of Palestine, specially the holy Qods
(Jerusalem), is the main reason for the Israelis to raise such
repeated allegations under this crucial juncture.
</P>
<P>
Iran had voiced strong opposition to the summit held on July 11-
25 in Camp David between leaders of Palestine, Israel and the
United Sates and expressed delight over the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
After Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak failed to reach any agreement, Tehran launched
extensive contacts and consultations with Islamic states and
Palestinian groups, calling for common stance among the Muslim
countries toward the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the U.S. statements to transfer its
embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Iran underlined the
sovereignty of Jerusalem belongs to Palestine and the Palestinians
have the right to establish an independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital.

<HEADLINE> Another Reformist Daily Suspended in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated press
court on Tuesday suspended another reformist daily Bahar (Spring),
bringing the total number of papers, most remformist, closed in
recent months to 22.
</P>
<P>
Bahar was closed down only two days after the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the reformist Majlis (parliament) to
drop its debate on an amendment to the strict press law, passed by
the conservative-controlled former Majlis not long before the
February parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
The court claimed that the daily was temporarily closed down as
its managing director Saeed Pourazizi had been summoned to court
several times, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Pourazizi was notified of the offenses and complaints against
the paper, but the daily did not heed the court notices, the court
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the public relations office of Tehran Justice
Department said the public prosecutor had lodged a complaint with
the court against the paper and the judge issued a ruling for a
temporary ban on it.
</P>
<P>
Iran's powerful conservatives started a wholesale crackdown on
the freedom-seeking reformist press after they suffered a face-
losing defeat to the reformists in the February parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
At present, only two major reformist newspapers, Iran, published
by IRNA, and Hamshahri (Citizen), published by the Tehran
municipality, escaped the wholesale crackdown, but their future are
not secured.
</P>
<P>
Along with the closure of reformist papers, a dozen of reporters
and writers had been also summoned to court or put into prison on
various charges.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives are still in control of most of the key state
organs, including the judiciary and the military.

ISLAMABAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A high level delegation of
former Afghan King Zahir Shah Tuesday flew into southern Kandahar

The delegation will stay in the Taliban headquarters for three

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) will deploy in 11 more positions along the U.N.-drawn Blue
Line in the next few days, thus taking longer than anticipated to
complete its deployment in the Israeli-Lebanese border area, local
press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. peacekeeping force intends to deploy in 11 additional
positions in the coming days, and will continue to coordinate its
deployment with the Lebanese authorities," said U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan's deputy spokesman Manoel de Al Meida.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL has deployed in 17 new positions and "the deployment of
about 1,000 Lebanese security forces to the region is expected to
take place in the coming days," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He expressed U.N. concerns over the escalating stone-throwing
attacks from the Lebanese side of the fence on Israeli soldiers and
farmers in recent days.
</P>
<P>
He also added the U.N. is concerned about the stone-throwing
activities at Fatma Gate and the potential for further escalation
of the situation in the border area, hoping that such incidents can
be halted. UNIFIL has not established a position near the Fatma
Gate.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese police said four Lebanese civilians, including two
correspondents, suffered gunshot wounds when Israeli troops opened
fire Sunday in response to stone attacks and locally-made Molotov
Cocktail canisters tossed over the barbed-wire fence. Lebanon has
lodged a complaint over the Israeli gunfire in a note to UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the French foreign ministry described the UNIFIL
deployment as an "encouraging development to re-establish stability

and help the Lebanese government to reinstate its authority over
part of its territory."
</P>
<P>
France has repeatedly called on the Lebanese government to
deploy its army alongside UNIFIL after Israel withdrew its troops
from south Lebanon on May 24, ending its 22-year occupation of the
region.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Postpones Crucial Vote on Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Sri Lankan
Parliament K.B. Ratnayake announced Tuesday that the vote would be
postponed on a new draft constitution bill which aims at
politically ending the bloody ethnic civil war between government
troops and Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution, which was presented by the government
last Thursday, was due to be debated and voted later on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year civil war against Tamil
Tiger rebels who are fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east. The government has
introduced the draft constitution in a bid to end the conflicts by
devolving more powers to regional councils including one
administered by Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport of the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
government A.H.M. Fowzie said that the government has decided to
postpone the debate as more members of Parliament wanted to
express their view.
</P>
<P>
He said that the debate will not continue on Wednesday and only
the extension of emergency will be taken up. The minister denied
that the government has backed out and it is a lost of face for
the PA.
</P>
<P>
However, members of the main opposition United National Party (
UNP) said the postponement is due to the inability of the PA
government to muster the required two-thirds majority or 150 votes
in the 225-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the draft constitution cannot be
taken up again in this parliament as the present parliament stands
to be dissolved on August 24.
</P>
<P>
In the parliament on Tuesday Minister of Rehabilitation Sarath
Amunugama accused the UNP of sending 10 Members of Parliament to
Singapore. He said that it had been done to prevent them from
voting with the government.
</P>
<P>
When the parliament met Tuesday morning a UNP member of
Parliament from the south Mervyn de Silva crossed over to the
government side.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of Committees Rauff Hakeem adjourned the
parliament Tuesday morning sighting unruly behavior by some
members of Parliament. A party leaders meeting was also convened
on Tuesday by Speaker Ratnayake.
</P>
<P>
The delaying of the vote comes as thousands of opposition
supporters and the Buddhist monks continue to hold protest against
the proposed draft constitution around the parliament. A Buddhist
monk who began a fast on Monday continued with his fast near the
Colombo railway station.

<HEADLINE> MSF-Belgium Pulls Out of Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Medecins sans Frontieres (
MSF or Doctors Without Borders)-Belgium has pulled out of the
humanitarian activities in Kosovo, accusing even more instability
and ethnic hatred a year after the United Nations and NATO-led
international peacekeeping force entered the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The MSF-Belgium said that they could no longer tolerate the
serious and continuous deterioration of the living conditions of
the ethnic minorities in Kosovo, local television reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The RTBF, the radio and television service for the French-
speaking part of Belgium, quoted the MSF-Belgium as saying that it
pulled out of Kosovo because it had witnessed "daily harassment
and terror against the Serb minority in Vucitrn and Srbica and the
Albanian minority in Mitrovica."
</P>
<P>
"Doctors Without Borders questions the appropriateness of
humanitarian medical and psychological assistance in Kosovo. With
the presence of international mandated protection forces, the
fundamental rights of people are being denied," the television
report quoted a statement released by MSF-Belgium on Monday in
Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Patrice Page, coordinator of MSF-Belgium based at Mitrovica in
northern Kosovo, told the press that MSF-Belgium had been
considering pulling out of Kosovo for the past seven weeks, during
which it had appealed to the Mission of the United Nations in
Kosovo about the living conditions of Kosovo ethnic minorities
that was marked by assassinations, killings, shootings, hand
grenade attacks, verbal abuses, threats and blackmails as well as
robbery.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs who now live isolated on an Albanian majority-
dominated territory have been the victims of intimidation attacks
even under the protection of the international peacekeeping forces,
" said the MSF-Belgium.
</P>
<P>
MSF-Belgium is pulling out from Mitrovica its six staff members:
one doctor, one nurse, one psychiatrist, two logisticians and one
coordinator. MSF-France and MSF-Spain, however, are staying.
</P>
<P>
Medecins sans Frontieres, the Paris-based humanitarian group,
has been working in Kosovo since 1993.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Cargo Vessel Sinks in Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean freighter ship sank
Tuesday morning after colliding with a Chinese cargo ship due to
thick mist in the Yellow Sea some 25 miles east of Changpo-ri,
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
All 12 crew members aboard the South Korean ship, Wooyang-Blue,
were rescued by a South Korean maritime police patrol boat, the
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
However, oil spilled from the sunken ship's engine room,
polluting an area of 50 meters wide and 100 meters long in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The 2,550-ton South Korean ship carrying 1,915 tons of scrap
iron was on its way to Kusun, South Korea, from Vladivostok,
Russia, when colliding with Jinju, the 500-ton Chinese ship, which
was damaged.
</P>
<P>
The collision ripped Wooyang-Blue's bow about one meter long,
bringing sea water into the ship.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated ship reportedly has 29 tons of Bunker C oil and
12 tons of diesel in its tank.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean maritime police sent three oil-spill cleanup
boats to the scene to skim the oil off the surface of the sea.

<HEADLINE> Film of Nanjing Massacre to Be Donated by American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The camera and film footage used
by a U.S. clergyman to record the atrocities of Japanese soldiers
in Nanjing in 1937 will be donated by his son to the Memorial Hall
of Nanjing Massacre Victims.
</P>
<P>
The clergyman, John Magge, filmed scenes with a film camera
when the city fell to the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Many museums and individuals in the United States had offered
to buy the film but were all turned downed by Magge and his son
David.
</P>
<P>
The film, which runs for almost two hours, provides undisputed
evidence of the Nanjing Massacre, in which more than 300,000
Chinese were brutally killed by Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The massacre shocked the world, but there are some Japanese who
have attempted to deny that the massacre never happened.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that Magge's film is the only film record of the
Nanjing Massacre that has been discovered so far.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, the church in Xiaguan District in Nanjing where Magge
preached became a secondary school library. The local government
has named it the John Magge Library.

<HEADLINE> HK's Water Supply Among Safest in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has one of the safest
water supplies in the world, said a senior official of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Rotary Club luncheon, Lee Shing-see, secretary
for works of the HKSAR, said "Hong Kong's water is as good as the
best anywhere else in the world."
</P>
<P>
He added that the treated water fully meets stringent
international health standards.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAR government set up in April this year an
Advisory Committee on the Quality of Water Supplies with the aim
to promote transparency and encourage public participation in the
monitoring of the quality of water supplies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong gets its water from two sources: rainfall collected
in its local catchments and stored in reservoirs and supply from
the Dongjiang River in Guangdong, providing respectively 20
percent and 80 percent of the water required for the city.
</P>
<P>
Lee explained that the water had to undergo a series of tests
that comply with WHO drinking water standards.

<HEADLINE> Rural Consumers Need More Power, Water, TV Antennas(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- According to a survey conducted
by the National Bureau of Statistics, by slashing electricity
prices and installing satellite dishes and tap water facilities in
rural areas, China will be able to make every 100 farmer
households buy 10.5 more color TV sets and 22.6 more washing
machines than at present.
</P>
<P>
Outdated power grids, higher electricity prices, poor TV
signals and a lack of tap water are preventing the increase of
demand for durable consumption goods in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, every 100 farmer households had less than 40 color TV
sets and 24 washing machines, comparing with 105 color TV sets and
77 washing machines for every 100 households in cities.
</P>
<P>
The low income of farmers is not the only factor restricting
consumption demand in the rural market.
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1999, rural households in Guangdong province in
south China earned 71 percent more than households in cities did
in 1991. However, rural households owned far less color TV sets
and washing machines than urban households eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The availability of tap water, stable power supplies and TV
antennas have a very positive influence on farmers buying washing
machines, color TV and refrigerators.

Installing tap water facilities and satellite dishes in
villages will increase farmers' purchase of TV sets and washing
machines by 22.6 million and 10.3 million respectively, according
to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBC).
</P>
<P>
By starting a tap water project in rural areas, China may not
only fully utilize the idle production capacity of washing
machines, but also start another round of investment in new
factories.
</P>
<P>
At present, electricity prices in rural areas are 45 percent
higher than in cities.
</P>
<P>
NBS predicts that if electricity prices are slashed by ten
percent, farmers will buy 3.42 million more TV sets, accounting
for ten percent of the total sold in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, farmers will buy 5.65 million more washing
machines, accounting for 50 percent of the total sold last year.
</P>
<P>
The on-going upgrading of rural power grids may hopefully lower
electricity prices by 20 percent. This price drop will generate
enough demand to greatly reduce stock piles of TV and washing
machines in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government's effort to install
satellite dishes in villages and sort out charges and taxes in
rural areas will help create favorable conditions for invigorating
the consumer market in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Holds Secret Talks With Top Palestinian Legislator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres Tuesday morning held secret talks with
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
During the clandestine meeting, Peres reportedly submitted
several "new ideas", which he hoped could break the current
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process following the
botched Camp David summit last month, Israel Radio quoted
Palestinian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office and Peres's spokesman
all refused to confirm the meeting or elaborate on the exact
details of these "new ideas."
</P>
<P>
Peres also explained the political situation in Israel to Qurei,
the number two figure after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and
urged the Palestinians to be more flexible in the negotiations,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The two officials will meet again, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting indicates that Peres, who was dealt with a
humiliating blow in the presidential ballot in the Knesset
(Parliament) on July 31, has swiftly recuperated and returned to
the political spotlight.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994
for his efforts to masterplan the landmark Oslo Accords between
Israel and the Palestinians, is regarded by many Arab politicians
as a persuasive and believable person.
</P>
<P>
Some officials in Barak's One Israel coalition even urged the
prime minister to nominate Peres as Foreign Minister to replace
David Levy, who resigned last Wednesday due to disputes over
Barak's negotiating approaches at the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by Barak, Arafat, and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, lasted 15 days and failed to reach an agreement finally on
core issues between the two sides, especially on the fate of
Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Parliament to Convene Special Session in Recess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset, or Parliament,
will interrupt its summer recess next week and convene a special
session to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Likud
officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The special session was placed on the agenda at the request of
the opposition party, which has gathered the law-required 21
signatures of Knesset members for holding such a session.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset began its summer recess on August 2 and will not
convene until the end of October. However, a special session could
be convened if enough legislators request to do so.
</P>
<P>
Likud parliamentary faction whip Reuven Rivlin said that the
session will discuss Prime Minister Ehud Barak's continued peace
contacts with the Palestinians and the current change of cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear whether the opposition will submit no-
confidence motions for the special session. Barak had hoped that
the three-month recess, as a period of grace, would let him pursue
peace targets without the interference of the parliamentary
politics.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators held several meetings to
keep the current momentum of the peace process after the botched
Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day-long Camp David summit, attended by Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton,
failed to reach any agreement last month.
</P>
<P>
The Likud accuses Barak of making too many concessions in the
talks and is mustering the opposition parties' support to topple
Barak's government in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Likud leader Ariel Sharon met with
former Center party leader Yitzhak Mordechai, who resigned from his
transport portfolio early this year for his involvement in a sexual
harassment scandal and subsequent trials.
</P>
<P>
The two reportedly discussed the possibility of Mordechai's
rejoining the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is also due to meet former Foreign Minister David Levy,
another Likud defector, to induce him back. Levy resigned from
Barak's coalition last Wednesday for their disputes over the
negotiating approaches with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iran Slams U.S. Comment on Majlis Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi here on Tuesday refuted remarks made by a U.S.
official on Iran's recent Majlis (parliament) debates, saying it is
interference in Iran's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials, people and their representatives in the
Majlis are well aware of their country's interests, and foreign
countries must refrain from meddling in Iran's internal affairs,
Asefi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Monday
commented on Iran's recent Majlis brawl over the press law, saying
the moves by Iranian conservatives against press freedom
underscored the country's human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We do have very serious concerns about freedom of expression
and freedom of the press in Iran," Boucher told reporters, adding
that Iran should uphold international human rights standards
including the right to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Sunday ordered the Majlis to cancel a scheduled debate
on amendment to the press law, which sparked a brawl, even physical
scuffling on the Majlis floor.
</P>
<P>
The press law has recently become a focus of Iran's factional
struggle. Reformers dominating the Majlis try to remove the
restrictive clauses in the law, but the conservatives are against
the move, as the law is a powerful tool for them to crack down on
the country's pro-reform press.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary has ordered the closure of some 20
reformist papers and journals in the past few months on the basis
of the press law.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's direct intervention in the press law issue was a
severe setback for reformers, as rewriting the press law was the
first major task they have tried to finish since they started to
control the Majlis on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said as the supreme leader is considered the
highest authority in the country who stands by the conservatives,
such interventions by him will make it very difficult for the
Majlis to help push through President Mohammad Khatami's reform
programs.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's decree on the press law has received great support
from the conservative camp, who have organized large gatherings in
front of the Majlis building since Monday to show support for the
leader and protest any disrespect to the leader's decree by
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people from different walks of life rallied at the
Majlis building Tuesday. The conservative protesters chanted
slogans in support of the leader's order to forgo debates seeking
to amend the press law.
</P>
<P>
"Obeying the leader is a prerequisite for an MP (parliament
member), and disobeying him is tantamount to sacking an MP,"
shouted the protesters, most of whom carrying pictures of supreme
leader Khamenei and the late founder of the Islamic republic,
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that the press law is only a small factor
behind the conservatives' massive offensive against the reformers.
Their real target is the next presidential election, expected to be
held in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
Reform-minded President Khatami has announced that he would seek
reelection next year, but the conservative, who have suffered
humiliating defeats in the 1997 presidential election and
February's parliamentary election, are eager to reverse the trend.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Fuel Prices Reach All-Time Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand said the
prices would go up by 0.3 baht (0.75 U.S. cent) per liter.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the retail price of high octane gasoline has risen
to 16.49 baht (40 cents) per liter and the retail price of diesel
has gone up to 13.59 baht (33 cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand said it was forced to take
the step because of the higher crude prices in world markets,
resulting from the cutback in supply from members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
The price of high octane gasoline in the world market is
currently 37.95 dollars a barrel, while diesel is being sold at 33.
93 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand said it could no longer
shoulder the higher cost when its narrowed oil margin has made it
difficult to sustain operations economically.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the depreciation of the baht has eroded
Thailand's purchasing power. The baht fell to 41.63 against the
dollar on July 26, touching a 10-month low and hovering around 41
against the dollar ever since.
</P>
<P>
Due to higher oil prices, the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand announced it will raise electricity prices starting on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
To contain inflation, the Thai government has decided to freeze
cooking gas prices until the end of the year, saying a rise in the
gas price would affect the public and fuel inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said despite
higher energy prices, inflation is not expected to surpass the
target set by the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's inflation rates have hovered around 1.3 percent in
the first half of this year and are expected to be between only 2
percent and 3 percent for the whole year. The Bank of Thailand has
forecast inflation to stay below 3.5 percent over the next two
years.

Anelka, who began his second spell with PSG with a 37-minute

The French international striker played 10 matches for PSG

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, Sichuan Province, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ma Mingyu
became the first Chinese player to join Italian Serie A as his
Sichuan Quanxing club and the Perugia signed a contract on his
move here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But both sides refused to reveal how much money the contract
involves, citing it was "a secret".
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two clubs fell through on August 3 because
there were "unbridgeable gap in three major principles".
</P>
<P>
The Perugia official who came to China for the talks claimed
that they just wanted to "loan" Ma and would not pay any transfer
fee to Quanxing. It irritated the Sichuan club and the
negotiation broke down.
</P>
<P>
But the official said later that Perugia's president demanded
he take a "more flexible attitude" in future talks with Quanxing,
which was believed to have played a key role for Ma's successful
move.
</P>
<P>
Perugia showed their interest in the 30-year-old Chinese
international after Quanxing launched their pre-season training
camp in Italy. The Italian club sent a fax early in June to start
the talk.

</P>
<P>
Releasing the survey Tuesday, the Census and Statistics
Department of Hong Kong said manufacturers in the printing, and
electronic and electrical products and electrical machinery
industries are more upbeat about their business performance in the
second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
They generally expect some increases in the volume of orders in
the second half of 2000 compared with the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, most of the manufacturers in the wearing
apparel and fabricated metal products industries expect little
change in the volume of orders, while manufacturers in the
textiles industry generally anticipate little change or some
decreases in the volume of orders.
</P>
<P>
In general, manufacturers anticipate capacity utilization to
remain stable in the second half of the year, and profit margins
are, however, forecast to be slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
On export performance, exporters are generally more optimistic
about their business in the second half of 2000 than they were at
the beginning of the year. Bankers are also optimistic about the
trade outlook. They generally expect some increases in the value
of total exports in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
As for construction firms, they generally anticipate some
increases in the volume of construction output in the second half
of 2000 compared with the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey is conducted on a half-yearly basis, covering about
300 firms in the major manufacturing industries, the import/export
trades, the banking industry and the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
It collects views of firms on the short-term prospects of the
various major business sectors covered and aims at providing a
quick reference, with a minimum time lag, for assessing the short-
term future economic performance of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Addresses Nation to Mark End of Iraq-Iran War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
delivered a nation-wide address on Tuesday morning to commemorate
the 12th anniversary of the end of the Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
In his annual "great victory day" speech, Saddam expressed his
highest appreciation for the jihad (or holy war) of the Iraqi
people and Iraqi armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Every year, the eighth of August towers above us like a
splendid moon in the skies of our people and our nation, or like a
morning star that guides those who follow the bright path in a dark
night," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he condemned the Gulf states and other countries for
allowing the United States and Britain to use their bases to bomb
Iraq, calling them "traitors who sold their souls."
</P>
<P>
Ever since December 1998, the U.S. and British warplanes have
been using bases in Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to patrol and
bomb targets in the two so-called no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the zones, which were imposed on the
country after the 1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, and has termed Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as "full
culprits" collaborating with the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Iraqi president also attacked Iraq's enemies,
including Iran, the Gulf states allied with the U.S, as well as
other perceived enemies of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the rhetoric of the speech is seen not as strong as
that of last year, in which Saddam vehemently blasted Iran and
other enemies of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The speech made little reference to the issue of prisoners of
war (POWs), a stumbling block hindering the normalization of the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran has announced it will release some 700 Iraqi POWs later
this week.
</P>
<P>
Iran said in June that it has freed a total of 3,389 Iraqis
since the start of the current Iranian year on March 20. All the
POWs were set free under the supervision of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Iran says it has documents showing that more than 3,000 Iranian
POWs are sill being held in Iraq, while Iraq claims that 9,000 more
Iraqi soldiers are kept in Iranian prisons, apart from almost 20,
000 not registered with the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year-long Iraq-Iran war, which ended on August 8,
1988, claimed some one million lives and caused severe damages to
the two neighbors' economy.

<HEADLINE> Normal Life in Bangladesh Disrupted by Opposition Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Normal life in Bangladesh was
partially disrupted Tuesday due to a half-day countrywide general
strike called by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In the capital, offices, schools and financial institutions
were shut down during the seven-hour strike from six in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
Most vehicles were off the roads during the strike hours, but
some government-owned public buses and some private transport were
seen plying in the streets. paddle rickshaws rolled as usual in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had no reports of violence during Tuesday's
strike which was called by the opposition to protest the foiling
of their planned rally and procession by police on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance had earlier withdrawn a scheduled dawn-
to-dusk general strike on Sunday on grounds of outbreak of dengue
fever in the capital and different parts of the country. Then it
planned to hold a joint rally in the capital and bring out a
procession on the day to protest the government's failure to check
the disease.
</P>
<P>
But police attacked the rally shortly after it began and foiled
it by firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets. Nearly 30
opposition activists received serious injury.

ROME, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Juventus' French midfielder Zinedine

weather he will get a coaching or a management job in Atlanta,"
said Davis, a former New York Knicks player.

member, ranks eighth all-time on the NBA's scoring list (26,668),

<HEADLINE> China's First SOE Closed Down for Pollution (Details Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shenyang Intermediate People
's Court today declared bankruptcy of Shenyang Smeltery, one of
the leading pollutant makers in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China shut down an ultra-large
state-owned enterprise (SOE) on account of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which discharged 42 percent of sulfur dioxide in
Shenyang, reduced its normal production in May. Its three funnels,
which gushed hazardous gas all day long, ceased operation at the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuying, a resident who lives near the factory for more
than 20 years, said with pleasure, "We can breeze some fresh air
from now on."
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1936, the Shenyang Smeltery was among China's top 500
SOEs in the 1980's. Its gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc
production used to lead the country at that time.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the factory discharged large quantities of waste
residue, water and dust, which caused great harm to the health of
local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the local environmental protection department, the
factory discharged into the air 74,000 tons of sulfur, dioxide and
66.8 tons of heavy metal each year, polluting 50 square kilometers
of the city, making up one fourth of the total area of this major
industrial in north China.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the Shenyang City People's Congress, Liaoning
Provincial People's Congress and National People's Congress time
and again appealed for a solution to the pollution of the plant,
and the issue finally aroused great concern of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
As the factory runs at a loss and produces heavy pollution, the
State Council, China's highest governing body, approved a decision
to gradually reduce its production until its operation was finally
suspended.
</P>
<P>
When the bankruptcy was announced at a mass rally this morning,
an official of the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court also
pronounced a proper arrangement for more than 10,000 workers
serving the factory for decades.
</P>
<P>
Meng Fanguang, a 47-year-old worker, said, "The closure of the
factory is a bad news for me and my colleagues, but it's great for
most of the citizens in Shenyang."
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, once known as one of the top ten most polluted cities
in the world several years ago, has attached great importance to
the improvement of its environment in recent years. Last year, it
was listed by the United Nations as a pilot city for sustainable
development.

BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's first special

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. presidential candidate Al Gore's choice of a Jewish
running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, is being
greeted with rave reviews by Democrats and Republicans alike. They
say the selection shatters a historic barrier and will boost Gore's
chances in the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in American history that a Jew has run on a
major party ticket for the vice presidency. Lieberman, 58, is a
two-team senator widely regarded as a moral and political leader in
the Senate, and also one of the most conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
There was no official reaction here on the announcement, but
politicians across the spectrum noted Monday that he is a strong
friend of Israel, and even has family here.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The police national fraud investigation unit Monday
recommended to the State Attorney's Office that Kiryat Malachi
mayor Lior Katsav, the brother of newly-elected President Moshe
Katsav, be placed on trial on suspicion of perpetrating election
fraud.
</P>
<P>
In a terse statement, the President's Office said this was a
private matter relating to the president's brother and that the
president would not become involved.
</P>
<P>
The police suspect that in the 1998 municipal elections, Katsav,
who was running for mayor of the northern Negev city of Kiryat
Malachi, promised to appoint a rival candidate to a senior post in
the municipality if he withdrew from the race.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A day after formally taking over the foreign ministry from
David Levy, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday gently showed
Director-General Eytan Bentsur the door and also recalled
ambassadors considered close to Levy.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of Bentsur's departure came just hours after
Barak met with the ministry's top staff. The timing led to
speculation that Barak dismissed Bentsur.
</P>
<P>
Bentsur is a career diplomat considered close to Levy, and
became the director-general when Levy took over the ministry under
Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996. Veteran diplomat Alon Lier will replace
Bentsur.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Shai Green, a 28-year-old reserve soldier from Herzliya was
killed Monday when a hand grenade exploded during a training
exercise at the Tze'elim base in the Negev, another reservist was
wounded in the blast.
</P>
<P>
An Israel Defense Force commission of inquiry is examining two
main causes: a technical defect in the grenade or human error.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was the first fatal accident at the huge base
since 1992 and Green was the third soldier to be killed in training
accidents this year.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Underway to Bring Cyprus Female Drug Suspect Back From Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Efforts are continuing to bring a
Cyprus woman from Egypt to Cyprus to stand trial on suspicion of
smuggling drugs, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 19-year-old Maria Antoniadou, who is being
held in Egypt's Port Said, are holding meetings with Cyprus
officials to ask help on the issue, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Antoniadou was arrested by Egyptian police on July 25 for
carrying 3.5 kilograms of "bango", a cheap, low-grade variety of
marijuana popular in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the drugs concealed in a secret
compartment in her suitcase.
</P>
<P>
Antoniadou's lawyer Iacovos Avraamides and her mother met Monday
with Presidential Undersecretary Pantelis Kouros in a bid to bring
her back for trial instead of in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Avraamides is due to have a meeting with Attorney-General
Alecos Markides on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the government is doing all it can, taking
all the measures and actions it can," said the lawyer, expressing
hope that President Glafcos Clerides himself would make personal
effort on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was too early to say whether he was optimistic
about his client being sent back to stand trial in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general said Monday that Cyprus has two criminal
conventions with Egypt and that he would examine the issue in
depth.
</P>
<P>
Security officials in Port Said have said that Antoniadou could
face death penalty if convicted in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has had a tough policy on drug-related crimes for the past
decade, with capital punishment as the maximum sentence for drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer last week expressed concern at conditions in
Egyptian jails, and at the severity of sentencing in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Even if she is guilty, even if she were a courier, can the
Cypriot people accept the possibility that this girl will go to
prison for 20 years for something like that?" he said.

CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- World-leading air conditioner producer Daikin has
decided to engage in a co-production deal with its Turkish
distributor Teba, reported Anatolia News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Technicians from Daikin will tour Teba factories soon, head of
the Teba group Mustafa Baygan said.
</P>
<P>
"Teba factories have technically compatible infrastructures and
are located in free trade zones, which make Turkey a production
point in the area covering Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa,
Russia and the Central Asian republics."
</P>
<P>
He added that an alliance with Daikin for the production of both
industrial-type and split air conditioners may emerge soon. Teba
holds 20 percent of Turkey's air conditioner market and plans to
increase sales from 40,000 to 75,000 units.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 2.3 million tourists visited Egypt between January
and May this year, a report released by the Ministry of Economy and
Foreign Trade said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tourists spent a total of 13.74 million nights while staying
in Egypt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that more than 400,000 tourists traveled to Egypt in
May, including 320,000 from Europe, 40,000 from Middle East
countries, over 30,000 from North America, East and South Asia, and
the rest from other regions.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's cotton output in the 2000-2001 harvest season
is expected to be in the range of 759,000 to 760,000 tons, reported
Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cotton output from the 1999-2000 harvest totaled 899,000 tons,
against consumption of 1.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Although output is expected to fall, cotton imports in the
2000-2001 harvest season are expected to remain in the traditional
range of 300,000-400,000 tons," said a senior official from the
Chamber of Commerce in Izmir, southwest of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The official said that more accurate figures for cotton output
would come in September, adding that given the increased cost of
production, producers' demands for a floor purchase price above
500,000 Turkish Liras (about 0.8 U.S. dollar) are reasonable.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Sural Su A.S., a leading potable water producer in
Turkey, has begun to export water to Israel from Antalya Port on
the Mediterranean coast, reported Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sural Su A.S. Executive Board Chairman Suleyman Sural told
reporters Monday that they used to export water to Israel from
Mersin Port, to the east of Antalya.
</P>
<P>
He said that bottled water had been shipped to Israel on five
containers from Antalya Port.
</P>
<P>
The company has exported 1,200 tons of water to Israel since the
beginning of 2000 and the water sale to Israel is expected to
increase by three to four folds in 2001.

<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
downplayed Tuesday the call of some lawmakers for Secretary Robert
Aventajado, who chairs the flagship projects committee and heads
the government panel negotiating for the safe releases of the Sulu
hostages, to select only one post.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that there is no need to compel Aventajado to choose, as his role
as chief negotiator is a temporary appointment.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that call is necessary. It is clear that
Aventajado's permanent position is in the flagship projects
committee," Zamora said.

<P>
He said Aventajado is based in Manila and goes only
occasionally to Zamboanga or Sulu to hold negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, in a separate radio interview, said his office
merely coordinates the implementation of flagship projects and
does not hold the budget for such projects.
</P>
<P>
He added that he does not receive additional compensation for
his role as government chief negotiator. President Joseph Estrada
appointed Aventajado in May as head of the panel tasked to
negotiate with the Abu Sayyaf for the release of the hostages in
Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"We don't hold the budget. We merely coordinate the
implementation of the flagship projects," Aventajado said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Ending Hostage Standoff in 1-2 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
expressed confidence anew Tuesday that the hostage crisis in Jolo
will be over in "one to two weeks," as the negotiation process for
the release of the captives has been "simplified."
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
President Joseph Estrada has received an assurance from chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado that the hostages may be
released by then.
</P>
<P>
"This is temporary. We have been assured that this will be
finished in one to two weeks," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, in a series of radio interviews, said he has
simplified the negotiation process with Ghalib Andang (Commander
Robot), and has done away with "go-betweens" who may delay the
talks.
</P>
<P>
He said he now talks directly with Andang using his cellular
phone, while Andang uses a satellite phone to communicate with
Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
"We simplified the process. I believe we can reach an agreement
because we now have fewer areas of differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the administration's no-ransom policy, Zamora said
that the government could not control interested parties that
insist on paying ransom for the release of the hostages,
particularly "foreign individuals, agencies and governments."
</P>
<P>
"They find a way to pay ransom. But definitely this is without
the Philippine government's consent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Formally Charged With Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto was formally charged with corruption here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors handed over two boxes and a suitcase filled with
documents to the South Jakarta District Court.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto has been charged with corruption. If he is found
guilty, he can be imprisoned for 20 years or life," state attorney
Umbu Laga Lozara told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 79, is accused of having misused 1.4 trillion rupiah
(150 million U.S. dollars) and 416 million U.S. dollars of state
funds, allegedly amassed through his seven tax-free charitable
foundations.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta District Court chief judge, Lalu Mariyun,
told reporters that the trial will start before the end of August.
</P>
<P>
He said five judges will preside over the trial that will see
130 witnesses called.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down from his office on May 21,
1998, following the worst economic and political crisis and chaos
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of abusing of power and authority during his 32-
year in power. He has been put under house arrest and has
undergone several investigations by prosecutors from the Attorney
General's Office (AGO).
</P>
<P>
The AGO declared Soeharto as a defendant in corruption case
last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Angola Vows to Eliminate Lepra by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government is
determined to eliminate lepra as one of the most dangerous skin
diseases threatening public health in Angola, the country's
National Program of Combating Lepra (PNCL) has said.
</P>
<P>
The government is engaged in the wipe-out of lepra by 2005,
said PNCL director Conceicao Palma on Monday in Sumbe, capital
city of the central coast Kwanza-sul province, where he attended
the third regional meeting on the control of lepra.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the international and the Angolan
communities to do more and take more effective measures in the
drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, there are 18 lepra hospitals around
the country, but due to the long-term civil war, the government
can only control 40 percent of the hospitals which usually locate
far from the cities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Angola has 7,200 lepra victims among a
population of 12 million, 17 percent of the patients have suffered
grave physical deformation and incapacity when they go to hospital
for help.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a serious epidemiological situation, aggravated
by the operational factors such as the difficult access to the
patients living in distant areas," Palma said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Triples in Tanzania Within Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in
Tanzania in the first half of this year has nearly tripled the
amount a year ago despite decrease in the number of new projects.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 projects with a combined capital of about 694
million U.S. dollars were established by foreign investors in
Tanzania in the first half of this year, compared with 100
projects worth about 250 million dollars in the same period last
year, the local African newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Naiko, Investment Promotion Director of the Tanzania
Investment Center (TIC), was quoted as saying that investors have
shown great confidence in Tanzania's political climate.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign investment to the country this year is set to
outstrip that for the previous year "by far" despite the coming
general elections, he said, attributing the vibrant growth of
investment to the streamlined investment procedures in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It now takes investors an average of 14 days to secure
business registration and to accomplish all immigration
requirements compared with between three and four months taken
before these formalities were brought under the TIC," Naiko
explained.
</P>
<P>
The new TIC offices, inaugurated last April, brings under one
roof officers from the Tanzania Revenue Authority, immigration
department, the ministries of labor and lands, business registrar
and business licensing departments.
</P>
<P>
According to Naiko, gold mining took the lion share of the
direct foreign investment, followed by the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Many investors put their money into commercial farming,
horticulture, floriculture and establishing irrigation schemes, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Albania's Economy Returns to Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Albania has been making progress
in stabilizing its economy and improving people's living standards
since an unrest-caused crisis three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fraud of illegal fund-raising that caused an armed riot in
1997 had pushed the country's economy to the brink of collapse.
The then Albanian coalition government led by the Socialist Party
had taken several measures to recover its economy.
</P>
<P>
The stability measures included strengthening public security,
introducing economic restructuring, attracting foreign assistance,
expanding labor exports and punishing corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures of the Ministry of Economy and
Privatization, seven industrial sectors made a profit of 978
million lek ( about 6.9 million U.S. dollars) in the first half
this year, 7.3 percent more than previously planned and 20.6
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The metallurgic industry earned 446 million dollars while the
oil industry produced 81,400 tons of oil. Improvement has been
recorded in other sectors such as chromite, construction, timber
and food.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the agricultural output has accounted for half of the
gross national product due to the expanded government investment.
The wheat production this year, both in the yield of per unit area
and gross output, went up from last year. The milk and eggs have
met 95 percent and 90 percent of the domestic demand, respectively,
with some of them exported abroad.
</P>
<P>
After studying Albania's economic situation, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded in July that the overall
performance of the country's economy was satisfactory and the
structural reform has been brought back on track. The current
inflation rate was close to zero and the economy grew at a rate of
seven percent. In contrast, the inflation rate was soaring at 42
percent in 1997 and the annual economic growth rate was negative
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's tax income increased 33 percent in the first half
of this year, and more foreign businessmen have invested in the
mining and fertilizer sectors.
</P>
<P>
While the economy remained stable, the people's living
conditions have been improved with a raise of 10 percent and 15
percent separately in wages and pensions from July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, it takes time for Albania to recover its economy to
the level of 1989 as the official unemployment rate still lingered
at 17 percent, while local media put the figure at 40 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo
in thin trading Tuesday, with investors selling to adjust their
positions following Monday's sharp gains.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 182.60 points, or 1.14
percent from Monday's close to end at 15,820.11.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 8.24 points or 0.56 percent to 1,468.
62.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 478.99 million shares
from Monday's 442.27 million shares, but trading remained inactive
due to the summer holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Construction firm Kumagai Gumi was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell in 23 of the 33 business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Losers included the insurance, warehousing and mining sectors,
while the rubber, wholesale and brokerage sectors drew buying.
</P>
<P>
Information and technology issues closed mixed, while some
construction firms were boosted by a report that three main
creditor banks of ailing Hazama Corp. have agreed to waive some of
their loans.
</P>
<P>
Monday's comments by Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Masaru Hayami
suggesting the central bank may end its zero-interest-rate policy
have thrown cold water on the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers exceeded
gainers 773 to 456, with 174 issues remaining unchanged.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:

<HEADLINE> Swiss Scientists Discover Five New Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Astronomers based in the Swiss
city of Geneva have discovered five new planets outside the solar
system, according to a Swiss Radio International report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The planets cannot be seen directly but were detected by the
gravitational pull they exert on their host stars. The planets
were detected with Switzerland's 1.2-meter Leonhard Euler
Telescope in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The most significant discovery concerns one planet, named HD
83443c. It is the lightest planet ever discovered outside the
solar system, with a mass roughly half that of Saturn. It is also
only the second planet ever found which is part of a multi-planet
system.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries, formally announced on Monday, were made by a
team of astronomers from the Geneva observatory. They found the
planets after examining information gathered by the La Silla
Observatory in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Because planets produce no light of their own, they can only be
detected by the gravitational pull they exert on the stars they
orbit. Measurements of the minute effects planets have on their
host stars allows astronomers to calculate a planet's orbit as
well as its mass.
</P>
<P>
So far around 50 extra-solar planets have been discovered, but
because they can only be detected by the effect they have on their
stars, all are far bigger than Earth, and most are the size of
Saturn or larger.
</P>
<P>
Such planets are almost certainly composed mainly of gas, with
a rocky core. Like the gas giants of the solar system, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, they are unlikely to be unable to
support life.
</P>
<P>
The planet HD 83443c circles the star HD 83443, along with two
Saturn-sized gas giants. The system is 141 light years from our
Sun and lies in the Vela constellation.

<HEADLINE> UBS Admits Predecessor Profiting from Nazi Slave Labor During World War Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, Switzerland's
biggest bank UBS has admitted that its predecessor benefited from
Nazi slave labor during World War Two.
</P>
<P>
UBS spokesman Michael Willi was quoted by Swiss Radio
International as confirming that the Swiss Bank Corporation, one
of two banks that merged in 1998 to create UBS, had held a
majority stake in a holding firm which itself had a majority share
in the Golleschauer cement factory in Poland.
</P>
<P>
He said the factory was forcibly taken into Nazi administration
when Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and that documents in
Berlin proved that the cement works used slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
The UBS spokesman did not give an exact figure for the number
of people involved but it is claimed that at least 400 prisoners
from the nearby Auschwitz concentration camp were forced to work
at the factory.
</P>
<P>
Last week, UBS along with Switzerland's second biggest bank,
Credit Suisse, formally approved the 1.25 billion-dollar global
settlement aimed at ending the long-running dispute over Holocaust
assets.
</P>
<P>
A US judge has given Swiss companies which benefited from slave
labor until August 25 to decide whether they want to be part of
the deal. If they agree, they will be free from the threat of
legal action.
</P>
<P>
Willi said any use of slave labor involving the banks is
already covered under the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Textile Sector Earns 10-Billion-Yuan Profit in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's textile sector earned a
net profit of 10.7 billion yuan (1.47 billion US dollars) in the
first half of the year, 7.4 billion yuan more than the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
State-owned textile enterprises performed better, earning 2.4
billion yuan during the January-June period, while those in the
red reduced losses by 1.7 billion yuan on a year-on-year basis,
down 44 percent, according to the State Administration of Textile
Industry.
</P>
<P>
The combined and added industrial value, the sales volume of
the State-owned textile industry in 42 large and medium-sized
cities nationwide improved considerably, coming close to the
average level of the country's State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, profits earned in western and central China were much
lower than those earned in the east of the country. Of the 31
provinces and cities, 10 were in the red, nine of which were in
the western and central China. Their losses accounted for more
than 80 percent of the sector's total.
</P>
<P>
Profits earned in various industries in the textile sector
differed considerably, with garment, cotton textile and chemical
fiber earning 3.1 billion, 3 billion and 2.6 billion yuan
respectively, far better than other industries.
</P>
<P>
Non State-owned enterprises earned more than the State-owned
companies, with a sales ratio standing at 7 to 3, and a profit
ratio of 8 to 2.

<HEADLINE> Brake Fluid Quality Low: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Only 17.9 percent of brake fluid
on the market and 45.9 percent produced by big-name manufacturers
were up to the State standard, according to today's Guangming
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The results came from a recent sampling survey, which was
conducted by the State Bureau of Technological Supervision.
</P>
<P>
A total of 61 kinds of brake fluid producers and 39 sold by 31
distributing outlets were chosen for the test by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
China began to implement a new set of criterion on brake fluid
about a year ago. However, quite a lot of brake fluid on the
market was still produced according to the old standard.
</P>
<P>
At present, only about 50 manufacturers produce brake fluid
strictly according to the State criterion, including Oil Refinery
of Wuxi, Donghua Chemical Plant of Tianjin and Xi'an Petrochemical
Plant.
</P>
<P>
The overall quality of brake fluid was further brought down by
low-cost imitations that flooded the market, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of the Fifth Beijing
Book Festival are busily preparing for the coming grand "book-
lovers' holiday".
</P>
<P>
"The preparation has been basically completed," said an
organizer of the 11-day book fair, which will start on September 8.
"The festival is ready to open."
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 varieties of books, newspapers, magazines and
video-audio products will be on for sale and business
representatives marketing these items are flocking into Beijing
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
The main trade venue during the festival will be located at the
Beijing Working People's Palace of Culture, while smaller sales
transactions will take place at about 100 bookstores in Beijing's
18 districts and counties.
</P>
<P>
The biennial festival has been gaining more and more popularity.
Over 2.33 million books worth 20 million yuan were sold at the
last festival, which attracted over 50,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
"Over 90 percent of the books were bought by individuals. That
reflects that the demand for cultural products is on the rise,"
some experts at the festival said.
</P>
<P>
Many new items have been added to this year's exhibition list.
While traditional book sales dominate the fair, purchases can also
now be made on-line.

<HEADLINE> Green Food Industry Enjoy Bright Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's relatively young green
food industry will thrive in the 21st century as people begin to
care more about their nutrition and health.
</P>
<P>
Although its prices are about 20 percent higher than
traditional food, green food sales in the country are expected to
grow and reach 20 billion yuan in the next several years,
according to the Guanming Daily.
</P>
<P>
As a new industry, green food has been noted for its natural
processing, production that does not emit pollutants and strict
quality control.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 1,000 kinds of food have been categorized as green
across the country, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As one of the pioneers of the green food industry, Shanghai
produces only about 280,000 tons of green food a year, which
accounts for 0.6 percent of the city's food consumption.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that over 80 percent of Shanghai
residents hope to shift their consumption to green food, and some
70 percent said they were unsatisfied with the variety and supply
of green food.

<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China will take substantial
measures against geological disasters, so as to enhance the
country's abilities to prevent such calamities and minimize
possible losses, said Sun Wensheng, a vice minister of Land and
Resources.
</P>
<P>
As of July 15, China experienced a series of such calamities
this year, resulting in 555 deaths, said Sun at today's national
teleconference on the prevention and control of geological
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Before the arrival of the flood season, the ministry sent six
work teams to key areas to make sure that all necessary
preparations were in place, Sun said. Land and resources
departments had the task of monitoring and forecasting potential
disasters.
</P>
<P>
The efforts made by these departments have saved the life of at
least 2,000 people, said Sun. Special attention should be paid to
the Yellow River and Huai River areas which often witness mudflows
and landslides, Sun added.
</P>
<P>
He urged local land and resources departments to check places
vulnerable to potential geological disasters, strengthen
cooperation with meteorological departments, set up grassroots
monitoring networks, and enhance public awareness of such
potential disasters.

the 12th anniversary of the end of the Iraq-Iran war.
</P>

morning star that guides those who follow the bright path in a dark
night," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he criticized the Gulf states and other countries for
allowing the U.S. and Britain to use their bases to bomb Iraq,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Recognize Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
recognize the Palestinian statehood if Palestine decides to
proceed with it, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is only a technical matter," he told reporters after
meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid at the Merdeka Palace
here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will very soon leave for a number of Gulf
countries and meet with their leaders to convey the president's
ideas.
</P>
<P>
"He has asked me to meet with (Palestinian leader) Yassir
Arafat, (Jordan's) King Abdullah, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Syrian President (Bashar Al-Assad)," Alwi said.
</P>
<P>
The president wants to communicate with leaders of Middle
Eastern countries to share some of his ideas on the Mideast peace
process, Alwi said, adding that Wahid's ideas are related to
Palestine's plan to declare the establishment of the Palestinian
state on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that basically, the president is urging
every party involved in the peace process to give priority to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If it is possible, Gus Dur (as the president is widely known)
expects the parties to find a way to achieve peace before (
Palestine makes) the declaration," Alwi added.
</P>
<P>
The president will promote his ideas in the international forum
because Indonesia is the world's biggest Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
"We (Indonesia) should play a big role," Alwi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Alwi's visit to the Middle East will be part of an overseas
trip that will also take him to the United States, France and the
Netherlands starting on August 30.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Slips vs. U.S. Dollar in Early Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso was traded
lower against the U.S. dollar early Tuesday amid the Philippine
Central Bank's (PCB's) decision to further reduce overnight
borrowing rates.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 44.899, weaker compared to Monday's close of
44.845.
</P>
<P>
On June 26, the PCB has adopted a three-tiered scheme for its
overnight borrowing facility, where it effectively cut its
overnight borrowing rate from a uniform rate of 10 percent. Since
then, the PCB pays 10 percent for the first five billion pesos
placed overnight, 8.5 percent for the next five billion pesos and
7 percent for those in excess of 10 billion pesos (250 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said the peso is not likely to touch the level
of 45 pesos against one dollar. The peso was traded within a thin
band of 44.960 and 44.840.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Three foreign private companies
have been awarded the tender to supply 105 megawatts of
electricity to ease the current power crisis in Kenya, which began
last September.
</P>
<P>
The British company Aggreko is expected to start generation by
September 1, and the other two, Cummins and Deutz, should be on
the stream by the third week of October, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current power rationing program will soon be reviewed once
the additional power supply arrives, said Kenyan Finance Minister
Chris Okemo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After 11 months of power rationing, industry now has to deal
with 32 hours of power a week and private homes with between six
to 12 hours of electricity per day.
</P>
<P>
In the past, 90 percent of power supply was provided by the
KenGen, a state-owned company and the rest 10 percent came from
independent power producers.
</P>
<P>
After the arrival of the three foreign companies, the
percentage of power supply by Kenya's state-owned company is
expected to drop to about 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> 104-Year-Old Refugee Calls for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A 104-year-old Angolan refugee in
Zambia has called for peace in Angola, a Zambian newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Silver Kawanda, with his seventy-year-old wife Paulina Chivela,
is among the more than 10,000 refugees who entered Zambia from
Jamba, the stronghold of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), where fighting between UNITA and
the government troops broke out in January this year.
</P>
<P>
"We want immediate restoration of peace in Angola," he was
quoted by The Post newspaper as saying at the Nangweshi refugee
camp in Zambia's Western Province last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The old man, flanked by his wife, recounted how on January 4 he
had the worst experience in his 104 years when Jamba was bombed,
forcing many villagers to flee.
</P>
<P>
"We walked for four days before we got to the Zambia border. It
was very touching seeing unaccompanied children running for safety,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Kawanda said he had left all his belongings behind but was
concerned about the safety of his 11 children who are now in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
According to Nangweshi refugee camp manager Hussein Yussuf,
Angolan refugees are continuing to enter Zambia through the border
areas of Western Province.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest arrivals of mainly children and women had
raised the number of refugees to 10,382 since the camp was
established on January 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The influx is not as massive as it used to be," he said. "The
majority of our refugees are children and women, forming 80
percent of the total population."
</P>
<P>
He said food supplies are currently not enough for the 3,600
families in the camp.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC Summit Meeting Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Yue
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The two-day summit attended
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of
state ended in Windhoek, Namibia, on Monday evening with fruitful
results.
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable achievement during the summit was that the
participants gave a green light for the revised SADC Free Trade
Agreement to be implemented on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol, initially agreed by SADC member countries
in 1996, envisages that 85 percent of intra-SADC trade will be
liberalized by 2008 and the remaining 15 percent will be tariff-
free by 2012.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the trade deal, South Africa and its partners in
Southern African Customs Union, namely Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho
and Swaziland, will open their markets faster than the rest of the
SADC.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, regarded as a significant drive towards economic
integration in the southern African region, will also enhance the
SADC's ability to attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
SADC, which was established in August 1992 on the basis of the
former Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference, now
has become a 14-nation regional bloc, including Angola, Botswana,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the DRC, Seychelles and Zambia will be temporarily
excluded from the trade agreement implementation group because
Angola, the DRC and Seychelles have yet to sign the trade
agreement while Zambia has signed but not ratified it.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC Executive Secretariat expressed the hope that
the four member states will be integrated into the free trade
agreement by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders also joined the voice in calling on the
developed world to pay greater attention to the poor African
countries' heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
As outgoing SADC Chairman and Mozambican President Joachim
Chissano mentioned at the opening ceremony of the summit on Sunday
that five SADC member countries, namely Mozambique, Angola, Zambia,
Tanzania and Malawi, are facing acute debt problems.
</P>
<P>
"Improved economic prospects can only come into reality in the
SADC countries, in Africa and in the developing world at large if
the current economically debilitating debt is forgiven in its
totality," Chissano emphasized.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the SADC leaders also discussed the
deteriorating AIDS situation in southern Africa, the worst hit
region by the fatal disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed on a multi-sectoral approach to fight the
spread of the AIDS epidemic and reached a consensus that the
western pharmaceutical companies should offer cheaper anti-AIDS
drugs to SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants' discussion also centered on the conflict in
the DRC. It is notable that the SADC leaders' efforts to push
forward the peace process were shadowed by President of the DRC
Laurent Kabila's absence at the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC leaders still decided to hold a special
meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, on August 14 to discuss ways to end the
two-year conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the SADC heads of state also expressed their
full support for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's land reform.
</P>
<P>
The summit elected Namibian President Sam Nujoma as new
Chairman of the SADC.

<HEADLINE> German Public Figures Call for Strikes at Right-wing Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- German public figures have urged
harsher campaigns against neo-Nazi and far-right extremists for
their violence.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, 760 crimes occurred
throughout the country involving 838 extremists, the newspaper
Bild reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, only 31 warrants were issued for their arrests, with
the remaining 807 extremists acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Under such grim circumstances, public figures have urged the
government to take more effective measures to crack down on
extremist crimes.
</P>
<P>
Konrad Freiberg, vice-chairman of the Police Union, said Monday
to the Southwest Radio that cross-state cooperation should be
strengthened to effectively suppress extremist crimes, and that
all data related to neo-Nazi and far-right extremists should be
kept in a data base and made available to all states.
</P>
<P>
Michel Friedman, vice-chairman of the Central Council of Jews
in Germany (CCJ), believed that fighting against xenophobic
attacks should be "the top socio-political issue in the months to
come," adding that the most urgent task is to deal with the
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Monday that the
government will cooperate with the CCJ to launch an all-German
initiative for collecting comments and ideas on hitting at the
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said a nationwide campaign will be started in
late September in Berlin for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Heye suggested that all the buses and trolleys should be
equipped with an alarm system connected with the police, through
which the vehicle can get assistance from the nearest patrolling
police car through code.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union called
on strengthening teen-age education and preventing the extremists
from holding demonstrations and parades.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Green
Party, and Christian Social Union (CSU) also expressed support for
taking tougher measures against the far-right extremists.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Cuts More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- United Airlines, the biggest
airlines in the world, canceled more than 245 flights on Monday by
late afternoon, bringing its total cancellations to nearly 600
during the past three days, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, the company already canceled about 350
flights a day out of 2,400 daily flights. The bulk of the
cancellations have been at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
a key connecting hub for United and its chief rival, American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Even though United Airlines partly blamed weather problems,
American Airlines, which is nearly as large as United Airlines,
canceled only 40 flights a day on Saturday and Sunday systemwide,
its spokesman John Hotard said.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the fact, industry sources believe, is
that United Airlines' pilots have refused to work overtime since
their contract expired in April and have increasingly been calling
in sick.
</P>
<P>
The sticking points are job security, flight assignments,
salary and benefits, the sources added. Negotiations between the
two sides became more complicated when United Airlines announced
earlier this year that it planned to acquire US Airways, the No. 6
U.S. carrier.
</P>
<P>
Both United Airlines and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA),
which represents its 10,000 pilots, have said they hope to have a
deal by November. They are meeting five days a week, with help
from the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
At stake, in part, is the success of United Airlines' plan to
buy US Airways Group Inc., which would give it more than a quarter
of the U.S. air travel market. ALPA has said it is opposed to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasons, United Airlines ranked last among top 10
U.S. airlines in on-time arrivals in May, the most recent month
for which Department of Transportation data is available, with
only 57 percent of its flights arriving on time.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources noted that flight cancellations and delays are
becoming routine for United Airlines this summer, a result of
stormy weather and stormier relations between the world's largest
airline and its pilots.
</P>
<P>
Wedged in the middle are travelers, who can almost bank on
spending more time sitting around airports or on runways.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Actors Take to Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of actors Monday
went on a protest march and gathered at the Hollywood Palladium on
Sunset Boulevard in the 15th week of a strike against the
advertising industry.
</P>
<P>
"They need to get back to the negotiating table," actor Richard
Crenna said, criticizing the industry's wage proposals so far as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Federal mediators' efforts to restart talks last month between
the union representing 135,000 actors and the advertising industry
had failed.
</P>
<P>
The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) want to have the industry's
compensation structure changed to give actors "pay-per-play"
residual incomes for both network and cable TV commercials.
Advertisers want to pay flat fees for both.
</P>
<P>
According to the advertising industry, advertising production
during the strike that began on May 1 has basically remained
normal with the use of nonunion performers.

<HEADLINE> Boon for Patients Suffering Penis Deformity, Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical professor from
central China's Hubei Province has successfully treated 1,593 men,
including 36 foreigners, suffering from penis deformity and damage
over the past 15 years and helped them regain their sexual
virility through surgical procedure developed by him.
</P>
<P>
Long Daochou, professor with the Plastic Surgery Department of
Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, explained the key part of his
surgical procedure is to prolong the spongiose part of the male
urethra by cutting the suspensory ligament to keep normal blood
vessels and nerves function so that the penis can have feeling and
respond normally upon sexual arousal.
</P>
<P>
Long has initiated 11 national training courses to inform other
medical professionals about his surgical technique and was invited
to give lectures about it in several countries including Japan,
the United States and Canada in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen medical doctors from overseas visited Long to study his
surgical technique, which won first prize for scientific progress
in Hubei Province last year.
</P>
<P>
The group of medical specialists believe that with Long's
technique an operation dealing with penis deformity or damage is
safe and easy to popularize, and patients spend less and suffer
less, and so far Long's technique is the best method of doing this.
The technique is also named after Long.
</P>
<P>
For his work in this area, Long was recently given the second
state prize along with 27 other items of technologies and
inventions for scientific progress and inventions in China.

<HEADLINE> A Senior Official in Tibet Is An Internet Surfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QAMDO (Tibet), August 8 (Xinhua) -- He is not only a senior
government official in the Tibet Autonomous Region, southwest
China, he is also one of the more than 16 million Chinese Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
Yang Song, vice-president of the regional government, usually
surfs on the net for more than one hour before going to bed every
night. During weekends and public holidays, he often stays on the
net for two to three hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in all the information about the development of
the western region and all matters relating to Tibet," Yang said,
adding that "I can get many information and materials in this
regard on the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Yang started surfing the Internet life as early as 1997 when he
studied at the Party School of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee in Beijing. He remembers clearly that the first
article he read on the net was a discussion about a popular film
at that time.
</P>
<P>
Since there was no Internet service in Lhasa, the regional
capital, Yang could only browse on the Internet when he was on
business trips in the less technologically developed areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
"I should have been engaged in science and technology. I love
natural science and all of the new things," said Yang, who is
concurrently the secretary of the Qamdo Prefectural Committee of
the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 50, is a 1976 graduate from the physics department of
Xinjiang University. He worked in Ali Prefecture in Tibet for 15
years (1976-1991).
</P>
<P>
"Qamdo Today," an idea Yang came up with, is the first website
in Tibet. It was launched in November of last year. At the same
time, the telecommunications department also opened "163" Internet
service, and Yang became one of the first Internet users in Qamdo
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He has bought a new computer and keeps in contact with his
friends through e-mails.
</P>
<P>
"I get the latest information mainly through the Internet,"
said Yang. "Because of where I live, the newspapers I get are old
news by the time they reach me."
</P>
<P>
Qamdo, which means the "eastern gate of Tibet," is located in
the area irrigated by the Lancang, Nujiang and Jinsha rivers, with
high mountains and deep valleys.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet helps me with a lot with my work," said Yang.
However, he also complains that it takes him too long to connect
to the Internet, because the bandwidth is narrow and it is too
crowded on the net.
</P>
<P>
Qamdo now has more than 100 Internet users, and only three of
them are allowed to surf on the Internet at the same time due to
local conditions.

<HEADLINE> Price of Xinjiang's Botany Wools Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The price of botany wool produced
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region edged up
markedly compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
At a recent auction held in Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, more than 560 tons of quality botany wool was
sold for 17.7 yuan (2.13 U.S. dollars) per kilogram, with the
highest standing at 26.6 yuan, much higher than last year's price
of 11 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is the biggest botany wool producer in China and its
annual output stands at 15,000 tons, some 4,000 tons are thinner
than 21 microns.
</P>
<P>
China has been is a major importer of Australian botany wool.
However, Zhang Jici, an official with the Xinjiang Association for
Botany Wools Producers, said he is confident that the Xinjiang
botany wool will be able to compete with Australia's so long as
its quality keep improving and quantity continues to increase.
</P>
<P>
The Gongnaisi Breeding Sheep Farm, the biggest in Xinjiang,
sold only 25 breeding sheep last year, but so far this year, the
farm has sold 800 of its breeding sheep as a result of the price
increase for the botany wool.
</P>
<P>
Zhang predicted that the price of Xinjiang botany wool will
continue to rise and will become an important factor which affects
the price of Australian botany wool.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Museum in Ancient Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANSHUI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese relic experts are
planning to build a museum of a aboriginal civilization on a 8,000-
year-old site of ancient relics, located along the "Silk Road" in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The Dadiwan New Stone Age Site in Qin'an County in Gansu
Province provides relics dating back 7,800 to 4,800 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to build a museum to put on display more than
100,000 pieces of cultural relics unearthed in Dadiwan. We will
also attempt to rebuild a primitive village and show the life
style of our Chinese ancestors," said Li Peisong, subprefect of
the county.
</P>
<P>
He said the village will have pottery-making workshops, and
scenes of the daily life of ancestors of Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Dadiwan Site covers a total floor space of 1.1 million
square meters on the gentle slope south to Qingshui River. It was
listed as a national key relics protection site in 1988.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1984, the Archeology Institute of Gansu Province
explored the area and found 242 ancient houses, 38 kilns and 8,100
pieces of pottery, stone and bone ware.
</P>
<P>
Li said Dadiwan is a history book which is only half open.
Dadiwan provides solid evidence that Gansu was one of the major
cradles of ancient Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
The government of Gansu Province has asked the Chinese
Institute of Architecture Technology to design the museum. The
government will also clear up 33.3 hectors of land in the ancient
site to build the museum.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 400 large sites of ancient ruins and tombs
all across the country, and many local governments face the
problem of how to protect, said Wang Jun, an official with the
State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
He said the museum in Dadiwan will help explore effective ways
of protecting large sites of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> China to Have Noble Prize Winner within 20 Years: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first Noble Prize winner
is likely to appear within the next 20 years, said Chen Ning Yang,
a winner of the 1957 Noble Prize in physics.
</P>
<P>
The famed Chinese-American scientist made the remarks at a
symposium recently held at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"China's economic development and its increasing input into
education have given me the confidence that China will have its
own Noble-Prize winner in the near future," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"Mathematics may be the most promising area" said Yang.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is no Noble Prize mathematics awards, Chinese
mathematicians may win Fields Awards. Biology is another area
where Chinese scientists have an edge," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
"It was relatively easier for a physicist to be successful from
the 1950s to the 1970s, an era with a plethora of scientific
secrets waiting to be discovered," he explained. "However, with
the progress of research in physics, the chances have decreased
considerably."
</P>
<P>
Yang's remarks have provided an answer to a long-time question
on the minds of many Chinese people, that is, when China will have
its own Noble-Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
To help China realize the long-cherished dream of winning the
Noble Prize, Yang suggested that Chinese scientists should
intensify their cooperation with their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Born in China in 1922, Yang entered the University of Chicago
in 1945, receiving a doctorate in 1948. Nine years later, he won
the noble prize in physics with another Chinese-American scientist,
Trung Dao Lee.

<HEADLINE> Head of Cultural Commission of Iran's Parliament Decides to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Cultural Commission
of Iran's Majlis (parliament) Ahmad Pournejati announced here
Tuesday he has decided to resign from his post.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in an oration delivered before
Tuesday's open session of the parliament, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Pournejati, a prominent reformist figure, came
only two days after a brawl among parliament members (MPs) over the
issue of the press law.
</P>
<P>
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered the Majlis on
Sunday to withdraw from its agenda a debate on rewriting the press
law, which the conservative judiciary used in the past few months
to close down some 20 reformist papers and journals.
</P>
<P>
The order sparked a brawl on the Majlis floor, with some MPs
even engaged in physical scuffling.
</P>
<P>
A legislator from the southern city of Abadan expressed his
strong objection to the Majlis decision not to debate the press
law, but some other MPs accused him of disrespecting the leader's
order.
</P>
<P>
The reformist-controlled Majlis, which only took power from the
previous conservative one on May 27, has vowed to rewrite the
restrictive press law, but the direct pressure from the supreme
leader has clearly created a setback for it.
</P>
<P>
With the precedent of Khamenei's direct intervention, it will be
very difficult for reformers in the Majlis to carry out their
campaign pledge of pushing through President Mohammad Khatami's
reform programs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Lawyers to File Contempt Petition Against PM  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior lawyers of the Supreme Court
of Bangladesh would not only file a contempt of court petition
this week against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her remarks on
the judiciary,but also organize their fellow members of the
profession all over the country to build resistance against such
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the legal profession have expressed the
apprehension that the institution of the judiciary might suffer an
irreparable damage if the objectionable remarks went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
Barrister Moudud Ahmed, given charge of finalizing the draft of
the proposed contempt petition, told newsmen Monday night that
they had collected signatures of about 225 members of the Supreme
Court Bar Association in favor of the proposed petition. Their
target is to collect 300 signatures before filling the proposed
petition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The present move to file the proposed contempt is against
comments made by the Prime Minister in her interview with the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on July 27.
</P>
<P>
In her interview, Sheikh Hasina held the lawyers and the judges
responsible for the deterioration of law and order situation in
the country and criticized the lawyers for seeking bails of the"
terrorists" and also the judges for granting them.
</P>
<P>
The comments were regretted by the Supreme Court Bar. Eleven
former presidents of the Bar issued a joint statement protesting
the prime minister's statement.
</P>
<P>
At a protest rally attended by hundreds of lawyers Monday in
the capital, senior lawyers condemned the prime minister's remarks,
saying it was tantamount to the contempt of court and asking her
to withdraw her comments and apologize.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 131 opposition members of parliament, in a joint
statement Monday, denounced the prime minister's remarks on the
judiciary and said that it was a threat to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said that it was a provocative statement by the
prime minister and it would create anarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The signatories included the leader of the Opposition and
Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party Begum Khaleda Zia
and Jatiya Party Chief Hussain Mohammad Ershad.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, however, argued that she has not violated any
provision of the constitution about the judiciary in her interview
with BBC and her statement was not intended to undermine the
country's judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference last Friday at her office on
return from her four-day visit to Malaysia, the prime minister
stressed "what I said was that the criminals and killers were
committing crimes after getting bails from the court."
</P>
<P>
The criminals after getting bails from the court felt
encouraged to commit further crimes and flee the country, she said,
adding that the statement of the lawyers would further encourage
the killers to create a lawless society in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the prime minister unveiled a list of
the top terrors of the city who were set free from jail on bail
and again indulged in "heinous crimes."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A young man's debilitating
eyesight has improved after undergoing a cornea transplant using
the cornea of a fish, the first transplant of its kind in China,
which also gives hope to many other people with cornea problems.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xiaoyong, 19, a resident in Shenzhen, in South China's
Guangdong Province, suffered from a cornea ulceration in his left
eye last June, according to today's "China Youth Daily".
</P>
<P>
He was in urgent need of a cornea transplant, but the hospital
couldn't find a proper human cornea transplant donor. Doctors
decided to use a fish cornea instead of a human one on July 5.
</P>
<P>
Xu left the hospital with improved eyesight on August 6.
Doctors predicted that his eyesight will continue to improve over
time.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that half of the blindness that occurs among
Chinese people is due to cornea problem. Using the fish cornea has
provided a new alternative material for cornea transplants,
according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Piracy of Optical Discs Cracked Down in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 700,000 pieces of pirated optical discs were
destroyed in Macao on Monday. Actually, they were only part of the
discs seized in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that almost 2.7 million pieces of pirated
discs were seized from 1998 to June this year. Other discs will
also be destroyed following legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Macao used to be a manufacturing and distribution center of
pirated optical discs beginning from the mid-1990s. In 1997,
police authorities detected 15,000 pieces of illegal discs and the
number in 1998 increased tenfold.
</P>
<P>
The pirated discs were normally hidden in hollow cloth rolls,
waste materials or submarine tanks, or mixed with blank discs.
</P>
<P>
The authorities intensified law-enforcement in 1999,
stipulating that illegal disc manufacturers can be sentenced up to
four years in prison and pirated disc dealers can be given a two-
year imprisonment and heavy fine.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the import of optical disc production lines
and relevant raw materials has been strictly restricted.
</P>
<P>
In view of the progress in protecting intellectual property
rights, Macao was moved in May this year from the "Priority Watch
List" to "Watch List" of the United States.

</P>
<P>
A total of 29 members of the group were charged at the Sessions
Court in Taiping in the northern state of Perak Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The attorney-general said he decided to charge them under
section 121 of the Penal Code with waging war.
</P>
<P>
"Waging war in the context of the Penal Code is purely a
technical legal term which means nothing else but acts of treason
against a democratically elected Government. Such acts include
armed insurrections, destroying properties or place of worship or
buildings,resisting arrest by the authorities, using arms against
the security forces where its objective is to go against the
establishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said police investigation also showed that pamphlets were
distributed and trainings were conducted to cause an uprising
against the country to change the government of the day by illegal
means or force.
</P>
<P>
The group, in its preparation to carry out their plan, gathered
its members and purchased weapons such as crowbars and parangs
with Islamic inscriptions, vehicles, army uniforms and foodstuff
or rations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police investigation further disclosed that the group seized an
assortment of arms and ammunitions from two military camps in Grik,
Perak and brought them to their base.
</P>
<P>
"Upon advice on security reasons, I have determined that the
case against the Al-Ma'unah group be classified as a security case.
As such, I have issued a certificate for the case to be
transferred to and tried in Kuala Lumpur," Mohtar said.
</P>
<P>
With the case being transferred to Kuala Lumpur, the 29 are
expected to appear at the High Court here Wednesday to record
their plea.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, they face the death sentence or life
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> 1stadd: Anwar Sentenced to 9 Years' Imprisonment on Sodomy Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 8 (Xinhua) - Malaysia's former Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was Tuesday sentenced to 9 years'
imprisonment on the sodomy charge.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the verdict, High Court judge Arifin Jaka ordered
Anwar to serve the sentence after the completion of his current
six-year jail term for corruption.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 53, was jointly tried with his adopted brother Sukma
Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja on separate charges of sodomizing his
former family driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Sukma was sentenced to six years' jail with four strokes of
caning.
</P>
<P>
However, the judge spared Anwar the cane which is limited to
those aged 49 years and below.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's supporters gathered around the court area, but the
situation was calm with no untoward incident taking place except
that 2 opposition leaders were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was originally scheduled to be delivered on August
4 but was postponed on what the court said the "judgment is not
ready".
</P>
<P>
But, analysts attributed the postponement to the authorities'
fear of chaos due to the announced demonstration by Anwar's
supporters on that day.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sentenced earlier on April 14, 1999 to six years'
imprisonment by the same court on four counts of corrupt practice
of interfering in police investigations into allegations of his
sexual misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Increased Use of Electronic Communications Tools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Both Internet and intranet
use are growing dramatically among North American and European
workers, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of e-mail messages sent and received increased by an
average of 10 percent since last year in the five countries
surveyed, indicating the accelerating adoption of desktop and
laptop personal computers as core work tools, said the report from
Pitney Bowes, a U.S. firm specializing in messaging tools research,
in partnership with the Silicon Valley-based Institute for the
Future.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said, the number of respondents who
reported regular use of the Internet and intranets increased by an
average of 18 percent and 12 percent respectively, with an
especially quick adoption rate in the United States, where three-
quarters of office workers surveyed reports using these tools
regularly.
</P>
<P>
The study analyzed the adoption and usage rates of messaging
tools among knowledge workers in Canada, U.S., France, Germany and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four percent of American workers and 74 percent of
Canadian workers report using the Internet every day or several
times a week. In Europe, 61 percent of workers in both Germany and
the U.K. do the same compared to 55 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of American and 63 percent of Canadian
workers use the intranet every day, while 59 percent to 66 percent
of Europeans workers do the same.
</P>
<P>
U.S. workers rely on more communications tools to organize
their work and enhance their thinking, using an average of seven
communications tools on a daily basis, compared to five to six
tools for workers in the other countries surveyed.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the U.S. and Canada, e-mail has emerged
as the most used tool in the communications tool kit, with 97
percent of North American workers reporting that they use e-mail
every day or several times a week.
</P>
<P>
In the U.K., e-mail and the desktop PC are the most frequently
used communications tool. The desktop PC is also the most
frequently used communications tool in France, while in Germany,
the fax machine emerged as the most frequently used communications
tool.
</P>
<P>
"Our research has found that workers find substantial value in
text-based messaging and knowledge management tools," the report
said. "In each of the countries surveyed, Internet use increased
between 13 percent and 25 percent since last year. As a result of
more frequent worker use of these technologies, companies in
Europe and North America have the opportunity to deliver greater
amounts of value to employees via internal networks and to
customers via the Internet."
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted between January and March this year
and consisted of interviews with workers in all organizational
levels in small, medium and large companies.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Unemployment Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Unemployment rate in
May dropped to 4.3 percent from 5.3 percent in the same month last
year, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NSO noted in a report that the decline is an encouraging
trend, saying the government will continue efforts to maintain the
economic recovery in order to absorb new workers who expected to
enter the job market in the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in May, 30.48 million Thai people are
employed and 1.42 million unemployed, while the total eligible
workforce in that month numbered 31.9 million, or 53,56 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
The report also said employment rate in non-farm sectors
increased to 17.73 million in may year-on-year from 16.85 million
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it said employment rate in the agriculture sector was
down to 12.75 million in the period from 12.98 million the year
before.
</P>
<P>
On a region-by-region basis, the Northeast had the highest
unemployment rate with 7.1 percent followed by the North with 4.4
percent, Bangkok 3 percent, the South 2.1 percent and the Central
region 1.9 percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Draft Constitution to Be Amended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Attorney General C.
Kamala Sabeysen has submitted to the Supreme Court that the draft
constitution bill, currently before the parliament to debate, will
be amended to accommodate independent groups to contest elections,
the official Daily News said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general was quoted as saying that the aim of the
bill was to enhance franchise and not to alienate or diminish the
sovereignty of the people.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court was examining a draft bill to change the
country's electoral system referred to it by the government. What
the court had to determine was whether the proposed law was
inconsistent with the entrenched provisions of the constitution.
Sixteen petitions by political parties, nongovernmental groups and
individuals were filed against the bill.
</P>
<P>
The proposed electoral law has three segments - the first-past-
the-post, proportional representation and national list. The
voters are given the right to elect 298 members of Parliament, 73
members more than the present parliament.
</P>
<P>
President's Counsel H.L. de Silva appearing for the Sinhala
Urumaya (heritage) party told the court on Monday that the right
of people to elect candidates of their choice was prevented by the
omission of independent groups. He said the proposed legislation
could not become law without a two-thirds majority in the
parliament and a referendum.
</P>
<P>
President's Counsel K.N. Choksy, appearing on behalf of the
main opposition United National Party, said that under the new
system the necessity to vote for a party is dispensed with, the
voter's right of preference votes is removed and independent
groups are not recognized. He said the new system did not reflect
the true choice of the voters. For these reasons the right of
franchise was being violated.
</P>
<P>
The other lawyers who appeared for other groups and individuals
associated themselves with the submissions and opposed the
legislation.

<HEADLINE> Thai Police Crack Down on People Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past month, 100 traffickers have been charged with
illegal smuggling -- mostly across the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The move to crack down on smugglers comes as the tide of
illegal immigrants across Thailand's borders with Myanmar, Laos
and Cambodia is rising to record levels.
</P>
<P>
"This is profitable activity for Thai smuggling gangs,"
Jinabhadra Tansrisakul, immigration superintendent at the country'
s largest detention center in Bangkok, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He estimates illegal traffickers get paid between 3,000 baht (
75 U.S. dollars) to 6,000 baht (150 dollars) per head from Myanmar
immigrants hoping to get work in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Many of these gangs are importing illegal immigrants to order,
for Thai factory owners in Bangkok and the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
The police believe that 70 percent of migrant workers wind up
in the greater Bangkok areas and in the industrial zones of the
eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to clamp down on this racket is to catch the
smugglers in the act, which takes a lot of work and police
manpower, but this is where we have to concentrate our efforts,"
Jinabhadra said.
</P>
<P>
Although precise figures on the influx of illegal immigrants
are sketchy, the police confirmed that 100,000 of them have been
repatriated overland to Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia over the past
nine months.
</P>
<P>
Jinabhadra admits new strategies have to be adopted in addition
to cracking down on smugglers, vowing to clamp down more heavily
on factory owners who make use of migrant workers, upgrade the use
of information and set up internet links with all immigration
border crosspoints to coordinate information.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has launched an AIDS
information hotline to help HIV-infected people cope with the
physical and psychological aspects of the disease, the
Communicable Disease Department announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said in an announcement that the service, a joint effort by
the department and Thai business circle, will help patients in all
stages of HIV-AIDs live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
The hotline is available around the clock and offers advice on
more than 172 AIDS-related topics, including symptoms,
complications, sources of assistance from public or private
agencies, patient care, medicine, AIDs in pregnant women and in
children and blood tests, it said.
</P>
<P>
If the answer to a question is not available, callers can
submit their questions in a voice-mail box, and the information
will then be included when the hotline is updated, it said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the department said the hotline is very necessary
as many Thai HIV infectors found it difficult to seek advice from
health-care personnel because of travel expense or embarrassment.

<HEADLINE> Wireless Internet Market Predicted to Explode Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The wireless Internet market
will explode worldwide once operators begin delivering streaming
media at reasonable prices, and next-generation wireless devices
will number more than 500 million by 2005 worldwide, a U.S. market
research firm reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Code division multiple access (CDMA)-based wireless services
will enable hundreds of millions of people to access multimedia
content anytime, anywhere, according to the study by Datacomm
Research, which specializes in tracking communications markets.
</P>
<P>
CDMA, a method for transmitting simultaneous signals over a
shared portion of the spectrum, is less costly to implement,
requiring fewer cell sites than the GSM (global system for mobile
communications) and TDMA (time division multiple access) digital
cellphone systems and providing larger capacity.
</P>
<P>
CDMA has become widely used in North America and is also
expected to become the third-generation technology for GSM. Unlike
GSM and TDMA, which divides the spectrum into different time slots,
CDMA uses a spread spectrum technique to assign a code to each
conversation.
</P>
<P>
Datacomm's report describes many of the new products, services
and business models enabled by CDMA. New consumer products will
include Internet radios that download music on-demand, wireless
cameras that print to the Web, personal navigators providing turn-
by-turn driving directions, and electronic wallets offering the
convenience of cash with guaranteed security and privacy.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Plans More Privatization for Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning more
privatization of its state-owned medium- and small-sized
industrial enterprises as part of its efforts to develop the
country's industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Thorough scrutiny and assessment of such enterprises for
transfer to national entrepreneurs are being made by departments
concerned to be submitted to the government-formed Privatization
Commission for approval, official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its state-owned economic enterprises (SEEs)
including industrial enterprises, aimed at systematically
transferring them into effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The plan is carried out by auctioning and leasing out the
enterprises or establishing joint ventures with local and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme cover 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in 1999, a total of 118 SEEs including 15
factories, 7 rice mills, 85 cinemas and 11 hotels were covered by
the privatization plan.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is a total of 1,760
SEEs in Myanmar, mostly being industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In Myanmar, about 1.74 million people are engaged in the
industrial sector, the contribution of which to the country's
gross domestic product is about 9 percent, ranking the third after
agriculture and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that during the last four years, there
was an annual increase in industrial development by 7.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cancer of Rectum Is Preventable: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have been the
first in the world to prove, after 24 years of research, that the
removal of polypi of the rectum is helpful to the prevention of
the cancer of rectum.
</P>
<P>
The research report will be carried in the magazine "Common
Epidemic Diseases in China" this month.
</P>
<P>
The finding is a result of joint efforts by a team of Chinese
researchers, led by Professor Zheng Shu of the Tumor Research
Institute of Zhejiang University in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the rectum polypi could lead to a decrease in
the development of the rectum cancer by 40 percent, and a drop in
the mortality rate caused by such cancer by 50 percent, according
to another leading researcher, Liu Xiyong.
</P>
<P>
From 1977 to 1980, researchers made two enteroscopy
examinations of more than 230,000 people aged over 30 in Haining
City in Zhejiang Province. As a result, 4,077 people were found to
had rectum polypi.
</P>
<P>
Two decades of monitoring the sufferers showed that the removal
of polypi helped decrease the possibility of the cancer by 68.6
percent, and fatalities from cancer by 82.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of those who had the polypi removed, some 500 have suffered
from cancer of the rectum in the past two decades, 229 cases less
than the predicted figure, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets' Shares Expected to Be Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's A-share market, which is
only open to domestic investors, and the B-share market, reserved
for overseas investors, are expected to merge in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Liang Dingbang, chief advisor to the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, said here recently that China is
considering allowing overseas investors into the A-share market as
part of an endeavor to boost the securities market.
</P>
<P>
"If overseas investors are permitted to invest in A shares,
listed companies may consider re-purchasing B shares, and the A-
share and B-share markets will then be united naturally," Liang
said. The merger of the two shares is not through government
decrees, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises have issued 108 B shares on the two stock
markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, raising more than five billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, due to such reasons as the irrational structure of the
shares, the B-share market has long been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
"Merging the two markets will have a positive effect on China's
securities market," Liang added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Enhance Economic Ties with South American Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 7 (Xinhua) - Mexico will strengthen its
economic relations with South American countries, especially with
the members of the South American Common Market (Mercosur),
Mexico's President-Elect Vicente Fox said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect, who arrived in Chile on Sunday as the
first stop of his first diplomatic trip after the general
elections, made the remark after meeting with his Chilean
counterpart Ricardo Lagos this morning.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local media, Fox said Mexico was
interested in joining the Mercosur trade bloc. Fox will also meet
Chile's opposition leaders to discuss relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
On July 2, Fox became the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has been in power since its creation in
1929. His victory has attracted the attention of Chilean
politicians of all different shades -- left, center and right. All
want to claim him as one of their own.
</P>
<P>
Yet his support for free trade follows the lead of his
predecessor, President Ernesto Zedillo, who negotiated many trade
deals, including agreements with Israel, the European Union, and
several countries in Central America. Zedillo also talked of an
agreement with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that Mexico has to sign free trade agreements
with everybody in sight," said Sidney Weintraub, of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
Mexico fears it is too highly dependent on the U.S. economy,
Weintraub said.
</P>
<P>
After meetings Monday in Chile, Fox will discuss a possible
Mercosur agreement with leaders in Argentina on Tuesday, followed
by trips to Brazil and Uruguay later in the week.
</P>
<P>
However, the president-elect won't be able to sign any
agreements until he takes over the presidency on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
After his trip to South America, Fox will travel to Canada and
the United States, meeting on Aug. 22 with Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien in Ottawa and on Aug. 24 with President Clinton and
Vice-President Al Gore in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Against Antidumping Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia called for a review of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) antidumping regulations, saying
that these regulations have been manipulated by industrialized
countries to become protectionist measures.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Director-General of Industrial Institutes
Cooperation and International Trade at the Ministry of Industry
and Trade Hatanto Reksodipoetro here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, along with other developing countries, will raise
the issue at a planned conference on trade liberalization measures
under the auspices of the WTO, he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down in Seattle, the United States, in December
last year largely because of huge differences between the member
countries, including the row between industrialized and developing
countries over dumping practices.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries have charged developing countries of
widespread dumping practices and include in their definition of "
dumping" the huge subsidies provided to industries to keep their
costs down.
</P>
<P>
By seeking to revise the antidumping regulations, it does not
mean that Indonesia is supporting dumping activities, Hatanto said,
adding that Indonesia's own economy could be ruined without
antidumping regulations.
</P>
<P>
"We have to watch out for the imposition of the regulations for
the purpose of protecting inefficient industries," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into allegations of dumping had to be done very
carefully as a government's intent to investigate was enough to
influence the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
At least seven Indonesian products have been given antidumping
duties by the European Commission since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Valderrama Wants to Coach Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BOGOTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Veteran midfielder Carlos
Valderrama said on Monday that he wants to coach his country's
national team.
</P>
<P>
"My objective is to be coach of the Colombian team," the 38-
year-old said in a weekly column for the Todogol Spanish language
web site.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy a challenge, but one cannot reach this post without
adequate preparation and credentials. I have to prepare myself for
this, I have to get myself qualified, and I'm going to do it when
I stop playing."
</P>
<P>
Valderrama made it clear it was unhappy with present coach
Luis Garcia, under whom Colombia have adopted a defensive style
which has produced results but few admirers.
</P>
<P>
Valderrama, who announced his international retirement after
the 1998 World Cup, briefly pondered a comeback last month because
he said he was disillusioned with Colombia's recent performances.
</P>
<P>
Valderrama named four candidates to take over his mantle as
the national team's playmaker - Neider Morantes, Geovany Hernandez,
Arley Betancourt and Mayer Candelo.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Colored-Brick Tomb Found in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 8 (Xinhua) -- An ancient brick tomb decorated
with dozens of colored frescoes has been found in Kaifeng City in
central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Believed to date from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), the
tomb is the first of its kind found in the city, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was robbed one hundred years ago. Archaeologists have
concluded that it was built for a local squire and his wife,
judging from three bronze coins and a pottery jar, and the
frescoes depicting their lives.
</P>
<P>
On the tomb's arched ceiling are paintings of chrysanthemums
and water lilies.
</P>
<P>
Kaifeng is famous for its chrysanthemums, and the painting
indicates that the flower was cultivated in the city almost 1,000
years earlier than previously thought, a local official said.

<HEADLINE> China's Mushroom-Growing Techniques Help World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 8 (Xinhua) --Mushroom-growing techniques
developed in China have been widely copied around the world,
according to an international conference held here recently on
poverty relief through growing mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
Some 149 foreign experts from 45 countries, including Egypt,
Brazil, Iraq and Yugoslavia, have come to China to learn the
techniques. A national mushroom lab or mushroom-growing center
have been established in Brazil and Iraq, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Invented by Prof. Lin Zhanxi of Fujian University in east China,
the techniques are used to cultivate mushrooms for food or for
medical purposes by using grass, stalks or straw, instead of using
wood as in the past.
</P>
<P>
This not only reduces production cost, it also increases the
utilization rate of solar and biological energy, and thus helps
protect and improve the ecological environment, experts said. It
has the great potential for application in regions that suffer
from drought and semi-drought worldwide, and thus is suitable for
poverty-relief programs, experts added.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning's Deficit-ridden Textile Industry Makes Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 8 (Xinhua)-- The gross industrial output of
the textile sector of Liaoning Province, China's largest
industrial base, increased by 17.5 percent to reach 4.02 billion
yuan (over 484 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Eleven textile enterprises among the 15 most-indebted ones have
reduced their deficits by 11.17 million yuan (about 1.35 million U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The economic momentum sustained last year's recovery, which
showed profits totaling 21 million yuan, following nine straight
years of losses in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Economic and Trade Committee attributed the
recovery of the chronic low-efficiency industry to overall capital
recombination and structural readjustment. A total of six large
enterprise groups have become the mainstay of the local textile
economy since deficit-ridden cotton textile plants with a total of
439,000 spindles were closed down during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 million yuan (about 14.5 million U.S. dollars)
has been allocated by the provincial government this year to set
up 11 hi-tech textile projects. Moreover, local textile
enterprises have introduced 17.32 million U.S. dollars of
contractual foreign investment in the first six months of this
year, up 30 percent over the same period of last year.

XI'AN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts and scholars have
urged Shaanxi Province, which is well-known for its ancient relics,
to make full use of its advantages in science and technology to
develop tourism.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi ranks third in China in the number of universities and
research institutes, after Beijing and Shanghai. It has built the
country's first agricultural high-tech city, the Xi'an satellite
control center and a hall for making artificial rain, and cloned
the first live goat from adult body cells in the world.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guangyuan, a leading Chinese scholar and a member of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said during an inspection tour
of this provincial capital that the satellite control center,
aircraft company and high-tech development zone in Xi'an should be
opened to Chinese and foreign tourists. Tours of historical sites
can be arranged together with visits to sites of modern
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yaofeng, a professor at the Tourism Department of Shaanxi
Teachers University, highly praised the practice of organized
tours to the science and technology museum and high-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, on northwest China's Loess Plateau, was one of the
cradles of the Chinese nation. Thirteen dynasties made Xi'an their
capital. The province has 300 cultural and historical sights,
which belong to different periods in history, including the world-
famous Qin Shihuang Tomb and terracotta warriors, Famen Temple and
Mount Huashan, attracting millions of visitors every year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The reunification of both sides
of the Taiwan Straits must be part of China's modernization drive,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came at a two-day seminar which finished
yesterday in Shenyang, capital city of Northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts from Taiwan and the mainland expressed
their confidence in the mainland's ability to achieve
modernization and peaceful reunification with Taiwan after
reviewing the mainland's accomplishment on economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sheng, head of the Taiwan delegation, said he believed
the reunification of Taiwan and the mainland was inevitable, and
was welcomed by all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Taiwan question can be solved as soon as possible.
We are, after all, all from one family and should work together
towards our country's modernization," Wang said.

Composed of 60 scholars and top entrepreneurs from Taiwan, the
delegation discussed current big issues with their mainland
counterparts, including the ongoing reforms of State-owned

<HEADLINE> Jerry West Retires From LA Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Jerry West, one of the NBA
Greatest 50, retired on Monday to put an end to his 40-year career
with the Los Angeles Lakers as player, coach and manager.
</P>
<P>
West, 62, is to be succeeded as executive vice president of
basketball operations by general manager Mitch Kupchak, and Kurt
Rambis promoted to assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Lakers fans, West said that "this is a
difficult yet happy time for me personally as I retire my position
with the Los Angeles Lakers and enter another period of my life,
one that will allow me more freedom to enjoy my friends and
particularly my family, unburdened with the pressures of the
professional athletic business."
</P>
<P>
West played for the Lakers for 14 seasons before retiring in
1974. He won one championship ring as a player and six more as an
executive. After two years away from the game, he replaced Bill
Sharman as coach of the Lakers before the 1976-77 season.
</P>
<P>
He spent three years as coach and three more as a special
consultant with the team before being promoted to general manager
prior to the 1982-83 season.
</P>
<P>
From the college at West Virginia, West became the Lakers' top
draft pick and No. 2 overall in 1960. That year he helped lead the
United States to an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
As a player, he helped take the Lakers to nine NBA finals. He
was a 14-time All-Star and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of
Fame in 1979. The Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983.
</P>
<P>
As an executive, West completed many deals, including the most
exciting one by signing Shaquille O'Neal from Magic for 120
million U.S. dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Congenital Heart Diseases Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sufferers of congenital heart
diseases, which make up eight percent of the world's population,
are likely to be cured by repairing a gene called CX43.
</P>
<P>
"It is the abnormality of CX43 that directly leads to
congenital heart diseases," said Huang Guoying, professor of the
Medical School of Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Huang based his conclusion on a four-year research on lab mice.
</P>
<P>
Huang's research indicates that the abnormality of CX43, an
intercellular connective protein, prevents neural crest cells from
developing into stromal cells in the heart of an embryo, thus
hindering the growth of the efferent tract of the heart and
resulting in congenital heart diseases like pulmonary stenosis.
</P>
<P>
During lab experiments, mice died of congenital heart diseases
when a CX43 was removed from or an extra CX43 was put into their
bodies, according to Huang.
</P>
<P>
Through a Doppler ultrasonic cardiograph, Huang also discovered
both systolic and diastolic problems in mice embryos that had CX43
abnormality.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said Huang's achievement represents a new step
toward genetic diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart
diseases.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Ancient Human Bone Genepool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first Ancient Human Bone
Genepool is to be set up in this east China metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Jointly founded by the Shanghai Nature Museum and the Human
Genetics Institute of Fudan University, the genepool will collect
human bones of various ages unearthed in different regions of
China. Modern molecular biological technology will be used to
extract DNA from the bones for permanent preservation, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The genepool to be set up has received support and financial
aid from the South Center of China's National Human Genes Program.
</P>
<P>
"This is a meaningful event. People can learn more accurately
about human evolution in China through directly looking at genetic
data," said Chen Zhu, an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and head of the South Center.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, it has become more common worldwide to use
modern technology to extract DNA from ancient human bones so as to
study ancient human societies, migration, diseases and other
archaeological puzzles.
</P>
<P>
A special DNA lab has been established in the Human Genetics
Institute. It has successfully extracted DNA from human bones
dating back 3,200 years.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Nature Museum, one of the largest of the kind in
the country, has collected quite a number of human bones of
various ages and from various regions.

GAZA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in the
interim talks Saeb Erekat said conditions for holding another Camp
David-style summit involving the Palestinian, Israeli and U.S.
leaders were not ripe.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side expressed hope for continuation of the Camp
David talks but Israel did not like to do so, Erekat told Monte
Carlo radio on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the United State would play a more effective
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ruled out the
possibility of holding an Israeli-Palestinian summit at present,
Israel Radio reported on Tuesday.

The issue will be reconsidered if the Palestinians offer "more
serious and worthy" proposals, Barak was quoted as saying.

Speaker of Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qurei, known as
Abu Ala, held a secret meeting with Israeli Minister of Regional
Cooperation Shimon Peres Tuesday morning on the latest developments

urged the Palestinians to show more flexibility to push forward the
peace talks.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Formal Charges Levelled Against Egyptian Professor Yet: Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian authorities dismissed on
Tuesday reports about prosecution against a professor of the
American University in Cairo, who was suspected of spying for the
U.S..
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Maher Abdel Wahid said Tuesday that public
prosecution has not levelled formal lawsuit against the detained
sociology professor Saad Eddin Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has not completed investigation into the case of
Ibrahim, director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Social
Developments, and no charges can be brought against someone before
there is sufficient evidence, Abdel Wahid was quoted as saying by
the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Wahid was responding to reports which said that
prosecutors had filed a criminal lawsuit against Ibrahim for spying
for the U.S. intelligence services, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The accused has the right to the prosecutors' information and
documents as soon as they are released in order to be able to
prepare his defense, the attorney-general said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who has both Egyptian and U.S. citizenships, was
arrested on June 30 and has been accused of taking funds from
abroad without prior permission of the authorities, defaming Egypt
and some other Arab countries, and trying to bribe Egyptian state
television officials.
</P>
<P>
His detention, which can be renewed indefinitely under emergency
law, was extended on July 27 for a third consecutive 15-day period.
Seventeen others are also being detained in the case.

DAMASCUS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed
Mehdi Saleh said here Tuesday that Baghdad hoped to increase
imports from Syria and raise its trade with Syria from the current
450 million U.S. dollars to 1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Saleh is in Syria to attend the first Iraqi-Syrian joint
economic commission in 20 years and to promote cooperation in "

Baghdad cut relations with Syria in 1980 to protest Damascus'
support for Iran in its eight-year war with Iraq.

In 1998, the two countries signed an agreement to reopen an oil
pipeline closed since 1982 linking the northern Iraqi city of
Kirkuk with the Mediterranean port of Banias.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also expressed satisfaction Tuesday in Damascus over the
agreement to open the first rail link between the two countries

<HEADLINE> Greece Increases Reward for Information on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday once again
increased its reward for any information leading to the arrest of
members of the country's terrorist group, "November 17," which has
claimed responsibility for over 20 killings in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
"A reward of 1.5 billion drachmas (about 4.1 million U.S.
dollars) will be offered to anyone providing evidence and
information leading to the dismantling of the November 17
terrorist organization, shedding light on its crimes and arresting
the culprits," said the Greek government in a statement.
</P>
<P>
After Britain's military attache Stephen Saunders was shot
dead by two members of the November 17 terrorist group in early
June, Greece doubled its reward to 1 billion drachmas (about 2.7
million dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Greece has set up two hotlines for information on
terrorist activities, the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Greek terrorist group's first victim was Richard Wells,
CIA station chief in Greece in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Supreme Court Confirms Pinochet Immunity Stripping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Supreme Court ratified
Tuesday by 14 votes in favor and six against stripping former life-
long Senator Augusto Pinochet of his immunity, paving the way for
him to be forced to stand trial for alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Judges' voting against the immunity stripping had supported
Pinochet having to undergo medical tests.
</P>
<P>
Human rights lawyers had fought to have Pinochet's immunity
removed because of his alleged involvement in a "Death Caravan"
incident that slaughtered leftists after his forces ousted elected
socialist President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
In May, a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet, 84, of
his immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed against that
ruling in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, judges heard testimony from lawyers
representing the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year rule
and from lawyers defending him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet ousted socialist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody September 1973 coup. More than 3,000 people died or
disappeared while Pinochet was president and tens of thousands of
other Chileans fled the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the most infamous incidents of the era involved the so-
called "Death Caravan," a military helicopter unit that blitzed
through northern Chile in October 1973 in search of union leaders
and left-wing supporters of Allende. At least 72 people were
killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Renews Objection to Venezuelan President's Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
repeated its strong objection to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez'
s planned visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We've made quite clear what our views are on the issue," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said after Venezuela rejected
the U.S. position over Chavez's trip this week to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it's wise or appropriate for him to visit, and
therefore, we'll look to see what he does," Boucher added.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said on Monday that Washington was concerned over
Venezuelan President Chavez's visit to Iraq, saying the visit was
"particularly galling" and Venezuela must "observe all the
Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq and the sanctions
regime."
</P>
<P>
But Venezuela's Foreign Ministry rejected the U.S. position
earlier on Tuesday, saying Washington's objection was "absurd" and
there was no way Chavez would change his plans.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq stop was "a done deal ... the trip was arranged this
way and no one will change this decision," said Venezuelan Foreign
Minister Jose Vicente Rangel.
</P>
<P>
Chavez planned to travel to Iraq by car on Friday at the Iran-
Iraq border after his meeting with Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Iraq trip is part of Chavez's 10-nation tour of OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who started his nine-day visit to OPEC member countries
on Monday, said the trip was aimed at broadening cooperation among
the OPEC members countries.
</P>
<P>
he said that he would use the trip to "outline the need for us
to make far greater advancements in oil-related development."
</P>
<P>
it was reported that his key objective of the tour is to invite
personally OPEC members to attend the oil cartel's September
summit in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The countries Chavez will visit include Saudi Arabia, Iraq,
Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Indonesia, Libya,
Nigeria and Algeria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Revocation of Pinochet's Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
welcomed the decision by Chile's Supreme Court to strip former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet of his immunity for prosecution,
calling the decision "historic."
</P>
<P>
"The decision is clearly historic. It is significant for Chile,
for the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human
rights," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The decision affirms the fundamental principle that no one
stands above the law. We certainly hope that it will contribute to
the resolution of long-pending human rights issues and further
advance the process of justice and reconciliation in Chile," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States backed Pinochet when he overthrew late
President Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup, and continued its
support to Pinochet during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Supreme Court stripped Pinochet of immunity earlier
Tuesday, thus clearing the way for him to be prosecuted for human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, currently faces 157 charges filed against him in
Santiago's Court of Appeal by relatives of some 3,000 people who
died or "disappeared" during his rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
Germany should "take all measures" to crack down the far-right
radical tendency, he told the N24 television news in Majorca
island of Spain, where the Chancellor was on vacation with his
family.
</P>
<P>
"That needs the toughness of the police, and the toughness of
the court. But that also needs the help of those who have become
the social ground behind the skinheads," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shcroeder appealed to the international society to distinguish
between Germany and the far-right groups, saying "it is most
important for me to make it clear to all over the world that
Germany should not be equal to those bad derailments."
</P>
<P>
The press office of Berlin cabinet said Tuesday that Schroeder
had set the campaign against far-right extremism the key issue of
his tour of five east German states later this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German politicians of major political parties also
proposed strict laws, quick trials and special courts for anyone
charged with neo-Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
Peter Ramsauer, parliamentary manager of the opposite Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), told Tuesday's large circulated Bild
Zeitung newspaper: "We must try now whether it is allowed in our
Basic Law to try extremists at fast special courts."
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary fraction of CDU and its Bavarian sibling
Christian Social Union (CSU) has drafted stricter Demonstration
Law and Youth Penalty Law to punish far-right rallies and
youngsters in radical groups, the Rheinische Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin told the Bild
Zeitung newspaper Tuesday that the government was planning special
measures to block and trace far-right radical contents and web
sites in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
She told the Westdeutsche Rundfund radio that filter systems
would be applied in German Internet domain name server to block
contents including special far-right and neo-Nazi words, such as

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Offers Humanitarian Aid to Eritrean Border Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia said here on
Wednesday it has been offering humanitarian assistance to
residents in Senafe, a border town of Eritrea, although it is
still facing challenges including the shortage of grain resulted
from drought.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Ethiopian government said in a statement
that the distribution of assistance that the Ethiopian troops have
been providing to the people in Senafe from their ration so far
could sustain 45,000 inhabitants of Senafe for one month.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of the statement by Ethiopia is apparently to
reject Eritrea's allegation that residents in Senafe were denied
by Ethiopian troops to have access to international humanitarian
agencies.
</P>
<P>
This is a "false allegation and pure fabrication", the
statement said, accusing the Eritrean authorities of making
difficulties for assistance to be made available to Eritrean
citizens in Senafe.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Ethiopian government invites
representatives of the United Nations, donor countries and non-
governmental organizations to verify whether or not the Eritrean
claim has any basis and to make their independent judgement of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been condemning each other for weeks
although the two belligerent countries signed a ceasefire
agreement in June in a bid to end their two-year border war.

<HEADLINE> S. African Man Lodges Compensation Suit Against Cigarette Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A South African young man
named Howard Josselowitz Wednesday launched a 500-million-rand (
about 71 million U.S. dollars) suit against an international
cigarette manufacturer for his tobacco-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, the claim
followed a recent United States court ruling against cigarette
manufacturers, who were ordered to pay millions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cape Town-based Japan Tobacco International, the
manufacturer of Camel brand cigarettes, Johannesburg attorney
Peter Soller said Josselowitz has been smoking that particular
brand for many years.
</P>
<P>
Josselowitz, 27, is now experiencing respiratory problems and
so addicted that he can not quit, Soller said.
</P>
<P>
"Although cigarette manufacturers include warnings on the
dangers of cigarette smoking in their advertisements, companies
like yours continue to subtly advertise and market your products
in other ways," the letter states.
</P>
<P>
Soller also referred to the research by an international
tobacco institute that has "conveniently been shelved and never
released to the public", which states that nicotine is not a
natural ingredient of the tobacco leaf but is added by
manufacturers to make cigarettes addictive.
</P>
<P>
"Josselowitz believes there are sufficient reasons to ensure
that the intrusion made by your company and other manufacturers
into people's lives is considerably curtailed by ordering you to
place 500 million rand in a trust for the benefit of the whole of
South Africa to cover the medical costs of smokers," Soller added.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Japan Tobacco International Arnold Peck said he
has not seen the letter, but his company is naturally concerned
about the contents.
</P>
<P>
"Japan Tobacco International will, however, only comment in
detail after the claim has been studied. Provisionally I can only
say that a person must bear in mind that our legal system and that
of America differ and that such a claim must be adjudicated
according to local law," Peck said.

<HEADLINE> Weather Services in SADC Struggling With Technology Update </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Meteorological services in
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are
struggling to maintain and update observational networks because
of budgetary constraints, Zimbabwe's Transport and Communications
Minister Swithun Mombeshora said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing meteorologists from SADC member states at a workshop,
Mombeshora said countries in the region were faced with an
inability to keep up with technological advances in both computers
and communications.
</P>
<P>
"While significant progress has been made in keeping weather
services in advanced countries up to date with technology, some of
our meteorological services in the SADC region struggle to
maintain an optimum observational network and computing facilities,
" Mombeshora said at the meeting which draws about 30 experts from
12 SADC countries except Seychelles and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was important to continue monitoring
climate variations as the economies of most member states relied
heavily on agriculture for sustenance.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries, he said, were affected by disasters arising
from extreme climatic events such as drought, tropical cyclones
and floods.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore a region most sensitive and prone to extremes
in climatic variability," said Mombeshora, adding "when climatic
conditions are extreme and not anticipated, the impact on the
socio-economic development can be catastrophic."
</P>
<P>
He said results from the workshop would form a greater input
into the Southern Africa Region Climate Outlook Forum to be held
in Botswana from September 18 to 22 this year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Government Urged to Protect Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
New National Party (NNP) on Wednesday urged the government to take
more effective steps in implementing laws protecting women.
</P>
<P>
NNP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk said at the party's two-day
women's conference in Pretoria that two acts namely Domestic
Violence Act and Maintenance Act, came into effect in 1999 which
could play an important role in empowering women.
</P>
<P>
The Domestic Violence Act vastly increases the help which
police and courts can give to women abused by their partners.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Maintenance Act allows courts to issue
orders asking an employer not to deduct maintenance payments from
a person's salary. Those refusing to pay can also have their
property seized.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, as with many other well-intentioned laws passed
by Parliament, the effective implementation of these laws is
lacking. There is a lack of resources for and a degree of
confusion about implementation," the party leader noted.
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk said the Domestic Violence Act places such new
burdens on the police that they have found it impossible to carry
out these duties.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Maintenance Act, maintenance investigators
are not being appointed.
</P>
<P>
He said urgent steps are needed to remedy the situation, adding
the South African government has a very clear obligation to come
to the assistance of women and children suffering as a result of
these laws not functioning effectively.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urges Sierra Leonean Rebel to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has urged Sierra Leone's rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to nominate liaison officers for
negotiations to revive the Lome Peace Accord, according to a
report reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of the ECOWAS, was quoted
as saying in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Tuesday that the sub-
regional organization was waiting for the RUF to name a new leader
to re-open the negotiation with Sierra Leonean government and
international community on the implementation of the peace accord
signed in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since RUF leader Foday Sankoh was arrested by the Sierra
Leonean government in May on charge of being responsible for the
abduction of about 500 United Nations peacekeepers by the RUF
fighters, the international community, including the ECOWAS, has
been pressing the rebel group to name a new leader to open
negotiation on reviving the Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the RUF stressed that Sankoh, who faces trial for war
crimes, is their sole leader to negotiate with the government.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has earned 252
million U.S. dollars from export of 116,000 tons of coffee during
the last fiscal year that ended in July, the Coffee and Tea
Authority (CATA) announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsegaye Berhane, general manager of the CATA, told
reporters here that amount of coffee exported in the last fiscal
year was less than that of the set target by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The general manager attributed the decline in coffee export to
the decrease in the prices of coffee in the global market because
of excess production in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the amount of coffee exported last year
exceeded that of the previous year by 8 percent.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The first series of books to
celebrate the achievements of South African women were released in
the country's capital Pretoria by the South African Human Sciences
Research Council on Wednesday, the National Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Acting Executive Director of the council Meshack Khosa said the
aim of the books which are entitled "Women Marching into the 21st
Century" is to document women pioneers in certain fields as far
back as the turn of the 19th Century and pay tribute to them.
</P>
<P>
"This publication is by no means a comprehensive digest of
South African women, but rather a first in a series that in the
end will provide a complete picture of all the heroines of our
country," Khosa said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the Human Sciences Research Council
responded to our request to pay tribute to South African women
with this commemorative publication," said Deputy Minister of
South African Arts and Culture Department Brigitte Mabandla.
</P>
<P>
"As we build a new democratic non-racial, non-sexist South
Africa, history demands that due recognition be given especially
to women who have contributed so much, yet are still largely
disempowered," Mabandla said.
</P>
<P>
The National Women's Day aims to commemorate the Women Defiance
Campaign of August 9, 1956, a march to protest the apartheid laws.

<HEADLINE> African Officials Discuss Strategies on HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- About 100 senior officials from
east, central and southern African countries gathered here on
Wednesday to discuss strategies for the fight against AIDS
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Commonwealth Regional Health
Community Secretariat for East, Central and Southern Africa (CRHCS)
, is aimed at mobilizing resources for an expanded response to HIV/
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The effect of HIV/AIDS is an additional burden to the already
overburdened sub-Saharan African countries, compared with other
developing countries, CRHCS Regional Secretary Steven Shongwe told
participants of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"However, the external debt service consumes large proportion
of total gross domestic product (GDP), implying diversion of
national resources required to undertake interventions in the
crusade against HIV/AIDS and other social expenditure," Shongwe
said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, for example, spends 30 percent of its GDP in debt
service and only 2 percent in social sectors, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Efforts and mechanism must be sought to mobilize additional
resources to effectively respond to the challenges of the pandemic,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Permanent Secretary for the Health Ministry Julius Meme
told Xinhua that he was confident that the spread of AIDS would be
stemmed if the government and its people adopt sound strategies
against the scourge.
</P>
<P>
Officials from 11 countries, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland, attended the three-day conference. On
Thursday and Friday the ministerial session will be held.
</P>
<P>
The sub-Saharan Africa is worst hit by AIDS, with the HIV
infection rate in most countries of the region above 10 percent
among adults.

LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba left here Wednesday to meet his Congolese counterpart
Laurent Kabila to discuss how to implement the Lusaka ceasefire
agreement signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's visit to Lubumbashi, a border city in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), is to pave the way for a meeting to
be held in Zambian capital Lusaka next Monday, which is aimed at
restoring the fragile peace process in the war-torn DRC.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended summit of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) held in Windhoek, Namibia, efforts to bring peace
to the DRC failed with the absence of president Kabila. One of the
main topics of the summit was to remove obstacles to the Lusaka
peace accord signed last July and August by all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
Conflict in the DRC has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia,
which support DRC president Kabila, and also Rwanda and Uganda,
which back different rebel groups in the DRC to fight the
government troops.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans to Become Free From Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is expected to declare
itself a country free from iodine deficiency by the end of this
year, Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while opening a one-day meeting
to sensitize salt traders on the progress of Iodine Deficiency
Disorders (IDD) control programs.
</P>
<P>
He said preliminary results of the 1999 micro-nutrient survey
indicated that the country had almost eliminated iodine deficiency
as reflected by the urine iodine levels of school children sampled
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the urine samples collected from a total of 1,074
pupils showed an average of 245 micrograms of iodine per liter, a
figure well above the 100 micrograms per liter cut off point.
</P>
<P>
He said the country looked forward to declaring itself an
iodine deficiency free country by the end of the year when an
independent team would be invited to verify its iodine status.
</P>
<P>
IDD include not only neck disfigurements but also mental and
physical impairments in children born of mothers with iodine
deficiency. Where deficiency was severe, abortions and stillbirths
were experienced. Some children were even born unable to speak or
walk.
</P>
<P>
The mission to eliminate IDD came about after the ministry
embarked on a nationwide study in 1998 which confirmed the
presence of severe iodine deficiency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Looks For Greater Drug Consumption Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. anti-drug chief General
Barry McCaffrey Tuesday described the reduction of drug
consumption as the most important target of the anti-drug
cooperation with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a "very big problem" of over 5 million
chronic addicts, McCaffrey said in Mexico's capital during the
Seventh Meeting of the High Level Contact Group which examines
anti-drug cooperation between both countries.
</P>
<P>
Owing to its magnitude, America's market is attractive for drug
traffickers who move their drugs from Colombia and Peru through
Mexico, he added.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said a few days back that drug consumption is growing
in Mexico, although levels are below the United States.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey supported the continuation of anti-drug cooperation
facing oncoming governmental changes in Mexico in December and in
the United States in January.
</P>
<P>
"Big criminal organizations still exist and have a large
presence in the United States as well as Mexico," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that anti-drug cooperation has achieved large results
like the confiscation of 40 tons of cocaine last year.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said that collaboration between Mexico and the United
States has improved in obtaining justice in the battle against
money laundry and reduction in drug taking.
</P>
<P>
The official supported intensification in the campaign against
weapon trafficking, as "drugs and weapons go hand in hand."

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is expected to meet Wednesday on the current situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) when the 15-nation body is
facing difficulties in deploying its peacekeepers in the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also come at a time when fighting in several
parts of the African nation has driven thousands of new refugees
into neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference here Tuesday that the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that an estimated 2,700
refugees have crossed the DRC border into Uganda since late July.
Many refugees say that they are running from rebel forces who have
accused them of harboring the militia of Interahamwe, or the
former Rwandan Hutu fighters.
</P>
<P>
Those refugees are coming from the Congolese province of North
Kivu, just across the border from Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, DRC Human Rights Minister Leonard She Okitundu
urged the Security Council to speed the withdrawal of Ugandan,
Rwandan and Burundian troops from its soil. But council members
asked the minister not to wait until the troops had pulled out of
the war-torn central African country before launching a dialogue
aimed at national reconciliation and facilitating the deployment
of a U.N. observer mission.
</P>
<P>
Okitundu also urged the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers solely
in combat zones to assure the complete and total withdrawal of
Ugandan, Rwandan and Burundian troops. The DRC government was
reported to seek the deployment of U.N. soldiers only in the rebel-
controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, in accordance with Security Council
resolutions, said that it wants peacekeepers deployed in areas
including the government-held regions, and the deployment will
only begin unless and until the fighting stops on the ground,
diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
In the many-sided conflict, the government army is supported
by forces from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia while rebel groups are
backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Tuesday with the blue chips rising on a higher-than-expected
productivity report which eased fears of higher interest rates,
but the tech shares fell on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 109.88 at 10,976.89,
extending its gains of 355.84 points in the previous six sessions
in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.48 at 1,482.80 but the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 14.44 at 3,848.55.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose after the U.S. Labor Department reported
that the labor productivity surged 5.3 percent in the second
quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations of a 4.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The rising productivity offset labor shortage that would boost
wages and put pressure on inflation. In the same report, unit
labor costs fell 0.1 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report showed a fresh sign that the U.S. economy is slowing
and inflation remains under control. Investors believed therefore
that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged at
the August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last
summer in a pre-emptive move to cool off the U.S. economy and keep
inflation at bay. The central bank leaves door open to more rate
hikes despite a slew of reports showing that the economy is
slowing.
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak, IBM and Wal-Mart led the Dow's advance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq index fell as investors pulled money out of the
market to lock in profits from a strong rally. The index rose 204.
53 points in the previous three sessions.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.18 at 665.70. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 1.16 at 914.30 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.15 at 508.72.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,590 up, 1,300 down and 476

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's exports to the United
States went up 23 percent in the first half of this year, reaching
5.9 billion U.S. dollars compared with 4.8 billion dollars
obtained in 1999's same period.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the increase in Brazilian exports to the
devaluation effects of the Brazilian currency and to the efforts
of Brazilian companies in looking for markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's main products that contributed to sales on the North
American market in the first six-month period were airplanes, with
a 5.74 percent growth, footwear 20.35 percent, iron and steel semi-
manufactured goods 37 percent, transmission apparatuses or
receptors and parts 80.59 percent, and cellular phones 59.55
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of Brazilian products exported to the United
States were manufactured, and therefore barriers to basic and
manufactured Brazilian products didn't have a big negative
influence on Brazil's trade balance, said head Citibank economist
Carlos Kawalt.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Not to Cancel Iraq Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
who is on a tour of 10 countries of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), will not cancel his visit to Iraq,
said Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president, who is expected to arrive in Iraq on
August 10 to meet President Saddam Hussein, will be the first head
of state to visit Baghdad since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
Washington could not understand the visit and would be raising the
issue with "relevant" Venezuelan officials.
</P>
<P>
"We do think it's a rather dubious distinction to be the first
democratically elected head of state to go and meet with the
dictator of Iraq," the spokesman said, adding that Chavez is
making the visit without the approval from the United Nations
Sanctions Commission.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minster said that there is no U.N.
resolution banning dignitaries from visiting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it is absurd that people "so politically
pragmatic as Americans" do not understand that Venezuela, as an
OPEC member, cannot discriminate against a country because of its
political regime.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only interest Chavez has in visiting Iraq is
that it's an OPEC nation, of which Venezuela is also a member.
</P>
<P>
The key objective of Chavez's 10-nation tour is to personally
invite all OPEC members to attend the Caracas summit in September.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has visited Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. He left late
Tuesday for Qatar and is due to travel to the United Arab Emirates,
Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria and Algeria before returning
to Caracas on August 15.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Deputy Senate President Resigns for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputy President of Nigeria's
Senate Alhaji Abubakar resigned on Tuesday under pressure from an
anti-corruption inquiry committee.

<P>
The Senate majority leader Samaila Mamman also gave up his
position in connection with the corruption after a meeting of the

</P>
<P>
The Senate President Chuba Okadigbo, however, still refused to
step down as required by a senate voting following his deputy's
resignation, in which 68 in favor of his resignation and 27

</P>
<P>
But the Senate later sent a six-member delegation to persuade
Okadigbo to accept the Senate's decision to pave the way for an
election of a new Senate president.
</P>
<P>
Senator Azuta Mbata was elected temporary Senate President,
according to the latest reports of the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member corruption probe committee last week published
its report on senate corruption investigation, and called on the
senate's president and his deputy to resign.
</P>
<P>
The report accused the two figures and several of their
prominent colleagues of accepting kickbacks and unauthorized "
welfare packages", worth millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Okadigbo had been involved in inflating contract volumes and
accepting kickbacks in a street light project and computer
purchase with combined value of 273 million naira (about 2.48
million U.S. dollars), according to the report.

He and his deputy Alhaji Abubakar were said to have paid

LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government had no

<HEADLINE> Chilean Army Grants Support to Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Army Commander-in-Chief
Ricardo Izurieta Tuesday expressed support for General Augusto
Pinochet following the Supreme Court's decision regarding
withdrawal of his parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
"Chile's Army, represented by its commander-in-chief and the
group of generals that accompany me, has wished to come and
express and deliver to General Pinochet, former president of the
republic and commander-in-chief of the Army, our support and our
solidarity at this distasteful moment for him," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general made this statement when being consulted about the
Supreme Court's decision of stripping Pinochet of his immunity and
after visiting him at his La Dehesa residence together with a
group of generals.
</P>
<P>
Izurieta said, "The Army lately has made every effort to attain
entente and rencounter with Chile's society. We understand these
matters will come through when there is trust and when there is
the necessary ambiance for this to happen."
</P>
<P>
General Pinochet made many valuable and important efforts for
the benefit of the nation on these questions which are my worries
at present and are logically of the country, said General Izurieta.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Supreme Court Tuesday stripped Augusto Pinochet of his
immunity from prosecution, paving the way for the 84-year-old man
to be forced to stand trial for alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Pinochet foes, who had waited outside the country's
highest tribunal for the formal ruling, jumped for joy. Others
hugged each other, celebrating what they regarded as a human
rights victory over the military's father figure.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Grants Visa to Former Nicaraguan President Ortega </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has granted
a two-year multiple-entry visa to former Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He applied for a visa in November of 1999. We issued the visa
after very careful consultation between the embassy in Managua and
the department," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion was that he was eligible to receive a U.S. visa
and we issued him a two-year multiple-entry visa in December of
1999," he added.
</P>
<P>
Boucher made the remarks as Ortega, who served as Nicaragua's
president from 1979-1990, plans to visit Miami on Thursday and
Friday to attend the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship
International World Convention.
</P>
<P>
Boucher declined to comment on speculation that Ortega might
face arrest in the United States on the basis of his stepdaughter'
s allegations that Ortega abused her as a child. Ortega has denied
the allegations and has never faced trial.
</P>
<P>
"Allegations like that would have been relevant for visa
purposes if they had resulted in a conviction. We're not aware
there's been any such conviction," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the Department of Justice, not State, who determines who
should and should not be prosecuted while in the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Boucher also denied that Ortega was on a State Department visa
lookout system which is supposed to keep suspected "terrorists"
out of the United States.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Boom Comes to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The housing boom in Britain is
officially over, with price increases halving over the past six
months, new figures from the Halifax Building Society show.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of price inflation fell sharply for the third
successive month - to 8 percent in July, compared with 16 percent
in January.
</P>
<P>
House sales in England and Wales fell four percent in the last
three months compared with the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rate rises and the abolition of mortgage interest tax
relief partly explained the slowdown, the Halifax said.
</P>
<P>
Average house prices, however, rose to 84,276 pounds -- an
increase of 0.3 percent or 373 pounds compared with June. Experts
said the figures were further proof the housing boom is slowing
down.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has called for efforts to develop the livestock industry in the
country, saying that the general improvement of the industry is
clearly provided in his government program for the modernization
of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The efforts to be made in this regard will help the government
earn more foreign exchange as well as help provide better beef
products to the international market, said the president when
meeting with a delegation of Uganda Beef Producers Association (
UBPA) executives and Swede-Agri Consultants here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni emphasized the importance of constructing a modern
abattoir as the starting point for commercialization of beef in
the east African country, according to a press release from the
President's Office.
</P>
<P>
The release said Museveni was confident that involving all
stakeholders, especially the small cattle farmers and ranchers in
the industry, would be the best way of improving the industry.
</P>
<P>
Swede-Agri, an international consultant organization co-owned
by the Federation of Swedish farmers, is now in Uganda to provide
consultancy services on how to develop and promote the Ugandan
beef industry as well as discover possible ways of cooperation
with UBPA.
</P>
<P>
Sune Sigvardsson, team leader of the Swede-Agri, said during
the meeting that there is a high potential of the beef industry in
Uganda, but he stressed that Uganda should have the defined
objectives which are necessary for sustainable and viable
commercial beef production for regional and international markets.

Chiluba said here Wednesday that President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has agreed to attend the
meeting to be held here next Monday to discuss the implementation
of the ceasefire agreement signed here a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The president described as fruitful and friendly his talks with

afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who mediated the Lusaka ceasefire agreement, went to
Lubumbashi to persuade Kabila to attend the planned meeting.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return here, Chiluba expressed the belief that all
presidents of the signatory countries of the agreement will attend
the crucial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Kabila refused to accept former Botswanan
President Ketumire Masire as a facilitator of the peace process on
the ground that he is not impartial.
</P>
<P>
Kabila failed to attend the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) summit in Windhoek, Namibia, on Sunday and Monday
which decided to hold a meeting in Lusaka on August 14 to discuss
ways to save the Lusaka peace accord signed July and August last
year by all parties involved in the two-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has sucked in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which
support Kabila, and also Rwanda and Uganda, which back different
rebel groups in the DRC to fight the Kabila government.
