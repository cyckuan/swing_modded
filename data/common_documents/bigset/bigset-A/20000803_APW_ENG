<HEADLINE> Child Abuse, Adult Stress Linked  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Abuse in early childhood dramatically changes the
brain chemistry of women for life, making them more vulnerable to
anxiety disorders and more easily frustrated by stress as adults, a
study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the results could lead to profound advances in
treatment for depression -- for women and men. The study was
published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic differences in women based on whether they had been
physically or sexually abused as children came to light when they
were asked to speak in front of a poker-faced audience and to solve
tricky math problems.
</P>
<P>
   In women who had been abused, a key hormone that regulates the
body's response to stress responded six times as strongly as in
women with no abuse history. The early trauma makes the hormone
hypersensitive, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've known for a long time that if you enrich the environment
during early development, you can get critical, positive long-term
effects,'' said Dr. Charles Nemeroff of Emory University, one of
the study's authors. ''This is the other side of the coin, the dark
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-depressant medication available now indirectly targets the
body's hormonal response to stress. But researchers said Wednesday
the new information bolstered ongoing studies on whether
anti-depressants can target specific stress-reaction hormones.
</P>
<P>
   They also said it could help victims of abuse prevent falling
into deep depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be beneficial is seeing whether we can reduce that
sensitivity,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Newport, a study author.
</P>
<P>
   A professor from the University of Georgia disagreed with the
conclusions from the Emory report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not always so,'' said Allie C. Kilpatrick, a professor of
social work at the University of Georgia. ''There are so many
intervening factors. Who was the person providing the abuse, how
long did the abuse continue, how much force and trauma occurred at
the time? All those factor in to how someone reacts later in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick said she did a study of her own with 500 women,
including some who had sexual relations with their fathers when
they were children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effects were all varied,'' she said. ''There were some
women who had no traumatic effects and there were women who had a
lot. It all depends on those intervening variables and the
resiliency of the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emory study examined 49 women ages 18 to 45, dividing them
into four groups by whether they had been abused as children and
whether they suffered depression as adults.
</P>
<P>
   They were told to speak before a panel of observers who had been
told not to show any reaction, and they were asked to subtract 17
from 4,000 continually.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests measured the response of cortisol and
adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH, two hormones closely related
to another hormone called CRF that controls the body's reaction to
stress.
</P>
<P>
   Cortisol and ACTH are much more easily measured in blood than
CRF.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said they focused on women because both abuse and
adult depression are more widely reported among women than men. But
they said similar tests on animals have shown almost no difference
in the responses of males and females.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt that this will be the case for both men and
women,'' Nemeroff said Wednesday. ''It just highlights the
importance of public education about child abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Quakes Shake Islands South of Tokyo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- More moderate earthquakes rattled a string of
volcanic islands south of Tokyo on Thursday, part of a series of
tremors that have hit the area for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1, was
centered six miles under the ocean floor off Niijima island, 105
miles south of Tokyo, the Meteorological Agency said. It struck at
6:42 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Sugimoto, a municipal official on Niijima, said there
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The island has 600
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's tremors, which also included a magnitude 4.6, were
among the tens of thousands registered in the islands since late
June, when a volcano on one of them rumbled back to life. Nearly
10,500 of the quakes have been strong enough to felt by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Bread Workers Awarded $120M in Suit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The nation's largest wholesale baker was
ordered Wednesday to pay $120 million in punitive damages to black
workers who said they suffered racial discrimination at a Wonder
Bread plant.
</P>
<P>
   The damage award came two days after a jury ordered Interstate
Bakeries Corp., the Kansas City, Mo.-based company that produces
Wonder Bread, Twinkies, Home Pride and Hostess Cupcakes, to pay $11
million in actual damages to 21 workers at the San Francisco plant.
The judge cut that amount to $5.8 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs stood and applauded after the award was announced
in San Francisco Superior Court. ''Thank you, Jesus!'' one
exclaimed. Others hugged the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm numb. This is definitely way beyond my wildest
imagination,'' said Charles Wright, 52, a former deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the bakery said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are disappointed that punitive damages were awarded,''
their statement said. ''The facts of the case do not support
awarding any damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the jurors agreed with the verdict, either.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Keating, a San Francisco State University student,
did not award any damages during the trial's second phase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't find there was a preponderance of the evidence for
any of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine of 12 jurors are required to reach a verdict under
California civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman Francisco Ortiz said the workers were deserving of
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people were treated wrong,'' the local electronics
worker said. ''I think we did the right thing here.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that the company acted with malice and oppression
toward 17 of the 21 plaintiffs; the 17 men and women will share the
punitive award. All 21 share in the actual damages awarded Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery said it would ask the judge to reduce the damages
awarded because some of the allegations, which date back more than
30 years, occurred when Ralston Purina owned the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The jury spent nine days deliberating after two months of
testimony about racial slurs and other indignities suffered at the
hands of co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Theodis Carroll Jr., 34, a former machine operator, testified
that co-workers called him ''boy'' as well as common racial
epithets. And Wright said he was denied Martin Luther King Day off,
even though white workers were allowed to take days off to see the
San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Jones Jr., a former route salesman, was put on light duty
after being hit by a drunken driver, but the company demanded that
he sweep the parking lot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I refused. I was treated like I was at the bottom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Not Enough Proof in Infant's Death  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE TSAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. -- A 2-day-old boy who died last month
might have survived had his parents relied on doctors instead of
prayer, but the coroner Wednesday stopped short of ruling his death
a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Ray Reed died July 9 after having difficulty breathing,
Mesa County Coroner Rob Kurtzman said. Kurtzman said the child died
because a hole in his heart limited the supply of oxygen in his
blood.
</P>
<P>
   He said the manner of death was undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Ray was born at home without a doctor present. Kurtzman
said that if the parents had sought medical attention after the boy
was born, his life almost certainly could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (the heart problem) is not something that I would
ordinarily think of as a cause of death,'' the coroner said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtzman said he had favored a homicide ruling but did not have
enough evidence. He said since no doctor saw the boy when he was
alive, officials did not how severe the symptoms were.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents, Billy Reed, 31, and Barbara Reed, 23, did not
answer a phone call Wednesday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mondis Herrman, an elder in the Reeds' church, the General
Assembly Church of the First Born, said he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there was any criminal activity going on here.
They were just doing what they felt was best,'' Herrman said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Frank Daniels said he would review Kurtzman's
report and a sheriff's report before deciding whether to press
charges. Under Colorado law, parents who rely on faith healing are
not automatically considered criminally liable in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the parents of Warren Trevette Glory, also members
of the church, were sentenced to 16 years' probation in the death
of their 18-day-old baby, who died of pneumonia and bacterial
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of negligent homicide against Warren's parents were
dropped in exchange for a guilty plea to child abuse.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Govt. Drafts Constitution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- The government presented a draft
constitution Thursday that aims to end the separatist war by giving
autonomy -- but not independence -- to the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   If passed by the Parliament, the new constitution will guarantee
Sri Lanka's 3.2 million Tamils a greater say in running their own
affairs in the north where they are in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have already
rejected the offer, saying they will settle for nothing less than a
separate homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it will not agree to a division of this
small island country off India's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament was expected to debate the draft for three days
before a vote is taken. The government hopes moderates among the
Tamils will support the move, which could eventually sideline the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The war with the Tamil Tigers has left more than 62,000 people
dead since 1983. The rebels say they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese, who constitute 14 million of Sri Lanka's 18.6
million people.

<HEADLINE> Petrobras Fires Four Employees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Government-owned oil conglomerate
Petrobras has fired four workers for failing to follow proper
procedure, triggering Brazil's worst oil spill in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras President Henri Phillipe Reichstul said an internal
investigation determined a botched pumping operation caused last
month's spill that spewed more than 1 million gallons of crude oil
into the Iguacu river.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was contained, the oil spill at the Getulio Vargas
refinery in Araucaria, about 435 miles southwest of Rio,
contaminated a 27-mile stretch of river, devastating wildlife and
sparking fears it would soil the world famous Iguacu falls.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation determined the spill occurred after an
employee failed to open a tank meant to receive the oil pumped from
the terminal. Two more employees were fired for failing to perform
routine safety checks that could have prevented the spill. Another
was fired for failing to detect the spill quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras has been fined $120 million by various state and
government agencies for environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Army Moves in to Fiji Trouble Spot  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military sent troops to Fiji's second
largest island Thursday in a bid to put a stop to attacks against
ethnic Indians that have persisted since the Pacific nation's May
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Fiji's director of public prosecutions, Josaia
Naigolevu, announced that coup leader George Speight would be
arraigned Saturday on minor charges including unlawful assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Speight is under investigation for treason but has not yet been
charged with that offense, which carries a maximum sentence of
death.
</P>
<P>
   A company of soldiers was deployed to the northern island of
Vanua Levu to strengthen troop numbers there and end attacks on
ethnic Indians, said military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini. The
troops immediately arrested 30 suspected rebels and searched the
jungle for more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one house was razed overnight, and armed gangs have for
weeks been terrorizing ethnic Indian families in towns on the
island, a stronghold of Speight support.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have moved into Vanua Levu in force and that should put an
end to the disturbances and enhance our search for weapons,''
Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   Raids, hostage-taking, theft, beatings and burnings have become
commonplace in small ethnic Indian-dominated rural communities
since a nationalist uprising in May which toppled Fiji's elected
government and bred more than 11 weeks of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman Speight led an armed gang into Parliament on
May 19 and held dozens of officials for two months, demanding
ethnic Indians be stripped of political rights. The military met
his demands for an amnesty and the scrapping of Fiji's multiracial
government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claimed that ethnic Indian Fijians have too much power
and threaten indigenous Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians -- whose
ancestors were brought to Fiji in the 1870s by British colonialists
as indentured laborers -- make up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000
population and dominate business and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The political crisis has paralyzed the economy, dependent on
tourism and sugar exports, and brought sanctions by some nations
condemning Fiji's abandonment of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was arrested last week and is the subject of a treason
investigation for allegedly threatening the life of President Ratu
Josefa Iloilo after his amnesty period expired. Speight and his key
advisers are being held on a prison island off Suva, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 400 other hard-core rebel supporters were arrested in a
tear gas raid last week at a camp in Suva. The last of the rebels
were arraigned Thursday on charges of unlawful assembly, which
carries up to one year in prison. Most pleaded innocent and were
freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase has promised to pursue a
nationalist agenda by appointing a commission to rewrite the
constitution to strengthen indigenous Fijians' hold on power before
elections are held, possibly in three years.

<HEADLINE> Webber Testifies in Gambling Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Former University of Michigan basketball star
Chris Webber testified Wednesday before a federal grand jury
investigating the alleged gambling activities of Ed Martin, a
former Wolverines booster.
</P>
<P>
   After testifying for nearly an hour, Webber said he will
cooperate with prosecutors who want to know about Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 65, a retired Detroit electrician, is accused of
operating a lucrative numbers betting pool at the Ford Rouge plant
where he worked for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I answered all their questions, and I will help the
prosecutors as much as I can,'' Webber told The Detroit News.
</P>
<P>
   Webber, who plays for the NBA's Sacramento Kings, was scheduled
to testify last month but didn't show up for his court appearance.
On Wednesday, he arrived on time with his father, Mayce.
</P>
<P>
   Mayce Webber testified before the grand jury in June.
</P>
<P>
   Webber emerged from the U.S. Courthouse in Detroit smiling,
perhaps because, as he told the Detroit Free Press: ''I knew I was
not the one on the hot seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber is the second ex-Wolverines player called before the
grand jury at U.S. District Court. Earlier this summer Robert
Traylor, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, answered questions
about his dealings with Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the grand jury investigation, the FBI and IRS
also are looking into charges that Martin supplied players,
including Webber and Traylor, with large amounts of cash while they
were playing at Michigan. Failure to pay taxes on such cash gifts
would violate tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor's lawyer, Steven F. Fishman of Detroit, also represents
Louis Bullock, another former Michigan player. Fishman said Bullock
will testify soon.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 2, Braves 0  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- In his home debut for Arizona, Curt Schilling
shut out Atlanta for the second time this season Wednesday night as
the Diamondbacks beat Greg Maddux and the Braves 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (8-6), who graduated from high school in Phoenix, is
2-0 since the trade that brought him back to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 7-2 with a 1.69 ERA in his last 10 starts, allowed
six hits and retired the final 13 batters. He struck out four and
walked one in his fifth complete game of the season and 15th
shutout of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old right-hander has allowed one run in 17 innings
for the Diamondbacks, and is 3-0 against the Braves this season.
Schilling shut out Atlanta 6-0 with Phialdelphia on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell's two-out RBI double in the third inning provided
Schilling with the only run he needed. Matt Williams drove in Bell
with a single for the second run.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (12-6) lost his third straight decision. He gave up two
runs on five hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked
two, one intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   With just their third victory in 10 games, Arizona climbed back
into a virtual tie with San Francisco for first place in the NL
West.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, batting just .220 with two outs and runners in
scoring position this season, scored both of their runs with two
outs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack had perhaps the biggest at-bat of the night. With
two outs, after fouling off several pitches, Womack walked on
Maddux's 3-2 pitch, then stole second, his 22nd steal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, hitless in his previous four games and batting just .173
since July 1, doubled to right-center to drive in Womack. Williams
followed with an RBI single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had runners on first and second with one out in the
fourth and fifth inning, but both threats were wiped out by double
plays. Paul Bako grounded to first to start the first one, Chipper
Jones grounded one to shortstop to start the second.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling and Maddux have opposed each other as starters seven
times. Schilling has won the last four, Maddux won the first three.
The two had squared off since April 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bell was back in the No. 2 spot in the batting order after
being dropped to either No. 6 or 7 the previous three games. ...
Arizona right fielder Jason Conti threw out Brian Jordan trying to
move from first to third on B.J. Surhoff's single with no outs in
the second. ... The Braves failed to take advantage of errors by
Bell at second base in the first and Womack at shortstop in the
second. ... The crowd of 40,643 put Arizona over the 2 million
mark, the ninth major league club to do so this season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopes To See Young in Politics  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON THEIMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans would like to recruit retired
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young to a new arena:
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who gave the invocation Wednesday night at the Republican
National Convention, would bring a mix of name recognition,
intelligence, media savvy and morality to public office, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates and party officials are so enthusiastic, their
only question is not which office, but which state: Young, a Salt
Lake City native, has homes in the San Francisco Bay area and in
Provo, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''He certainly has the opportunity to pursue either federal or
state office in either state,'' said Ron Fox, a delegate from North
Salt Lake City and executive director of George W. Bush's campaign
in Utah. ''I kind of see this as Steve Young's coming-out party
within the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, retired from the
49ers in June.
</P>
<P>
   In his invocation Young asked a special blessing for the
recovery of former President Gerald R. Ford, hospitalized a few
miles away after suffering two small strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Young hasn't spoken publicly on his plans, including a potential
political career, and declined to comment Wednesday. He was invited
to the convention by Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, who knows Young well, said that so far Young's
political activity has been limited to helping friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's maintained a fairly nonpartisan approach to his
involvement until now,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed with others from the Utah contingent that Young
could be successful in politics in Utah or California.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Young's political persuasion, he has a lot in common
with the convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Young is a lawyer by education, though he has never taken the
bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   California Assemblyman Bruce Thompson said he has talked to
fellow Republicans about Young running for governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is short on potential challengers to Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis and needs someone with name recognition and money, said
Thompson, a friend of Young's aunt and like Young, a practicing
Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, a governor's race would be ''way too big''
for Young, Thompson said. A congressional race in California or a
campaign in Utah would be better, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a star in the area where Republicans are the weakest and
that's the Bay area, and I don't know that you can get a lot of
mileage once he leaves the Bay area,'' Thompson said. ''I mean, the
name recognition is going to be there, but Californians are very
wise. They'll stop and they'll say, 'Who is this guy really?'''
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones, considering a GOP run
against Davis in 2002, said he would like Young to seek statewide
office.
</P>
<P>
   He's ''obviously an outstanding individual in the sports area,
and as far as I know he is a fine individual personally and
professionally,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt spokesman Mike Mower said Utah residents consider Young
''an adopted native son.'' His wife, Sheri, is unabashedly
enthusiastic about the prospect of a Young candidacy -- for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   But Doris Dingle, a delegate and homemaker from Fresno, Calif.,
is reserving judgment until she knows more about Young's political
views.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean I think he's a nice guy, I respect him and I think he
has good moral values and things like that, but there's a lot more
to it in politics,'' said Dingle, a party activist. ''There's a lot
of heavy-duty things that they're responsible for.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 5, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Pedro Martinez improved to 9-0 on the road this
season, pitching a five-hitter as the Boston Red Sox beat the
Seattle Mariners 5-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (13-3) struck out seven and walked two in his fifth
complete game of the season and the 33rd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In six career appearances against Seattle, including five
starts, Martinez is 6-0. He has allowed only 18 hits and five
earned runs to the Mariners, with 66 strikeouts and 14 walks in 45
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra went 2-for-4 and drove in three runs,
improving his major league-leading average to .393.
</P>
<P>
   Four first-inning runs were all Martinez needed against Seattle.
He allowed two-out singles in the third and fifth innings to Mark
McLemore and Carlos Guillen, and three eighth-inning singles by
Guillen, Dan Wilson and Al Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has a 1.20 ERA in 11 road starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox jumped to a 4-0 lead in the first inning. Mariners
starter Freddy Garcia (3-2) walked the first two batters before
Garciaparra hit a one-out double to left-center for two runs. Troy
O'Leary singled and scored with Garciaparra on Jason Varitek's
double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the fifth, Trot Nixon reached first on Garcia's
throwing error. He stole second and came home on Garciaparra's
two-out single to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia pitched well after the first. He allowed seven hits and
five runs, four earned, with three strikeouts and three walks in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored two runs in the eighth. Guillen led off with a
single and went to third on Wilson's single. Guillen scored on
McLemore's groundout, and Wilson came home on Martin's first hit
with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez's streak of five straight games with 10 or more
strikeouts was snapped. He is 3-0 with a 0.75 ERA in three starts
at Safeco Field. ... Boston RHP Ramon Martinez was placed on the
15-day disabled list with a right knee contusion. RHP Rick
Croushore was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket. ... Edgar Martinez
is 1-for-18 (.056) lifetime against Tuesday's starter Tim
Wakefield, and 1-for-14 (.076) against Pedro Martinez. ... Seattle,
which went 7-6 on its longest homestand of the season, still has
the best home record in the AL at 37-19. ... Martin got his first
AL hit in the eighth inning.

Republicans Nominate Bush, Cheney
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans awarded Texas Gov. George W. Bush their 2000
presidential nomination Wednesday night and chanted in unison as running mate
Dick Cheney ignited the convention with a partisan spark. Taunting the
Democrats, he said, ''It's time for them to go.'' Accepting his vice
presidential nomination, Cheney said Al Gore is ''trying to separate himself
from Bill Clinton's shadow, but it won't work. ''Somehow we will never see one
without thinking of the other,'' he said in a speech that drew waves of applause
from Republicans hungry to regain power after eight years out of the White
House.

Childhood Abuse, Adult Stress Linked

   ATLANTA (AP) -- Abuse in early childhood dramatically changes the brain

said the results could lead to profound advances in treatment for depression --
for women and men. The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. Dramatic differences in women based on whether
they had been physically or sexually abused as children came to light when they
were asked to speak in front of a poker-faced audience and to solve tricky math

Speight is under investigation for treason but has not yet been charged with

Previously, a cease-fire by Kashmir's largest guerrilla group had raised hope

<HEADLINE> Fijian Indians Remain Under Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUANIWENI, Fiji (AP) -- Two days after a screaming, cursing mob
torched the house his grandfather built in this lush farming
valley, Gayn Datt weeps at the sight of the ruins as they smolder
under a soft tropical rain.
</P>
<P>
   Datt and his wife were in their own home next door when the mob
arrived, local youths who have been terrorizing ethnic Indian
farmers in this valley for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came up the hill. There was a lot of shouting and
swearing and they were throwing stones. They poured petrol all
around and then whoosh! it was all flames,'' Datt said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Raids, hostage-takings, beatings and burning attacks on the
ethnic Indians of Fiji's small rural communities have become
commonplace since a nationalist uprising on May 19 that toppled the
elected government and started more than 11 weeks of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Datt's nephew and his three children had been living in his
grandfather's house, but fled a few days before the house was
torched because of previous threats by the youths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing left here,'' said Datt's wife, Sapaya. ''No
radio -- stolen. No TV. They killed our milking cow. We haven't
planted any crops for two months -- they told us not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Three homes were razed Monday night in Muaniweni, a hamlet an
hour's drive from Fiji's capital, Suva. The night before, two
houses were set on fire in a nearby town, and others were torched
in previous nights on the northern island of Vanua Levu.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians, descendants of indentured laborers brought to
work Fiji's sugar plantations from 1870s to the 1920s, now make up
44 percent of the South Pacific nation's 814,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming ethnic Indians had too much power and were threatening
Fijian culture, failed businessman George Speight and armed
supporters stormed Parliament on May 19, taking dozens of officials
hostage. Speight demanded the multiracial constitution be scrapped
and the government, the first led by an ethnic Indian, ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Speight tapped a vein of resentment among Fijians toward ethnic
Indians, who have come to dominate business and commerce. A
nationalist rally in Suva the same day as the coup turned into a
riot. Indian-owned shops were looted and burned. Attacks on ethnic
Indians spread into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's military, which imposed martial law to try to stop the
unrest, agreed to Speight's demands to secure the freedom of the
last of the hostages on July 13. Since then, a strongly indigenous
Fijian Cabinet has been appointed to oversee the rewriting of the
constitution ahead of elections, possibly in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people -- mostly ethnic Indians -- are trying to flee
Fiji, afraid for their safety and the potential for financial ruin
following the near-collapse of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's tourism- and sugar export-dependent economy has been
crippled, and could be hurt even more by a large-scale exodus of
ethnic Indians. Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States
and France have imposed limited sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The military has cracked down, arresting Speight and hundreds of
the supporters in Suva. They also have quelled isolated pockets of
rebel support outside the capital, reclaiming a barracks on Vanua
Levu and the main hydropower station.
</P>
<P>
   But although they are becoming less common, attacks on rural
ethnic Indians continue.
</P>
<P>
   The unarmed police appear to have done little to stop the
attacks. At the police post at Muaniweni, inquiries about what was
being done to find those responsible for Monday's rampage were met
with blank stares and shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini said many of the farm
raids have nothing to do with Speight's cause. ''They are just a
criminal element who think they can get away with it and use the
coup as an excuse,'' Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   Politini said the military was moving in to restore security in
the areas of civil instability. There were no soldiers Wednesday in
Muaniweni.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, ties between indigenous Fijians and ethnic
Indians have been strengthened by the trouble. Indigenous Fijians
have taken their neighbors in, providing them with shelter, food
and helping see off the gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But in Muaniweni, ethnic Indian families huddle together in
houses at night, or move into camps in the jungle around their
homes, Sapaya said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police haven't done anything,'' she said. ''Most of the
locals around here have changed since the coup. They used to be
friendly.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Death Penalty Reprieve  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last president to sign a death warrant for
a federal inmate was John F. Kennedy in 1963. One of President
Clinton's last Oval Office decisions may be whether to sign the
next one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday postponed the scheduled execution of a
Texas drug dealer until Dec. 12, five weeks before the close of
Clinton's term. The inmate, Juan Raul Garza, had been set for
execution Aug. 5 at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Garza will use new government procedures to ask
Clinton for clemency, in much the same way that state death-row
inmates make last appeals to their governors.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's Houston attorney, Gregory Wiercioch, said he intends to
ask Clinton to commute Garza's sentence to life in prison without
the possibility of parole. The clemency request will focus on
whether minorities and residents of just a few, mostly southern,
states have been disproportionately sentenced to death under the
federal system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racial disparities ... and where these cases come from makes a
big difference,'' in whether an inmate is sentenced to death,
Wiercioch said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is studying that same question but has
not yet issued a report.
</P>
<P>
   As the Garza execution loomed, the Clinton administration also
began reviewing federal procedures for carrying out the death
penalty, including the apparatus needed to file a clemency appeal.
Justice Department lawyers then decided to write a new set of
rules, which were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new, 10-page clemency guidelines allow an inmate 30 days to
file for clemency after an execution date is set. The Justice
Department then has 90 days to review the request and make a
recommendation to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The rules provide an opportunity for the inmate's attorney to
make an oral presentation to the Justice Department's pardon
attorney. They also provide a chance for families of the victims,
with the assistance of prosecutors in the case, to make their own
oral presentation to the pardon attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The White House indicated last month that Clinton would delay
Garza's execution so that he has the same opportunity to use the
new procedures as would any of the other 20 inmates on federal
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents can grant a reprieve, as was last done in 1937 by
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or they can commute an inmate's sentence
to less than death.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a death penalty supporter, has not commented directly
on the Garza case.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old inmate was convicted in August 1993 in
Brownsville, Texas, of killing three men between April 1990 and
January 1991. A 10-count indictment named him as the boss of a drug
ring that imported tons of marijuana into the United States between
1983 and 1993. He has lost appeals all the way up to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, suspended
executions in that state until a panel could study its fairness.
Thirteen Illinois death row inmates have had their convictions
overturned since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's decision helped propel the question of capital punishment
into the presidential campaign. Both Vice President Al Gore and his
Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, reiterated their
support for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has expressed concern over racial disparities but does not
support a moratorium on executions. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer
said the governor believes executions deter crime but also
''understands the complexity of each individual death penalty
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat who has sought a moratorium on all executions, Sen.
Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, said Clinton's decision to delay the
Garza execution ''was the only fair and just thing to do,
particularly at a time when Americans are increasingly questioning
the fairness of our nation's administration of the death penalty.''

<HEADLINE> Republican Motives Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The question hangs in the air and sometimes
gets answered without being posed: Why are you a Republican?
</P>
<P>
   It's asked directly or framed with raised eyebrows to racial
minorities, gays, people who want to preserve abortion rights,
people who want to clean up rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, George W. Bush's international affairs adviser
and a black woman, answered the question at the Republican National
Convention without being asked, because she knows people wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I found a party that sees me as an individual, not as part of
a group,'' she said from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the stage, Randy Moody, co-chairman of Planned
Parenthood Republicans for Choice, said he gets the question all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Moody recites his background: registered as a Republican in
1964, worked as a college Republican for Barry Goldwater, went to
the 1984 convention as a Nebraska delegate for Ronald Reagan. And
more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not about to let the far right drive me out of the
Republican Party,'' he says. (Goldwater spoke from the right and in
defense of extremism, but favored abortion rights.)
</P>
<P>
   The party nowadays officially opposes affirmative action and gay
rights, wants abortion rights eliminated and excised a reference in
its platform to having a strong federal role in environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it tells minorities ''this is the party of
freedom and progress, and it is your home.'' Bush is trying to
appeal directly to them and to seem inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they reach out, we have to grab that hand,'' Shinae Chun,
an Illinois delegate, said of the party. She was happy to see more
fellow Asian-Americans in her state's crowd than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some find their Republicanism a stigma at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being Hispanic and Republican in Chicago -- it's like a sin,''
said Rene Noriega, an alternate delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe is gay but what drives him on issues is
trade.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 12 years in Congress without discussing his sexuality
but came forward under threat of being ''outed'' when he spoke
against his party's Defense of Marriage Act opposing legal rights
for same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   He finds it inconsistent that his party wants the government out
of everybody's business, except when it comes to their personal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Republican nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, he says, seem to want the government out of
people's personal lives, but in their face in every other respect.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, the Republicans were once strong. On the
Sierra Club's list of the 12 greatest environmental achievements of
the 20th century, President Nixon is credited with five.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republican Theodore Roosevelt IV, great grandson of
President Teddy Roosevelt, a father of the national park system,
reminded the party of that legacy in a speech. But his remarks were
lost in the buzz on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent black Republican, retired Gen. Colin Powell,
criticized Republicans who attack affirmative action in an opening
night speech that cut through the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing his words were two black members of the Utah
delegation, both raised as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   James Evans, 36, who owns an investment company, grew up in
Orangeburg, S.C., home of two traditionally black colleges and many
black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've only seen success within the black community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Wilkinson, 55, was born in Cedar Heights, Md., in a
black section of town and says he ''never went within 20 feet of
whites until I went in the Navy in 1962.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Democratic President Kennedy, he carried the colors at

<HEADLINE> Padres 5, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Matt Clement, who stayed in San Diego despite
many trade rumors, ended his three-game losing streak as the San
Diego Padres topped the Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 Wednesday night
for their fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens had three hits and scored twice as the Padres swept
the three-game series and matched their longest winning streak of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (10-10) allowed two runs and seven hits in 6 2-3
innings. He struck out seven and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Clement matched his win total from last year, when he went
10-12. He avoided losing four consecutive games for the first time
in his two-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees were said to be one of several teams
interested in dealing for Clement before last Monday's trading
deadline passed.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 26th save in 32
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Daal (2-12) fell to 0-2 in two starts since he was obtained
with three others from Arizona for Curt Shilling on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who dropped to 0-6 in his last eight starts, gave up three
runs and six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clement worked past the fourth inning for the first time in
three starts. In his two previous outings, he gave up 16 earned
runs and 17 hits combined in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who let a 5-0 lead in the first inning slip away
Tuesday, took a 3-0 edge in the first this time and stayed ahead
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego made it 5-2 in the seventh on Ruben Rivera's two-run
double off Cliff Politte. Travis Lee later reached over the
left-field fence to rob Bret Boone of a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had two infield singles in his fourth consecutive multihit
game. Over that span, he's gone 10-for-19.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Owens led off with a single and Phil Nevin walked
with two outs. Joe Vitiello hit an RBI double and Wiki Gonzalez
followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville hit a two-out double and came home on Alex Arias'
single to cut Philadelphia's deficit to 3-2 in the seventh. Bobby
Abreu then singled off Kevin Walker, but Heathcliff Slocumb struck
out Scott Rolen to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies scored in the fourth on a RBI single by Lee.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres extended their working relationship with the
Mexicali Aguilas of the Mexican Pacific League for the third
consecutive year, covering the 2000-2001 winter season. Padres
pitcher Mike Darr previously played in Mexicali. ... Phillies
right-handed pitcher Paul Byrd underwent successful arthroscopic
surgery on his right shoulder, performed by Dr. Craig Morgan. Byrd
is expected to miss the rest of the season. ... Right-handed
pitcher Kent Bottenfield, acquired from Anaheim on Sunday, is
scheduled his make his first Philadelphia start on Friday at
Colorado. ... The crowd of 14,1447 set a season low for San Diego.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Nominate George W. Bush  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, building on a
political dynasty spanning three generations, claims the Republican
presidential nomination Thursday night declaring that America needs
a change of leadership to solve the tough problems that President
Clinton and Al Gore failed to fix.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
running mate Dick Cheney told the confetti-filled GOP convention
Wednesday night. ''But the wheel has turned. And it is time, it is
time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Send them home,'' delegates shouted back, taking off their
hats and waving goodbye. Cheney's speech provided the partisan bite
that had been missing in a convention programmed to present a
softer, more moderate face.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would deliver a closing speech that ''speaks from
my heart. I'm going to lift the spirit of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Born to one of America's most prestigious political families,
Bush begins his quest just eight years after his father was forced
from the Oval Office. His grandfather was a U.S. senator from
Connecticut. His brother is the governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In his own prime-time televised address, Bush will share his
disappointment about what he believes is the Clinton-Gore
administration's failure over eight years to improve schools,
reform Social Security, overhaul taxes, beef up the military and
attach some form of prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will talk about the current administration's failure to get
anything done,'' said spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ''The tone will be
regretful rather than critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 54, seeks to become the first presidential son to win the
White House since John Quincy Adams in 1824. Bush enters the race
ahead in the polls and leading a party more united than it's been
in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said ''big changes are coming to Washington'' if Bush
wins in November. He promised Bush ''will repair what has been
damaged'' and ''restore decency and integrity to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney officially won their nominations in a tumultuous
convention gala. Bush watched from his hotel suite a few miles
away. He described himself as ''a tough competitor'' and said,
''I'm going to give it my best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What are we to make of the past eight years?'' Cheney
questioned in his acceptance speech, taking aim at Clinton and
Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting. ''I look at
them,'' Cheney said, ''and see opportunities squandered. The wheel
has turned. And it is time. It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's time-for-them-to-go barb was borrowed from Al Gore's
vice presidential speech before the Democratic convention in 1992,
aimed at then-President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney presented his credentials as a former congressman, White
House chief of staff, defense secretary and business executive. He
said that Gore would try to pull away from Clinton to be his own
man. ''But we will never see one without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton and Gore came in together. ''Now let us see them
off together,'' he chortled.
</P>
<P>
   At Cheney's behest, the convention paused to convey good wishes
to former President Ford, hospitalized after suffering perhaps two
strokes in Philadelphia. Doctors said Ford should recover
completely.
</P>
<P>
   The final night of the convention belongs to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a generational theme woven through Bush's
acceptance speech, noting that this is the first election since
World War II without a candidate of that generation. ''What will
our generation do?'' Hughes said Bush would ask.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the speech is doing is saying we have a unique moment,
because with our prosperity and relative peace we have the means to
tackle the tough problems before they create a crisis for our
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Untested on the international stage, Bush hopes his speech will
demonstrate that his business background and two terms as governor
have given him the skills to lead the nation, keep the economy
booming and deal with problems abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''My fellow Americans,'' he said in a practice run at the
convention microphone, ''I accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush makes that declaration official in closing the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to get a word in edgewise, faxing and phoning
statements to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much for the Republicans' positive campaign,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane. ''Tonight they're turning the clock back
with a card-carrying conservative member of the Republican old
guard. They're engaging in the only type of Republican politics
they know: attack politics.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-page rebuttal from Gore's campaign claimed Cheney had
delivered ''one of the most negative Republican convention speeches
since Pat Buchanan. The mask is off the GOP masquerade ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's biography invites father-son comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush left his boyhood home in West Texas to follow
his father's footsteps at prep school in Andover, Mass., Yale
University and the secret Skull and Bones society. He also got an
M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he became a fighter pilot -- he was in the Texas
Air National Guard, his dad was a combat pilot in World War II --
and went into the oil business in Texas. When the oil bust hit, he
moved on, eventually buying the Texas Rangers baseball team, aided
by family connections and a willing group of investors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bush ran for governor against popular incumbent Ann
Richards in 1994 and pulled off an upset. Four years later he
easily won re-election.

<HEADLINE> Guam GOP Seeks Recognition  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Be honest, now: Do you know where Guam is?
Do you even know WHAT Guam is?
</P>
<P>
   In a geographically challenged nation where even questions about
Wyoming's whereabouts can consternate, many folks accosted at the
Republican National Convention had to admit ignorance. And that's
what Guam's GOP delegation is here to combat.
</P>
<P>
   They came from 17 hours away -- from America's most distant
territory. They rode three airplanes to get here. And what they're
doing this week, tiny as they are, is thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are proud and patriotic Americans living on America's
frontier,'' said Fred Castro, Guam's delegation chairman, who wears
a little gold elephant on his plum blazer. ''We're an integral part
of the American framework.''
</P>
<P>
   In the roiling sea of power brokers that is the Republican
convention, getting any attention can be a real trick. But David
Sablan, a 47-year-old insurance broker and Guam's GOP chairman, can
rattle off a dozen reasons why ''mainlanders'' should listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Americans say they have to protect their borders, they're
thinking of California,'' Sablan said. ''Guam can be our forward
post. We're not just a little supply base.''
</P>
<P>
   Guam, an island home to 145,000 people and the slogan ''Where
America's Day Begins,'' is the westernmost American territory,
ceded in 1898 after the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a possession, not a state. And its distance -- 8,902
miles from Congress -- makes it difficult for Guamanians to chart an
American destiny.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military, for example, has long been a crucial part of
Guam. But 1990s base closures downsized the presence and left
islanders facing a ''brain drain.'' Guam had little recourse, and
the 1997 Asian economic crisis didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ''This idea that federal employees are too expensive -- well,
guess what? The island is in turmoil,'' said Manny Cruz, a James
Earl Jones lookalike who heads the American Federation of
Government Employees in Guam and is an alternate delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Guam rises and falls on the mainland's fortunes. During and
after World War II, when many who fought in the South Pacific had
seen them firsthand, Guam and American Samoa seemed more real to
Americans. But in recent decades, many Guamanians feel distant
means ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to the territories, the American bias is more in
terms of apathy and ignorance,'' said Mike Young, a Penn State
Harrisburg political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason these Guamanians look to the Republican Party,
which they say treats them better than the government. Twelve of 15
seats in Guam's unicameral legislature are Republican-held. And
while its delegation to Congress has no vote, its four GOP
convention delegates cast votes as powerful, if not as numerous, as
any state's.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, in matching print shirts, they did just that,
giving their four votes to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though we are still maturing politically, we know who
will best serve our island and our nation as president,'' shouted
Guam's House speaker, Antonio R. Unpingco. On the same day, the new
GOP platform acknowledged Guam as a ''strategically vital U.S.
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guamanians aren't the only ones saying ''we're here'' this
week. Representatives of America's Dangerfield Belt -- those who
feel they don't get no respect -- are out in force, fighting the
assumption of irrelevance that Comedy Central's Jon Stewart
personified when he described the convention as a ''week-long
festival of diversity, inclusion and the obligatory nod to American
Samoa.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, for example, found District of Columbia
Councilman David Catania on the convention floor urging that
district residents be allowed to vote in Congress. The U.S. Virgin
Islands delegation is here. And from Puerto Rico, the most
politically powerful of the non-mainland territories, came delegate
Miriam Ramirez, a statehood advocate upset she can't be heard in
Washington -- even though she's an American.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many people here think we're foreign,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from American Samoa, whose territory was misspelled as
''Somoa'' in the official media guide, were more sanguine. Amata
Radewagen, who co-presided over the nominating process Wednesday
night in a long dress festooned with pachyderms, said her
appointment as a convention officer -- the first from a territory --
''speaks volumes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm from a little island, and here I am,'' she said. ''It's a
recognition of what the Republican Party thinks of the territories.
Awareness is increasing every day.''

<HEADLINE> Troops Restore Order To Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A shaky calm has returned to
Venezuela's provinces after violent protests that broke out over
disputed election results.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person was killed and a dozen others injured
Tuesday when supporters of President Hugo Chavez clashed with
opposition backers in several states where results of gubernatorial
races were being contested.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of army troops were called in to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Several incumbent opposition governors who lost by thin margins
in Sunday's elections said they would challenge the results in
court but urged their supporters to refrain from violence.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans re-elected Chavez by a landslide in Sunday's polls,
which were required by a new constitution Chavez pushed through
last year that called for public offices to be ''re-legitimized.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez broke into Venezuela's national scene eight years ago by
staging a failed military coup. He became president in February
1999 promising a ''social revolution'' for the poor, and during the
latest campaign repeatedly called opposition candidates
''counterrevolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   International observers said the elections appeared relatively
transparent, but urged an investigation into complaints of
irregularities. Several opposition leaders have asked the foreign
monitors to stay to scrutinize the outcome more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Calderon, governor of the western state of Tachira, said
he will challenge a controversial decision by the electoral board
to give his opponent the votes of a third candidate who dropped
out, thus denying him re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In the Andean state of Merida, ousted governor William Davila
huddled with his lawyers to outline a strategy to contest the
results, which had him losing by a mere 1,686 votes. Davila said
9,500 ''invalid'' votes suggest fraud. With Davila's defeat,
Chavez' adversaries would lose one of their most respected and
popular leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Davila thought it was impossible for him to lose. He has the
right to protest because this is a democracy but it is
irresponsible for him to call this fraud,'' said the man who beat
him in the polls, Florencio Porras, a Chavez supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's clashes between Davila's and Chavez' supporters
injured nine people, blocked roads and forced local businesses to
close. Head of Merida military operations Jorge Garcia said the
violence subsided Wednesday and traffic and business activity
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said Tuesday his coalition would continue fighting for
its candidates in disputed elections. ''We're consolidating our
revolution, and like any battle, we have to care for it up to the
last bit of territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez' leftist political coalition won 14 of the country's 23
states and a simple majority in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Congress Candidates Seek Donors  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The congressional candidate listened
patiently to the Arkansas businessman talk about his heart attack,
his insurance business, his taxes. He reached for a notebook in his
breast pocket. ''Do you have a card?'' he interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mike Ferguson, a Republican, wants to represent New
Jersey, he didn't miss the chance to jot down the name of a
possible donor from halfway across the land. ''I'll keep you
posted,'' Ferguson promised.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he strode across a stage, took a quill from a Ben
Franklin impersonator and signed his name on a ''Small Business
Declaration of Freedom'' -- as hundreds of business owners watched.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quadrennial ritual for congressional wannabes: flocking
to the nominating conventions and working the periphery, hoping to
connect with out-of-state donors and drum up money for fall
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real action at this convention is taking place outside the
convention hall, in the hospitality suites and the railroad cars,
all these areas where lobbyists are talking to lawmakers,'' said
Larry Makinson, head of the Center for Responsive Politics, which
studies political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, a teacher making his second bid for Congress in a
closely watched congressional race, has worked a lengthy list of
cocktail receptions with his chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got stacks of business cards, and we'll follow up once
we get back home,'' explained William A. Milligan, Ferguson's
finance director.
</P>
<P>
   John Dorso, a GOP House candidate in North Dakota, was equally
busy.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a luncheon thrown by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
got introduced to a lobbyist for DaimlerChrysler by House Majority
Leader Dick Armey and hooked up with General Motors executives
through aides of House Republican Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just glad-handing folks, and handing out (contribution)
envelopes,'' Dorso said.
</P>
<P>
   Such candidates are getting plenty of help. The Republican Party
and many interest groups, like the National Federation of
Independent Business, which sponsored the event Ferguson attended,
have staged events in Philadelphia to facilitate all the hand
shaking and business-card-swapping.
</P>
<P>
   And though leaders of the sometimes unpopular GOP-led Congress
have been conspicuously absent from the televised portions of the
convention, they have worked furiously behind the scenes to help
candidates like Ferguson find national donors.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was selected as one of a few GOP aspirants given a
moment on stage during the televised portion of the convention to
introduce themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all by design,'' explained Rep. J.C. Watts, the No. 4
Republican in the House. ''Members don't mind. And putting our
newest challengers up front helps to show the country and those who
support us that we have diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking hands over and over again, Ferguson has a finely honed
pitch. To some, he harkens to his background as a teacher because
''businesses understand we need new workers prepared for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, he stresses his experience starting a small
consulting business and his understanding of how too much
regulation and excessive taxes can stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   James Davis, the Arkansas insurance businessman who talked to
Ferguson at the small business reception, found the candidate
sympathetic to his hopes that Congress eliminate the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you reach this level and you have a little bit of
success, then they want to take it away from you,'' Davis lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson gave an understanding nod, before moving on to greet
others. Eventually, he bumped into Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia,
offering a succinct reason why he had to work so many receptions
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just spent $900,000 to win the primary. And now I'm going to
need $1.2 million for the fall,'' Ferguson said.

<HEADLINE> Fed: Big Banks Charge Big Fees  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's largest banks charge significantly
more for services than smaller banks that do business in only one
state, the Federal Reserve has found in an annual survey of bank
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed report, released Wednesday, also found that the number
of banks offering free checking account services dropped to 10.8
percent in 1999, compared with 17.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The number of savings and loans with free checking account
services rose to 30 percent last year, compared with 23.4 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the difference in fees between big banks that operate in a
number of states and small banks, the Fed said, ''Most of the fees
charged by multistate banks were on average significantly higher
than those charged by single-state banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed report found the average bounced check fee at a
single-state bank was $17.04 last year, compared with $21.80
charged by big banks.
</P>
<P>
   Small banks charged on average $14.50 for a stop-payment order,
compared with $20.10 for big banks, the central bank found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on inquiries with 1,000 financial
institutions, also showed that more banks offer minimum-balance
accounts, in which customers pay flat monthly fees as long as their
balances remain above a certain amount.
</P>
<P>
   It found 40.6 percent of banks offering such accounts, compared
with 35.6 percent in 1998. The average monthly charge dropped last
year by 28 cents to $6.15, compared with $6.43 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report will be the Fed's final survey on bank fees
unless Congress reauthorizes the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the disparity illustrates a need for
legislative oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report continues to show that bigger banks continue to
charge bigger fees,'' said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program
director for U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Mierzwinski said his group, which also has studied bank charges,
has found that more banks charge customers for services that once
were free, such as assessments for transactions involving tellers
or the return of canceled checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regular checking account service fees are not going up that
much, but banks are adding new fees. You are getting less but
paying more,'' Mierzwinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry officials defended the more prevalent fees as a
way to hold down basic charges.
</P>
<P>
   John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association,
said a survey the ABA did last month showed that 59 percent of bank
customers pay $3 or less for monthly bank services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bank fee structures have really gone from a one-size-fits-all
approach to a pay-as-you-go approach,'' Hall said. ''You only pay
for the services you use, rather than having one fee structure
subsidize everyone.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders In Convention Background  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Attentive viewers of the Republican National
Convention might have caught the brief speech Wednesday night by
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, one of the few GOP leaders from
Capitol Hill who got a share of the prime-time limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Lott, of Mississippi, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert
of Illinois have been relegated to mundane convention tasks such as
wielding the opening gavel. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both from George W. Bush's home state of
Texas, haven't been seen at the podium at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 4 House Republican and only black GOP member of
Congress, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, has appeared regularly to
introduce speakers and perform other duties in prime time, along
with Reps. Jennifer Dunn of Washington state and Henry Bonilla of
Texas, a Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, each of the three have the title ''permanent co-chair''
of the convention, in yet another carefully scripted effort by the
GOP to appeal to minorities, women and groups that don't always
vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dark-suited lawmakers intoning their Capitol Hill
rhetoric, Republicans found ''real people'' to give short addresses
about tax cuts, reducing government regulations, welfare and Social
Security. Dunn said this lack of prominent legislative talk was
part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted this to be a real-life convention,'' Dunn said. ''We
didn't want just policy people up there. We wanted people who are
really living it.''
</P>
<P>
   If they feel slighted, no congressional leaders have said so
publicly or privately, several lawmakers said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''My personal opinion is, people see enough of us on C-SPAN,''
said Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. ''This is a time for the Bush
campaign to talk about what they want to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   For House members, all 435 of whom are up for re-election this
year, the conventions are more valuable for the fund-raisers
organized by DeLay and other leaders and the contact with delegates
who can help with their campaigns back home.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has regular contact with Capitol Hill leaders
at the staff level and coordinates with the committees that direct
money and resources into congressional races. Bush himself has kept
Congress at arm's length, but there have been no recurrences of
last year's criticism that GOP leaders would ''balance the budget
on the backs of the poor'' if they pushed to curtail a low-income
tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since then, I haven't heard a lot of grumbling,'' said Rep.
Steve Chabot of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   If they haven't been picked for prime time, GOP leaders have run
a popular party circuit. Hastert attracted big-money donors to a
morning fly-fishing trip at nearby Valley Forge and the ''Lott
Hop'' early 1960s theme party over the weekend was packed with
revelers. DeLay has held a series of events at a site just outside
the convention hall and Armey is hosting a big country music soiree
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every event is a political event. That's what it's all about,
introducing people,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Countries Seek Democracy Lessons  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Macedonia sent an observer to the Republican
National Convention to get some tips on democracy-building because
''the U.S. way is the way to freedom.'' Azerbaijan wanted to get up
to speed ahead of its parliamentary elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the hundreds of ambassadors, lawmakers and other
government officials from around the world who are in Philadelphia
for a first-hand look at the American political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to establish a system of democracy,'' said
Macedonian observer Igor Popov, whose country didn't exist the last
time the Republicans won the White House. ''We base our model on
the U.S. model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan sent two embassy officials in advance of its
parliamentary elections -- contests the opposition is already
criticizing as undemocratic because of laws that would prevent some
parties from participating.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have only eight years of independence,'' said Elmar
Mamedyarov, an embassy counselor. ''We are still in transition from
communism to democracy. ... It's quite important, these events, (to
see) if they can be incorporated or not.''
</P>
<P>
   China sent a 14-member delegation to Philadelphia. ''The trip is
designed in effect to educate, in a very discreet and courteous
way,'' said Allen Weinstein, president of the Washington-based
Center for Democracy, which is hosting the Chinese delegation here
and at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles. ''The key is to
recognize that this is a long-range process. It's not going to
transform itself in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials say the number of foreign dignitaries
attending this year's convention is greater than previous years --
in part because ambassadors could make the trip easily from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadors from 135 countries and their spouses are arriving
Thursday on a special luxury train for a day of foreign policy
briefings, sightseeing, dinner and watching George W. Bush's speech
accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Corporate members
of Potomac Exchange, a nonpartisan group, are funding the trip.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's U.S. ambassador, James Bolger, said he was
attending both the Republican and Democratic conventions to assess
the candidates' trade, security, economic and foreign policies and
how they might affect his country.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Gaoshan, a member of the Chinese delegation, was more
blunt: ''We are here to get to know some information about party
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 12-member parliamentary delegation from across the
Taiwan Straits said it was more interested in influencing party
policy than learning about it.
</P>
<P>
   Parris Chang, chairman of the foreign relations committee in
Taiwan's parliament, said he hoped to convince Republican
decisionmakers that their support of a ''one China'' policy was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His delegation hosted a cocktail reception at Philadelphia's
Academy of Fine Art. ''The Bush administration should go a huge
step further to differentiate itself from the Clinton
administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Pomper, a professor of political science at Rutgers
University, said foreign governments could learn from the American
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a country in which we pass power uncomplainingly,''
Pomper said. ''And when you think of Serbia ... this is a very
relatively rare and very precious thing and we do have something to
offer.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Is Kicked Off 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Birthday girl Jordan got a gift from ''Big
Brother'' viewers: She got the hook.
</P>
<P>
   The former stripper Wednesday night became the second of 10
contenders to be booted from the camera- and microphone-bugged
house on the CBS ''reality'' series, which airs the residents'
antics six nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a Minneapolis resident who turned 27 Wednesday, and
Curtis, a New York City lawyer, were marked for expulsion by a
house vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   Then viewers took over. In a phone poll, 78 percent of callers
picked Jordan for banishment. Curtis was chosen by 22 percent. CBS
would not divulge how many people voted.
</P>
<P>
   The last remaining houseguest when the series concludes in
September will win a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was conveyed to Jordan by Julie Chen, who anchored
the live hour from a Los Angeles studio adjoining the house.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling bravely, Jordan hugged her housemates in the living room
and again on the front doorstep. She toted her backpack and dragged
her swimming-pool raft down the front walk. Outside the chain-link
fence, she embraced her waiting boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the studio, she faced a debriefing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen asked Jordan her reaction to being out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel foreign to everyone outside the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Was she surprised that she made such a negative impression?
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on how they edited me,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Would she consider posing for a nude pictorial?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd consider it,'' she said, ''but the chances are close to
none.''
</P>
<P>
   During the program, viewers were given a glimpse of the
Minneapolis topless club where Jordan danced for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''She will come back,'' predicted Blake, one of her former
colleagues. ''She hasn't cleaned out her locker.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast also included instant analysis from Dr. Drew
Pinsky, known as a health and relationship specialist. The viewers,
he told Chen, ''are tending to vote out people who create
instability in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The first to be ousted two weeks ago was William, a 27-year-old
youth counselor and black activist from Philadelphia. He had spent
much of his time fighting with fellow residents.
</P>
<P>
   Since ''Big Brother'' premiered on July 5, Jordan had similarly
tried her housemates' patience. She was characterized by several of
them as a manipulator and provocateur.
</P>
<P>
   She displayed wide mood swings, on one occasion seen weeping in
bed in the middle of the night. ''I'm totally losing it right
now,'' she wailed into her body mike, ''and I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   While each week's five other episodes are taped highlights,
''Big Brother'' features an around-the-clock Web site that streams
live sight and sound.
</P>
<P>
   It was here on computer screens that Jordan could be spied
preparing for the worst Wednesday, an hour before she learned her
fate on the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bought such cute clothes for the show,'' she declared,
packing her things.

<HEADLINE> Dot-Com Convention Coverage Varies  </HEADLINE>
By ANICK JESDANUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Take an instant poll. Chat with fellow viewers.
Play a game of ''electoral chess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers all this and more in its attempt to promote
greater audience participation in the Republican National
Convention. The interactive features return Thursday night, as
George W. Bush gives his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   But promises often sound better than reality. The convention has
been highly scripted, and the Internet by itself was powerless to
change that. Even the Net's bells and whistles couldn't improve its
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Chat rooms allowed viewers to set the agenda, and participants
generally chose to discuss anything but the convention.
</P>
<P>
   At CNN, MSNBC and Pseudo, chat rooms often became forums to bash
Bush, President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and fellow Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   During Dick Cheney's speech Wednesday accepting the GOP vice
presidential nomination, chatters continued off-topic discussions.
More often than not, the few comments on Cheney's record were
unrelated to his floor remarks.
</P>
<P>
   One chatter going by the name ''Boring'' kept interjecting such
comments as ''Cheney is boring.'' Another chatter responded, ''Gore
invented boring.'' Yet another, ''Boring is boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Roberts, a political communications specialist at the
University of Florida, said the text-based assaults reduce the
Net's usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are to have substantive discussions and this be truly
interactive, we must learn civility.''
</P>
<P>
   TV call-in programs on C-SPAN and other cable stations offered
viewer participation with fewer distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites had instant polls to engage viewers. America Online
visitors voted on such items as pro wrestler The Rock's role as a
convention speaker. AOL immediately displayed results and discussed
them with its guest, former Miss America Nicole Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But such online polls, even on meaningful topics, are
unscientific and reveal nothing about the mood of the general
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, news organizations tried to marry television and
the Net. Pseudo's David Bohrman suggested earlier that viewers turn
off TV and tune in to his site's TV-like coverage. But viewers
could have missed an entire speech just getting their computers
configured properly.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN repeatedly directed viewers to its Web site to ask
questions and join a chat. Cable's Fox News Channel displayed an
e-mail address and Web site. Peter Jennings concluded the evening
news with the site for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC's site allowed Internet users to send questions to NBC
News anchor Tom Brokaw and its floor reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Also at MSNBC was an ''electoral chess'' feature that lets
viewers play campaign manager, figuring how to get the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidential election. An online
quiz on convention history required viewers to watch cable TV for
answers. CNN's site had an adjustable map of the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   SpeakOut.com promised MSNBC viewers an on-screen dial to
register what they liked or disliked about each speaker. But, in a
reminder of technology's limits, the site crashed shortly before
Cheney spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Yet broadcast veteran Sam Donaldson opened a Webcast at the ABC
News site with a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm telling you, folks, in another four or eight, 12 years at
the outside, there won't be any convention on television,'' he
said. ''It will be all on the Internet.''

<HEADLINE> Gerald Ford Recovering From Stroke  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As Gerald Ford continued his recovery,
doctors defended their diagnosis of a sinus infection the night
before they determined he had suffered one and possibly two small
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the former president had complained of soreness in
his face, but asked only for pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that the care that he was given ... by the
emergency room was appropriate,'' Dr. Steven Klasko, associate dean
of clinical affairs at Hahnemann University Hospital, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford went from the Republican National Convention to the
hospital for about a half-hour Tuesday night and was given
antibiotics. He returned Wednesday morning with slurred speech and
difficulties with balance.
</P>
<P>
   Neurological exams confirmed he had suffered at least one mild
stroke, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Schwartzman, the hospital's chief of neurology, said
the stroke was not initially detected because ''it looks like an
ear infection.'' He said Ford's private doctor had been treating
him for pain in his face and tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was listed in serious condition, but the hospital and
his aide said his condition had improved Wednesday evening. He is
expected to remain hospitalized for five or six days and is being
treated with drugs to prevent his blood from clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Calvin McDowell, said Ford has not questioned the
hospital's diagnoses and believes the staff ''has been nothing but
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said it is easy to misdiagnose a stroke -- most commonly
caused by a blood clot in the brain -- because many of the symptoms
look like other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Saver, neurological director of the UCLA Stroke
Center, said as many as 5 percent of all strokes are initially
misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''All too often, patients wish to deny that a stroke may be
occurring,'' he said. ''Frequently, they are denying the symptoms,
and are waiting, hoping it will pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Satz, head of Hahnemann's emergency room, said Ford
had ''absolutely a normal neurologic exam'' Tuesday and that ''all
he sought at that time was pain relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was treated appropriately and discharged as per his
wishes,'' Satz said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also were asked if Ford's health was endangered because
he wasn't immediately treated with an effective clot-busting drug.
But Dr. Carole Thomas, director of the neurointensive care unit at
Hahnemann, said that even if the stroke had been diagnosed earlier,
Ford's symptoms were too mild to use the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Saver said the drug can cause bleeding in the brain and is used
only in cases where the risk of a severe stroke outweighs the
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Ford's stroke, suffered in the back of his brain,
showed no bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should totally recover,'' Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they believed mild arterial disease caused the clot
in Ford's brain stem, the part of the brain that controls balance,
speech and other faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman said they suspected Ford also suffered a mild stroke
a day earlier, but there was no evidence of brain damage or
permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   The health problems of the nation's 38th president dampened the
mood at an otherwise jubilant GOP celebration. Well wishes came
from President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former president
George Bush, and the presumptive Republican nominee, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young, former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers,
opened the session with a prayer in which he sought ''a time of
healing'' for Ford and wife Betty, who was at his bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was appointed vice president by Richard Nixon, and sworn in
as president in August 1974 after Nixon resigned in the midst of
the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ford later pardoned Nixon -- an act widely believed to have
contributed to his loss to Jimmy Carter in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Protests at Convention  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With more than 300 activists still in jail,
protests aimed at the Republican convention were quiet and peaceful
Wednesday, a day after demonstrators clashed with police and
snarled traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we may have disorganized them yesterday,'' Deputy
Commissioner Sylvester Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   A few small protests popped up around town, and activists held
banners and signs at several locations to greet George W. Bush, who
arrived Wednesday to accept the party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet demonstrations contrasted to Tuesday evening's mayhem,
which led to 300 arrests. At least 10 demonstrators were charged
with felonies for assaulting an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were not expected to be released from jail before
the convention ends Thursday. Processing is delayed because many
have refused to give their names, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner John Timoney was one of 15 officers slightly
injured in clashes with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, about 40 demonstrators denouncing the death penalty
and calling attention to other issues chanted and waved banners at
an entrance to a downtown arena when Bush arrived for a noon
fund-raiser. They were surrounded by about 50 police officers as
Bush entered through another door.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is these people don't represent the people of this
country and they are constantly arguing in favor of corporate
America,'' said 16-year-old Tuck Young. ''We have to hit the
streets and try to gain the support of the people of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, about 120 Democrats posted 20 flags representing
Spanish-speaking countries outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art,
where Bush addressed a Hispanic audience. The demonstrators said
they were unhappy with Bush's record on Latino issues in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia officials said most convention delegates did not
even notice Tuesday's protests unless they watched television.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who came into Philadelphia today didn't even realize
that anything happened in Philadelphia overnight,'' Philadelphia
Managing Director Joe Martz said.

<HEADLINE> Delegates Re-enact 'Rocky's Run'  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Bounding up the steps, sweating in the
stifling midday heat, Jose Mendoza revels in the struggle to fill
the shoes of his favorite icon.
</P>
<P>
   After running six miles through the crowded streets, the
74-year-old fitness buff used a final burst of energy to leap up
the 80 steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, just like a certain
fictional boxer who will forever be associated with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks the movie ''Rocky'' has been forgotten only
needs to sit on the city's most famous stairs for 10 minutes, where
he lives on with his fans. Every. Single. Day.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, an adviser to the Montana delegation, was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway up the stairs, a group of art connoisseurs sneer at the
shameless celebration of pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza continues, undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty more steps.
</P>
<P>
   Three street sweepers perched on a fountain break into the
familiar theme -- da-da-da, da-da-dum.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping up the last steps, Mendoza's face bursts into a smile
and he victoriously trots around in a circle, finally leaping into
the air with his hands toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to make this run just like the main man did before
his big fight,'' Mendoza said, huffing and puffing with his hands
on his knees. ''He did it and obviously it worked for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rocky,'' which stared Sylvester Stallone as a
tough-guy-turned-boxer, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1976, the
year it was released. In the scene before the boxer's climactic
fight, Rocky runs through urban Philadelphia, and finally, up the
steps.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years and four sequels later, out-of-towners still
make special trips to the stairs just for the purpose of running to
the top.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a movie, but if you see it enough times, it begins
to seem real,'' said Darrel Hargrove, a 27-year-old lawyer who
makes the run daily. ''When you think of these steps, you think of
Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third movie, the city puts a sculpture of the boxer at
the top of the steps. That statue stood on the steps, in real life,
for more than a decade. The museum made the decision to remove the
statue two years ago. It remains outside a sports arena, but some
fans still grumble about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have left it here,'' said 44-year-old Timothy
Smith, a lawyer. ''It wasn't art, but it was about courage and
determination and inner strength, which are all very beautiful
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Art lovers have long questioned the memorial to a fictional
character.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't even that good of a sculpture,'' said Jessica
Hansen. ''It doesn't look like him. Maybe people should spend more
time inside the museum.''

<HEADLINE> Foreign Delegates Reflect on Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Solomon Yue remembers electing
his class
president in school.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''The teacher would come to you and say, 'You vote for this
guy,''' he says. That's the way things were in China, where he grew
up during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about freedom, about the democratic
process,'' says Yue, now 41 and an Oregon delegate to the
Republican convention. Few outside his delegation know how long Yue
has struggled to be able to make his vote count.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't tell his story often, and when he's asked he starts
slowly and chooses his words. His grandfather was a tailor -- a
capitalist -- and when the Cultural Revolution began in 1976, his
whole family was suspect.
</P>
<P>
   When Yue was 7 he watched Red Guards storm his house and destroy
everything of value. School ended that year, and re-education camp
began. He was forced to work in factories and in the fields, eating
only rice and sleeping on dirt floors covered with straw.
</P>
<P>
   The political re-education was a brainwashing, Yue said -- but it
certainly didn't take. Teachers tried everything to shut him up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was labeled a troubled kid, a spiritual polluter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the revolution ended with the death of its leader, Mao
Tse-tung, and the arrest of his supporters. The pressure eased on
Yue, although he still rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather, who had earlier fled to Hong Kong, arranged a
scholarship for him to Alaska Pacific University. He arrived in
Alaska knowing two English phrases: Thank you and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   He was fascinated by a man on TV who seemed to speak about
everything Yue had gotten in trouble for saying in China. The year
was 1980 and the man was Ronald Reagan. Yue asked a friend to
translate and was riveted by Reagan's speeches on freedom and
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was almost my entire life's thinking being ratified
somehow, being confirmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He worked two jobs to put himself through college and got
married. In 1990, Yue and his wife, a doctor, moved to Salem, Ore.,
where she opened a clinic and he started a latex glove business.
</P>
<P>
   This convention, Yue's first as a delegate, has been dismissed
by some as a pep rally. Yue can't stand that kind of talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is to protect freedom,'' he said. ''To be able to
sort through what is real, and what is not.''

<P>
   Hours after grenades showered a seven-car procession on a Cuban
road, destroying six vehicles but missing the one carrying Fidel
Castro, a conspirator got a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're coming for you,'' said the voice on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   No longer could Manuel Rebuelta, Cuba's minister of health,
remain cloaked in the perception he still supported Castro's
revolution. He grabbed two machine guns, kissed his wife goodbye,
and fled for the Brazilian embassy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 years later, Rebuelta is engaged in a process to
nominate a democratic president. Make no mistake, though -- that's
''democratic'' with a little ''d.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuelta has become one of Georgia's most active Republicans and
is an alternate delegate at GOP's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Rebuelta was on Castro's side in the revolt
against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   Castro tapped Rebuelta, a doctor, as the movement's health
minister because Rebuelta was already in charge of the hospitals
where wounded rebels were taken. But when Castro ordered a shipment
of unsanitary beef exported to the United States, Rebuelta refused
to sign off, enraging the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuelta decided to take a chance and call on a fellow official
who he suspected also had concerns about Castro's plans. His hunch
was correct -- the official had been stockpiling weapons to stage a
revolt against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   When their plot failed, Rebuelta escaped to Brazil, where he
spent three years before heading to Puerto Rico and then Atlanta.
His parents and wife joined him there later.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great enthusiast, a smiling spokesperson for
anti-Communism,'' said Georgia Republican chairman Chuck Clay.
''Nobody can question whether he has paid his dues.''

   Winston Wilkinson and James Evans, two black alternate delegates
from overwhelmingly white Utah, took very different paths to the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, from a state where blacks make up less than 1
percent of the population, both began their political lives as
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson, 55, said he has worked hard to overcome racism.
Eventually, he converted to Mormonism and went to work for
church-owned Brigham Young University. He is a candidate for Salt
Lake County Council.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 36, who plans to run for state GOP chairman next summer,
is a lifelong Baptist who owns his own investment company. He
insists that he has never felt the effects of segregation or racism
-- not where he grew up in Orangeburg, S.C., or in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't necessarily believe that a lot of the negative
experiences are because of race. We've been taught to discount
personality,'' he said. ''Whether you're black, white, conservative
or liberal, that shouldn't effect whether you're liked or
disliked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson was born in Cedar Heights, Md., where he said a
section of town fenced off with barbed wire kept blacks segregated.
''I never went within 20 feet of whites until I went in the Navy in
1962.''
</P>
<P>
   He was assigned to the military honor guard in Washington, D.C.,
and President Kennedy made him a member of the special unit that
carries the colors at White House ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   He later became a Muslim and a follower of Malcolm X.
Eventually, after getting business and law degrees from Howard
University, he got involved in Republican politics. He works as a
fund-raiser at Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Both men welcome George W. Bush's efforts to show the GOP's
diversity and attract more minorities, moderates and independent
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been waiting so long for the party to put this kind of
face on it,'' Wilkinson said. ''I'm not going to let Democrats tear
that down.''

<HEADLINE> Roll Call Delivers Amusement  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ohio: ''The state that is earning a
reputation as the reading state of America...''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma: ''A state that understands the future belongs to
conservative governance...''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico: ''The window of American democracy in the
Caribbean...''
</P>
<P>
   South Dakota: ''The pheasant capital of the world....''
</P>
<P>
   For the nostalgic, it is one of the few reminders of how
conventions used to be. For old timers' sake, choreographers of the
Republican convention allowed the roll call of the states one more
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a streamlined convention, the roll call offered the
chance to engage in old-fashioned, not-made-for-television,
oratorical horseplay, a rolling reminder that the United States
remains composed of 50 individual and somewhat eccentric entities.
</P>
<P>
   The powers that reconfigured the convention to fit a ''different
kind of Republican'' allowed this institution to stay, even if
truncated over four nights out of fear of boredom.
</P>
<P>
   And so Wednesday night the states that came toward the end of
the alphabet got the chance to point with pride and make puns with
impunity. After all, it occurred before prime time, and the
networks weren't watching.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee took its turn to chide the forthcoming Democratic
presidential candidate, of indisputable Tennessee roots, Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tennessee: ''We look forward to his return to Tennessee as
a private citizen in January 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota made hay of its rural heritage. It called itself
''the safest state in the union,'' and said, ''We have clean air
and short commutes.''
</P>
<P>
   And Texas, home of the party's new nominee, George W. Bush,
permitted itself to engage in some geopolitical braggadocio: ''From
the vast prairies of the Red River country to the piney woods of
East Texas, from the rolling hills of Central Texas to the sandy
beaches of the Texas Gulf Coast, from the booming metropolises of
Dallas and Houston to the towns that border on the Rio Grande ... A
Texas where no dream is too small and no dream is too grand ... A
Texas where diversity is more than a goal, it's who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because the gavel was fixed on keeping to schedule and
because it comes near the end of the call, Utah made a short claim
none could dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Utah called itself ''the only state that starts with 'U.'''

<HEADLINE> Asian Attacks Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine authorities arrested the
main suspect in a series of sexual assaults in the United States, a
government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration chief Rufus Rodriguez said Mark Anthony Lewis, 33,
of Chicago, was arrested by immigration agents at a seaside mall.
Lewis' passport had been canceled and he was to be deported
Thursday evening, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis denied any involvement in the attacks against Asian women
and a Hispanic woman in the Chicago area that began in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not flee the U.S.,'' Lewis said. ''As for these charges
of me assaulting anyone, they are totally uncorroborated by
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I surrendered because I didn't want anyone to get hurt and I
wanted to prove my innocence,'' he added. ''If I was guilty, I
should have kept hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had family and friends in the Philippines and his
visit had been planned earlier. Lewis arrived in Manila on July 21,
two days after the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is suspected of having attacked at least eight Asian women
and one Hispanic woman beginning April 7. The attacker posed as a
census taker, a police officer, an FBI agent and an immigration
officer to get into the women's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police said victims identified him through photographs.
Lewis' car, they said, matches the description of a car used by a
man in one of the attacks. Clothing and other items described by
victims were found at Lewis' last known address in Chicago, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Lewis claimed his wallet was stolen two years ago
and used by the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police have issued an arrest warrant for Lewis. The FBI
has obtained a federal fugitive warrant.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Dennis Peers said the bureau was ''extremely pleased''
with the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every belief and confidence that this is the
individual we have sought,'' Peers said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anwar Verdict Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The High Court postponed Friday's
scheduled verdict in jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's sodomy trial
amid opposition plans to mount a massive protest.
</P>
<P>
   Sankara Nair, Anwar's attorney, said the court sent a statement
Thursday saying Justice Ariffin Jaka would not deliver the verdict
in the yearlong trial that has raised concerns about Malaysia's
judicial and political system.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given and no new date was set, Nair said. Another
lawyer said that it appeared Ariffin's judgment was not ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came as pro-Anwar activists were organizing a huge
rally in front of the court for Friday morning. Rights activists
and opposition politicians had vowed to defy dire warnings that
police would arrest anybody trying to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International had urged Malaysian authorities to respect
human rights amid fears of a police crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad describes Anwar as a corrupt
sexual deviant unfit for public office. Anwar allies say he is
being judged unfairly by a system controlled by Mahathir and that
there is a conspiracy to destroy his career.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict could add several years to the six-year jail
sentence that Anwar, 52, was given for corruption last year. Sodomy
is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a whipping.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction could take Anwar away from public gaze for more
than a decade. Although he could remain a martyr to many, it would
be a severe blow to his campaign to liberalize Malaysian politics
and end Mahathir's 19-year administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir fired Anwar in September 1998, when the Asian economic
crisis had battered a once-booming economy and differences broke
into the open between the two men on how to deal with it. Sentiment
was building that Anwar was about to make his move for the top job.

<HEADLINE> Two men arrested in 1999 death of graduate student  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - More than a year after Amy Watkins was fatally
stabbed in the back with a 10-inch kitchen knife as she walked to
her Brooklyn apartment, two men have been arrested and charged with
her murder.
</P>
<P>
   David Jamison, 27, of Brooklyn, was charged Wednesday with
first-degree murder, first-degree robbery and criminal possession
of a weapon in the graduate student's death. Felix Rodriguez, 20,
of Brooklyn, was charged early Thursday with second-degree murder,
first-degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A third man was still being questioned in the case early
Thursday at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn and had not been charged,
said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison was picked up for questioning Wednesday thanks to
several tips to police, including some from the Crime Stoppers hot
line. He had previously been arrested for selling drugs, petit
larceny and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jamison and two other men saw Watkins walk by the restaurant they
were in on March 8, 1999, and decided she would be an easy robbery
target. Watkins apparently struggled with her attacker and she was
stabbed once, the source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Watkins, the victim's father, said in a telephone
interview from his Manhattan home that he was completely surprised
when police called him about 1 p.m. Wednesday to tell them about
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someday something would happen, but I really didn't
have a lot of hope,'' he said. He expressed gratitude to the police
for never giving up on the case.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter's death horrified the city and her neighbors in
Prospect Heights, a quiet neighborhood of gentrified brownstones a
short subway ride from Manhattan. Her slaying came at a time when
the city was in the midst of a dramatic decrease in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26 and from Kansas, was studying for her masters in
social work, counseling battered women and working with children as
an intern at the New Settlement Community Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   She had taken the subway from the Bronx, where she organized a
meeting for parents about their children's reading scores. She was
attacked as she walked home from the subway station, after stopping
for some groceries shortly before 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   She was unconscious when passers-by found her on the sidewalk -
some residents said they had heard a woman scream. Watkins lived
with a roommate in an apartment building about two blocks from
where she was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Illinois but raised in Topeka, Kan., and
graduated from the University of Kansas. She moved to New York in
1997 after living briefly in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was a second-year graduate student at Hunter College's
School of Social Work, had an internship at the center and had
started working there in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was buried in suburban St. Louis, where her mother, Margaret
Tafoya, and her stepfather, John Tafoya, live. Lawrence Watkins
teaches at Dominican Academy in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Ford One Of Many To Survive Stroke  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Ford got lucky Wednesday: He
survived a stroke, and one that occurred in a brain region where
strokes are particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke is the nation's No. 3 killer, claiming 160,000 lives each
year. More than 600,000 people will suffer a stroke this year. Some
of the 4 million stroke survivors have fully recovered from their
''brain attack''; others suffer permanent disability.
</P>
<P>
   Too many victims don't realize stroke symptoms are an emergency
and can be treated. Dial 911 or get to a hospital immediately if
you have any of the warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden numbness of weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially
on one side of the body.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden severe headache with no known cause, or trouble seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was ''very lucky,'' said George Hademenos of the American
Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ford had appeared on television seeming confused and
speaking slightly slurred. That night, he went to the hospital and
doctors diagnosed a sinus infection. Only when Ford returned to the
hospital Wednesday did doctors ultimately say he suffered one,
perhaps two, small strokes in recent days -- in the brainstem.
</P>
<P>
   That brain region controls a lot of bodily functions. Usually,
brainstem strokes are ''very, very serious,'' Hademenos said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford's doctors insist his stroke was minor and that he is
expected to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   However, survivors are at high risk of repeat strokes, and
typically take anticoagulant drugs like warfarin to lower that
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it sometimes is difficult to diagnose a small or
early stage stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many cases, the earliest events in a stroke can be very
subtle and are often missed,'' said Dr. Gerald Fischbach, neurology
chief at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you without more information whether there was a
missed diagnosis,'' Fischbach cautioned. Regardless, he stressed
that people with stroke symptoms must seek care fast -- and doctors
should always to check for a stroke -- because there are treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, patients themselves may not realize they're
experiencing stroke symptoms and may need a friend or relative who
recognizes something's wrong to seek care, added Dr. Thomas Brott
of the National Stroke Association.
</P>
<P>
   When describing the symptoms, it's not a bad idea to ask a
doctor outright if it could be a stroke, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A stroke is a lack of proper blood flow and oxygen that quickly
kills delicate brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Ford suffered the most common type, an ischemic stroke, caused
by a blood clot in the brain. It sometimes is preceded by silent
''mini-strokes,'' called ''transient ischemic attacks,'' that
produce reversible stroke-like symptoms when blood flow is only
temporarily blocked. People who have had a mini-stroke are at very
high risk of a full-blown stroke, so diagnosis is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   For years, doctors couldn't treat stroke so patients weren't
encouraged to race to the hospital. But now, if patients get
clot-busting medication within three hours of an ischemic stroke's
onset, they have a good chance at stemming or even reversing much
of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes also can be caused when a blood vessel abruptly bursts
in the brain. These are called a hemorrhagic strokes, but they are
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting old is one of the biggest risks for stroke. Other
risks include high blood pressure, smoking, heart disease,
irregular heartbeat and diabetes.

<HEADLINE> Convention Volunteers Ready To Serve  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Call it the Great Cowbell Caper.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas delegation to the GOP convention decided it
wanted cowbells to ring when George W. Bush gets the presidential
nomination, it turned to its Philadelphia Friends: four volunteers
assigned to answer the group's every question and cater to every
whim. A day later, the cowbells were in hand.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot tougher than it sounds, finding 150 cowbells. The
Friends launched Internet searches and phoned across the country.
Farmers were contacted. Finally, the bells were located -- someone
was selling them a few blocks away, at the Pennsylvania Convention
Center.

<P>
   As it turned out, the Secret Service decided cowbells at the
Republican convention were a bad idea, but, for the Friends -- 110
volunteers assigned to each of the state delegates and on duty 24
hours a day -- it was mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a wheelchair is broken, we know where to send them. If a
cell phone is broken, we know where to send them,'' said volunteer
Leslie Morgan. ''The Texas delegation is rowdy. They're
backslapping. They give you hugs. We hug them back. We give them
high fives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no small job, apparently, finding the right people to be
volunteers. Each of the applicants had to be tested -- on their
knowledge of Philadelphia and on how to hail a cab or catch the
subway. They were questioned on which restaurants they would
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the seminars, two hours a week, on security, on
how to handle the questions they might be asked.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 39, is an investor in real estate in a Philadelphia
suburb. ''We all have good bios,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Houston Pastor To Introduce Bush  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell said he agreed to
introduce Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the GOP's nominee for
president because he brings a new openness to the party and has
appointed women and minorities to state office.
</P>
<P>
   But Caldwell, pastor of one of the nation's largest, most
affluent black churches, disagrees with Bush on abortion,
affirmative action, the death penalty, gun control, and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   One example: While Bush was defending the execution of Texas
prison inmate Gary Graham in June, Caldwell was leading death
penalty opponents in prayer at Graham's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   And Caldwell, who will make the introduction at the Republican
National Convention on Thursday, isn't even a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am there to let independents and even Democrats know it's OK
to vote for this guy, in spite of the differences I have with
him,'' said Caldwell, leader of Houston's Windsor Park Methodist
Church. ''I am saying he is a fair man who has demonstrated social
and economic inclusiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, some church members and leaders of Houston's black
community were critical of Caldwell's decision to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell defended his stance, saying Bush's home ownership and
tax plans would benefit the poor and that he admires the
candidate's ''emotional intelligence,'' Christian values and
entrepreneurial spirit.

<HEADLINE> GOP Nominates Cheney for VP Slot  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a withering attack on the Clinton-Gore
administration, Dick Cheney accused the Democratic pair of
squandering opportunities to help ordinary Americans. He promised
''big changes'' if George W. Bush is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney -- a former six-term congressman, defense secretary and
oil executive -- accepted the Republican party's vice presidential
nomination Wednesday night and opened a new chapter in his
political life.
</P>
<P>
   He lambasted President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for
failing to help children and reform education, not fixing Social
Security and depleting the nation's military power.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there has been ''little purpose in the White House''
these last eight years, Cheney contrasted the Republican ticket
with Clinton and Gore, who will claim the Democratic presidential
nomination later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will make accusations ... we will make proposals. ...They
will offer more lectures, legalisms, and carefully worded
denials,'' Cheney said, touching off a roar of applause in the
convention hall. ''We offer another way ... a better way ... and a
stiff dose of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's speech, Cheney had not taken on the role of
attack dog -- something most running mates do in presidential
campaigns. But his address was peppered with barbs and criticisms
of both Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney said. And, he borrowed a crowd-pleasing line that Al Gore
used in the 1992 presidential campaign against Bush's father: ''It
is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd didn't miss a beat. They picked up on the line and
chanted back ''Time to go! Time to go!'' and motioned with their
thumbs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came in together. Now let us see them off together,''
Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Orben, former speechwriter for President Ford, said
Cheney delivered the speech in somewhat of a monotone, but he gave
him high marks for being aggressive, but not mean.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dick Cheney has to be the kindliest attack dog ever,'' Orben
said. ''He did it very very well.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point the crowd broke out in laughter when Cheney
referred to Clinton as the ''man from Hope'' who is going ''home,
ah, to New York'' this fall, a thinly veiled referenced to Hillary
Rodham Clinton's bid for a New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who served under three presidents, cast himself as a man
of broad experience and said ''I know what it takes'' to do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been in the company of leaders ... and I see in our
nominee the qualities of mind and spirit our nation needs,'' Cheney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said he and his wife, Lynne, were content in their life
out of the public eye with time for fishing and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was glad to return to the public arena because,
''I have been given an opportunity to serve beside a man who has
the courage and the vision and the goodness to be a great
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said Bush will bring a new era of bipartisanship to
Washington, ''reaching across the partisan aisle to do the people's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Bush would ''restore decency and integrity to the Oval
Office,'' Cheney said, touching off another round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   The speech marked Cheney's reintroduction to the American public
who last saw him in the early 1990s on nightly newscasts as the
United States tried to oust Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   And for voters who were too young to remember those days, this
was their first good look at the candidate, whose political
pedigree reaches back a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was nominated by a roar of acclamation from Republican
delegates, who waved signs saying ''We Love Cheney'' and ''Our Next
VP.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney acknowledged his former boss and mentor President Gerald
Ford, who was hospitalized with a stroke on Wednesday, saying, ''I
wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't for the trust and confidence
he put in me 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney, a prominent conservative and former head of the
National Endowment for the Humanities, introduced her husband as a
''fabulous father'' who taught his two daughters flyfishing, a
Cheney passion that defines him, his wife said, because ''it is
definitely not a sport for chatterboxes.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Nephew Causing Buzz  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- He's been called the budding family star, a
symbol of the new inclusiveness of the Republican Party and a
measure of youth activism in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his uncle, the presidential nominee, just calls
24-year-old George P. ''the hot member of the family.'' Former
President Bush, his grandfather, favors comparisons to Ricky
Martin, the Latin pop star.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the Rice University graduate will warm up the
crowds before his uncle's acceptance speech, delivering remarks
''peppered in Spanish'' and extending his hand to young and
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his Mexican wife, Columba,
George P. has been a valuable asset in the Bush campaign's strategy
to reach out to both of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   He has done so relentlessly this week, scurrying from convention
floor to pubs to parks talking up his uncle. He sees himself adding
a personal touch to politics and urges young adults not to cave
into apathy or cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to us to carry the torch,'' he declared to a GOP youth
caucus rally. ''Are you guys with it?''
</P>
<P>
   There is usually a rousing response. Visiting hundreds of young
convention-goers who were painting posters Sunday afternoon, George
P. found himself nearly mobbed by fans waving cameras and seeking
handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his grandfather's words, George P. is quick to brush off
any suggestions of rock star treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's flattering,'' George P. said. ''But I do have a message,
and I do have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   And a weighty name to uphold. Each part bears some connection to
his famous family's legacy. There's George and Bush. And also his
middle initial ''P,'' which some people call him by. That stands
for Prescott, as in Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut, his
great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   But George P., who heads off to law school at the University of
Texas in the fall, says he's bound to his uncle's campaign by more
than family ties. George W.'s efforts to reach out to minority
groups and his track record on education in the state of Texas also
appealed to the young Bush, who taught school in Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   While calling himself a minor player in the process, he is
clearly enjoying his time here as a member of the Bush clan. At a
Republican fund-raiser Wednesday, George P. recruited sidekick and
father Jeb to do a ''Top 10'' list for why the Texas governor
should be elected.
</P>
<P>
   But his grandmother, Barbara Bush -- the family ''enforcer'' --
advises him ''not to be a showoff like my grandfather,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That George Bush, the former president, insists that ''it hasn't
gone to his head. He's the same down-to-earth kid we love dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members may have only one concern about the young Bush
jumping in to political life: being upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not so sure we should be campaigning with him anymore,''
the nominee George W. said to his brother Jeb Wednesday. ''People
are kind of looking beyond us these days.''

Republicans Nominate George W. Bush

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, building on a political
dynasty spanning three generations, claims the Republican presidential
nomination Thursday night declaring that America needs a change of leadership to
solve the tough problems that President Clinton and Al Gore failed to fix. ''We
are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,'' running mate Dick Cheney
told the confetti-filled GOP convention Wednesday night. ''But the wheel has
turned. And it is time, it is time for them to go.'' Bush said he would deliver
a closing speech that ''speaks from my heart. I'm going to lift the spirit of
the country.''

had complained of soreness in his face, but asked only for pain reliever. Ford
went from the Republican National Convention to the hospital for about a
half-hour Tuesday night and was given antibiotics. He returned Wednesday morning
with slurred speech and difficulties with balance.

one person was killed and a dozen others injured Tuesday when supporters of
President Hugo Chavez clashed with opposition backers in several states where
results of gubernatorial races were being contested. Thousands of army troops

for women and men. The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. Dramatic differences in women based on whether
they had been physically or sexually abused as children came to light when they
were asked to speak in front of a poker-faced audience and to solve tricky math

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Jolts Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- A powerful earthquake was
recorded Thursday near a remote Pacific island chain that is part
of the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage and it
was not clear if the shallow, magnitude-6.8 temblor had caused a
tsunami wave.
</P>
<P>
   One person from the region, where a few thousand people live,
called the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation to report the
quake, but gave no details of whether it had caused damage.
</P>
<P>
   Spiro Spilliopoulos of the Australian Geological Survey
Organization confirmed a quake with a magnitude of 6.8 hit 10
minutes after noon near the Santa Cruz Islands, about 470 miles
east-southeast of the Solomons' capital, Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Spilliopoulos said there was a small possibility that a tsunami
could have been generated. Such waves could be devastating to
low-lying islands in the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Texas County Spars Over Graves  </HEADLINE>
By PAM EASTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETERSBURG, Texas (AP) -- As a Hale County commissioner, Mario
Martinez has had a lot on his plate: advisory boards, budget
meetings, legislative oversight and digging graves.
</P>
<P>
   Digging graves?
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that was just a job that I inherited,'' Martinez said.
''Just like the commissioner before me did it himself, I was just
doing what the others had done. No one ever really griped about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true until last week, when County Attorney Chris
Prentice notified the commissioner that the activity was thoughtful
but, unfortunately, illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole point is they are using not only county assets but
man-hours to benefit private individuals,'' Prentice said. ''It's
the same thing as grading a farmer's driveway so you can keep his
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of using county-owned resources to dig funeral
plots in Petersburg Cemetery became common around 1950 in this town
of 1,600, some 25 miles northeast of Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ''The county has done it as far back as anyone can remember,''
City Manager Cullen Davis said. ''I think the populace at large
appreciates it and views it as a service the county provides, and
one that they can actually see. That's the way little towns try to
operate, but politics sometime get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis suspects that infighting among the county's four
commissioners led one to tattle about the grave digging. The whole
episode has left many in Petersburg ''scratching their heads,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the cemetery, plots cost only $40. The money is used for the
upkeep of the community-run cemetery, which has never charged
anyone to have a grave dug.
</P>
<P>
   Digging and filling a grave in Petersburg should cost about
$385, said Stan Workman, who is retired from West Texas Wilbert
Vault in Lubbock, a firm that digs graves throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever anybody would call down here to get a grave opened, I
would tell them to call the county because they do it for free,''
he said. ''I expected a long time ago that somebody would complain
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice is not without precedent. In neighboring Oklahoma,
a statute permits county workers to dig graves -- as long as there's
a county policy permitting the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we require them to do is to establish a policy, which is
not that Uncle Ted gets buried for free, and that type of thing,''
said Jim McGoodwin, Oklahoma director of special audits.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the practice in Oklahoma and what's going on in
this small Texas town differ, especially since Texas has no such
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who is buried in any other cemetery in Hale County has
to pay $200,'' Prentice said. ''It's a nice thing to do for people,
but it's just not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal or not, Mayor Jim Fox said the practice of a county
commissioner hopping on a county-owned backhoe and digging graves
was in keeping with the close bond of the residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you ever go to a funeral in Petersburg, you don't know what
race the person was,'' he said. ''We all went to school together
and live together. We're a small little community, more than a
town, and we all stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of the practice's illegality, commissioner Martinez has
agreed to stop the service, even though many here still believe it
is a responsibility of local government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It saddens me because it seems like we're not being able to
help our fellow man like we used to,'' he said. ''It's taking away
a part of our history. What we've always done there, suddenly, we
are not going to be able to do anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prentice said he understands the community's frustration but
insists that another manner of providing the service must be found.
Meanwhile, he said, he hasn't been the favorite son of the west
Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised the people in the graves haven't come up and hit
me with things,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Charged With Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Prosecutors on Thursday charged former
President Suharto with siphoning off $570 million in state funds
and planned to take him to court within days.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been formally charged,'' said Umbu Laga Lazore, a
member of the investigative team that probed Suharto's wealth.
''From now on Suharto's status is as a defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   The team handed over the case to prosecutors at Suharto's home
in central Jakarta where he has been held under house arrest for
several months. The officials held talks with the former dictator's
attorneys, who maintain Suharto is too sick to face trial because
of recent strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suharto has brain damage,'' said his chief counsel, Juan Felix
Tampubolon.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, Mohamad Assegaf, said Suharto fully
cooperated with the officials on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police were deployed as a precaution against
possible protests by students who want him tried immediately, not
only for corruption but also for human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is accused of using charities under his control to
siphon off the money during his 32-year iron-fisted rule. Suharto,
who was forced to quit after riots in May 1998, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The case is seen as a test of Indonesia's resolve to roll back
years of corruption and push ahead with democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has said that he intends bring
the former autocrat before a judge before Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has called for Suharto to be
prosecuted, although he has offered a pardon if his predecessor
returns any ill-gotten gains.

<HEADLINE> DNA tests exonerate two men accused in Newark rape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The investigation into the rapes of two
girls at the public library here in 1998 has been reopened after
DNA tests exonerated two men arrested for the crimes, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Diaz was arrested on June 19, 1998, after one victim - a
16-year-old girl - identified him from a book of mug shots. Last
month, a DNA test of semen taken from the victim found that Diaz
was not the rapist.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA test administered at the same time also exonerated Jason
Yantin, who was charged with raping another woman at the library
about a month earlier, and showed that one man was responsible for
both sexual assaults. The 15-year-old victim in that case also
chose Yantin's photo from a book of mug shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a rush to judgment,'' Joseph Rotella, Diaz's lawyer,
told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Thursday's editions. ''My
client's name was spread all over as a sexual predator. Meanwhile,
nobody was looking for the real rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Essex County Prosecutors Office took a DNA sample from Diaz
only after Rotella requested it. When prosecutors decided to test
Yantin at the same time, the public defender representing him
objected. The tests were administered after prosecutors obtained a
court order to have Yantin's blood taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lawyers are often skeptical about what DNA evidence might
show,'' said Alan Zegas, past chairman of the criminal law section
of the New Jersey State Bar Association. ''They might not be sure
their client is telling the truth. So they oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts told the newspaper that the exoneration of the two
men, who had been free on bail since shortly after their arrests,
is among only a few cases in New Jersey in which DNA evidence has
cleared a defendant - and the only one they knew of in which
defendants were cleared before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old was raped in the second-floor restroom of the
main library in Newark on May 12, 1998. On June 17, 1998, the
16-year-old was raped in the stacks after the assailant asked for
help finding a book.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Police Director Joseph Santiago, who had publicly labeled
Diaz a ''sexual predator'' at the time of his arrest, told the
newspaper that police were obligated to arrest the men because of
the victims' identifications.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, had been charged - but not convicted - of sexually
assaulting a former girlfriend. He had been allowed to enter a
program for first-time offenders that does not require an admission
of guilt. Santiago said he made the earlier comments about Diaz
because of the combination of his record and the new charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are glad to see the DNA tests exonerated them,'' Santiago
said. ''We would hate to see them prosecuted for something they
didn't do.''

<HEADLINE> Fur Flies With Nugent, Protesters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- All charges have been dropped against a man
who was arrested after rocker Ted Nugent accused him of assault at
an anti-fur protest.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco district attorney's office decided Tuesday to
release Bhaskar Sinha, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent said Sinha bumped and threatened him Sunday, but a
security camera that recorded the incident showed no contact. A
charge of threatening Nugent was also dropped because it was too
vague.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent came out of a Neiman Marcus store and ran right into an
animal rights group's regular protest against the sale of furs.
Nugent, an outspoken supporter of guns and hunting, got into an
argument with Sinha over his hunting plans.

<HEADLINE> 'Sopranos' Member Recording Album  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Tony Soprano's mob boss ''Uncle Junior''
is about to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Chianese, who plays Corrado Erico Soprano on HBO's hit
series ''The Sopranos,'' was in a Franklin recording studio last
weekend recording his first album.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a fluty, pleasant tenor,'' said Dino Elefante, co-owner
of The Sound Kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Elefante said the album, which was recorded with studio
musicians, includes several standards like ''Ramona'' and ''For the
Good Times.'' Chianese wrote three songs himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was giving Dominic a tour of the studio and he ended up
singing 'Amazing Grace' with a gospel quartet that was recording
here,'' Elefante said. ''It was an amazing moment. Junior Soprano
was in my studio singing 'Amazing Grace.' You talk about worlds
colliding.''
</P>
<P>
   Chianese is shopping for a record label. A release date for the
album has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Chianese has been acting since 1952. His film credits include
the role of Johnny Ola in ''The Godfather, Part II.'' He has also
appeared in the TV series ''Law &AMP; Order,'' ''Kojak,'' ''East Side,
West Side'' and ''Dark Shadows.''

<HEADLINE> Carly Simon Bails Out Backup Singer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Singer Carly Simon posted $250,000 bail for
one of her backup singers after his arrest at Newark International
Airport on cocaine charges.
</P>
<P>
   John Forte was charged July 13 with conspiring to distribute
nearly 31 pounds of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they have taped telephone conversations in which
Forte, 25, referred to the cocaine as ''ice cream'' and arranged to
pick up the shipment at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents arrested him after he was handed a suitcase by
two women, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Forte was charged with conspiracy to distribute the cocaine. A
federal magistrate set bail for Forte at $625,000 and Simon posted
$250,000 of it last week. Forte was placed under house arrest at
his mother's home in South Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Forte sang backup during Simon's last tour. Forte also
co-produced the Fugees' hit record ''The Score'' in 1996 and sang
on a solo album released by Fugees singer Wyclef Jean.

<HEADLINE> Rain Helps California Firefighters  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAVA HOT SPRINGS, Idaho (AP) -- The nation's worst fire season in
more than a decade has struck the West like a storm, with new
blazes forcing hundreds of evacuations and pillars of reeking smoke
prompting health alerts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something that's going to be over next week,''
warned Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck, who met with fire
strategists at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise before
leaving to tour fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 large fires were burning early Thursday across more
than 700,000 acres in Texas and the West. Nearly 3.6 million acres
have burned in the United States this season, the most since at
least the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have stretched resources so thin that federal
officials are considering bringing in crews from Mexico and
technical experts from Australia. The government is spending $15
million a day to support 20,000 civilian and military firefighters
from 46 states and Canada. Some are working 36-hour shifts -- or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We face a very serious and difficult firefighting situation
across the western United States,'' said Jim Lyons, an
undersecretary at the Agriculture Department, which oversees the
Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   He said current Western weather patterns -- dry and hot with the
potential for lightning -- are ideal for fires. He likened the
situation to that outlined in ''The Perfect Storm,'' a book about a
storm-hurricane combination that struck the East Coast in 1991 with
deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters say the kind of weather needed to change the
conditions may not occur in the West until October.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, fires forced people out of more than 300 homes
south of Helena, Mont., and in the Bitterroot Valley, in
southwestern Montana along the Idaho line.
</P>
<P>
   Ravalli County officials declared a health alert because of
smoke from fires in the scenic valley and Idaho. The Bitterroot and
Helena national forests, covering more than a million acres of
western Montana, were closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's that serious,'' said Tom Clifford, the Helena National
Forest supervisor. ''We continue to break on the average two to
three new fires per day.''
</P>
<P>
   More bad news came from California: Four firefighters were
burned Wednesday as they battled one of several blazes that have
blackened some 83,000 acres of timber and brush. Two of the injured
were in serious condition and the others were in fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   California crews did make progress against some blazes, though a
fire that began on the Pachenga Indian reservation southeast of
Temecula grew to 5,200 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real, real steep out there and the terrain is heavy,
heavy brush that hasn't burned in a long, long time -- about a
hundred years,'' said fire spokesman Iral Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from dozens of fires in Utah hung over the Wasatch Front,
obscuring the mountains around Salt Lake City and prompting
references to Los Angeles-like smog. The smoke boosted ozone
concentrations in Salt Lake City to its highest level since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember it ever being like this,'' 15-year resident
Kib Jacobson said as he walked downtown. The state issued its fifth
consecutive ''No Drive Day'' for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews in eastern Idaho got a brief respite Wednesday as
helicopters arrived to fight a complex of 11 fires burning nearly
200,000 acres of steep rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Crews managed to stop the flames threatening houses near the
southeastern Idaho resort community of Lava Hot Springs, but the
fire wasn't fully contained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could do this and box this in and be free and get another
tonight and then start all over,'' said Bill Brandau, an
Arizona-based firefighter. ''We're not out of the woods yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires have burned more than 20,000 acres in Wyoming in the past
week. In the state's northwest corner, near Jackson, a 2,000-acre
fire forced 200 people to evacuate. Among them was Barbara
Hetherington of Corona, Calif., who left her family's cabin near
Jackson with two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was quite a horrific sight to see the flames leaping all
over the place,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Delegate Urges Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Before George W. Bush accepts the Republican
nomination for president Thursday night, convention delegates had
better pray.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what they pray for -- or even who they pray to,
but an Alabama delegate insists they must start the session with a
prayer. Otherwise, technically speaking, the day's business won't
count.
</P>
<P>
   Some would disagree with Perry Hooper Jr.'s analysis of a rule
mandating a prayer and the pledge of allegiance before all official
meetings at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Hooper ought to know. He wrote the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just something I philosophically thought would be
appropriate,'' said Hooper, who is a state representative. ''I
believe in the power of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooper introduced the mandate four years ago as a member of the
rules committee. The committee concurred on a voice vote, and a
nearly identical measure was approved again for this year's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, it doesn't change much. Republicans have long
started most of their meetings the way Hooper prefers. On Tuesday,
a rabbi did the honors for the main session. On Wednesday, it was
retired quarterback Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ''He codified what was already in practice,'' said Tom Yu,
spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper said Thursday his intent was to require prayer in front
of state caucus gatherings as well. Alabama has led off with one at
every meeting this week, but other states pray only before a meal --
a fact that surprised and disappointed Hooper and other Alabamans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You really shouldn't have to have a rule to do it,'' said
Alabama GOP Chairman Winton Blount. ''You ought to just do it. We
always have and always will.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Hooper has tried to mandate meditation.
Two years ago, he proposed requiring teachers in every public
school classroom in Alabama to start each school day with a period
of quiet reflection of no more than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   That law and others allowing voluntary prayers at school
functions were approved by the state legislature. Some parts are
still under review by the courts.

<HEADLINE> Six Arrested in Hong Kong Fire  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Six people have been arrested in connection
with a fiery explosion set off by mainland Chinese migrants at Hong
Kong's immigration headquarters, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people of the 50 injured were listed in critical condition
Thursday, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's political leader, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa,
visited victims in the hospital Wednesday night and called the fire
''brutal behavior, irrational behavior that is unacceptable to all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thursday they had arrested six people and were
questioning them in a case being investigated as arson. But
immigration officials accused the migrants of a deliberate and
dangerous attack on officers who process residency claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They set the liquid on fire and intended to injure the
officers,'' said Sunny Ho, a spokesman for the immigration
department.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration from mainland China has been the most difficult
issue to confront Hong Kong since it reverted from British to
Chinese sovereignty three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But although there have been legal battles and protests by
mainland Chinese migrants demanding the right to stay, the normally
peaceful territory had seen nothing like Wednesday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 20 migrants went to immigration headquarters
around midafternoon, demanding documentation that would let them
stay as residents. When workers told them to leave four hours later
as the office was closing, some of the mainlanders doused the floor
with flammable liquid and set off an explosion and blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigration employees returning to work Thursday seemed
fearful despite tighter security.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney who represents migrants, Pam Baker, expressed
concern the incident and comments like Tung's could turn Hong Kong
citizens against the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a small number of people out of the thousands who have
behaved with great dignity,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government has fought to limit the number of
mainlanders who can move into the affluent territory, fearful that
its educational and social systems could be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's highest court granted residency rights to anyone
with at least one Hong Kong parent, but the Hong Kong government
last year persuaded the Chinese central government to intervene.
Beijing declared the court had ruled wrongly, and ordered a legal
interpretation that sharply cut the number of eligible migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong is now part of China, strict border controls
remain in place, keeping out numerous mainland residents who
believe they could have a better life in the former British colony,
which maintains some freedoms and capitalist ways.

<HEADLINE> Baby sitter and man held in rape of baby girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - An 18-year-old man was ordered held on
$200,000 bail Wednesday in the rape of a 4-month-old girl at her
baby sitter's apartment in Passaic, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The infant girl underwent surgery for genital injuries she
suffered during the July 24 assault and was hospitalized for nearly
a week, said Boris Moczula, first assistant prosecutor in Passaic
County. Moczula said she is thought to be the youngest victim of
sexual assault in the county's history.
</P>
<P>
   Marios Patino Cabrera was arrested July 27. At his bail hearing
Wednesday in Paterson, detectives also arrested the baby sitter and
accused her of giving authorities false information in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalba Rodriguez, 24, was charged with endangering the welfare
of a child for failing to seek medical attention for the girl's
injuries, and later lying to investigators. She had been the
infant's baby sitter since May, Moczula said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cabrera, believed to be a cousin of the baby sitter's
husband, lives in the couple's apartment in Passaic along with
several other relatives. They, as well as the victim's family, were
illegal immigrants from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred about 11:30 a.m. on July 24, Moczula said.
Later in the day, the baby sitter told the infant's mother that the
baby had bled during a bath, but that she thought the bleeding was
caused by a diaper that had been put on backward.
</P>
<P>
   The mother later discovered the genital injuries, Moczula said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Attacks Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine authorities arrested the
main suspect in a series of sexual assaults in the United States, a
government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration chief Rufus Rodriguez said Mark Anthony Lewis, 33,
of Chicago, was arrested by immigration agents at a seaside mall.
Lewis' passport had been canceled and he was to be deported
Thursday evening, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis denied any involvement in the attacks against Asian women
and a Hispanic woman in the Chicago area that began in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not flee the U.S.,'' Lewis said. ''As for these charges
of me assaulting anyone, they are totally uncorroborated by
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I surrendered because I didn't want anyone to get hurt and I
wanted to prove my innocence,'' he added. ''If I was guilty, I
should have kept hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had family and friends in the Philippines and his
visit had been planned earlier. Lewis arrived in Manila on July 21,
two days after the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is suspected of having attacked at least eight Asian women
and one Hispanic woman beginning April 7. The attacker posed as a
census taker, a police officer, an FBI agent and an immigration
officer to get into the women's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police said victims identified him through photographs.
Lewis' car, they said, matches the description of a car used by a
man in one of the attacks. Clothing and other items described by
victims were found at Lewis' last known address in Chicago, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Lewis claimed his wallet was stolen two years ago
and used by the attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police have issued an arrest warrant for Lewis. The FBI
has obtained a federal fugitive warrant.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Dennis Pierce said the bureau was ''extremely
pleased'' with the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have every belief and confidence that this is the
individual we have sought,'' Pierce said.

<HEADLINE> Robert Downey Jr. Leaves Prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr. was in seclusion in a
''sober living environment'' Thursday, his first full day of
freedom after being released from prison where he served time for
drug violations, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court ruled Wednesday he had served enough time to
fulfill his three-year sentence, saying he should get more credit
for time he had served in rehabilitation. He was released on $5,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's en route to an undisclosed, secluded location,'' said
Robert Waters, the actor's attorney. ''He will be in a sober living
environment, but not a specific program at this point. He'll be
living as though he's on parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters planned a news conference Thursday to discuss his
client's release. Downey, 34, was not scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Downey was jailed after he admitted during a probation hearing
that he was missing scheduled drug tests. In August 1999, Superior
Court Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced him to three years in prison
for violating his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mira's original sentence, which included some credit for
time served, Downey would have been eligible for release Nov. 2.
But the appeals court said that the time served was not calculated
correctly and he could go free immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Downey was released at midafternoon from a drug treatment
section of the prison at Corcoran, said Bob Martinez, a spokesman
for the California Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The son of film director Robert Downey earned an Oscar
nomination for his work in the title role in ''Chaplin,'' the 1992
screen biography of the comedian. Other film credits include ''Less
Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born Killers,'' ''One Night Stand,'' ''Two
Girls and a Guy'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996, when he was
stopped for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities
found cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A month later Downey was found passed out on a child's bed in a
neighbor's home. Three days later, he was arrested for leaving a
recovery center.

<HEADLINE> Marine Convicted of Rape in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A 19-year-old Marine has been convicted of raping a
woman on Japan's southern island of Okinawa and sentenced to four
years in prison, a military official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. military court sentenced Pfc. Derrick L. Oliver on
Wednesday. It also handed him a dishonorable discharge, stripped
him of all pay and allowances and demoted him to the rank of
private, Marine Corps spokesman Capt. Joseph M. Plenzler said.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, from Farmville, Va., was convicted of the March 4 rape
of a Japanese woman at his home near Futenma Marine Corps Air
Station, where he worked as a mechanic. He had pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawa, 480 miles southwest of Tokyo, is home to 26,000 of the
47,000 U.S. forces stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, another 19-year-old Marine was charged with walking
into an apartment in Okinawa City in the middle of the night and
fondling a 14-year-old girl as she slept. That sparked protests on
the island, prompting President Clinton to express regret for
misconduct by U.S. service members.

<HEADLINE> Lifetime Movie on Teen Sexuality  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In ''The Truth About Jane,'' a teen-ager's
voyage of self-discovery leads her into conflict with her friends,
her parents and herself.
</P>
<P>
   The reality for a high schooler who realizes she's lesbian is
harsh -- but not hopeless -- as painted by Lifetime's movie starring
Ellen Muth as Jane and Stockard Channing and James Naughton as her
anguished parents. The film debuts 9 p.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard enough having sex for the first time with anyone,''
a plaintive Jane says in a narrative voice-over. ''But when you do
it with a girl, you're just asking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even making a film about lesbianism can be asking for it,
according to writer-director Lee Rose. She shot the project in
Phoenix, where she found the weather balmy but the welcome less so.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost no public school would let us shoot there, which blew
my mind,'' she said, crediting ''one courageous principal,'' James
McElroy, for allowing filming at Phoenix's Caesar Chavez High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Casting was equally touchy, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The famous teen-age actresses, most of them wouldn't go near
it out of fear, or their parents wouldn't let them do it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Muth, an 18-year-old whose credits include ''Dolores
Claiborne,'' rose to the challenge. She and the reliably superb
Channing are effective foils as a battling mother and daughter,
with Muth veering believably between adolescent cockiness and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a smart, wonderful, talented kid. She has a gay friend
and it never occurred to her to be frightened of doing this,'' Rose
said of the young actress.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Lagano, 23, plays Jane's first romance, Taylor (brief
scenes show them kissing and sharing a bed). RuPaul Charles,
clean-scrubbed and out of his drag costume, offers a sensitive turn
as a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made with guidance from the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation (GLAAD) and the support group Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too rare to have the opportunity to do a story like this
and I wanted to get it right,'' Rose said. There was another,
equally important reason for the latter group's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''PFLAG has never really had a movie where they had a big part
in it, so it was really important to them,'' Rose said. ''And it
was really important to me that kids and parents watching it knew
where to get help if they were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although homosexual characters and themes have become the stuff
of mainstream shows like ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' social tolerance has not
kept pace, Rose contends. When vulnerable youngsters come out as
gay or lesbian, she said, they risk hostility and even violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regardless of whether the media has gay sitcoms and gay
movies, the real world doesn't reflect that,'' Rose said. ''As long
as we can't shoot a movie about a gay teen-ager in a public school
in Phoenix and the Matthew Shepards are killed and other people
kill themselves because of abuse from peers, then I'm not so sure
how far we've moved forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, 21, was a gay University of Wyoming college student
beaten to death in 1998 partly because of his sexual orientation.
He is listed in the dedication for ''The Truth About Jane,'' and
Rose and Channing helped honor his parents at a Washington, D.C.,
PFLAG event.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was a harsh reminder for Channing of the ugliest
side of anti-gay fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the parents stood up and bore witness to what had
happened to their kids, and it was chilling and very moving,'' the
actress said. ''These people were talking about their own struggles
and what their kids had gone through, and some had lost kids
through suicide or violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Truth About Jane'' does not dwell in the darkest corners
of homophobia. The tender relationship between Jane and new student
Taylor is affected not by violence but by the intolerance of Jane's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The most bruising moments are between Jane and her mother, whose
enlightenment ends when the issue of homosexuality crosses her own
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you know what you feel? You're a 16-year-old kid,'' she
snaps at Jane after her daughter's revelation.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until Janice is faced with losing her daughter or
accepting her that the two try to find a way to heal their rift.
''When did you first feel that you were, uh ...?'' a discomfited
Janice asks.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lesbian? It's OK, you can say it without becoming one,''
Jane says.
</P>
<P>
   If her film errs on the side of optimism, Rose said, that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are still not really good about accepting a
difference in someone else,'' she said, noting incidents of gay
bashing and racially motivated attacks like the dragging death of a
black Texas man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep trying to make sense out of it in movies, because I
can't make sense out of it in the real world,'' Rose said. If even
one parent and one child finds comfort or answers in her film, she
said, ''I've succeeded.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military Kills Rebel Supporter  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The military intensified its crackdown on the
lawlessness that has followed Fiji's May coup, shooting one rebel
supporter to death Thursday and arresting 37 others.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 troops were sent to Vanua Levu, the country's second
largest island, to bolster the military's presence in villages that
are rebel strongholds and bases for attacks on Fijians of Indian
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers gunned down a rebel after he shot at them with a
small-caliber hunting rifle at Dekreti village, military spokesman
Maj. Howard Politini told FM96 radio.
</P>
<P>
   Troops arrested 37 other men in the area Thursday, including
five who shot and wounded a cane farmer, Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to use force if we need to, we have shown
that,'' Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   Raids, hostage-taking, theft, beatings and arson have become
commonplace in small ethnic Indian-dominated rural communities
across Fiji since the coup, which paralyzed the tourism- and sugar
export-dependent economy and sparked international condemnation of
the South Pacific nation's abandonment of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Suva, the last of almost 400 rebels supporters arrested by
soldiers in a tear gas raid last week were charged with unlawful
assembly and released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings clear the way for coup leader George Speight and a
group of key advisers to appear in court Saturday, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight led a group of gunmen into Parliament on May 19,
claiming that ethnic Indian Fijians have too much power and
threaten indigenous Fijian culture. He held dozens of officials for
two months until the military met rebel demands for an amnesty,
agreed to discard the multiracial constitution and oust the ethnic
Indian-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was arrested last week and faces minor charges as well
as a treason investigation for allegedly threatening the life of
President Ratu Josefa Iloilo after his amnesty period expired.
</P>
<P>
   The military has said an amnesty it agreed to offer Speight and
his rebels could be scrapped because they did not stick to one of
its conditions -- to turn in all their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown comes as a new government sworn in last week has
begun day-to-day operations. On Thursday it ordered ministers in
the former Cabinet to clear out their former offices by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase has promised to appoint a
commission to rewrite the constitution to strengthen indigenous
Fijians' hold on power before elections are held, possibly in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the military's broad concessions to rebel demands,
Speight had threatened a new campaign of civil unrest unless the
new Cabinet was stacked with his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, prosecutors are believed to be considering
taking a magistrate to the prison island off Suva where Speight is
held, rather than bringing him to court in downtown Suva.
</P>
<P>
   In court Thursday, a Speight supporter was charged with unlawful
possession of a firearm for allegedly threatening police officers
at a roadblock May 20, FM96 radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was significant because May 20 falls within the
period covered by the amnesty, possibly indicating that prosecutors
will ignore the amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges a Start III Arms Pact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Thursday reiterated
promises to fulfill the START II arms reduction treaty and pushed
for a START III treaty that would further cut Russian and U.S.
nuclear weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian leadership has consistently supported the
strengthening of the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons,
and is taking steps to continue the process of nuclear
disarmament,'' Putin said in a letter of greeting to Britain's
Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having ratified START II, Russia intends to work on ensuring
its implementation and full observation, as well as the speediest
conclusion of START III treaty,'' Putin's message said.
</P>
<P>
   START II, which would slash both countries' nuclear arsenals to
between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads each, was ratified by the Russian
parliament this spring after years of stalling by the Communist
opposition. Moscow and Washington are now considering START III,
which would set ceilings of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads each.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia has threatened to scrap all arms agreements if the
United States proceeds with proposals to deploy a new missile
defense system. Such a system would likely require Washington to
back out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Moscow
considers a cornerstone of global stability.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Advances in Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia
smashed through the defense lines of opposition forces and advanced
toward a town in the northern province of Takhar, Taliban and
opposition officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban reached the outskirts of Ishkamish, 130 miles north
of the capital Kabul, Mohammed Abil, spokesman of the anti-Taliban
alliance, told The Associated Press by telephone from the
war-battered area.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy artillery was booming outside the town, and most of
Ishkamish's 40,000 people had fled, Abil said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our forces could not hold against the Taliban assault
overnight and retreated after two hours of fighting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullah Mohammed Khaksar, the Taliban deputy interior minister,
said Taliban forces attacked Ishkamish to counter an opposition
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition fighters attacked us first,'' Khaksar said.
''We launched a counterattack, and our forces are now in
Ishkamish.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the opposition and the Taliban refused to give casualty
figures.
</P>
<P>
   There was also heavy fighting Thursday in Keshendeh district of
Balkh province, 170 miles northwest of Kabul, opposition spokesman
Ustad Atta Mohammed said. Both sides were using heavy artillery and
tanks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan including Kabul,
are attempting to capture the entire country. The opposition
controls the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are Sunni Muslims and mostly Pashtun, Afghanistan's
majority ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition comprises ethnic and religious minorities,
including Shiite Muslims, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Guerrillas, India Talk  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Kashmir's main Islamic guerrilla group
held unprecedented talks with India on Thursday, vowing to
implement a long-term cease-fire in the bloodstained Himalayan
province a day after a wave of shootings left 102 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Home Secretary Kamal Pande sat down for the talks with a
former separatist leader and four commanders of the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen guerrilla group, the biggest of the groups fighting
against Indian control in Kashmir. It was the first known meeting
between the government and the guerrillas since 1989, when
militants began their war to either make the Indian-controlled part
of Kashmir independent or to merge it with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Pande said the two sides had set up a committee to
hash out the details of the cease-fire, which the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen declared on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   A guerrilla commander wearing a handkerchief over his face said
his group is serious about the cease-fire. Indian authorities
blamed Tuesday and Wednesday's killings in Kashmir not on the
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, but on smaller guerrilla groups that want the
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will ask our six commanders to implement the cease-fire on
the ground effectively,'' said the masked commander, who serves as
the deputy chief of operations for the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and goes
by only one name, Masood. ''We express our gratitude to the
government of India for extending an unconditional dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there were signs that the cease-fire could be
short-lived: Sayed Salahuddin, the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen chief,
threatened Thursday to resume fighting in five days if India does
not begin joint talks with Pakistan and the militants over the
future of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The valley has been divided between archrivals India and
Pakistan since 1948, and both sides lay claim to the entire
territory. Two of their three wars in the last half-century have
been fought over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have given India an ultimatum that it should accept our
demand by Tuesday, 5 p.m.,'' Salahuddin told The Associated Press
in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. ''If India doesn't initiate
meaningful tripartite talks, we will resume our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people have been killed since Indian military
and Kashmiri guerrilla forces began fighting 11 years ago.
Thursday's talks came on the heels of the most recent bloodshed: In
a series of attacks, suspected Islamic guerrillas mowed down Hindu
pilgrims and shot people in their homes around the province,
leaving 102 people dead and many more injured.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials quickly blamed Pakistan-based guerrillas for
the deaths, saying they were reprisals for India's attempt to
secure peace in the territory. But witnesses said some of those
killed were shot by Indian forces, and Pakistan said such killings
have been carried out in the past by Indian paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee arrived
in Kashmir to visit Pahalgam, the site of the worst of the
massacres. At least 35 people died and dozens were badly hurt
Tuesday when suspected guerrillas opened fire on Hindu pilgrims and
others near a religious shrine and Indian security forces fired
back.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vajpayee told Parliament the massacre would not
deter the government from talks with the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and
reiterated that security forces would halt all operations against
the pro-Pakistan group. India decided on both those moves toward
peace after the Hez-ul Mujahedeen announced the cease-fire last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The talks Thursday were held at the Nehru Guest House in
Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. After the
105-minute meeting, Pande, the Indian home secretary, told
reporters: ''It was a very positive dialogue. Very cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   Masood, the guerrilla commander, said his group identified a
12-point agenda for discussion with India, including a cease-fire
and human rights violations in the province. He said his group
wanted Pakistan to be included in the talks ''at a later stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Pande countered that the talks now were focusing only on the
cease-fire. ''Pakistan will not be involved in these talks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has said it supports the cause of the militants but
denies it gives them cash, arms or training, as India alleges.
Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, on Wednesday
repeated his offer to open talks with India on the Kashmir dispute
and said the cease-fire presented an opportunity for peace.
</P>
<P>
   In a Wednesday phone conversation with President Clinton,
Vajpayee said there was no basis for a meaningful dialogue with
Pakistan because every peace initiative of his had met with
Pakistani-sponsored terrorist acts. But he added that India would
pursue the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Detain four Foreigners  </HEADLINE>
By DANILO BURZAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav army said Thursday it
had detained four armed foreigners -- two Britons and two Canadians
-- suspected of training pro-Western forces in Montenegro to commit
''terrorist actions.''
</P>
<P>
   An army statement faxed to The Associated Press said the four
were arrested near the border between Montenegro and the Serbian
province of Kosovo sometime during the night between Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four were armed ''with military equipment, explosives,
etc.,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are indications that the arrested foreigners were
training special units of Montenegrin police and that they are
specialists for explosives and terrorist actions,'' the statement
said. It said the army has ''enough material to prove the true
intentions and aims of the arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is Serbia's junior partner in the two-republic
Yugoslav federation. Serbian authorities, who are at odds with the
pro-Western Montenegrin government, have recently alleged that
special British forces and other foreign experts were training
Montenegrin police in preparation for its secession from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the four could not immediately be confirmed,
but there were indications that two might be employees of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and two might
be aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, Austria, OSCE spokesman Mans Nyberg said two Britons
who work as instructors at the OSCE-run Kosovo police academy in
Vucitrn had been missing since Tuesday. He said they were believed
to have been with two Canadian aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Montena-fax news agency had said earlier that
the four were tourists caught with arms in their possession. But
Yugoslav army spokesman Col. Slobodan Stojanovic said the four were
''not tourists, but terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Illegal material was found in their possession for which
criminal charges are earmarked,'' Stojanovic told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest comes amid increased tensions in pro-independence
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that trouble may erupt in the republic ahead of
Sept. 24 Yugoslav elections, which the Montenegrin leadership has
vowed to boycott. Leaders here also worry that the Yugoslav army --
which is under the control of autocratic Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic -- may try to oust the Montenegrin government,
which has a smaller but well-trained and well-equipped paramilitary
police force.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Montenegrin Democratic Party of Socialists said that
by claiming foreign instructors are training Montenegrin troops,
Milosevic and his allies are trying to ''prepare ground for a
physical assault on Montenegro ... and the elimination of its
democratic leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Yugoslav authorities -- who have been increasing their
anti-Western propaganda ahead of the elections -- announced that
four Dutchmen were arrested in Yugoslavia in July for allegedly
plotting to assassinate Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests follow allegations that NATO has hired mercenaries
to snatch fugitive war crimes suspects on Yugoslav territory,
tightening the noose around indicted Serb leaders. Yugoslav
authorities claimed the Dutch were on a mission to kill or abduct
Milosevic or former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and bring
them to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government has demanded access to the detainees in
accordance with international conventions, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Bart Jochems said Thursday. But he said a Yugoslav
official in The Hague would not give details of the charges, where
the Dutch detainees were being held or their medical condition.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Campaigns Against Smoking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea, an isolated communist
country known for its belligerent rhetoric, says it has found a new
enemy: cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The Stalinist regime kicked off a ''Week of No Smoking
Campaign'' on Tuesday, North Korea watchers in Seoul said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening ceremony in Pyongyang, North Korea's health
minister, Kim Su Hak, urged North Koreans to ''make the 21st
century a century free from smoking,'' said the North's foreign
news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, North Korean TV stations and newspapers have
urged people to quit smoking, said Chu Seok-yong, a North Korea
watcher at Seoul's Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cigarettes are like guns trained on your hearts,'' Chu quoted
an anti-smoking slogan in the North as saying.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean media recently reported that the campaign was
ordered by Kim Jong Il, who demonstrated his leadership by quitting

<HEADLINE> German Police Free Bombing Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- As a wave of neo-Nazi activity
continued, police on Thursday freed a former German soldier
questioned in a bomb attack that injured immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old man owns a military shop near the commuter train
station in Duesseldorf where a World War II hand grenade was
detonated last week, injuring 10 immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, six of them Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''It turned out not to be a hot lead,'' state prosecutor
Johannes Mocken said. While the suspect had a police record, he had
not been linked to the right-wing scene, Mocken said.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to speculate about the motive for the attack. But
the fact that all the victims were foreigners has raised fears that
it was carried out by far-right extremists. The victims were all on
their way to catch trains home after leaving their daily German
class.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation continues amid a series of racist attacks that
have prompted calls from politicians including Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder for authorities and the public to do more to stem a rise
in extremist violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, police reported several fresh cases of right-wing
activity, including two new incidents in North Rhine-Westphalia,
the region which includes Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   In Kaldenkirchen, police said they detained three skinheads for
following asylum-seekers and threatening them with clubs and iron
bars.
</P>
<P>
   In Essen, police were seeking those responsible for throwing a
fist-sized rock through the bedroom window of the home of a
Moroccan family Wednesday night. A note attached to the rock
featured a swastika and Nazi slogans, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, five youths attacked a man from India, hitting him on
the head, on a train from Leipzig in eastern Germany late
Wednesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, police in the eastern town of Eisenach arrested
10 youths for shouting slogans including the Nazi ''Sieg Heil!''
salute. Two African asylum-seekers were attacked and chased through
the same town last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also reported vandalism, including an overturned
grave, at the former Woebbelin concentration camp. Police said it
was the third time the site had been vandalized in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Two men arrested in 1999 death of graduate student  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - More than a year after Amy Watkins was fatally
stabbed in the back with a 10-inch kitchen knife as she walked to
her Brooklyn apartment, two men have been arrested and charged with
her murder.
</P>
<P>
   David Jamison, 27, of Brooklyn, was charged Wednesday with
first-degree murder, first-degree robbery and criminal possession
of a weapon in the graduate student's death. Felix Rodriguez, 20,
of Brooklyn, was charged early Thursday with second-degree murder,
first-degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A third man was questioned extensively from Wednesday afternoon
to Thursday morning at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn, but was
released without any charges being filed against him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison was picked up for questioning Wednesday thanks to
several tips to police, including some from the Crime Stoppers hot
line. He had previously been arrested for selling drugs, petit
larceny and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jamison and two other men saw Watkins walk by the restaurant they
were in on March 8, 1999, and decided she would be an easy robbery
target. Watkins apparently struggled with her attacker and she was
stabbed once, the source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Watkins, the victim's father, said in a telephone
interview from his Manhattan home that he was completely surprised
when police called him about 1 p.m. Wednesday to tell them about
the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought someday something would happen, but I really didn't
have a lot of hope,'' he said. He expressed gratitude to the police
for never giving up on the case.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter's death horrified the city and her neighbors in
Prospect Heights, a quiet neighborhood of gentrified brownstones a
short subway ride from Manhattan. Her slaying came at a time when
the city was in the midst of a dramatic decrease in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26 and from Kansas, was studying for her masters in
social work, counseling battered women and working with children as
an intern at the New Settlement Community Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   She had taken the subway from the Bronx, where she organized a
meeting for parents about their children's reading scores. She was
attacked as she walked home from the subway station, after stopping
for some groceries shortly before 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   She was unconscious when passers-by found her on the sidewalk -
some residents said they had heard a woman scream. Watkins lived
with a roommate in an apartment building about two blocks from
where she was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Illinois but raised in Topeka, Kan., and
graduated from the University of Kansas. She moved to New York in
1997 after living briefly in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was a second-year graduate student at Hunter College's
School of Social Work, had an internship at the center and had
started working there in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was buried in suburban St. Louis, where her mother, Margaret
Tafoya, and her stepfather, John Tafoya, live. Lawrence Watkins
teaches at Dominican Academy in Manhattan.

For churches, unity builds economic clout
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- In Baltimore, a growing number of black
churches are asking members to open accounts in area banks that
have pledged to invest in the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   The concept, called collective banking, has netted $1 billion in
assets for 110 black churches and nonprofit organizations that have
joined the program, ministers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Collective Banking Group of Baltimore and Vicinity recently
renewed its three-year contract with four banks: Bank of America,
First Union Corp., Harbor Bank of Maryland and Advance Federal
Savings and Loan.
</P>
<P>
   Collective leaders predict the banks will deposit about $1
million a week from church and nonprofit members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're no longer infants and children in our economic
development. We are moving out of our adolescence,'' said Bishop
Vashti McKenzie, pastor of Payne Memorial AME Church and the
collective's founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, McKenzie became the first woman bishop in the
history of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has allowed more than 40 churches to complete
construction projects large and small, and made it possible for 61
small businesses to open or expand.

Churches offering sex education
</P>
<P>
   GROSSE POINTE, Mich. (AP) -- The Rev. John Corrado has no trouble
explaining why Grosse Pointe Unitarian Church teaches sex
education.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, the Bible's first act is the creation of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where more appropriate of a place to talk about life and the
creation of being than here,'' Corrado said. ''We're not trying to
shock or be hip, we're trying to be solid. We want to put values
into the education. This is a supportive and loving thing to do for
our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to break through to teens bombarded with sexual messages
on television, at the movies and in school, many churches are
taking the same approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sexual creatures,'' said the Rev. Mike O'Mire of the
Woodlawn Church of God in Royal Oak. ''We're not just spirit, soul
and bodies. Sex is a beautiful gift to be expressed with God's
blessing in a monogamous marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex education also lets churches preach the value of abstinence.
A recent United Nations report found that effective education
delays the start of sexual activity, reduces unplanned pregnancies
and cuts sexually transmitted disease rates.

Amish torn on whether computers are a bane or a boon
</P>
<P>
   LEWISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Moses B. Smucker got into the computer
business by accident.
</P>
<P>
   He began using computers at his harness shop for bookkeeping
when his partner, who was not Amish, brought them in.
</P>
<P>
   His partner left, but Smucker kept seven computers and he plans
to start a computer-leasing business.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish have typically shunned technology. But in the last 20
years, many have had to move from farming to business to stay
afloat. There are about 1,500 Old Order Amish businesses in
Lancaster County, 60 percent of which have been started since 1980,
according to Donald Kraybill, a Messiah College professor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those business owners see computers as an inevitable way
to keep up with the world, but some Old Order leaders see computers
as blasphemous.
</P>
<P>
   They have even asked Smucker to get rid of his computers, but he
won't.
</P>
<P>
   Differences among the Amish concerning technology have sometimes
led to splits in the group.
</P>
<P>
   Paul D. Stolzfus' parents left the Old Order after it was
discovered his father used a battery-operated light bulb at his
butchering business. Stolzfus joined the more liberal Beachy Amish,
who allow him to drive a car, have electricity in his house and
sell computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing we have to work through is fear,'' Stolzfus
said. ''The Amish are going to go to computer stores.''

Christian pastor stabbed to death in southern India
</P>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- Tensions were simmering after attackers
stabbed a Christian pastor to death in a southern state where
religious rioting has intensified over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately banned gatherings of more than five people to
prevent violence after three assailants attacked G. Emmanuel, 64,
pastor of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church
</P>
<P>
   Police detained three persons in connection with the attack last
Saturday, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The killing is the latest in a series of bomb attacks on
churches, mosques and Hindu temples in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility, but police have blamed most
attacks on a fringe Muslim group called Deendar Anjuman. At least
12 members of the little-known group have been arrested in recent
days.

Women flock to evangelist's conference
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Bishop T.D. Jakes' brand of spiritual healing is
too big for even the Georgia Dome, where more than 80,000 women
from around the world came to get closer to God.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come to be radical for the Lord,'' said Lisa Bailey of
Claymont, Del., who attended ''Woman, Thou Art Loosed!'' with her
mother, sister and cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day conference last weekend featured sermons to
recharge the soul and seminars on economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Big-screen televisions were set up next door to accommodate the
overflow after tickets sold out. Jakes' message of getting
''loosed'' -- liberated -- was also broadcast on cable television and
via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, 43-year-old pastor of the Potter's House in Dallas, one
of the fastest growing churches in the nation, said he was
''teaching practical applications of the Bible's truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Black women in particular have flocked to hear his candid
discussions of such things as domestic violence, sexual abuse and
breast cancer. Many credit his revivals for delivering them from
low self-esteem and bad relationships.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Though the Dalai Lama's exclusion from the
upcoming Millennium World Peace Summit at the United Nations
brought unwelcome headlines, organizers hope the gathering of 1,000
religious leaders will highlight a new global effort for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit has to be a call to action,'' says Bawa Jain,
secretary-general of the summit and veteran interfaith organizer.
''Unless religious leaders commit themselves to action in their
communities, religion is not going to have any meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the four-day gathering, which begins Aug. 28, say
it should result in a permanent council of religious leaders to
advise the United Nations on preventing and resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even as the agenda is being finalized,
political-religious strains threaten the peace of the peace summit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, word got out that conference organizers had not
invited the Dalai Lama to the first two days of the conference at
the United Nations, for fear of offending China.
</P>
<P>
   China would be outraged, a U.N. official advised organizers, if
they invited to the United Nations the Tibetan spiritual leader who
fled his homeland in 1959 after an abortive uprising against
China's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, organizers invited the Dalai Lama to the last two days
of the conference and to give the concluding speech -- all scheduled
at a New York hotel, away from the United Nations. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have said they will attend are Cardinal Francis
Arinze, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for
Interreligious Dialogue; Cambodian Buddhist leader Samdech Preah
Maha Ghosananda; the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric; Israel's
Chief Rabbi Meir Lau; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and numerous
indigenous leaders including Chief Oren Lyons, faithkeeper of the
Onondaga Nation in upstate New York,
</P>
<P>
   Many confirmed participants say that given the number of
conflicts with strong religious influences -- from Sierra Leone to
the Balkans -- they won't miss a chance to form alliances at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the religious roots of violence, but
until recently little attention has been paid to religious
resources for peace, notes Marc Gopin, author of ''Between Eden and
Armageddon: The Future of World Religions, Violence and
Peacemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   These resources include conflict resolution strategies that take
into account factions' deeply held theological views, says Gopin.
</P>
<P>
   ''An understanding of religious tradition, he says, ''can
generate solutions that speak to billions of people,'' such as
bringing forward-thinking religious leaders into the highest levels
of the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier interreligious conferences, such as last year's
Parliament of World Religions in Cape Town, South Africa, focused
more on interfaith dialogue. Summit organizers say this meeting
will attempt to look at conflict resolution strategies in key
regions and propose initiatives on peace, poverty and the
environment while forging a partnership with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is not an official sponsor of the summit,
which has received funding from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation,
Better World Fund and others. A coalition of interfaith leaders
organized the program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, organizers say the meeting was a response to a call from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who will give the opening
address, and the first two days of the summit will be held in the
U.N. General Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Even loose ties with the world body, Jain says, have been
advantageous, helping to attract religious leaders who see it as a
neutral setting.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.N. connection also placed the summit into the midst of
international political tensions. It was on learning of the Dalai
Lama's exclusion that fellow Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu
fired off a protest letter to Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gather this happened through caving in to pressure from the
government of China,'' Tutu wrote. ''If this is so, then it totally
undermines the integrity of the United Nations and the credibility
of the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers question how much progress religious leaders can
make during a four-day summit, and just how forthcoming they'll be.
</P>
<P>
   Courageous leaders with large followings ''can do great things
for peace by making it clear religion cannot be used to legitimate
violence,'' says R. Scott Appleby, director of the Joan B. Kroc
Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he says, top leaders may be defensive of
their constituencies and refuse to admit their own communities'
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's common, he says, for leaders to ''talk about how their
traditions are for peace (and) denounce those who do violence'' in
the name of religion, but it's rare for them to acknowledge how
their own traditions incite violence.
</P>
<P>
   David Little, Harvard Divinity School professor of religion,
ethnicity and international conflict and a member of the summit
scholars group, says he hopes religious leaders will discuss
subjects they often avoid, such as the treatment of minorities who
have become the leading victims of human rights abuses and the use
of force to restrain violence.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he wants to see leaders make tough political
choices about who might serve on an advisory committee to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While skeptics predict four days of self-congratulatory
speeches, Jain said he believes the urgency of the problem will
inspire more substantive responses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world's great religious leaders,'' he asserts, ''will
together exert moral authority in zones of conflict to seek
nonviolent solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the level of violence worldwide, he says, ''we have no
choice.''

determine what new safety measures are required before Air France
can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its
supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of experts, including French aviation authorities and
Air France representatives, was working to establish the chain of
events that led to the disaster and make a recommendation to the
Transportation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly,
Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot, said after the meeting. But he said experts still had to
clarify a number of key issues before a ban on Air France Concorde
flights is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a day after French authorities established a
special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and
potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were
killed. The unit includes 44 members of the French national police
and three judicial experts.
</P>
<P>
   Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a
hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris. It was the first crash
ever of the sleek jet, once the pride of French aviation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the
crash. Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday quoted Gayssot, the transport
minister, as raising the possibility that the ban on Air France
Concorde flights could remain in place until the Accident and
Inquiry Office releases a preliminary report on the crash at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Accident and Inquiry Office, which is part of the
Transportation Ministry, has said that flames spewing from the side
of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a major
fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   It has also said one or two of the jet's tires exploded, one of
the engines shut down, and another failed twice -- once during
takeoff and again, fatally, about one minute later.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a spokesman for the Accident and Inquiry Office
declined to comment on a report in USA Today that quoted
unidentified sources as saying investigators were trying to
determine whether a piece of Flight 4590's landing gear broke off
before takeoff, leading to a fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, some 100 technicians carefully removed two engines
from the site of the crash to a special location at Dugny, near Le
Bourget airport north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., which is the only tire supplier
for the Air France Concorde fleet, has sent two specialists to
France to aid in the inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeper Killed in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A bomb exploded Thursday on a beach near
East Timor's capital, Dili, killing a U.N. peacekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangladeshi army engineer died while searching for
unexploded ordnance on the beach, said Norwegian army Col. Brynar
Nymo, a spokesman for the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bangladeshi engineer was slightly injured in the blast
at 9:30 a.m. local time. Their names were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The area had been used as a firing range by international troops
in the half-island territory.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers landed in East Timor in September to end an
outbreak of violence by militias opposed to the territory's vote
for independence from Indonesia the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Nymo said the Bangladeshis had been sweeping the beach for
ordnance after three Portuguese peacekeepers were injured by an
explosion last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reminder of how dangerous our job is here,'' Nymo
said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, New Zealand army Pvt. Leonard William Manning was
killed in a fire fight with 10 suspected pro-Indonesian militiamen,
who had crossed into U.N.-administered East Timor from West Timor,
which is part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a squad of Australian soldiers shot two suspected
militiamen to death in a gun battle in the same area.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Charged With Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Two years after student protests and
riots forced him from office, former President Suharto was charged
Thursday with siphoning $570 million from state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they may take the 79-year-old former autocratic
leader to court within days. His lawyers maintain he is too ill for
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who is under house arrest at his Jakarta home, received
a visit from authorities and signed a document acknowledging he had
been formally charged, said Yushar Yahya, a spokesman for the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was
referred to only as ''the defendant'' in the legal papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has been formally charged. This will be followed with us
filing the indictment and a dossier on the case in court,'' said
Umbu Laga Lazore, a member of a state investigative team that
painstakingly probed Suharto's wealth over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors formally assumed responsibility for the case against
Suharto on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has said he intends to bring
Suharto before a judge sometime before Aug. 10. If convicted, he
could face life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is accused of using charities under his control to
siphon as much as $570 million in state funds to bankroll business
empires for his family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates put the wealth of Suharto's relatives at $40
billion -- a figure his family denies. They also say there is no
Suharto family fortune stashed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing. One of his lawyers, Mohamad
Assegaf, said Suharto fully cooperated with the officials Thursday
and said he understood that they were ''only doing their duty.''
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has offered to pardon Suharto if the
stolen money is surrendered. Despite the offer, the case holds
immense symbolic importance as a test of Indonesia's resolve to
fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers raised doubts a hearing would start soon because
of their client's health. His family and attorneys claim a series
of strokes has impaired his speech and ability to remember
financial transactions and other details.
</P>
<P>
   One Suharto physician, Dr. Hari Sabardi, cautioned against
forcing the ex-leader into a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not sure if he will be able to understand questions put
to him and be able give the right answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman, a human rights activist during Suharto's reign, said
Suharto must face trial, and cited recent independent medical tests
that declared the former leader fit enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's rule ended May 21, 1998, following protests against
his rule and rioting in the capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, hundreds of police were deployed near Suharto's
home and blocked a peaceful protest by several hundred students.
They want him tried immediately, not only for corruption but also
for human rights violations carried out by Indonesia's military
under Suharto's orders.

<HEADLINE> Lynch Too Gruesome for NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It seems David Lynch is too gruesome even for
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cow sculpture created by the director for a public art show
is being returned to California without going on display, The New
York Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, known for the eerie 1990s television drama ''Twin
Peaks,'' chopped off his cow's head and stuck forks and knives into
its back. He also covered parts of the cow with a reddish,
blood-like substance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was Charles Manson,'' city Parks Commissioner
Henry J. Stern told the Times. ''I don't know whether it's shock
art or schlock art. David Lynch should stick to his day job, making
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   CowParade NYC 2000 features several hundred fiberglass cows
decorated by artists and schoolchildren and displayed on sidewalks
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said he was disappointed to be excluded. ''Don't you think
when people tell you you're allowed to do whatever you want as long
as it's not sexually X-rated that they should stand behind their
word and show your cow?'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   A cow by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was
rejected before the cow parade began in June and sued the city and
organizers unsuccessfully.

<HEADLINE> Daly Waxes Philosophical About Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- As the revival of the TV series ''The
Fugitive'' began filming its debut episode this week, Tim Daly was
philosophical about his starring role.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, whose father James guest starred in one of the original
episodes, called the series ''a great opportunity to do something
that was going to be a spectacular hit or fail miserably in a grand
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is to debut in October.
</P>
<P>
   From Savannah, Daly's Dr. Richard Kimble flees to Charleston,
S.C., Philadelphia, Atlantic City, N.J., New Orleans and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As in the classic '60s series, Kimble escapes after being
wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. In his quest to find the
real killer -- a mysterious one-armed man -- Kimble must contend with
police Lt. Philip Gerard always on his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is best known for his starring role in the early '90s
sitcom ''Wings.''

<HEADLINE> Capacitor plant adds 330 jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NELSON, N.Y. (AP) - Dielectric Laboratories will double the
number of its employees under its second largest expansion in three
years, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will add approximately 330 jobs and 60,000-square
feet of new space at its Madison County plant in a $10 million
expansion, said company President Brian DuPell. Dielectric will
have about 700 employees when the expansion is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The company produces capacitors, which store electrical charges
in high-frequency items such as cellular phones and satellites.
Dielectric is the world's leading manufacturer of single-layer
capacitors, producing 50 to 60 percent of the high-frequency
market.
</P>
<P>
   The capacitors are used in the base stations that connect users
of wireless phones. Company officials said last year that due to
the growth of the wireless communications market, Dielectric
produced almost 40 million capacitors in 1999, about 8 million more
than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dielectric had $6 million in sales; last year, it had
about $21 million. In 1997, the company added 24,000 square feet of
manufacturing space.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of anti-Hillary Clinton ad from Republican Leadership Council </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the Republican Leadership Council's
new
television advertisement poking fun at U.S. Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Wrong Erie.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Les Heintz.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Starting Friday in upstate New York television markets
(Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Binghamton) and on cable
systems in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Announcer: Hillary Clinton has been talking a lot lately
to the people of Erie - Erie, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Radio show host: Mrs. Clinton, thank you for joining us here on
News Talk 1400 ...
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: She talked like she was in Erie County, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton (on radio show): I was up your way, talking about my
upstate economic agenda ...
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: But she was actually talking to Erie, Pennsylvania
</P>
<P>
   Clinton (on radio show): ... on behalf of the people of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: How can Hillary Clinton help western New York if she
can't even find it on a map? Call Hillary Clinton. Give her
directions to Erie County in New York. But say it nicely - she's
new around here.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: The ad opens with the image of a map showing western New
York and northern Pennsylvania. It zeros in on Erie County, N.Y.,
and Buffalo before shifting to Erie, Pa. Viewers see a car radio as
the radio show host's voice comes up. There is a shot of a
Pennsylvania license plate, a picture of a smiling Clinton and a
shot of a ''Pennsylvania Welcomes You'' road sign. A large map
appears and the cameras shows New York, along with Vermont,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Canada. The Clinton
campaign's telephone number is displayed and the ad ends with a
shot of a ''Welcome to New York State'' road sign.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This is the third TV ad of New York's U.S. Senate
campaign produced by the moderate Republican Leadership Council
that counts Gov. George Pataki among its leaders. Pataki is a major
backer of Clinton's Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio. Mark
Miller, executive director of the council, said the RLC plans to
spend $1 million between now and Labor Day on such ads in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The ad uses a recent appearance by the first lady on an Erie,
Pa., radio station - which her media bookers apparently thought was
in Erie County, N.Y. - to highlight the fact that Clinton only
moved into the state in January. The ad utilizes a portion of the
actual radio show to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lighthearted reminder that Mrs. Clinton is so
unfamiliar with the state of New York that she didn't know the area
code she was calling was out of state,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opposition has been making much of the
''carpetbagger'' issue and independent polls indicate that between
a third and a half of New York voters are concerned that the first
lady lacks New York roots.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned recently about whether she knew she was on a radio
station in Pennsylvania rather than in New York, Clinton said, ''I
don't remember.'' The radio station noted that it did have a very
few listeners in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   On a more subtle level, the ad, by poking fun at her, serves to
give Clinton a nudge atop the first lady-pedestal many voters still
associate with her.

<HEADLINE> Youth Games delayed by transportation troubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) - A tournament for
youth athletes from five U.S. cities began one day late Thursday
because of transportation problems at the site in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Youth Games, scheduled to begin Wednesday, were delayed
because of a dispute between organizers and a private bus company
over the cost of transporting the students, said the event's acting
president, Orville Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament on the island of St. Croix features 600 athletes
from Birmingham, Ala.; Columbia, S.C.; Washington D.C.; Newark,
N.J., and Boston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegations missed the opening ceremony on Tuesday because
they lacked transportation, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hired the government-owned bus service, Vitran, at
the last minute, but on Wednesday the buses brought some students
to the wrong site, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the delegations were understanding about what we were
going through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volleyball and basketball games were pushed back a day. Other
events - such as golf, swimming and bowling - were set to begin
Thursday, with track and field scheduled for Friday.

<HEADLINE> Fans Ready for Queen Mother's Day  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Admirers of the Queen Mother Elizabeth, determined
to wish her a happy 100th birthday, staked out soggy places along
her carriage route a day early Thursday, despite occasional heavy
showers.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came to visit us in Hornsey Rise during the Blitz,'' said
Terry Hutt, who was 5 when he first saw his favorite royal in his
north London neighborhood during World War II. ''She was my queen.
That's why I am here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Like countless others, Hutt remembers her as Queen Elizabeth,
consort of King George VI at a time when Britain faced Hitler's
forces virtually alone, enduring heavy bombing and years of
deprivation. Vivid, youthful memories link many of the wartime
generation to the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Those gathered along the broad avenue of The Mall for her
birthday Friday will have only a few minutes to see her.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by eldest grandson Prince Charles, the Queen Mother
is to leave her home at Clarence House by horse-drawn carriage at
noon and make the short trip up The Mall to Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   She and her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret,
and other royal relatives will appear on the palace balcony and
hear a 41-gun salute before a private luncheon celebration with 30
members of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Birthday celebrations for the Queen Mother have been held for
weeks, from a royal birthday bash at Windsor Castle on June 21 to a
July 19 pageant and parade in London.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of other official and unofficial greetings have been
sent to the Queen Mother, from bottles of champagne to a rib of
beef delivered Thursday by a London butcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank of Scotland is issuing 2 million 20-pound notes
with pictures of her now and in her childhood, much of which she
spent at Glamis Castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Birthday wishes from far and near have been pouring in to
Clarence House, reaching the rate of 15,000 to 20,000 cards a day,
the Post Office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the postman will hand-deliver a centenary card from
the queen, who traditionally sends birthday wishes to everyone in
Britain who turns 100. This one, for her mother, will have an
additional personal message.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other centenarians will receive similar cards on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   One, Priscilla Croasdale of Bingham in central England, said she
enjoys being the same age as the Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of the national anthem as my tune,'' Mrs. Croasdale
said, adding, ''She likes sharing her birthday with me, too, you
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Carter, who will be waiting patiently on The Mall for a
wave from the Queen Mother on Friday, may not have the same
birthday but she never forgets the Queen Mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to come down every year,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been here since yesterday evening. I can't wait to get a
glimpse of the Queen Mum. I am a true royalist and I reckon she's
the best of the bunch.''

<HEADLINE> Reno: Caution on Gun Law Study  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More studies are necessary on the
effectiveness of the Brady background check law, but ''it makes
common sense'' to deny guns to people who shouldn't have them,
Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An American Medical Association study released Wednesday found
that murder and suicide rates dropped no faster than before in
states that had to toughen their laws to comply with the 1994 Brady
Act to regulate handguns. After the act took effect, however, fewer
people 55 and older used guns to kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're willing to say that we need to do more study here,''
Reno told a news conference. ''We are getting better at evaluating
what works and what doesn't work. We're getting better at
identifying crime problems, but we must continue to do everything
we can to make it as exact as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno noted that authors of the report acknowledged they didn't
study the Brady Act's indirect impact on what is known as the
secondary gun market -- gun sales by unlicensed dealers. That,
experts say, is the source of a significant number of weapons used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said ''it makes common sense'' to keep guns out of the
hands of criminals, and the law ''must have some affect in terms of
the dissemination of guns throughout the community.''

<HEADLINE> India Snakes Rescued Before Fete  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Hundreds of snakes, their mouths sewn shut
and venom glands punctured, were confiscated by wildlife officials
Thursday on the eve of a Hindu festival in which starving cobras
and rock pythons are forced to drink milk.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50,000 snakes die every year during the Nagpanchami
festival, when people offer milk, butter and sweetened rice to
starving snakes, according to India's World Wide Fund for Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the festival, snake handlers puncture venom glands,
pull out fangs and sew the snakes' mouths shut so they will be
harmless and hungry for the special food, which they do not
normally eat, the fund said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mouths of the snakes are stitched and punctured by iron
rods so that the snake does not bite. These wounds turn septic and
the snakes often just starve to death,'' said Kedar Gore, an
education officer at the conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Snakes never drink milk, but they are force-fed. They then
either have diarrhea or the milk goes into the lungs and they choke
to death,'' Gore said. The snakes usually die within a few days
after the festival and the snake handlers sell their skins on the
black market.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, teams of wildlife officials and
volunteers have been swooping down on snake charmers who display
snakes outside railway stations and temples. The snake charmers
encourage passers-by to throw money or place milk near the snakes
during the days leading up to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Protests by wildlife enthusiasts and awareness campaigns in
schools and colleges have drastically curtailed the number of snake
charmers who arrive in Bombay before the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes are held as sacred in India and clay idols of snakes are
commonly seen in temples. Snake charmers face from six months to
two years in prison for violating the Wildlife Protection Act, but
are generally let go after a day in police custody.

<HEADLINE> Court: State can decline to collect taxes from Indians  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Pataki administration can legally refuse
to collect taxes on motor fuel and cigarettes sold by Indian
vendors to non-Indian customers, an appeals court decided Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the five-member Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court panel in Albany rejected arguments by
non-Indian retailers who have been seeking for years to get the
state to tax their Indian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Indian businessmen argue that by not charging state
sales taxes on reservation purchases of tobacco and gasoline to
non-Indian customers, the state is putting them at a huge
competitive disadvantage with those Indian-run businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's tobacco tax nearly doubling to $1.11 a pack
starting on March 1, Indian vendors not charging sales taxes can
now sell a carton of cigarettes for $13.50 less than vendors who
collect state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under a July 1998 state Court of Appeals ruling, the state
Department of Taxation and Finance's refusal to collect the sales
taxes from Indian vendors was defensible if it could be proven that
the agency has a ''rational basis'' for not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate division decided Thursday that there is such a
rational basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record here clearly ... makes plain that the statutes
cannot effectively be enforced without the cooperation of the
Indian tribes,'' Justice D. Bruce Crew III wrote for the court.
''Because of tribal immunity, the retailers cannot be sued for
their failure to collect the taxes in question, and state auditors
cannot go on reservations to examine the retailers' records.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court said the Pataki administration's attempts
in 1997 to seize shipments of gasoline and tobacco products on
which state taxes had not been paid ''resulted in civil unrest,
personal injuries and significant interference with public
transportation on the state highways.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, all of these factors provide a rational basis for
the differential treatment of the parties,'' Crew said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration in 1998 issued new regulations superseding
the old ones requiring the collection of taxes from Indian vendors
and said the new non-collection policy would be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the group which was the lead plaintiff in the case,
Jim Calvin of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, said
Thursday's ruling will be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would ask the average New Yorker to ask this question: Is it
rational to allow certain people to ignore the tax law simply
because they threaten violence?'' Calvin said. ''And is it rational
to require some retailers to file tax reports, collect and remit
tax receipts (to the state), withstand tax audits and be exposed to
tax penalties, while totally exempting other retailers from those
same requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin said state legislators have decreed that Indian vendors
should pay the tax on tobacco and gas sales to non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''The executive branch chose to enforce that law selectively,''
Calvin said. ''Now we have the judicial branch saying it is OK for
the executive branch to enforce that law selectively. That's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians believe their reservations are sovereign nations and
that their vendors doing business on Indian land are not subject to
New York state taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Crangle, a Buffalo lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court
brief in the case on behalf of Mohawk and Seneca merchants, said
the unanimous ruling may represent the end of the case. Since the
state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, has already heard the
matter and sent it back down to the lower court for further
proceedings, it would be hard for non-Indian businesses to get the
Court of Appeals to hear it again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crangle also said Thursday's ruling was a victory for Indian
tribes because it extends to Indian retailers the principle that
they have sovereign immunity from being sued over the
non-collection of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This certainly demonstrates that the state policy that
Governor Pataki initiated recognizing sovereign immunity is now
being confirmed by the courts,'' Crangle said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Convenience Stores and M.W.S.
Enterprises, a Buffalo-area business, joined Calvin's group in
challenging the Pataki administration tax enforcement policy.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Taxation and Finance had no immediate
comment on Thursday's ruling.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Worries Send Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Thursday, erasing earlier losses as
bargain hunters successfully pulled the market out of a slump in
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 49.45 at 10,736.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, down as much as 137.21 in early
trading, was up 40.82 at 3,699.28. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 9.12 at 1,447.82.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of recently beaten down stocks fell back into favor,
helping to lift the broader markets. Oracle was up $3.75 at $76.875
and Cisco System up $3.625 at $64.563.
</P>
<P>
   On the Dow, bellwether gainers Thursday included General
Electric, up $1.25 at $53, and J.P. Morgan, up $3.25 to $135.25.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold technology stocks early in the session, extending
that sectors' recent losses following a string of mediocre
second-quarter earnings reports from some high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several companies have warned that earnings will
probably fall off in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concerns about technology earnings arose when Lehman
Brothers reported that Motorola was telling suppliers it was seeing
lower demand for handsets. That put pressure on the entire wireless
phone group. Motorola was down 56.30 cents to $36.25, while Nokia
slipped $1 to $40.25.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment maker Kulicke &AMP; Soffa
Industries Inc. warned that earnings later this year could fall
below forecasts. Kulicke fell $5.625 to $16.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has fallen more than 14 percent in the past two weeks
amid worries about slowing earnings growth at technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still lots of concerns in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Ronald Hill, investment strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the Dow was drawing some support from health care,
consumer non-durables, utilities and food and beverage stocks-- all
which tend to fare better in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest gauge on inflation, orders to American factories
shot up by 5.5 percent in June, the biggest increase in nine years.
While the report suggests strong economic growth, the figure met
analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, investors have tried to sort through
mixed signals about the economy, and whether or not it is slowing.
The economy's direction is critical to determine whether the
Federal Reserve will further tighten credit when its policymakers
meet Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 830.10 million
shares, ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 8.65 at 496.09.

<HEADLINE> No drugs found in system of bus driver who crashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - No drugs or alcohol were found in the system of
a bus driver who blacked out and crashed into a building, hitting a
traffic enforcement agent and injuring 34 passengers, a transit
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Antonio Battista was given a routine drug test after the
Tuesday night accident and the results came back negative, said Al
O'Leary, a spokesman for NYC Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Battista, 25, told investigators he passed out at the wheel.
O'Leary said Battista had no known medical condition which would
explain the incident and no violations during his 14 months on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The eastbound M-34 bus Battista was driving went out of control
shortly after crossing Ninth Avenue on 34th Street. The bus
careened into a parked car, hitting traffic agent Yvette Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   The bus then jumped the curb, crashed through a 15-foot tree and
a planter, smashed into the entrance of a Solomon Smith Barney
building, and finally came to rest in front of a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital. None
of the passengers' injuries were life-threatening.

<HEADLINE> Indian Actor's Release Sought  </HEADLINE>
By K.N. ARUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRAS, India (AP) -- Bells chimed in Hindu temples where fans
prayed Thursday for a film star abducted by a ruthless gang, and a
newspaper editor trekked into a forest to try to negotiate his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Rajkumar and three companions were seized Sunday from the
film star's vacation home by a gang led by a notorious outlaw,
Veerappan, who has eluded police for years.
</P>
<P>
   On a tape Veerappan handed to the actor's wife, he demanded the
release of a man being held without charge and warned against
harming any Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   R.R. Gopal, editor of the magazine Nakeeran, trekked 270 miles
to the fringes of the Andhiyur-Satyamangalam forest range but was
forced to stop when heavy rains lashed the area, said police chief
F.C. Sharma of southern Tamil Nadu state.
</P>
<P>
   Gopal, the only journalist who has ever interviewed Veerappan,
plans to try to establish contact with him in the 4,000-square-mile
forest. He is traveling with two correspondents and a cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   Gopal was acting on behalf of the governments of neighboring
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states. He has interviewed Veerappan three
times, each time traveling to the outskirts of the forest, where he
was then blindfolded and forced to walk for three days before
meeting the outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Rajkumar's admirers have attended prayer services in
dozens of Hindu temples since the actor's abduction.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the top elected official in Karnataka state, Chief
Minister S.M. Krishna, traveled 180 miles by helicopter to the
mountaintop Malai Mahadeshwara temple Thursday for prayers, joined
by his wife, Cabinet members and the actor's son.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, 56, who has eluded capture for 18 years, has ruled
the forest for 30 years, killing at least 130 policemen,
slaughtering elephants and felling sandalwood trees, police say.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently suffers from asthma and has repeatedly offered to
surrender in exchange for amnesty. The government of Karnataka,
where most of his crimes occurred, wants to put him on trial for
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Rajkumar, 72, has appeared in more than 200 Kannada-language
films over five decades and is politically powerful in Karnataka
state. Like many people in southern India, Rajkumar and Veerappan
go by only one name.

<HEADLINE> Lucent reorganizes optical networking business under new talent  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Lucent Technologies, trying to rebound
after strategic missteps and production problems hammered its stock
price and forced warnings of disappointing earnings, announced
plans Thursday to reorganize its optical networking group.
</P>
<P>
   The Murray Hill-based provider of telecommunications equipment
and services said it will split the business into separate units
focusing on long-distance and metropolitan fiber optic networks.
The networks carry digitized voice, Internet and data traffic at
high speeds on multiple wavelengths, or channels, of light.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring, meant to boost optical network revenues more
quickly, comes after three straight disappointing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''By focusing on the core and metro markets, we expect to see
more rapid growth across our entire optical networking business and
realize a greater convergence with our data networking business,''
said Richard McGinn, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Two executives who joined Lucent when it acquired their start-up
firms recently will head the new units in what one analyst says is
a move to install ''younger, more entrepreneurial managers to run
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The company wants to make sure that what they're doing is in
tune with the marketplace,'' said telecommunications analyst Dave
Heger of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ''With some of the
missteps they've had in the optical business ... Lucent's playing
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Heger said he expected Lucent to reap more long-term benefits
than immediate ones from the management changes, which were timed
to coincide with the retirement of Harry Bosco, the optical
networking group's president.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barron will head Lucent's new metropolitan optical
networking unit, which will supply products that transmit voice and
data along fiber optic cables to businesses and residential
customers in metropolitan areas. Until a couple years ago, such
systems were only economical for long-distance traffic, Heger said.
</P>
<P>
   Barron, 43, joined Lucent in June when it acquired two-year-old
Chromatis Networks of Herndon, Va., where he was chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jeong Kim will oversee Lucent's core optical
networking unit, which supplies the same type of products to
long-distance carriers such as AT&AMP;T for handling data and other
traffic between cities. He will stress developing integrated
long-distance networks that combine the newest technology in fiber
optics and data routing.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 39, joined Lucent in May 1998 when it acquired Yurie
Systems of Landover, Md., which makes ATM access technology and
equipment for data, voice and video networking.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucent acquired Chromatis, industry experts said it would
help Lucent improve its competitive position against its two
primary rivals in optical networking, Nortel Networks and Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to leverage the entrepreneurial and technical
talents we've gained through acquisitions to drive more speed into
our development and delivery processes,'' McGinn said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which was spun off from AT&AMP;T in 1996 and has since
acquired dozens of startups and other technology businesses, had
one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street when its shares were first
issued.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock has gone into a nosedive amid a series of
problems, from insufficient production of some hot new products
last fall to losing customers to competitors such as Nortel that
rolled out higher-capacity fiber optic equipment long before
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Heger noted that Nortel began selling systems that transmit data
at 10 gigabits, or 10 billion pulses of light, per second back in
1996. Lucent, which didn't anticipate how fast the Internet's
growth would increase customer need for greater capacity, just
began selling such equipment in February, replacing technology with
one-fourth that bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lucent missed out on the explosive demand for that
equipment,'' Heger said.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has seen customers switch sooner than expected
to newer products with lower profit margins than the ones they
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the stock price has plunged from $84 in December to
$54.125 two weeks ago, when company executive warned profits for
the next two quarters will be well below analysts' expectations. In
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares were down
$2.125 to $42.938.

<HEADLINE> Fossella grabs spotlight at GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - So how does U.S. Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y.,
prepare for the biggest political speech of his life?
</P>
<P>
   By taking his two sons to see ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad''
only hours before he gives a Republican National Convention speech
about saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan, 4, and Griffin, 3, may not still be awake when their
35-year-old father speaks, but millions of others will hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really thankful and grateful to the people of Staten
Island and Brooklyn who have given me their trust and I'm really up
there representing them,'' Fossella said. ''I hope to make them
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella, elected in 1997 to fill the unfinished term of Susan
Molinari, says that Social Security, the subject of his speech, is
that interests him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella's great-grandfather, Staten Island Rep. James O'Leary,
D-N.Y., was in congress from 1935 to 1944 and was among the
legislators who voted to create Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''My great-grandfather made that commitment 65 years ago when he
voted to create the Social Security system while he was in Congress
and it's a promise that must be fulfilled,'' Fossella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my great-grandfather was in Congress, he did the right
thing for my parents and my generation,'' he said. ''We're at a
crossroads: Do we do nothing and ignore future generations or do we
maintain that promise that was made 65 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella said the campaign organizers were the one who suggested
he use the connection with his great-grandfather in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had mentioned in passing to George Bush when he started
talking about improving Social Security that my great-grandfather
was in Congress and said 'I encourage you to keep talking about
this because it's an important subject,' so perhaps it was that
that filtered its way back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional GOP leaders haven't had much of a role in this
year's convention. When asked why a congressman from Staten Island
got a prime time speaking spot in the first place, Fossella just
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be Fossella's willingness to back Bush
during the raucous New York GOP primary while one of the most
powerful Republicans on Staten Island, former congressman and
current Borough President Guy Molinari, was Arizona Sen. John
McCain's state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella even ran as a Bush delegate and outpolled Molinari by
more than 1,000 votes in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did what the party needed him to do,'' GOP State Chairman
William Powers said. ''He's a great guy.''
</P>

   ''I urged George Bush to run about a year ago, even before the
primary,'' Fossella shrugged. ''I'm very happy I made that plea.''

<HEADLINE> French Keep Concorde Flight Ban  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The French Transportation Ministry decided Thursday
to keep the ban on Concorde flights until experts clarify exactly
what caused an Air France supersonic jet to crash, killing 113
people.
</P>
<P>
   The top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot,
Gilles Ricono, told reporters the technical investigation into the
July 25 crash was going quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, today, uncertainties still surround the interpretation
and the sequence of events, and it is not yet possible to answer
decisive questions necessary before resuming flights,'' he said.
''The suspension of the Concorde flights cannot, in these
conditions, be lifted today.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France has five Concordes. British Airways, which has seven
Concordes, resumed its flights a day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ricono spoke after aviation experts met at the Transportation
Ministry to try to determine what new safety measures are required
before Air France Concordes can take off again.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde crash killed all 109 people on board and four
people on the ground. The jet, spewing flames and smoke, slammed
into a hotel outside Paris shortly after takeoff from Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Ministry's Accident and Inquiry Office, which
is investigating the crash, expects to deliver its preliminary
report at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office has said that flames seen
spewing from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely
came from a major fuel leak. It has also said one or two of the
jet's tires exploded, one of the engines shut down, and another
failed twice -- once during takeoff and again about one minute
later.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have not determined how all these
elements worked together to turn the Concorde into a flying bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Accident and Inquiry Office said Thursday that
pieces of a water deflector -- a shield used to reduce spray into
the engines from tires on wet runways -- was found on the runway
where the Concorde started its fatal journey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found pieces of a deflector, but from the beginning that
has not been a secret,'' Paul-Louis Arslanian said. ''It is an
element of the inquiry, it is not the inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to questions prompted by a report in the
newspaper USA Today that quoted unidentified sources as saying
investigators are trying to determine whether a piece of the jet's
landing gear broke off before takeoff, leading to a fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said investigators found a water deflector on the
runway, and that a water deflector on a British Airways Concorde
caused a fuel leak in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   An official British report on that incident said it was almost
certain that energy released from a burst tire broke the deflector
and hurled debris against the underside of the wing, causing a
puncture and releasing fuel.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it modified the design on its Concordes
afterward, fitting the deflector to the landing gear more securely.
Air France said Thursday it had not carried out the modification
because it was not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities have set up a special investigation unit to
establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the
crash. Named Concorde 95, the unit includes 44 members of the
French national police and three judicial experts.

<HEADLINE> Wife of accused killer to be allowed to testify in old murder case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYLVAN BEACH, N.Y. (AP) - The wife of a man charged in the death
of a 12-year-old boy 22 years ago will be allowed to testify in the
case, a judge has decided.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida County Court Judge Michael L. Dwyer issued his decision
earlier this week to allow certain statements from the wife of
Arthur Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Mills is accused of pushing Raymond Umber Jr. into the water at
the Sylvan Beach pier on Oneida Lake in July 1978. Umber hit his
head as he fell in to the water, and Mills, who was 17 at the time,
did nothing to help him, prosecutors claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy and we agree with this ruling,'' Assistant
District Attorney Scott McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ruled the death an accidental drowning at the time.
But in March, Mills, now 39, was charged with second-degree murder
in the boy's death after witnesses came forward with new
information and state police re-opened the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Umber's body was exhumed to allow a forensic
pathologist a chance to determine the exact cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 11. Defense attorney
Joseph Lupia is trying to get a change of venue.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian WWII Prisoner May Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- A Hungarian who was apparently captured
in World War II and spent 53 years in a Russian mental hospital may
be brought to Hungary this month, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Gabor Horvath, told Hungarian state television
that the Russian government is willing to repatriate the man, known
as Andras Andreyevich Tamas.
</P>
<P>
   It will take about two weeks to complete the paperwork and issue
him a Hungarian passport, Horvath said. The state airline Malev has
offered to fly the man home.
</P>
<P>
   The patient was transferred from a prison camp to a mental
hospital in Kotelnich, 600 miles east of Moscow, in 1947. Since he
could not speak Russian, the man was forgotten until a Slovak
doctor recognized his speech as Hungarian.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andras Veer director of Hungary's National Psychiatric and
Neurological Institute, visited him last week and determined he was
an ethnic Hungarian, perhaps from an area that is now in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Horvath said no record of the man's birth nor any living
relatives had been found so far.

<HEADLINE> Mao Shoes Still in Style in China  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Once the trademark of China's revolution, the
blue button-up Mao suits are all but gone in Beijing. The matching
caps are also scarce. But one piece of the old communist uniform
endures: the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese still love their ''bu xie'' (pronounced boo-shyeh) --
black cloth slip-ons with flimsy plastic or cloth soles that look
more like bedroom slippers than proper shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Italian-style leather pumps, Nike sneakers and their
knockoffs have taken over a huge chunk of the footwear market since
China started going capitalist two decades ago, the traditional
cloth shoes have refused to be squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   Twentysomethings with mobile phones sport them in trendy
shopping districts. Retirees lounge around in them, playing cards
under shade trees near Tiananmen Square. Even construction workers
lug around heavy steel beams and pour concrete in the cloth shoes,
which don't come in a steel-toe variety.
</P>
<P>
   For feet spoiled by cushioned running shoes or the support of
firm leather uppers, spending the day in the slippers on Beijing's
unforgiving concrete and tile sidewalks would be torture. The shoes
provide no arch support or cushioning, though Chinese sometimes add
stitched cotton insoles, which help a little.
</P>
<P>
   But lifelong cloth-shoe wearers like 70-year-old Gu Yuqing
cringe when they think of binding their feet in lace-ups or
stuffing them in tight, stiff leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're nice and cool in the summer and they don't pinch my
feet,'' said Gu, a thin man with leathery tanned skin and a gray
crewcut, as he shuffled into the subway entrance near Tiananmen
Square. ''In the winter, I wear thicker ones with fleece inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of bu xie is their price -- about $1. That's
important for Chinese, whose average annual disposable income is
about $770 in the cities and less than half that in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mao suits and caps can mark someone as a bumpkin or a
rigid loyalist to the communist policies that created economic and
social chaos, cotton shoes have evaded stereotypes. That's largely
because the shoes predated the revolution and are considered
symbols of Chinese, not communist, culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least since the Qing Dynasty, we've been wearing cotton
shoes. Just in the past 20 years or so, we started wearing leather
shoes,'' said Wang Feng, a 25-year-old teacher from eastern Jiangsu
province who wore a pair of white-soled bu xie as he toured Beijing
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   One of China's most famous cotton shoe makers isn't afraid to
point out the footwear's ties to the communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the entrance of Beijing's Neiliansheng Shoe Store, an exhibit
of black-and-white photos shows the Dream Team of deceased Chinese
revolutionary leaders wearing the company's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   There's Mao Tse-tung sitting on a pile of soil, looking
wistfully at the Yellow River. Revered Premier Zhou Enlai, in Mao
suit and cap, chats with a villager. Deng Xiaoping, architect of
the reforms, meets North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who wears
leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the shoe shrine is President Jiang
Zemin. But Cheng Laixiang, Neiliansheng's general manager, said
Jiang is a good customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He usually wears Western-style shoes in public, but he changes
into his cotton shoes once he goes home,'' said Cheng. He said
former President George Bush bought a pair of Neiliansheng shoes
when he ran the U.S. government liaison office in Beijing in the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Neiliansheng's shoes, first made in 1853, cost about $10 --
nearly 10 times more than the popular Flying Horse brand sold
throughout Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng said he believes Chinese will always wear cloth shoes, but
he acknowledged the market is shrinking. He declined to give
specific sales figures, but said his factory makes less than the
100,000 pairs a year it produced 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shoemaker said Neiliansheng needs to do a better job
searching out new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thinking about targeting the Chinatowns in the United
States and Europe. There are a lot of people who stock up on the
shoes when they return and visit China.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: Milosevic 'Running Scared'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is acting illegally and
provocatively because national elections set for next month have
him ''running scared.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is for the opposition to solidify, present
a single candidate and get on with the elections,'' Albright said
at a joint press briefing with Spanish Foreign Minister Josep
Pique.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Milosevic changed the constitution of the Yugoslav
federation to allow himself to run for two more four-year terms. He
called the upcoming elections under terms that favor him and his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Milosevic ''is, I believe, running scared and
consequently taking actions that are illegal and changing its
constitution to suit his purposes and trying to be provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rome earlier this week, Albright sought unsuccessfully to
persuade opposition groups from Serbia and Montenegro to compete in
the elections. They are boycotting, partly because they consider
the process unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt in anybody's mind that this election is
going to take place ... and that it will take place in unfair
circumstances where the media is under control and the opposition
is being intimidated,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And yet it is very evident that the bulk of the opposition,
even with this threat, is going to participate in the elections,
and we support them in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Albright has discussed the issue with Milo
Djukanovic, the president of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in
the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   She said Thursday they discussed how Djukanovic's party could be
helpful to the opposition without participating in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Founder of New Covenant leaves charter school's board of trustees  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The founder of the state's largest charter
school has resigned from its board in the wake of a state report
alleging he mishandled school funds.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Dare, who founded the New Covenant Charter School in
Albany in 1999 and led it through a troubled first year, stepped
down from the school's board of trustees Wednesday, a little over a
month after he resigned as board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Dare told an Albany newspaper his resignation was not related to
release of the report.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, made available Wednesday by the State
University of New York's Charter School Institute, Dare wrote a
check, using New Covenant funds, for $89,000 to Milton Horne, owner
of Milton Horne Inc., for construction work done at the school's
temporary facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction came two days after Dare received $442,800 from
the Albany City School District and deposited it to a bank account
opened in the name of the school.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said Milton Horne Inc. had been hired by The
Commons LLC, which leased the modular classrooms to New Covenant.
The Commons is a for-profit subsidiary of the Urban League of
Northeastern New York, which sponsored New Covenant's charter. Dare
serves as the Urban League's president. The report said the payment
to Horne should have come from The Commons, not from the school.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, Dare transferred $353,800 of the school district's
money to Advantage Schools Inc., New Covenant's management company
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Advantage dated that same day, Dare said the
remaining $89,000 of the original $442,800 from the Albany City
School District had been spent on rental fees, energy costs and
accounting fees. But the report concluded that no such payments
were made with the $89,000 from the school district.
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant's money should have first gone through The Commons
or directly to Advantage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Dare explained that he had written the letter in late January
with the intention of making the payments with the $89,000. But he
said The Commons' payment to Milton Horne was long overdue and that
''the school's very existence'' was threatened by the debt, the
report quoted Dare as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Commons has since begun reimbursing New Covenant for the
payment made to Milton Horne, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The state report was prepared by Glens Falls lawyer Richard
Bartlett, a former dean of Albany Law School and one-time state
assemblyman who was appointed by the Charter School Institute to
look into New Covenant's management. The institute approved New
Covenant's charter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our recommendation ... that Aaron Dare remove himself
from the board of trustees of the school or that he be removed,''
the report concluded. ''Mr. Dare cannot serve as the chief
executive of Urban League and Commons and continue to sit as a
trustee of the school without continuing to create conflicts of
interest, real or perceived.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter School Institute sent the report on Friday to New
Covenant along with a letter citing various violations found during
an end-of-the-school-year review.
</P>
<P>
   Dare told the Times Union newspaper of Albany that his
resignation was not prompted by the report and that he wants to
spend more time with his family and on the Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Dare's resignation coincided with Eleanor Bartlett's taking over
as the school's new director. A member of the state Board of
Regents, Bartlett is no relation to lawyer Richard Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Ricciardi, an attorney representing New Covenant, said
the school is ''still sorting out the facts'' but the ''board's
feelings are that Aaron has done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not misuse the school funds, for himself or for the
Urban League,'' Ricciardi said. ''It might have been better if the
payment was made through The Commons, but in the end it was state
money used for the school.''
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant is the first of the state's five charter schools
currently in operation. During its first year of operation, it was
plagued by disciplinary problems and poor academic performance. It
has switched management companies from the Boston-based Advantage
to the Manhattan-based Edison Schools Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are taxpayer-funded but operate with an
independent charter, or license and with less restrictions than
regular public schools. They are designed to provide parents with
an option in areas where they feel the public schools are lacking.

<HEADLINE> After visit, man writes $1 million check for small city library  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. - Millionaire amusement park pioneer Charles
R. Wood hadn't set foot in his local library in 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But at the urging of Crandall Public Library Trustee Judy Dee
and his friend, Josie Beckos, Wood agreed to pay a visit recently.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up paying much more.
</P>
<P>
   He said that what he saw there amazed him. So after two more
visits, he donated $1 million to the library's $10 million
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Older people were reading papers over here and youngsters were
milling around reading books and working on computers,'' Wood said
Wednesday as he presented the check to library officials. ''It was
like their home away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion proposal for the library 50 miles north of Albany
still needs to be approved by local voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Wood requires that the money be used for children's resources.
He spent a lifetime operating nearby amusement parks called the
Great Escape and Gaslight Village and a camp for sick children
called the Double H Hole in the Woods Ranch.

<HEADLINE> Bargain Hunters Lift Stock Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday, erasing earlier
losses as bargain hunters successfully pulled the market out of a
slump in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, after falling as much as 137.21 in
early trading, closed up 87.76 at 3,746.22, according to
preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also overcame early losses,
closing up 19.05 at 10,706.58. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 13.40 at 1,452.10.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of recently beaten down stocks fell back into favor,
helping to lift the broader markets. Oracle was up $4.313 at
$77.438 and Cisco System up $3.437 at $64.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said technology stock prices apparently reached a
bottom Thursday and had nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, it was the thoroughly oversold
conditions that led to the rally, especially on the Nasdaq,'' said
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union
Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the Dow, bellwether gainers Thursday included IBM, up $1.375
at $116.063, and J.P. Morgan, up $3 to $135.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold technology stocks early in the session, extending
that sectors' recent losses following a string of mediocre
second-quarter earnings reports from some high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a growing number of companies have warned that
earnings will probably fall off in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concerns about technology earnings arose when Lehman
Brothers reported that Motorola was telling suppliers it was seeing
lower demand for handsets. That put pressure on the entire wireless
phone group. Motorola was down 68.80 cents to $36.125, while Nokia
slipped 62.50 cents to $40.625.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment maker Kulicke &AMP; Soffa
Industries Inc. warned that earnings later this year could fall
below forecasts. Kulicke fell $5.50 to $16.625.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has fallen more than 14 percent in the past two weeks
amid warnings of slowing earnings growth at technology companies,
and many analysts believe those worries will remain a factor in
providing direction for the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still lots of concerns in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Ronald Hill, investment strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the Dow was drawing some support from health care,
consumer non-durables, utilities and food and beverage stocks-- all
which tend to fare better in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest gauge on inflation, orders to American factories
shot up by 5.5 percent in June, the biggest increase in nine years.
While the report suggests strong economic growth, the figure met
analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, investors have tried to sort through
mixed signals about the economy, and whether or not it is slowing.
The economy's direction is critical to determine whether the
Federal Reserve will further tighten credit when its policymakers
meet Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.05 billion shares,
ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.60 at 498.62.

<HEADLINE> TB Contacts Screening Suggested  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Health clinics should look more carefully for the
AIDS virus among people who have close contact with tuberculosis
patients because HIV-positive people are much more vulnerable to
TB, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the
screening practices of clinics in 11 urban areas. Researchers found
that the AIDS virus status was unknown for 87 percent of the 6,225
people who had close contact with infectious tuberculosis patients.
</P>
<P>
   People whose immune systems are weakened by the AIDS virus are
much more likely than healthy people to contract TB, which is
transmitted through the air by those with active tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   People who are exposed to tuberculosis and are found to have HIV
can be treated with a new two-month regimen of a TB-prevention
drug, said Suzanne Marks, a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   People with HIV also must be screened more carefully for TB,
because the usual skin test may not work for them, she said.
Instead, she recommended a chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   In the CDC study, one-third of the people infected with the AIDS
virus and reporting close contact with TB patients started
treatment to avoid contracting TB, but only one-sixth completed
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Marks said that indicates the need for improved follow-up and
tracking by health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC analyzed data from June 1998 to January 1999 from
clinics in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Santa Clara,
Calif.; Atlanta; Chicago; Newark, N.J.; New York; Memphis, Tenn.;
Houston; and Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Bar Association: Lawyers are not so bad after all  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Lawyers aren't such bad people after all,
the state Bar Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' group said attorney disciplinary statistics from
1999 in New York state showed that more than 99 percent of the
112,000 lawyers in the state were not disciplined for misconduct
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six lawyers were disbarred by courts for professional
misconduct in 1999, 106 were suspended, 24 were censured and 26
lawyers resigned from the practice of law while facing disciplinary
action, according to the Bar Association's committee on
professional discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that only 242 lawyers were disciplined shows that the
''popular opinion'' of lawyers being involved in ''chicanery'' or
as ''hired guns willing to do anything for a fee'' is untrue, the
bar association said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to see the development of an effective
professional discipline system as a constructive and progressive
means of regulating the practice of law,'' said Brooklyn lawyer
Barry Kamins, head of the bar's professional discipline committee.
''We want the public, media and the profession, to understand that
discipline agencies are for real and take their jobs very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common infractions which earned lawyers disbarment or
other disciplinary actions last year was the misappropriation of
clients' funds, tax evasion, ''client neglect'' and other behavior
which reflected badly on the practice of law, the bar association
said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of complaints filed against lawyers dropped from more
than 16,000 in 1998 to just over 15,000 in 1999. Kamins attributed
the decline to the effects of continuing legal education and ethics
courses for lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, the Bar Association said 35 lawyers were
disbarred, 40 were suspended and eight were censured in the state
judiciary's First Department (encompassing Manhattan and the
Bronx); 41 lawyers were removed, 43 suspended and six censured in
the Second Department (New York City except for Manhattan and the
Bronx, plus Long Island and five counties north of New York City);
seven lawyers were disbarred, 17 suspended and four censured in the
Third Department (28 counties in eastern and central New York); and
three lawyers were removed, six suspended and six censured in the
Fourth Department (western and northern New York).

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 88; Dow Ends Up 19  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday, erasing earlier
losses as bargain hunters successfully pulled the market out of a
slump in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, after falling as much as 137.21 in
early trading, closed up 87.76 at 3,746.22, according to
preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also overcame early losses,
closing up 19.05 at 10,706.58. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 13.40 at 1,452.10.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of recently beaten down stocks fell back into favor,
helping to lift the broader markets. Oracle was up $4.313 at
$77.438 and Cisco System up $3.437 at $64.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said technology stock prices apparently reached a
bottom Thursday and had nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, it was the thoroughly oversold
conditions that led to the rally, especially on the Nasdaq,'' said
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union
Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the Dow, bellwether gainers Thursday included IBM, up $1.375
at $116.063, and J.P. Morgan, up $3 to $135.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold technology stocks early in the session, extending
that sectors' recent losses following a string of mediocre
second-quarter earnings reports from some high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a growing number of companies have warned that
earnings will probably fall off in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concerns about technology earnings arose when Lehman
Brothers reported that Motorola was telling suppliers it was seeing
lower demand for handsets. That put pressure on the entire wireless
phone group. Motorola was down 68.80 cents to $36.125, while Nokia
slipped 62.50 cents to $40.625.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment maker Kulicke &AMP; Soffa
Industries Inc. warned that earnings later this year could fall
below forecasts. Kulicke fell $5.50 to $16.625.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has fallen more than 14 percent in the past two weeks
amid warnings of slowing earnings growth at technology companies,
and many analysts believe those worries will remain a factor in
providing direction for the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still lots of concerns in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Ronald Hill, investment strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the Dow was drawing some support from health care,
consumer non-durables, utilities and food and beverage stocks-- all
which tend to fare better in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest gauge on inflation, orders to American factories
shot up by 5.5 percent in June, the biggest increase in nine years.
While the report suggests strong economic growth, the figure met
analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, investors have tried to sort through
mixed signals about the economy, and whether or not it is slowing.
The economy's direction is critical to determine whether the
Federal Reserve will further tighten credit when its policymakers
meet Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.05 billion shares,
ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.60 at 498.62.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Storm British Courtroom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLOUGH, England (AP) -- A pair of masked gunmen burst into a
courtroom Thursday and escaped with two defendants being held
without bail, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Several shots were fired during the incident at the magistrates
court in Slough, west of London, but no one was struck, Thames
Valley Police said.
</P>
<P>
   A policeman suffered minor injuries when he was hit over the
head with a gun butt during a struggle with the masked men,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was all over in a matter of seconds,'' said eyewitness
Richard Wareham, who was in a waiting room when the men stormed in.
''I had heard the gunfire go off, there was shouting and then two
prisoners ran out followed by the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who escaped were identified by the Prison Service as
Richard Hurley, 19, charged with burglary, and Ricky Loveridge, 22,
charged with conspiracy to burgle.
</P>
<P>
   Police later said they had arrested a 22-year-old man in nearby
Maidenhead on suspicion of being one of the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant appearing in court with the pair did not flee
with the gunmen, police spokesman Richard Goodfellow said.
</P>
<P>
   The court building was closed until Friday so forensic officers
could comb the area for clues, and surrounding roads were sealed
off.

<HEADLINE> Court says county sheriff's fee is an illegal tax  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - He's no real estate broker, he's the county
sheriff. And that means the Hudson County sheriff can't collect
more than $30,000 in commission on a land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The commission on a property sold before a court-ordered auction
was excessive and amounted to an illegal tax on the sale, a state
appeals court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson County Sheriff's Department thought it was in line
for a legally allowed slice of the $3.8 million deal. According to
court papers, the department spent less than $1,000 to handle the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheriff is a constitutional officer and public official.
He or she is not a private sector salesman or a broker entitled to
a contractual commission, no matter what the costs may be,'' Judge
Edwin H. Stern wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case began after two parties agreed on the sale of a
property that had been earmarked for a sheriff's sale.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer balked at paying the commission required by state law.
By following state statutes, the county's cut came to $30,408.64.
If the property sold at auction for the same price, the commission
would have been doubled.
</P>
<P>
   A trial court judge called the state law that allows the
commission unconstitutional. The appeals court did not. In this
case, they said the amount was inappropriate, not the law that
requires it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We merely hold,'' Stern wrote, ''that there is no evidence the
Legislature intended to put the disproportionate burden of taxation
on a limited number of users of the sheriff's services.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling and its impact on other counties and other proposed
sales is being examined, said Stephen E. Trimboli, a lawyer for the
Sheriff's Association of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear whether this decision is limited to the facts
of this case or not,'' Trimboli said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson County Sheriff Joseph T. Cassidy did not return a message
left at his office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Hudson County executive's office said the
decision is under review by the county's legal staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strength of the dissent will likely lead to an appeal to
the state Supreme Court,'' Julie St. Jean said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Officials Said to Rap Film  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian officials have summoned the film
director husband of pop star Googoosh to court over a film they say
violates the Islamic dress code, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Googoosh and her husband, Masood Kimiai, said the
move was an attack by hardliners on the increasing cultural
freedoms associated with moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The summons against Kimiai was issued after the Revolutionary
Guards, who see themselves as the upholders of the Islamic
revolution, filed a complaint over Kimiai's film ''Protest.'' They
said the film was ''promoting inadequate Islamic dress code,'' the
government-owned daily newspaper, Iran, reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kimiai and Googoosh are abroad shooting a film. On Saturday,
Googoosh performed in Toronto for 12,000 people, her first concert
since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution halted her career. The
goverment bans women from singing or dancing before audiences that
include men.
</P>
<P>
   Googoosh's songs, stunning looks and flashy Western outfits made
her a star in pre-revolutionary Iran. Despite a ban, her music
still outsells that of any other Iranian artist and is widely
available on bootleg tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Googoosh, 50, was allowed to leave Iran to perform but it is not
clear whether she will be allowed to return. If she does, she is
certain to face hardliners' wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Kimiai's film, which criticizes social restrictions in today's
Iran, is attracting thousands of viewers every day, many of them
young people opposed to the restrictions imposed by the religious
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's social laws have eased since Khatami's 1997 election, but
hardliners vigorously oppose attempts to ease restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The film 'Protest' promotes the wrong culture of the former
regime as well as inadequate Islamic dress code. The film sets a
wrong model for Iranian youth,'' the Iran newspaper quoted the
complaint as saying.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't say when the summons was issued and there was no
immediate comment from the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Mojdeh Akrami, a 29-year-old woman, saw the movie and said it
contained nothing shocking. ''This film was no different from other
recent Iranian movies I've seen and there was no violation of the
Islamic dress code. I think political considerations were behind
the summoning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to be a deliberate complaint to create a new
challenge to cultural reforms,'' well-known Iranian actor Jahangir
Almasi told The Associated Press. ''Summoning, boycotting and
detention will not help political and cultural maturity in our
society.''

<HEADLINE> Appeals court rules that Trump apartment building in UN area is legal </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The 72-story apartment tower that Donald Trump
is building near the United Nations over the objections of Walter
Cronkite and other area residents is legal, a Manhattan appeals
court ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, upholding a lower
court decision, ruled 4-0 that the residential edifice at 845 First
Ave., between 47th and 48th Streets, complies with zoning
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   A triumphant Trump called the appeals court ruling ''a great
victory'' and said ''I'm very happy about it.'' He said those who
opposed the tower were ''a bunch of rich people who lost their
views'' of the East River.
</P>
<P>
   The developer said the building, 856 feet high, will be the
tallest residential tower in the world and people will start moving
in as early as January. He said the building's apartments are about
75 percent sold.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite and other members of the opposition group complained
that Trump's building, which will be some 300 feet taller than the
39-story U.N. building, will dwarf the headquarters of the world
body.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Zimroth, lawyer for the opposing coalition, said he
will seek permission to appeal to the state's highest court within
the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Zimroth had argued to the Appellate Division that zoning laws
clearly bar buildings such as Trump's from that area. He said the
building sits in two different commercial zones, neither of which
permits that type of tower.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Lindenbaum, the lawyer who got the Buildings Department
and the Board of Standards and Appeals to approve Trump's tower,
said both zones are designated R-10, the highest residential
density allowed.
</P>
<P>
   As long as a building is primarily residential, Lindenbaum said,
it matters little what the underlying commercial zones and rules
are. The building must comply with residential zoning rules.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision in December, Justice Nicholas Figueroa said the
zoning law language was somewhat ambiguous and that he would defer
to the experts as long as their interpretation of the law has a
rational basis.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal court upheld Figueroa's decision.

<HEADLINE> City, mall developer sue over legal challenges by rival  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The legal tug-of-war over the Long Wharf
Galleria got more intense Thursday, when the city and the mall
developer filed an antitrust lawsuit against a rival mall company
that's been accused of trying to kill the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit in Superior Court accuses Westfield America Inc. and
affiliates of the Australia-based developer of violating the state
Unfair Trade Practices Act in an effort to keep its regional mall
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield has also filed frivolous lawsuits, multiple Freedom of
Information Act requests and complaints with government agencies to
delay and ultimately kill the planned development, the lawsuit
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The city and Long Wharf Galleria LLC also sued the city of
Milford for working with Westfield to undermine the Long Wharf
development to protect the Connecticut Post Mall, eight miles away
in Milford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fair competition is encouraged, promoted and protected in this
country. Unfair competition, anticompetitive conduct, monopolistic
behavior is prohibited by law,'' said Steven Fischman, president of
New England Development, a developer of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield in turn attacked this lawsuit as ''frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an act of desperation by a mayor who has pushed a very
unpopular project,'' Westfield attorney Ronald Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified triple damages and a halt to
frivolous lawsuits. No date for a hearing has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John DeStefano said the city is losing $150,000 in taxes
each week the project is delayed, plus lost permit fees and
thousands of jobs and wages for city residents. He said the mall
would have been well on its way to being built by now if it were
not for Westfield's legal delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have faced a calculated, methodical strategy from Westfield
to stop New Haven from building its future ... and it has caused us
severe financial harm,'' DeStefano said.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million mall would be built on 55 acres near the
intersections of Interstates 91 and 95.
</P>
<P>
   New England Development said it has secured commitments from
Nordstrom, Macy's, Filene's and Lord &AMP; Taylor to be anchor tenants,
and the company plans to put about 150 other stores in the shopping
center.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the state reaffirmed its pledge of $28 million in aid
for the project and declared that the mall would pose ''no
significant impact'' to traffic, the environment or to area
retailers - a claim mall opponents say is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe if the project is scrutinized the way the law
requires the project to be, any rational person looking at adding
millions of car trips to I-95 and I-91 would not approve it,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that Westfield is not the only retailer that would
be hurt by the mall. Downtown shops in New Haven and other area
towns, as well as strip malls and other local businesses, would
lose customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public support for this mall would exist if it were a good
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, however, accuses Westfield of playing both sides of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield was one of 10 developers that responded to the
original request for proposals for the mall development in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After New England Development and Fusco Inc., a New Haven
developer, were chosen for the project, Westfield did a study of
the impact the mall would have on its malls in Milford and Meriden.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that about 45 percent of sales at the new
mall would be diverted from the Meriden and Milford malls, which
would see $100 million less in annual sales, the lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   The company's other Connecticut malls are in Enfield and
Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield has offered to redevelop downtown New Haven if the
mall project is stopped, and has asked tenants for the new mall to
withdraw in favor of other deals at its malls, the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   DeStefano said the city of Milford has been a ''co-conspirator''
in the anti-mall effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Milford Mayor Fred Lisman said he is surprised that his city
was sued.
</P>
<P>
   Milford had sued New Haven and the mall developers to have
another hearing before the regional planning agency that initially
approved the project. A judge threw out that lawsuit, which
Westfield funded, but Milford is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sued because we wanted free discourse and truth, and we're
being sued for asking for that,'' Lisman said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton questions Lazio vote on lobster aid  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday
questioned Rep. Rick Lazio's vote against a bill that included aid
for Long Island's lobster fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign said the congressman had fought to include $8
million for lobstermen in the emergency spending bill, but that in
the end he voted against it because it ballooned into a ''$13
billion Christmas tree'' that ''included all sorts of pork which
jeopardized the fiscal health of the country. ... He was
disappointed the bill turned into what it did,'' said Lazio
spokesman Bryan Flood.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House in March but was never acted on in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody should have been a strong advocate for getting that
money immediately to our lobsterman and getting the money needed to
look at the causes of the dying off of the lobsters, it should have
been somebody who represents Long Island,'' Clinton said as she
stood in a park on Scudder Beach overlooking Long Island Sound in
Northport.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio later sponsored the Long Island Sound Restoration Act,
which provides nearly $14 million in aid for fishermen hard-hit by
a mysterious die-off of lobsters, especially in the western part of
the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''His Long Island Sound Restoration Act will go a long way to
ensuring that our lobsterman are protected,'' Flood said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobstermen in Connecticut and New York each are slated to get
$3.6 million in direct aid. The bill also provides $6.6 million for
research into the cause of the die-off.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's work on cleaning up the Sound and his votes against
strip-mining have earned him strong praise from environmental
advocacy groups like Friends of the Earth and the League of
Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent lunchtime in Brooklyn, eating at a kosher pizzeria
in Borough Park and introducing himself to voters - most of them
Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu sidewalk press conference, he expanded on
comments he made when asked about abortion on ''The O'Reilly
Factor,'' a Fox News show. Asked when he believes life begins, he
had told the show: ''You have a very special moment when you have
conception.''
</P>
<P>
   He added Thursday: ''I don't know precisely when life begins.
It's a religious and deeply spiritual question. I know what the law
respects and what I support and that is the standard of Roe v. Wade
in terms of viability.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his favorite Supreme Court justice, he said Sandra
Day O'Connor. O'Connor has joined with more liberal justices on the
high court in upholding abortion rights in recent votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' that he voted against
same-sex marriages because ''I just believe in respecting
traditional marriages. ... Just in terms of marriages, it's a
biological fact, you know? It's how society replicates itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passers-by who met Lazio outside the kosher pizza
place were unsure who he was, but voter Rivka Rabinowitz's reaction
was typical: ''Anybody running against Hillary's got my vote. I
can't tolerate her. She's a liar and a very big anti-Semite.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accused in a recent book, ''State of a Union,'' of
having made an anti-Semitic remark in an argument in 1974. She has
denied the allegation. Some conservative Jews also believe she is
too sympathetic to the Palestinians, despite her recent statements
that U.S. aid to the Palestinians should be cut off if they declare
statehood unilaterally.

<HEADLINE> CDC testing six New Jerseyans for possible exposure to West Nile virus </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - State officials have referred six suspected
cases of the West Nile virus to the Centers for Disease Control
after finding the people displayed several symptoms of the disease
or came from counties where dead crows were found infected with the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials tested about 50 New Jerseyans suspected of
having a human West Nile virus last year, but none tested positive.
The mosquito-borne virus killed seven people in New York City last
year and sickened dozens.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, more than two dozen people have received screening
tests for St. Louis encephalitis, a strain of the West Nile virus,
in New Jersey, said state Department of Health and Senior Services
spokesman Dennis McGowan. All the tests came back negative, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state referred six cases to the CDC based on two criteria:
Either a person who complained of illness had a fever of over 100
degrees, muscle weakness, disorientation, and signs of infection in
spinal fluid, or the person met some of these categories and came
from a county where dead crows have been infected with the virus,
McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen dead crows have been found to be infected with West Nile
this year - 10 in Bergen County, two in Middlesex, two in Union and
one in Hudson County. No mosquitoes or ''sentinel'' chickens being
tracked by the state have tested positive for the virus
</P>
<P>
   McGowan would not specify which counties the six people came
from or how old they are, saying state officials didn't want to
unnecessarily alarm a particular region or age group. Elderly
people, children under age 5 and people with weak immune systems
are believed to be more susceptible to the virus, which can cause
only flulike symptoms in healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the people, an elderly man with several other
medical problems, is from Bergen County, said Tom Ammirato, a
spokesman for Bergen County Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber. The
man was treated at a hospital in New York City, Ammirato said.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the CDC are expected next week, McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   State hospitals have been told to refer any cases of patients
displaying West Nile symptoms to the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Several patients have been referred who likely have viral
meningitis, an illness with many of the same symptoms, said Steven
Sperber, an infectious disease specialist at Hackensack University
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is difficult to diagnose because it has a short
incubation period and is similar to many other ailments, he said.
Many people infected with the virus are not symptomatic at all or
have only a slight fever, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sperber said he expected many patients to flood hospitals in
coming weeks, concerned that their flulike symptoms may be
something greater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, the outbreak started right around this time,'' said
Sperber.

<HEADLINE> People react to the West Nile virus affecting entire state  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - After confirming the West Nile virus in
birds from five upstate counties, state health officials said
Thursday the virus is likely present statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we are finding West Nile virus in birds in counties well
outside of the area originally infected, and many birds are too
young to fly far, it is likely that the virus is present throughout
New York state,'' Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello said.
</P>
<P>
   Crows that tested positive for the virus this week were in the
Albany County town of Colonie, Warrensburg in Warren County, and in
the Washington County town of Greenwich. In Dutchess County, the
virus was confirmed in a blue jay from Wappingers Falls and a
sparrow from Putnam County, found in the town of Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Until the birds in Washington and Warren counties tested
positive, the farthest north the virus had been found was in Ulster
County and in Onondaga County, near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said the news shouldn't unnecessarily alarm people. But
she said stagnant water where mosquitoes breed should be monitored
and eliminated when possible.
</P>
<P>
   State Wildlife Pathologist Ward Stone said the latest
discoveries show the virus is here and the public should get used
to dealing with it. Most people interviewed Thursday agreed,
particularly considering the heavy rains that have saturated the
state and given mosquitoes ample breeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not much we can do,'' said Bob Foggo, manager of the
Colonie Town Pool. ''There's been so much water it's hard to keep
it under control ... we've been squeegeeing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be more concerned with Lyme disease and that deer tick,''
said Arnie Whitcom, the maintenance man at the Colonie pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Lyme disease is more of a threat,'' agreed Thelma
Hansen, 50. ''We know Lyme disease is horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who are infected with West Nile virus show no
symptoms, but others suffer from flu-like symptoms. West Nile can
also cause encephalitis, a swelling of the brain. The young and old
and those with weakened immune systems are considered most
susceptible to it. Less than one percent of those infected will
because seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the first U.S. case of West Nile virus was reported
in late August, and a total of seven people in the New York City
area died and 62 were infected.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said that she would keep her two grandsons, ages nine and
15, covered in bug repellant and would try to cut the long grass in
the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been rainy every day, so it's kind of hard to get back
and cut it,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been no confirmed cases of humans
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Saratoga Race Course that draws thousands of people
a day during its 36-day race meet, said they routinely spray for
mosquitoes and flies drawn to the track's well-watered grass and
manure piles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always vigilant,'' said Glen Mathes, spokesman for the
New York Racing Association. ''If there's a need to do some more,
we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The third and last scheduled spraying of the year was Tuesday.
In the wake of the state's announcement Thursday, NYRA may spray
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, all you can do is keep the mosquito population down,''
Mathes said. ''We'll do everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ciametta, executive director of Boys and Girls Clubs of
Schenectady, said they routinely remove stagnant water from their
locations by filling in road crevices and drilling holes in tire
swings.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes can produce 4,000 times more offspring in tires than
in other habitats, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting rid of standing water, officials
recommend wearing bug repellent limiting time spent outside to
hours when mosquitoes are inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are working out in the yard early, with all this
moisture, the mosquitoes are still out having breakfast on everyone
at 9 a.m.,'' said Foggo of the Colonie pool.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove Foggo's point, Cathy Riccio waved at her
16-month-old son Matthew: ''He's full of mosquito bites. He woke up
with a bunch of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus, commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia
and the Middle East, is spread to humans by mosquitoes. Its
appearance in the New York area last year prompted a massive
campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County, health officials will move immediately to
address the problem, said Harold Robillard, commissioner of
administrative and fiscal services. He said the county will
consider spraying for mosquitoes.

<HEADLINE> Former Wall St. exec gets 8 months for giving inside info to porn star </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former top Wall Street executive who gave
inside information on bank stocks to an X-rated movie actress was
sentenced to eight months in prison Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James McDermott Jr., 49, turned toward more than 50 spectators
at his sentencing and apologized to his wife and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where I see weakness and cowardice, they saw strength and
courage,'' he said in a firm voice, which had become a fixture on
TV financial programs when he was chief executive of the New York
investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott lost his job after he gave inside information to
Kathryn Gannon, a Canadian woman known as ''Marylin Star'' in the
X-rated movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 31, allegedly shared some information with Anthony
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., who was convicted of insider
trading after acknowledging his own affair with Gannon. Gannon and
Pomponio allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, commenting that insider trading
''undermines investor confidence in the securities markets,'' also
fined McDermott $25,000 and ordered him to perform 300 hours of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was less than half of what federal sentencing
guidelines recommended for his April conviction for conspiracy and
securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said she could sentence McDermott to a shorter prison
term because he was needed at his home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.,
to care for a daughter who had extraordinary needs. She did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott disputed prosecutors' portrayal of him as an arrogant
Wall Street big shot who broke the law despite a $4 million-a-year
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was called a stud stock picker, a master of the universe,''
McDermott said. ''Those things couldn't be further from the truth.
I'm just an average person who tried to work hard and give back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon was arrested in May in Vancouver, British Columbia, and
is free on $50,000 bail. Extradition proceedings are under way to
bring her to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Enters Drug Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr. checked into a
residential drug treatment facility as part of a ''self-imposed
recovery program'' after his release from prison, his lawyer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert Waters said Downey decided to return to Walden
House, a facility where he had lived previously while trying to
fight his drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''He plans to maintain a life of sobriety,'' Waters said. He
called it a transitional living arrangement for Downey after a year
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went to jail, Downey spent 53 days in a drug rehab
center as part of a 15-month sentence for misdemeanor convictions
of driving under the influence, carrying an unloaded weapon in his
car and being under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court ruled Wednesday he had served enough time to
fulfill his three-year sentence for probation violation, crediting
him for time he had served in rehabilitation. He was released on
$5,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Downey is looking forward to making films again, Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's looking forward to going back to work. He's open to
offers of work, and he wants to meet with people,'' he said. ''He's
a terrific actor and a gifted individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters said Downey has been approached by people who want him to
tell his own story in a book or a movie, but ''he hasn't considered
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the drug-treatment facility at the state prison at
Corcoran, Downey's condition improved so much that he was actually
counseling other inmates, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in great shape, and he has a tremendously positive
outlook,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of film director Robert Downey earned an Oscar
nomination for his work in the title role in ''Chaplin,'' the 1992
screen biography of the comedian. Other film credits include ''Less
Than Zero,'' ''Natural Born Killers,'' ''One Night Stand,'' ''Two
Girls and a Guy'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996, when he was
stopped for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities
found cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A month later Downey was found passed out on a child's bed in a
neighbor's home. Three days later, he was arrested for leaving a
recovery center.

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us online operation sued over privacy concerns  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN (AP) - In separate class-action lawsuits, two women have
sued Toysrus.com and accused the online toy store of illegally
providing personal information about shoppers to another company.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Austin on behalf of Hawaii resident Leah Benbow and Florida
resident Lisa Laufman.
</P>
<P>
   The women claim that their personal information was transmitted
without permission from what they thought was a secure Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The women sued the Web site, parent company Toys ''R'' Us Inc.
of Paramus, N.J., and software maker Coremetrics for at least
$10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Coremetrics, which has offices in Austin,
offers a program that helps retailers track the browsing and buying
patterns of Internet customers. The software can track how
customers reach a site, such as whether they are lured by an
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com is a Coremetrics client.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ''R'' Us spokeswoman Rebecca Caruso said the company has
not seen the two Austin lawsuits but is aware of two similar claims
filed Wednesday in New Jersey and California. She would not comment
on specifics of the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't sell or rent visitor information to other parties,''
she said. ''Our customers' personal business and privacy are very
important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coremetrics issued a statement saying it will fight the
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawsuit is based upon a complete misunderstanding of the
services Coremetrics provides. We believe the cases have no merit
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these litigations,''
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com's posted privacy statement doesn't mention
Coremetrics by name, but the toy seller says it reserves the right
to gather information about its shoppers and share it with
advertisers and other companies. Such information doesn't identify
individuals, the policy says.
</P>
<P>
   The women seek $10,000 or $100 for each day the information was
allegedly transmitted to Coremetrics - whichever is larger. They
also seek the $1,000-per-person relief asked for each person who
joins the class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left with both women's lawyers Thursday were not
immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Airman to be buried near mother 56 years after crash  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   A long-lost airman who died when a B-24 crashed into a mountain
in China in 1944 is to be buried alongside his mother on Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The casket holding the remains of Anthony DeLucia was delivered
Wednesday to his hometown of Bradford, about 80 miles south of
Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel better that if I'm ever in this situation my family
would be the beneficiaries of the Army really going out of its way
to being their own home,'' said Army Capt. Paul Gonthier, who is
counseling DeLucia's family throughout the remains' return.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though this gentleman is from a long time ago, he's still
one of our brothers,'' Gonthier said.
</P>
<P>
   Two farmers found the crash site while searching for rare herbs
on 7,000-foot Kitten Mountain in Guangxi Province in 1996. The
remains of DeLucia, a flight engineer, and nine others on the
bomber were recently examined at the Defense Department's forensic
laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   One of the airmen was buried last month in Kingston, N.Y.; the
rest will be buried soon in Arlington National Cemetery in
Arlington, Va. or in private funerals. The names of the crewmen
also will be placed on a tombstone at Arlington National Cemetery
on August 21.
</P>
<P>
   DeLucia's brother, Elmer, flew to Hawaii last week to escort the
casket home. He had promised their mother, Jennie, to bury him in
the family plot in north-central Pennsylvania if he were found.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, who died in 1968, never truly believed that her son
had died during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had always thought the plane had crashed into the
ocean,'' said Vince Gaeto, a friend of the family and the funeral
director handling DeLucia's burial. ''His mother always said,
'Well, he was a good swimmer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elmer DeLucia recently met David Rankin, one of the
investigators who sought the remains at the crash site. About 80
people were involved in the three-year search. In July, the Army
gave Elmer DeLucia his brother's dog tags.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral Mass is scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday at the St.
Bernard Roman Catholic Church in Bradford, with burial to follow at
St. Bernard Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen servicemen will attend to carry the flag, perform a
21-gun salute and serve as pallbearers. DeLucia's family will
receive his Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed on Aug. 31, 1944 - Anthony DeLucia's 24th
birthday - as it returned from a bombing raid near Formosa, now
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Another brother, Augie, was wounded during World War II when the
plane he was piloting was shot down over Stuttgart, Germany. Elmer
DeLucia was part of a mortar company in the D-Day landing in
Normandy. Both brothers provided blood samples for DNA tests in the
effort to identify Anthony DeLucia's remains.
</P>
<P>
   Gaeto, a veteran himself, said he was surprised at how much work
the Army did to return the remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just phenomenal that the U.S. government, without batting
an eye, was willing to do this and was willing to bring these men
home,'' Gaeto said. ''It gave me tremendous pride and faith in our
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The other airmen on the bomber were identified as 1st Lt. George
H. Pierpont of Salem, Va.; 2nd Lt. Franklin A. Tomenendale of
Shabbona, Ill., 2nd Lt. Robert L. Deming of Seattle, Wash., 2nd Lt.
George A. Ward of Jersey City, N.J., Sgt. Ellsworth V. Kelley of
Newark, Ohio; Pfc. Charles Buckley of Garden City, Kansas, Staff
Sgt. William A. Drager of Washington, N.J., Sgt. Robert L. Kearsey
of McKees Rocks, Pa.; and Private Vincent J. Netherwood of
Kingston, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Navy Buys $18 Million Supercomputer  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maritime accidents like the one in the movie
''The Perfect Storm'' may be easier to prevent with a new
supercomputer just bought by the Pentagon, IBM says.
</P>
<P>
   International Business Machines Corp. announced Thursday that
the $18 million computer, code-named ''Blue Wave,'' has been
installed at the Naval Oceanographic Office computer center at
Mississippi's Stennis Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Adamec, the center's director, said the ability of the IBM
RS/6000 SP to do modeling and simulation will help in the designing
of aircraft and ships and will create models of the ocean's waves,
currents and temperature to forecast weather patterns better.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said the computer is the most powerful supercomputer ever
bought by the Defense Department, the fourth-fastest supercomputer
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RS/6000 SP extends NAVOCEANO's ability to solve the
Department of Defense's most difficult computer problems,'' Peter
Ungaro, an IBM vice president, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are ranked on a standardized speed test that measures
how many calculations they perform in a second. This one was judged
the fourth most powerful in early June by groups at the University
of Tennessee and the University of Mannheim in Germany, which
publish the rankings twice a year. Used in conjunction with other
equipment at the Navy center, the computer will perform 3 trillion
operations per second, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
   The three ranked faster were Intel's ASCI Red at Sandi National
Laboratory in New Mexico; IBM's ASCI Blue Pacific, Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Calif.; and SGI's ASCI Blue Mountain
at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the list is likely to be revised at the next ranking, and
the new computer dropped to fifth place, since IBM announced in
late June that it had built the most powerful supercomputer in the
world, able to perform 12.3 trillion operations per second.
</P>
<P>
   That one is to be used by the U.S. Energy Department at the
Lawrence Livermore lab.

<HEADLINE> FSU Veterans Report to School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Seventy members of Florida State's
national championship football team reported to school Thursday
with the season opener just three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's full bore ahead,'' senior quarterback Chris Weinke said.
''We're in the best shape we can be to defend our title.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen reported Tuesday to have a couple days to become
acquainted with the routine before the varsity met a deadline for
dinner on Thursday. Returning players will practice for the first
time Friday and everyone will be timed in a 1&AMP;frac12;-mile run that gives
coaches an idea of the team's overall conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   One of the freshmen, Michael Boulware from Columbia, S.C., has
already asked coaches to move from wide receiver to linebacker, an
area where the Seminoles are thin. The 202-pound Boulware is the
younger brother of former Seminole All-America Peter Boulware.
</P>
<P>
   ''With his speed and quickness, he's got a chance to help us,''
first-year linebackers coach Joe Kines said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Tommy Polley seriously injured a knee in
Florida State's 46-29 national championship victory over Virginia
Tech and won't be ready for the opener, creating a spot for
redshirt freshman Kendyll Pope. Boulware could move behind him on
the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches hope Polley, a first-team Atlantic Coast Conference
pick, will be ready for the league opener Sept. 9 at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coaches also decided to move sophomore guard Todd
Williams back to split tackle behind Brett Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles open Aug. 26 in Jacksonville against Brigham
Young.

<HEADLINE> Russian Media Empire Denies Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The independent media company Media-Most on
Thursday denied that it might be sold to the state-controlled
natural gas monopoly, Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a sale emerged when the deputy chief of the presidential
administration, Vladislav Surkov, was quoted by the New York Times
on Thursday as saying that the Media-Most holding may be sold to
Gazprom for debts.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most, owned by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, called the
statement a ''lie'' and said it was part of Kremlin attempt to
influence negotiations with Gazprom and to disrupt the work of its
media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most confirmed it was holding talks with Gazprom on
possibly handing over some of its stock as payment for a loan, but
insisted that control over the media company will not change hands.
</P>
<P>
   A Gazprom spokesman would not give details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom owns about 30 percent of Media-Most's NTV television
channel and holds 17-20 percent more of NTV's stock as collateral
for a loan. Gazprom has been stepping up pressure on NTV in recent
months to settle its debts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Media-Most accused the Kremlin of trying to
silence the reporting of its news outlets, which have been critical
of President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most had been accused of defrauding the government in a
privatization deal, and its owner, Gusinsky, was jailed for four
days in June in a case that some observers regarded as punishment
for Media-Most's criticism of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped last week for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Gusinsky stemmed from the privatization of
the St. Petersburg television company ''Russian Video,'' whose
head, Dmitri Rozhdestvensky, has been jailed since 1998 awaiting
trial on charges of misappropriating state funds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a St. Petersburg court ruled that Rozhdestvensky
can be released from custody upon his pledge that he will not leave
the city, the Interfax news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Sonics' First-Round Pick Signs Deal  </HEADLINE>
By MIA PENTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- First-round draft pick Desmond Mason signed a
three-year contract with the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unbelievable,'' the 6-foot-5 guard said Thursday at a
news conference. ''It's a dream come true for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 17th overall pick, Mason was eligible under the rookie
salary scale to sign a three-year contract worth $3.47 million. The
Sonics will have an option for a fourth year at $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who played four seasons at Oklahoma State, said he was
challenged by his stint in the rookie Shaw Pro Summer League 2000
run by the Boston Celtics. The Sonics and nine other NBA teams
participated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a step up,'' he said. ''I learned a lot of defensive
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Paul Westphal and Sonics president and general manager
Wally Walker said they were pleased with Mason's performance in the
summer league.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded the first Shaw Cup, to be given annually to the
fledgling league's outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know they were even giving out this award,'' Mason
said. ''It was a big thing for me, and my family was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason averaged 18.0 points and 6.6 rebounds in his final year at
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he wasn't sure where Mason would fit in with the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   He will be given a chance at shooting guard -- starter Brent
Barry's position -- but Westphal said Mason's defensive skills,
versatility and ability to shoot well from the outside are likely
to guarantee him court time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as ready as any rookie to play,'' Westphal said. ''He
plays with great effort and has a good knowledge of the game. It's
hard to imagine him not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are trying to shed the image of an older team by
acquiring aggressive youngsters like Mason and Rashard Lewis, the
forward who re-upped for three years Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal said he's optimistic about the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure we'll be better than last year,'' he said. ''The West
keeps getting tougher and tougher but we have taken steps to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said he is happy to be in Seattle and will work to meet
the standards of his idols Gary Payton, Horace Grant and Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to play hard every day,'' he said. ''That's all I
can do. That is all they can ask for.''

<HEADLINE> Miss America brings message to Vietnam veterans' convention  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - She's a slight woman with a southern drawl,
a beauty queen who prefers to carry her crown in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the veterans she meets have been in wheelchairs longer
than she's been alive, but when Miss America speaks, they listen -
whether she's pushing hepatitis C screening or poking fun at
military rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Heather French brought her work on behalf of
veterans to the Vietnam Veterans of America's National Leadership
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're the reason why I became Miss America,'' she told
several hundred members, many of whom would later vie for hugs and
handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Marine veteran wounded in Vietnam, French has
made homeless veterans her cause and has testified several times
before Congress about their plight.
</P>
<P>
   She promised to carry on the work after her reign, when she
becomes the ''second lady of Kentucky.'' She is to marry that
state's Lt. Gov. Steve Henry Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''This passion isn't something you can turn on and off like a
light switch,'' she said. ''I will always be the daughter of a
disabled Vietnam veteran. I will always be affected by his trauma
and his troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   French, 25, has used her celebrity to raise awareness of
hepatitis C. Spread through blood-to-blood contact, the potentially
deadly inflammation of the liver afflicts veterans in higher
numbers than the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Vietnam alone there were over 365,000 blood transfusions in
a two-year period,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With symptoms sometimes taking 30 years to appear, many Vietnam
veterans are only now starting to feel the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're starting to see a lot of these veterans with their
disabilities getting weaker and weaker and a lot of them don't know
why,'' she said. ''But we encourage them to go get tested for
hepatitis C because there is treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans seem to respond, she said, when they hear the message
coming from a veteran's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know there are other people out there who care about them
and want to see them lead a better future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Jack Hertzel, president of VVA chapter 850 in Smyrna,
Del., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she shows up, people show up for testing,'' he said.
''She's helped us out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   French seldom wears her Miss America crown, saying it is a
representation of the veterans' voice, with each jewel standing for
a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''A gentleman in Dallas, Texas, said, 'Well if every stone
represents a veteran can I pick out mine?'
</P>
<P>
   ''Y'all are so brave,'' she deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did tell him, however, that it seems the Marines pick the
big stones,'' she said. ''I'm not sure why.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Beach closings at record lows last year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELMAR, N.J. (AP) - Good news, beachgoers: The number of beach
closings in New Jersey plunged to record lows last year, according
to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were 34 ocean and bay beach closings due to pollution in
1999, down dramatically from the 194 closings that New Jersey
averaged between 1988 and 1994, according to the 10th annual
''Testing the Waters'' report issued by the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the closings occurred at Monmouth and Ocean county
beaches, the group said. Among the reasons: polluted stormwater
discharges and sewage plant failures.
</P>
<P>
   The group said New Jersey was one of 11 states that
''comprehensively monitor'' water quality at beaches and notify the
public about the results.
</P>
<P>
   It also praised the state Department of Environmental Protection
for frequent monitoring of ocean water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''These tough requirements are the winning formula that should
be emulated both in New Jersey and nationwide,'' said Curtis
Fisher, executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest
Research Group, which released the report.

<HEADLINE> Two men charged in 1999 death of graduate student  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn man was charged Thursday with
stabbing a graduate student in the back during a mugging last year
on a darkened Brooklyn street, taking her life for ''virtually
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, David Jamison, 27, was ordered held on a
first-degree murder charges after a prosecutor claimed he confessed
to stabbing Amy Watkins in the potential death penalty case. An
alleged accomplice charged with second-degree murder, Felix
Rodriguez, 20, also was denied bail during a separate appearance in
Brooklyn Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison decided to rob ''Ms. Watkins, who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time, to satisfy his need for a small amount of
money,'' prosecutor Michael Vecchione told a judge. ''She was
killed, quite frankly, for virtually nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   A large knife used by the victim's assailants ''went almost
completely through her body,'' Vecchione added.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' father, who was in court Thursday, said he wanted a
severe prison sentence for his child's killer - not death. By law,
prosecutors have 120 days to decide whether to make pursue a
capital case once a defendant is arraigned on an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death penalty would almost be an easy way out,'' Lawrence
Watkins said. He and the victim's stepmother, Gayle Greene Watkins,
said they were struck by how young - and emotionless - the
defendants looked.
</P>
<P>
   ''These boys were the last people to see our daughter, to touch
our daughter,'' Mrs. Watkins told reporters. ''We wanted to see
something in their faces that would tell us something.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, an attorney for Jamison, Jonathan Sims, said he
''would vigorously challenge the authenticity of the confession,
especially how it was elicited by police.'' Both Sims and
Roderiguez's attorney, Steven Chaiken, also claimed that witnesses
had not been able to pick either men out of police lineups -
something prosecutors did not dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying horrified the city and the victim's neighbors in
Prospect Heights, a quiet neighborhood of gentrified brownstones a
short subway ride from Manhattan. It came at a time when the city
was in the midst of a dramatic decrease in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, 26 and from Kansas, was studying for her masters in
social work, counseling battered women and working with children as
an intern at the New Settlement Community Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of March 8, 1999, Watkins had taken the subway
from the Bronx, where she organized a meeting for parents about
their children's reading scores. She was attacked as she walked
home from the subway station, after stopping for some groceries
shortly before 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Jamison and two other men saw Watkins walk by the
restaurant they were in, and decided she would be an easy robbery
target. Watkins apparently struggled with her attacker and she was
stabbed once, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was unconscious when passers-by found her on the
sidewalk - some residents said they had heard a woman scream. She
lived with a roommate in an apartment building about two blocks
from where she was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Illinois but raised in Topeka, Kan., and
graduated from the University of Kansas. She moved to New York in
1997 after living briefly in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was a second-year graduate student at Hunter College's
School of Social Work, had an internship at the center and had
started working there in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She was buried in suburban St. Louis, where her mother, Margaret
Tafoya, and her stepfather, John Tafoya, live. Lawrence Watkins
teaches at Dominican Academy in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison was picked up for questioning Wednesday thanks to
several tips to police, including some from the Crime Stoppers hot
line. He had previously been arrested for selling drugs, petty
larceny and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said his client had been convicted only once, for
misdemeanor drug possession in 1994. Since then, he added, Jamison
''has been on the right track,'' recently moving into a new
apartment with his wife and young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A third man was questioned extensively from Wednesday afternoon
to Thursday morning at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn, but was
released without any charges being filed against him, police said.

<HEADLINE> Former CEO at sentencing: I was no 'stud stock picker'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former top Wall Street executive who gave
inside information on bank stocks to an X-rated movie actress was
sentenced to eight months in prison Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, commenting that insider trading
''undermines investor confidence in the securities markets,'' also
imposed a $25,000 fine and ordered James McDermott Jr. to perform
300 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was less than half of what federal sentencing
guidelines recommended for his April conviction for conspiracy and
securities fraud during his affair with porn star Kathryn Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said she could sentence McDermott, 49, to a lower
prison term because he was needed at his Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.,
home to care for a daughter who had extraordinary needs. She did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Wood noted that McDermott had been arrested twice for drunken
driving, including once in 1999, and said she saw ''one element
common to all of Mr. McDermott's crimes: a recklessness that
disregards the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing, McDermott stood and turned toward more than
50 spectators as he apologized publicly ''to my wife and two
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where I see weakness and cowardice, they saw strength and
courage,'' he said in a firm voice that had become a fixture on
television financial programs as he rose to chief executive officer
of the New York investment bank, Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He disputed prosecutors' portrayal of him as an arrogant Wall
Street big shot who broke the law despite a $4 million a year job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was called a stud stock picker, a master of the universe,''
McDermott said. ''Those things couldn't be further from the truth.
I'm just an average person who tried to work hard and give back.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost his job and status as a leading expert on bank stocks
after he gave inside information to Gannon, a Canadian known as
''Marylin Star'' in the X-rated movie industry.
</P>
<P>
   Denis McInerney, McDermott's lawyer, asked Wood to let his
client avoid prison because of numerous acts of charity and
community service and because his crime occurred while he was
plagued by alcoholism and depression. The judge, however, noted
that he managed to perform well in his job despite those ailments.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney said McDermott had already suffered immensely from
public humiliation, being made fun of by late night talk show
comedians and having a television police show episode based on his
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is tortured by how hard this has been for his family,''
McInerney said, noting that friends find McDermott at times to be
barely coherent and sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said she could not excuse his conduct, ''motivated by
self interest,'' but she took McDermott's charitable actions into
consideration in reducing his sentence. The federal guideline range
is a year and nine months to two years and three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that he has seemed to rehabilitate himself in the
last year, avoiding alcohol. As part of his sentence, he must
participate in an alcohol aftercare treatment program and undergo
two years of probation after beginning his prison term on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell B. Kleinman, lawyer for Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, said
he told his wife on the telephone immediately after the sentencing
that the judge ''bought into the submissions,'' including letters
from 85 people praising McDermott as well as arguments by his
lawyers for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ''She bought into it completely,'' Kleinman said he told his
wife, who also is a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Kleinman said his comments were not meant to imply that the
firm thought McDermott deserved a harsher sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not unsympathetic human beings,'' he said. ''Obviously
something strange happened in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the firm has a new management team in place and remains
the second largest investment banking firm in the country in terms
of number of annual transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of our clients ever really expressed to us any doubts
about us as a result of this whole situation. I feel that this
thing is largely behind us. The sentencing obviously represents a
final episode,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, 31, allegedly shared some information with Anthony
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., who was convicted of insider
trading charges after acknowledging his own affair with Gannon.
Gannon and Pomponio allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon was arrested in May at her Vancouver, British Columbia,
residence and is free on $50,000 bail. She also has a home in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition proceedings are underway to bring Gannon to the
United States. Pomponio's sentencing is Sept. 6.

   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Bless them, Father, for they are hot. And
sunburned. And dripping with perspiration, standing four deep in
the corners and elbow to elbow up in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioner in the gymnasium of Wildwood Catholic High
School is noisily cranking, but it is no match for the humidity or
the body heat. More than 1,000 people - in sandals, tank tops,
cut-off jeans - have crammed themselves in here for the 11 a.m.
Sunday Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Rev. Jaromir Michalak performs the sign of the
cross to start the service, people are still filing in. Some stay
squished into the corners, some climb past the basketball hoops and
into the bleachers by the championship banners that hang from the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The late arrivals know better than to go looking for a vacancy
in the rows of wooden folding chairs that cover the hardwood floor
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the summer, they're just trying to find a church on
the island,'' Michalak says later in an interview. ''They're happy
to find us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to summer church, seashore style.
</P>
<P>
   As surely as the beaches, boardwalks and amusement parks of the
Jersey shore fill up when the weather warms, so do the pews,
confessionals and bleachers of churches and other houses of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nine months of worry, three months of scurry,'' said
Rabbi Aaron Krauss, of Temple Beth El Synagogue in Margate, echoing
a saying used by clergymen of all faiths from Point Pleasant Beach
to Cape May.
</P>
<P>
   The change from winter to summer is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Beach Island, there is only one place to attend Roman
Catholic services in the offseason. It is St. Francis of Assisi in
Brant Beach, which holds five Masses every Sunbay.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, St. Francis opens mission churches in Loveladies,
Beach Haven and Surf City to accommodate the bigger congregations.
Among the four locations, the parish offers 20 Sunday Masses, each
attended by 800 to 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big, big operation,'' said the Rev. Andrew Reitz,
its pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Priests are imported - from Franciscan institutions like Siena
College in Albany, N.Y., St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y.,
and Washington Theological Union in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the communion hosts, the tiny wafers signifying
the body of Christ, which are served at all Masses. ''When we
order, we order 200,000 of them. And that doesn't even carry us
through the summer. We always have to order more,'' Reitz said.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in Wildwood, one of only two
parishes serving Wildwood, North Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and West
Wildwood, the summer-to-winter dichotomy is equally dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old baroque cathedral, one of the state's biggest
churches, holds 2,800 people. In winter, it has more than enough
space and there are empty seats in all six of the Sunday Masses.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in summer, when the population of the Wildwoods goes from
15,147 to an estimated 250,000. The parish adds eight Masses - five
of them held at Wildwood Catholic High School, about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Between 75 and 90 percent of those attending are out-of-towners,
according to the Rev. Michael P. Orsi, pastor.
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, church workers drape a blue cloth with a
white cross on it over one of the basketball backboards at one end
and erect a makeshift altar beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not St. Patrick's Cathedral, but it serves the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of our faith to attend Mass every Sunday, and they
make it easy for you here,'' said Fran Boyer, 50, of Oaklyn, a
regular summer visitor who attends Mass at the high school. ''My
sons always like this better (than St. Ann's). It's less formal.
They feel more comfortable, with the basketball hoops and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to see a packed house, pastors sometimes struggle to
accommodate all the extra people. On a recent Sunday, a first-time
visitor sitting in the back of St. Ann's during a 9:30 a.m. Sunday
Mass was tapped to serve as an usher, collecting money.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the man was a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a pleasure,'' Orsi says of his swollen summer flock. ''I
can't tell you what a pleasure it is. It's wonderful to have a full
church. You hear so many people complain about people not going to
church anymore. Well, you tell them: They're all coming to
Wildwood,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nation's museums announce guidelines for ethics funding  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Prompted by months of fierce debate over the
ethics of the funding of the Brooklyn Museum of Art's ''Sensation''
exhibit and other art shows, the American Association of Museums
has adopted new guidelines on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, voted on unanimously by the association's board
and announced Wednesday, advise against some of the practices used
by the Brooklyn Museum in its exhibit of works owned by British ad
executive Charles Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The show was controversial because of the shock value of some of
the art, including a depiction of the Virgin Mary featuring clumps
of elephant dung. But ethical questions also arose over the museum
accepting loan of the works from Saatchi and including Christie's
auction house among the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Saatchi and Christie's stood to profit from the
''Sensation'' show of works by young British artists, critics
contend, because the public exposure added to the selling power of
the artists.
</P>
<P>
   The museum said at the time that it was merely doing what many
of today's museums do.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brooklyn Museum spokeswoman Sally Williams said,
''We didn't know what the guidelines were until this morning, and
we haven't had a chance yet to review them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines suggest how museums should finance and
oversee exhibits of private collections at a time when less
government funding means museums rely increasingly on donations
from art dealers and collectors, corporations, and auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   All of these types of donors could have a private commercial
interest in public displays of art and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines urge avoiding even the appearance of a conflict
of interest when accepting the loan of art for an exhibition. They
also say the museum should maintain full authority in deciding
which artworks to accept on loan and how they should be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This code of ethics will have a big impact,'' said Edward H.
Able Jr., president and CEO of the association of 3,000 museums and
11,400 museum professionals. ''Many museums have been asking for
guidelines like this, and they will help clear of some confusion in
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the guidelines are voluntary for now, they may be
adopted by the association's accreditation commission, which holds
its next meeting in November. In that case, museums could risk
losing funds from governments and foundations if they fail to
comply with the rules.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Sign Taylor Pyatt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders have signed left
wing Taylor Pyatt, the second of four first-round draft picks from
the 1999 Entry Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed Thursday, but it is
believed Pyatt, who was chosen eighth overall, signed for the
maximum rookie salary under the cap, $1.025 million, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Pyatt, who will turn 19 in just over two weeks, spent three
seasons playing for Sudbury of the Ontario Hockey League and scored
91 goals and 104 assists during that time, including 40 goals and
49 assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to training camp and earning a spot on the
team,'' Pyatt said. ''I think I'm ready for the NHL. I spent three
years in juniors and there's not much more to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyatt is listed as 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds.

<HEADLINE> No Civilian Rule on Comoros  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORONI, Comoros (AP) -- The military ruler of the Indian Ocean
nation of Comoros said Thursday that he will not restore civilian
rule to the republic until one of the three islands halts its
attempts to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Comoros has been plagued by coups, assassinations, and military
rule since it gained independence from France in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The island of Anjouan unilaterally declared independence in
August 1997, complaining it was not receiving its fair share of
export revenues -- mainly from the sale of ylang-ylang flowers used
in perfume and vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no elections for a civilian administration until
unity and border integrity of the Comoros archipelago are restored
with the recovery of Anjouan,'' Col. Azali Assoumane said in an
interview with The Associated Press. He also called for
''tightening economic and communications sanctions against Anjouan
to curb ... separatist leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Organization of African Unity imposed sanctions
on Anjouan in an attempt to force the tiny island to return to
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Assoumane said he was concerned about a repeat of 1975, when
residents of Anjouan, Grande Comore and Moheli voted overwhelmingly
in favor of independence and a fourth island voted against. That
island, Mayotte, became a French overseas territory, though it is
claimed by the Comoros government.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Anjouan and Moheli islands announced plans to
secede in order to gain status similar to Mayotte's, but France
refused. Government troops failed to defeat the secessionists.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, representatives of the three islands met under
OAU mediation. Those from Grande Comore, the archipelago's main
island, and Moheli agreed to a peace plan, but Anjouan
representatives did not.
</P>
<P>
   Following three days of rioting in Grande Comore, Assoumane --
then army chief of staff -- seized power in a bloodless coup. He
later issued a timetable that called for a return to civilian rule
by April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he said the country may take the first steps toward
restoration of ''constitutional order'' at a three-day conference
beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is expected to deliberate on how the Anjouan
crisis can be resolved and draft a new constitution, under which
the military ruler would relinquish some of his sweeping powers to
a prime minister and legislature. The legislature would be
appointed by a conference of political parties, the army,
professional bodies, and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Central Bank, Comoros' 690,000 people depend on
$24 million a year sent home by 180,000 Comorans living in France.

<HEADLINE> Study: 'Mad Cow' Cases on the Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The number of people contracting the human form of
mad cow disease has increased by about 23 percent a year in Britain
since 1994, new research has found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, published this week in The Lancet medical journal,
are part of scientists' effort to determine the scope of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a fatal brain-wasting disease.
</P>
<P>
   They are struggling to make accurate predictions about how large
the epidemic will be or when it will reach its peak because they
don't know the incubation period of the disease. It could lay
dormant for 20 years without being detected.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, which experts think comes from eating beef
contaminated with the cattle ailment bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, can only be confirmed by examining the brains of
victims after they have died.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have had to establish the onset of the infection
by asking the victims' relatives when symptoms first occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Experts don't know exactly how long it takes between becoming
infected and getting symptoms, and the lag between becoming sick
and dying has varied.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine and the National CJD Surveillance Unit, also
found that deaths from variant CJD have risen by about a third each
year since 1994, slightly faster than the increase in the onset of
the disease. Researchers don't know why deaths are rising faster
than the incidence.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 30, a total of 75 confirmed or suspected cases have
been documented. Sixty-nine of those people have died.
</P>
<P>
   The research said 14 people have died of the disease in the
first six months of this year, compared with 18 deaths for the
whole of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although absolute numbers remain low, there appears to be a
real increase in the incidence ... in the U.K., which is a cause
for concern,'' said Dr. Hester Ward of the surveillance unit, based
in Edinburgh, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until it is known whether this increasing trend is maintained
over time, it is difficult to predict future numbers of cases,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease first surfaced in the mid-1990s, a decade after a
vet discovered Britain's first BSE-infected cattle herd.
</P>
<P>
   Since the British outbreak, which affected some 180,000 cattle,
about 200 cases have been found in Portugal and smaller numbers in
Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A European Union report concluded Tuesday that cases of mad cow
disease are unlikely to occur in the United States and Canada, but
cannot be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ordered the
slaughter of 376 sheep originating from Belgium on suspicion they
may have a mad cow-type disease.

new research has found.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, published this week in The Lancet

   The incubation period is unknown, but one victim became a
vegetarian 20 years before dying of the disease, which means the
infection could lie dormant for decades, scientists say.

<HEADLINE> Polonia Re-Signs With Yankees  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Luis Polonia walked into the Yankees' clubhouse
3&AMP;frac12; hours before gametime, shook a few hands and said his hellos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited,'' he said. ''Who doesn't want to play for the New
York Yankees?''
</P>
<P>
   Polonia signed with the Yankees three days after the Detroit
Tigers released him. New York immediately inserted him into the
lineup, batting leadoff and playing left field against the Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre said Polonia could see time in left,
at designated hitter and as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Luis yesterday on the phone,'' Torre said, ''we'll do
it as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old outfielder hit .273 with six homers in 80 games
for Detroit with a .325 on-base percentage. Detroit put Polonia on
unconditional release waivers Monday to make room for Triple-A
prospect Billy McMillon. Polonia maintains he was let go so that a
2001 option in his contract wouldn't become guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always thought it would be nice to go back to New York
before I retired,'' said Polonia, joining the Yankees for the third
time. ''I didn't think it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonia loved playing for the Yankees and owner George
Steinbrenner so much that when New York and the Tigers agreed in
June on a tentative trade that would have sent Juan Gonzalez to the
Yankees, he lobbied the two-time AL MVP to go. Gonzalez ultimately
used his no-trade clause to block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Juan, 'Don't think about it. You want to go. You want a
ring, right?''' Polonia recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He told Gonzalez not to worry about the money now, saying that
if Gonzalez performed well, ''George will take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes Juan has too many people to make his decisions,''
Polonia said.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia played with the Yankees during parts of the 1989 and
1990 seasons, then was traded to Anaheim. He returned as a free
agent in December 1993, and New York traded him to Atlanta in
August 1995 following the return of Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the talk Thursday was of an at-bat he had against the
Yankees, playing for the Braves in the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   With the Series tied 2-all and New York ahead 1-0 in the ninth
inning of Game 5, Polonia pinch-hit against John Wetteland with two
outs in the bottom of the ninth and runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia fouled off six straight fastballs, then sent a shot into
the gap in right-center that looked like a game-winner -- before
Paul O'Neill caught the ball on the run near the warning track for
the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was going to get a fastball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia thought he had fouled off 9-12 pitches. Did he think he
had the winning hit?
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, as soon as I hit it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre compared it to Game 2 of the 1978 World Series, when Bob
Welch of the Dodgers struck out the Yankees' Reggie Jackson in a
nine-pitch duel that ended the game. Torre also said Jose Cardenal,
then a Yankees' coach, had O'Neill take a few steps toward
right-center after Polonia's first three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a dead silence when he hit it,'' Torre said,
remembering what it was like in the Yankees' dugout. ''I think
O'Neill slipped. I remember him banging the wall as soon as he
caught it. That will be in my mind for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: To clear space for Polonia, the Yankees' designated INF
Wilson Delgado for assignment. New York has 10 days to trade him,
put him on unconditional release waivers or send him outright to
the minors. ... New York, looking for another outfielder since
Shane Spencer tore knee ligaments July 9, still is keeping watch
for any outfielder who becomes available.

<HEADLINE> Congo: Peace Accord Is Invalid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- The government of Congo on Thursday
pronounced a year-old peace accord dead, saying it had failed to
end two years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Interior Minister Celestin Mulumba Katshi said the
government had been forced into a deal that let foreign
''aggressors'' and the United Nations interfere in Congo's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congo no longer exists as a sovereign and free state,'' he
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in the Central African country, formerly called
Zaire, erupted in August 1998 with a rebellion against President
Laurent Kabila, who had overthrown dictator Mobutu Sese Seko the
year before. The rebels accuse Kabila of mismanagement, corruption
and warmongering.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire agreement was signed in July 1999 in Lusaka, Zambia
by Kabila and his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by
Rwanda and Uganda, who are backing the rebels. The main rebel
factions signed in the weeks that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting continues, with all sides accusing each other of
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Katshi argued that the United Nations has become ''useless''
because of its ''inertia,'' complaining the world body had not
prevented what he called the slaughter of Congolese civilians by
foreign armies.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, however, has refused to allow armed U.N. peacekeepers to
deploy in government-controlled territory. Just over 200 unarmed
U.N. military observers have deployed in Congo, out of a planned
force of 5,537 troops and observers.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has also rejected mediation attempts by former Botswana
President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what should replace the peace deal, Katshi said: ''All
that is required is for the aggressors to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as the Ugandan army announced it had begun
withdrawing more than 4,000 of its troops from the northeastern
Congo town of Buta, 370 miles from the Ugandan border.
</P>
<P>
   At least 450 Ugandan troops were flown out of Buta on Wednesday
night and another 900 were scheduled to be shuttled out Thursday,
army spokesman Maj. Phinehas Katirima said in the Ugandan capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 Ugandan troops will remain in Congo.

<HEADLINE> Miami QB Fiedler Has Hip Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins' quarterback battle ended
suddenly Thursday, and Damon Huard became the winner by default.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fiedler, who was competing with Huard for the starting job,
required arthroscopic hip surgery Thursday night for an injury that
has bothered him since training camp began. He's expected to be
sidelined until late in the preseason or early in the regular
season, which starts Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected development makes Huard the starter as the
Dolphins head into their first season without Dan Marino since
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one less question you won't have to ask me every press
conference,'' coach Dave Wannstedt quipped to reporters. ''This was
a total shock to all of us. But, hey, better now than the second
game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, who led Miami to a 5-1 record when Marino was sidelined
last season, had a slight edge over Fiedler after three weeks of
training camp. Huard, 27, was already slated to start the first
exhibition game Saturday at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm optimistic Damon will go out and throw four touchdown
passes, and we'll all feel real good,'' Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldler underwent an MRI late Wednesday, which indicated
surgery was needed to repair a tear in his hip joint. He had been
bothered earlier this summer by a sore back and continued to
practice even after his hip began to hurt a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unclear to tell whether this injury was related to his
earlier back pain,'' trainer Kevin O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldler, 28, backed up Mark Brunell last year for the
Jacksonville Jaguars, then signed a three-year, $3.8 million
contract with the Dolphins in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad that the injury is not a serious one,'' Fiedler said
in a statement. ''I'm looking forward to a quick recovery and
getting back on the field as soon as medically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt said he hopes Fiedler can play in the final preseason
game Aug. 25. But for now the job belongs to Huard, who broke into
the NFL as an undrafted free agent and has been with the Dolphins
since 1997 but never started until last year when Marino was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fiedler's injury, Huard said he'll still feel pressure
to play well.

<P>
   ''Regardless, there's pressure -- that's the nature of the
business,'' he said. ''It's unfortunate for Jay, and I wish him a
quick recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard will play the first half Saturday against the Steelers.
The other quarterbacks on the roster are Jim Druckenmiller, who
becomes the backup, and Mike Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a panic situation,'' Wannstedt said. ''This is
just a little curve in the road that we have to deal with.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson's Name on Gambling Web Site  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reggie Jackson sold his name to a Web site
offering casino games, but it also showed up on a second one that
features gambling on sports, including baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's lawyers had approved the use of his name for the first
site, but said Thursday they had no knowledge that it was being
used to point to the sports gambling site as well.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball is investigating Jackson's involvement
with Transworld Network SA WorldNet Casinos Inc., located in San
Jose, Costa Rica, which operates the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has strict anti-gambling rules, which caused all-time
hits leader Pete Rose to be banned from the sport. Jackson, who
recently underwent back surgery, is on the New York Yankees'
payroll as an adviser and spent time with the team during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   The first site -- reggiejacksoncasino.com -- features a picture of
Jackson wearing pinstripes and swinging a bat. It offers games such
as blackjack, bingo and roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers on Thursday, however, also were able to find a
hyperlink that pointed them to a second site -- placethatbet.com --
which contains a sportsbook for betting on baseball. The hyperlink
read: ''Reggie Jackson Presents Place That Bet Online Casino and
Sportsbook Featuring Blackjack, Roulette, Poker and More.''
</P>
<P>
   Told by The Associated Press of the second site hyperlink
containing Jackson's name, his attorney, Ed Blum, said: ''That will
be off in a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Jackson's name was gone from one of the pages on
placethatbet.com, but remained on the hyperlink pointing to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was done totally without Reggie's knowledge or
involvement,'' he said. ''The folks we've been doing business with
have violated an agreement and trust. Reggie allowed his name to be
used with the express provision that a sportsbook would not be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have made it clear that as soon as there is any illegality
with the Web site, Reggie would withdraw any involvement. They have
no business linking Reggie Jackson's name with a sportsbook.''
</P>
<P>
   A person answering the phone at Metro Web S.A. in Costa Rica,
which registered the placethatbet.com Web site, said no one was
available to comment about the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Blum said he had exchanged correspondence with baseball attorney
Tom Ostertag regarding the reggiejacksoncasino.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ostertag did not immediately return two phone calls to his
office. Rich Levin, a spokesman for commissioner Bud Selig, said
baseball is looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand there is a prohibition against major league
baseball personnel being involved in casino operations,'' Blum
said. ''There are exceptions that they refer to as 'glad-handing' --
people like Willie Mays, who play golf with customers of casinos. I
took the position that the exception should apply to Reggie. If
it's appropriate to play golf with someone who is expected to go
into the casino, it seems we're much further removed from that by
simply allowing the use of his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they are doing is using his name on the Net. Since it is a
legal activity, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''If baseball asks Reggie to disassociate himself from this
operation, we're out,'' Blum said. ''Reggie's only involvement is
the use of his name. He is not an owner or an operator, He's made
it clear that he does not want to be involved in gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Merola, Jackson's agent, said Jackson's involvement with
the Web site was legal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has nothing to do with betting on baseball,'' he said.
''We're waiting to hear from baseball if it's OK. We have a way out
and if baseball says, 'Get out,' we're out.''

<HEADLINE> US Olympic Pitcher on No-Hit Streak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Johnny Vander Meer has nothing on
U.S. Olympic softball pitcher Lisa Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Meer is the only major league baseball pitcher to throw
consecutive no-hitters, accomplishing it in 1938 for the Cincinnati
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   But Fernandez has pitched four consecutive perfect games for the
U.S. national team on its ''Central Park to Sydney'' Olympic
preparation tour.
</P>
<P>
   No batter has reached base against Fernandez, of Long Beach,
Calif., in 30 innings. USA Softball officials said Thursday they
can't recall a pitcher ever having even three consecutive perfect
games against any competition.
</P>
<P>
   Softball was an Olympic sport for the first time in 1996, and
there were no perfect games in Atlanta. Fernandez came closest,
going 9 2-3 innings against Australia without allowing a baserunner
before giving up a game-winning homer that handed the United States
its only loss of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out 12 and didn't allow a ball out of the
infield in the national team's 11-0 victory over the Texas
All-Stars on Wednesday night. She is scheduled to pitch next on
Aug. 12, against the Tampa Bay FireStix in Bloomington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is 90-0 since the 1998 world championships and has
outscored its opponents 300-2 on the current tour.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Conserve Calif. Electricity  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton directed that federal
agencies and military units in California put electricity-saving
programs in place to help ease the state's acute power shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Thursday the state's power
problems are a warning that the nation's electricity system must be
modernized to meet growing demand and market pressures of an
increasingly competitive and deregulated industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's directive, managers of federal buildings and
military installations are expected to raise thermostats slightly,
turn off escalators and make sure lights are turned off in rooms
not in use, Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said expected electricity savings are equal to
providing power to 500,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson chastised Congress for failing to enact a
comprehensive bill to restructure the electricity industry before
leaving for its summer recess, saying such legislation is needed to
ensure electricity reliability and hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity costs have soared in recent weeks in some parts of
the country, including in California and in the Northeast. There
have been sharp price spikes because of high demand and supply
problems, although officials in California have capped wholesale
prices for peak loads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential power outage situation (in California) should
serve as a wake-up call to Congress. Failure to enact restructuring
legislation puts the reliability of the electric grid at risk,''
Richardson said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation being considered in Congress would create a new
organization to monitor and regulate reliability of the nation's
electricity grids. The bill has passed the Senate but is considered
dead in the House this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his directive, Clinton also ordered federal power-marketing
agencies in the West to ''take all possible steps to maximize the
amount of electricity that can be delivered to California.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These short-term measures will assist California utilities and
consumers in meeting electricity needs during this critical
period,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bonneville Power Administration in the Northwest and
the Western Area Power Administration, which operates dams across
the West, already have been delivering as much electricity to
California as transmission lines will allow, officials at the two
power agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Moosey, a Bonneville spokesman in Portland, Ore., said
two transmission lines from the Northwest into California are
carrying maximum loads.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Mobley Faces Knee Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Knee surgery ended John Mobley's season in
1999. Another trip to the operating room has postponed his debut in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos linebacker was scheduled to have surgery
Friday to repair a small cartilage tear in his right knee, while
his teammates prepared for their first preseason game Saturday at
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee in Denver's second game last year, is expected to be sidelined
for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really looking forward to Saturday, but I am also
relieved it's not going to go into the regular season,'' he said.
''It's something we can pretty much nip in the bud in the
preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, an All-Pro in 1997, practiced in pain over the past few
days and noticed in videotapes that he was limping. An MRI on
Thursday confirmed a small meniscus tear and surgery was scheduled
at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic in Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Team trainer Steve Antonopulos told Mobley the latest setback
was not related to last year's injury, and the 26-year-old was
determined to return for Denver's regular-season opener in St.
Louis on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless God strikes me down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley has had a string of misfortune over the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to driving while ability impaired and careless
driving after crashing his 1997 Jaguar last summer, and suffered
his season-ending knee injury three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by his offseason rehabilitation, Mobley hoped to make
a fresh start this year only to be slowed by his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one thing after another, but it makes you
stronger,'' he said. ''I think everybody needs some kind of
adversity in their life to be able to deal with the problems as
they come.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley's knee problems present an opportunity for rookie Ian
Gold, Denver's second-round draft pick out of Michigan. Gold and
third-year pro Nate Wayne were expected to share time at the
weakside linebacker spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that he got injured again, but I'm looking
forward to getting a chance to play,'' Gold said. ''That's why I'm
here. Due to the circumstances, I'll get some more playing time
than expected, and I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mobley, the Broncos also will be without
linebacker Glenn Cadrez on Saturday. Cadrez, who filled Mobley's
role last year, has a strained hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 101; Dow Ends Up 19  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday, erasing earlier
losses as bargain hunters successfully pulled the market out of a
slump in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, after falling as much as 137.21 in
early trading, closed up 101.42 at 3,759.88.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also overcame early losses,
closing up 19.05 at 10,706.58. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose
13.86 to 1,452.56.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of recently beaten down stocks came back into favor,
helping to lift the broader market. Oracle was up $4.313 at $77.438
after falling as low as $71.625 and Cisco Systems rose $3.437 to
$64.375 after hitting a low of $58.50.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said technology stock prices apparently reached a
bottom Thursday and had nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than anything else, it was the thoroughly oversold
conditions that led to the rally, especially on the Nasdaq,'' said
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union
Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the Dow, bellwether gainers Thursday included IBM, up $1.375
at $116.063, Intel, up $1.813 at $65.063, and J.P. Morgan, up $3 at
$135.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold technology stocks early in the session, extending
that sector's recent losses following a string of mediocre
second-quarter earnings reports from some high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a growing number of companies have warned that
earnings will probably fall off in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concerns about technology earnings arose when Lehman
Brothers reported that Motorola was telling suppliers it was seeing
lower demand for handsets. That put pressure on the entire wireless
phone group. Motorola was down 68.75 cents to $36.125, while Nokia
slipped 75 cents to $40.50.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor equipment maker Kulicke &AMP; Soffa
Industries warned that earnings later this year could fall below
forecasts. Kulicke fell $5.50 to $16.625.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq had fallen more than 14 percent in the past two weeks
amid warnings of slowing earnings growth at technology companies --
despite Thursday's turnaround many analysts believe those worries
will remain a factor in providing direction for the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still lots of concerns in the tech and telecom
sectors,'' said Ronald Hill, investment strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the Dow was drawing some support from health care,
consumer nondurables, utilities and food and beverage stocks-- all
which tend to fare better in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest gauge on inflation, orders to American factories
shot up by 5.5 percent in June, the biggest increase in nine years.
While the report suggests strong economic growth, the figure met
analyst forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, investors have tried to sort through
mixed signals about the economy, and whether or not it is slowing.
The economy's direction is critical to determine whether the
Federal Reserve will further tighten credit when its policy-makers
meet Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.29 billion shares,
ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.76 at 499.45.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.4 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.05 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 1.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 2.68 percent.

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Brown to 3-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- When Randy Brown played against the Boston
Celtics the past few years, he thought they needed someone to
bolster the second team. Someone just like him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're a team that's ready to burst out,'' Brown said
Thursday after signing a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the
Celtics. ''I think they're a couple of road wins away, and you're
looking at a playoff team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 32, played his last five seasons with Chicago, collecting
three NBA championships. He averaged 6.4 points and 2.4 rebounds in
27.5 minutes and is considered a solid defender who will fit in to
coach Rick Pitino's high-intensity system.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's someone who brings a true veteran presence that we've
been looking for for quite some time,'' said Celtics general
manager Chris Wallace, who also noted that Brown had 16 points, 11
rebounds and eight assists to help the Bulls beat the Celtics at
the FleetCenter in March.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's main job will be backing up point guard Kenny Anderson.
But he said he will try to be a team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't be a person that's going to bark in those guys' faces.
I'm not a barker,'' he said. ''I will be in their ears when they're
screwing up or doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he also talked with Milwaukee, as well as Chicago. He
said that he won't spend a lot of time telling the players in
Boston what it was like to win championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got enough tradition here,'' he said in the Hall of
Fame room of the Celtics' workout facility. Accepting a uniform
with the No. 20, he said, ''I only had about two choices with all
their numbers being retired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics earlier failed to sign free agent Denver Nuggets
guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad. Boston is well over the salary cap -- Brown
was signed using an exception -- and was not involved in the bidding
for such prime free agents as Tim Duncan and Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the Celtics would have to get rid of Antoine Walker
and Paul Pierce to compete for the top free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''That hasn't been an option since we've been here because we
like these guys,'' he said. ''Plus, it's a little tricky to get
down there. You have to throw a lot of things overboard, and you
don't always get those guys signed.''

<HEADLINE> Royals Suspend Beltran  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AL Rookie of the Year Carlos Beltran was
suspended without pay Thursday by the Kansas City Royals for
refusing to report to the team's Florida training complex for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old center fielder has been on the disabled list
with a bruised right knee since July 5. The Royals said their team
physician, Dr. Steve Joyce, recommended a rehabilitation at Haines
City and that the Royals directed Beltran to report.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City said Beltran refused to go and suspended him for 30
days or until he reports to Haines City, whichever is first.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran makes $350,000 this season and each day of the
suspension his will cost him $1,923.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Beltran's agent, Scott
Boras, or the Major League Baseball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran is hitting .247 this year with six homers, 32 RBIs and
10 steals in 10 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Beltran batted .293 with 22 homers, 108 RBIs, 112
runs and 27 steals in 35 attempts. He became the third Kansas City
player voted Rookie of the Year, following Lou Piniella in 1969 and
Bob Hamelin in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong's Friend, Fundraiser Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A 12-year-old girl who was a staunch
fund-raiser for Lance Armstrong's cancer research foundation has
finally lost her fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Davidson died Tuesday at her parents home in Fort Worth,
according to officials. She suffered from neuroblastoma, a cancer
in children.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was fighter and she fought it to the end,'' said Lauri
Adams, of the Ronald McDonald House of Fort Worth, where Davidson
had stayed on and off for about a year while undergoing
chemotherapy. ''We are all better people for knowing her.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Davidson stayed at the Ronald McDonald House was
earlier this year, Adams told The Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Armstrong foundation and the cyclist himself
did not immediately comment on Davidson's death, citing a request
by the girl's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kelly was the top fund-raiser for the 1999 Race for the Roses
event in Austin benefiting the Lance Armstrong Foundation and
cancer patients everywhere,'' according to an obituary in the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though she did not beat cancer, Kelly was and shall always be
a winner,'' the obit said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson met Armstrong three years ago as she struggled through
chemotherapy and the two became friends. Armstrong has since come
back from cancer to win the Tour de France the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28-year-old cycling champion never forgot Davidson, whom
he sent several gifts and wished her well on camera while riding in
the 1999 Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her parents, John and Jamie, Davidson is survived by her
grandparents, James and Marilyn Ballew, of Dumas, and Jerry and
DeAnn Davidson of Dimmitt.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral was to be held Friday afternoon in Pflugerville,
northeast of Austin.

<HEADLINE> Massenburg Signs With Grizzlies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Tony Massenburg is ready for
a third tour of NBA duty in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The much-traveled 6-foot-9 forward returned to the Vancouver
Grizzlies as a free agent Thursday after spending last season with
the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg played two of his most productive seasons in the NBA
with the Grizzlies from 1997-98 through 1998-99, averaging 8.9
points and 4.9 rebounds. He was a part of the blockbuster trade a
year ago that sent Steve Francis to Houston for Michael Dickerson
and Othella Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to leave and I had no control over that,'' said
Massenburg, who has played for 10 NBA teams, including both
Canadian franchises. ''With the things that I was able to
accomplish here, it was a really sad and hard thing for me to do. I
feel like I've played some of my best basketball in Vancouver and I
think my best basketball is still to come -- in Vancouver,
fortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg signed under the mid-level exception. The length of
his contract was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg, 33, averaged 4.6 points and shot .444 from the field
last season when he played only 10 games due to a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' president of basketball operations,
spoke highly of Massenburg's professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brings to the table what we were looking for,'' he said.
''And we like the fact that he is such a pro. He clearly knows who
he is and what he has to do. He's upbeat and a cheerful guy. And
he's a skill player. Plus, he brings toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg, whose last stint in Vancouver came under Stu
Jackson's regime, likes what he sees of Versace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Dick's done a great job of planning things and putting
a blueprint together and seeing where we want to go in the
future,'' said Massenburg, before cracking up the room with this
line: ''The addition of myself is probably his most brilliant
move.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Massenburg creates a logjam in the Grizzlies'
frontcourt, perhaps paving the way for a trade of either Othella
Harrington or Grant Long. Massenburg provides more depth in that he
plays both the power forward and center positions.
</P>
<P>
   Massenburg was originally drafted 43rd overall by San Antonio in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how many teams I've played for because I stopped
counting a long time ago,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Leaders Aim To Cut Traffic  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- With sooty, smoggy air hanging over the
Salt Lake area for nearly a week, Olympic organizers issued an
ambitious plan Thursday to curb traffic and air pollution during
the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to leave Salt Lake a better environment after
hosting the games,'' said Diane Conrad, director of environmental
programs for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC issued her 56-page air quality plan as Conrad got
''walloped'' by the city's worst air pollution since 1989. She
stayed home Thursday nursing an aggravated sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for 100,000 trees, natural gas-powered vans and
motor coaches for athletes, Olympic officials, sponsors and the
media and park-and-ride lots for spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic sponsor General Motors will loan vehicles that can burn
gasoline or compressed natural gas. Salt Lake also will make use of
its new light-rail system.
</P>
<P>
   The environment joined sport and culture in a trio of Olympic
ideals in 1994. Salt Lake's goal is to host the first Olympic Games
with no net increase in air pollution emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution could even be reduced, although this
mountain-rimmed basin is vulnerable to wintertime temperature
inversions that can trap pollutants at ground level.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, meanwhile, are rolling out a smart traffic
management system with the overhaul of Interstate 15 along the
Wasatch Front that was designed to cut traffic accidents by 20
percent and freeway delays by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The system involves 190 stationary cameras, 550 coordinated
traffic signals, roadbed sensors and 57 congestion-alert signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic committee already is a third of the way toward
planting a variety of 100,000 trees -- not seedlings but inch-thick
trees, said Conrad, former deputy commissioner for the Vermont
Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are consulting NASA images of ''urban heat islands''
to determine the best places for new trees.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was able to reduce traffic volumes by up to 30 percent
during the 1996 Summer Games, a goal Salt Lake hopes to match.
</P>
<P>
   But controlling pollution is an ambitious goal that could be
thwarted by weather, says Robert Dalley, manager for the air
monitoring section of the Utah Division of Air Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winter conversions are very common. We've had inversions
lasting up to 28 days without a break. We haven't experienced those
since 1993, so we're into seven years of better-than-usual
meteorology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake's summer air pollution eased slightly Thursday after
six straight days of unhealthy air. Levels for ground-level ozone,
which forms smog and can irritate lung tissue and burn eyes, and
fine particles exceeded safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions were exacerbated by 100-degree heat, stagnant air
and drifting smoke from wildfires, Dalley said.

<HEADLINE> Houston Rockets Closer to New Arena  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Reservations were expressed almost immediately
after the Houston Rockets and local officials agreed Thursday to
give Harris County voters a second chance at approving a new
downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets and the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, a
partnership between the city and Harris County, signed a letter of
agreement to build the arena moments after authority members
approved the $175 million facility. The arena's fate will now be in
the hands of voters this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed to get an agreement that was fair to both sides and
fair to the people of Houston, and I think that's what we've done
today,'' authority chairman Billy Burge said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The authority voted eight for, none against with the Rev. C.L.
Jackson abstaining. Jackson, who is black, said he supported the
concept but was uncertain the agreement was fair to taxpayers or
that it guaranteed enough minority participation in construction
and operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think our public will accept this,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a $160 million arena proposal went down in flames
despite support from Mayor Lee Brown, popular former mayor Bob
Lanier and other prominent Houstonians.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the city's black community but west Harris County
Republicans, led by county party chairman Gary Polland and Tax
Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt, who helped build a 55 percent
landslide that buried a similar proposal last November.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were in Philadelphia for the national GOP Convention
and were not available for comment Thursday. Bettencourt planned to
reserve reaction until he had a chance to study the deal
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets and the authority have been negotiating an
arrangement for a new arena since February. Lanier consistently
warned voters last year that the Rockets would leave if they voted
no.
</P>
<P>
   The team never has formally threatened to uproot. But a handful
of other cities have wooed the Rockets, but none of the suitors was
considered serious.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets are locked into their Compaq Center lease until
November 2003. The team wants a new building with luxury boxes and
a revenue structure more beneficial to Boca Raton, Fla.,
businessman Les Alexander, the Rockets' owner.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority would finance construction using bonds
backed by car rental and hotel occupancy taxes, with a tentative
opening date of Sept. 1, 2003. The club will pay $105 million in
rents over a 30-year lease and be responsible for operating the
building ''in first class condition.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Rockets receive all revenues from events and get
at least 95 percent of the naming rights fee. Currently, the
Rockets are merely tenants at Compaq Center, the city's current
arena.

<HEADLINE> Mob Burns 5 Alive in India  </HEADLINE>
By OMER FAROOQ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- A mob of nearly 200 villagers in
southern India on Thursday burned to death four women and a man
they accused of practicing black magic, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were dragged from their homes and tied to a tree in
the main square in the village of Timmapur in Andhra Pradesh state,
said police superintendent Vinayak Apte.
</P>
<P>
   The mob then doused them with kerosene and set them on fire,
Apte told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating the deaths but no arrests have been
made.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman managed to escape the mob with injuries to her
hands and was admitted to a hospital in the nearby city of
Warangal, Apte said.
</P>
<P>
   Apte said the villagers believed the victims were practicing
sorcery and had caused the deaths in the area. But only two men had
died in the village in recent months, Apte said. One died in the
local hospital after suffering chest pains and the other drowned in
a nearby canal.
</P>
<P>
   The village of 1,500 was almost deserted when police arrived.
Scared residents had fled, leaving behind the old and a few young
women, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members have given police names of 20 people who
allegedly dragged the victims from their homes late Wednesday, Apte
said.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of rural India, villagers sometimes kill women they
have branded as witches responsible for deaths or sickness in the
area, despite the practice being illegal, police and social
activists say.

<HEADLINE> Judge calls state kosher laws unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn federal judge has struck down state
statutes which set standards for kosher food, saying they violate
the First Amendment by ''endorsing and advancing religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon was part of a
ruling in favor of two Long Island butchers who sued the state
Department of Agriculture and Markets in 1996, alleging the
long-standing laws violated church-state separation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 27-page opinion, Gershon found that ''the entanglements
involved here between religion and the state are not only excessive
in themselves, but they have the unconstitutional effect of
endorsing and advancing religion.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Thursday
that the state would likely join several national Orthodox groups
in an appeal of Gershon's decision. ''We're committed to protecting
kosher consumers,'' said the spokesman, Darren Dopp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the plaintiffs, Brian Yarmeisch, said he was
''thrilled'' by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Yarmeisch, co-owner of Commack Self-Service
Kosher Meats in Commack, N.Y., said that his shop, though not
Orthodox, still produced products sanctioned by ''a duly ordained
rabbi.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs alleged the business had been subjected to
''irregular, arbitrary and capricious inspections'' by the state's
Kosher Law Enforcement Division. Since the mid-1980s, inspectors
cited and fined the shop for everything from failing to properly
label kosher chicken to incorrectly salting veal spare ribs.

<HEADLINE> Reno Will Speed Up E-Mail Review  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday she
will accelerate a promised review of the FBI's e-mail surveillance
system and do everything she can to calm privacy advocates' worries
about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekly media briefing, Reno reiterated that she will have
an independent panel of experts critique the inner workings of
''Carnivore,'' the FBI's system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thought would be that we would show the source code to
these experts and then create the opportunity for us to have a
discussion about any weaknesses that they saw in the whole
process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore is the term used for the entire system, a computer
running the Microsoft Windows NT operating system and software that
scans and captures ''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet
traffic, as they travel through an internet service provider's
network. The FBI can install a Carnivore unit at a service
provider's network station and configure it to capture only e-mail
going to or from a person under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill hearing last month, FBI officials said
Carnivore has been used 25 times, including 16 times this year.
None of the cases has gone to trial, so the FBI has disclosed no
detailed information about them.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates say that only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system
while it is installed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center asked federal judge to force release of
Carnivore's computer source code. U.S. District Judge James
Robertson gave the FBI 10 days to respond to the group's Freedom of
Information Act request. The American Civil Liberties Union has
filed a similar request.
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to comment on the court cases. Earlier, FBI
officials suggested they would object to the request because
Carnivore is an investigative tool and making it public might
enable suspects to circumvent it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has taken notice of Carnivore, as well. After the July
hearings, two legislators introduced bills to restrict the FBI's
power to monitor e-mail traffic, and several high-ranking
congressman have reservations about its use.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the review would start as soon as Justice Department
attorneys agreed on the process -- with her encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that I can satisfy all the privacy advocates,''
she said, ''but I want to try to do everything I can.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than sign each other's players with no compensation,
Orlando, Detroit and Toronto made nice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic worked out sign-and-trade deals with the Pistons and
Raptors, resulting in a nice extra chunk of cash for Grant Hill and
Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   Both players signed seven-year, maximum salary deals worth $93
million with their old teams, then were traded to the Magic. They
join Tim Duncan and Jalen Rose as the biggest financial winners of
this summer's free agent class.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents Chucky Atkins and Ben Wallace, who were already
prepared to sign with Detroit, ended up signing with the Magic and
then being traded to the Pistons for Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of felt all along that if I left Detroit, this is where
I wanted to come. When we played against them, they would just play
so hard. That really impressed me,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady, who was prepared to sign a six-year deal with Orlando
containing 10 percent annual raises, instead gets a seven-year deal
starting at $9.6 million with annual raises of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando sent a future No. 1 pick to Toronto for McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic also made a trade with Cleveland, sending small
forward Matt Harpring to the Cavaliers for center Andrew DeClercq.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic's maneuverings were the biggest story on a day when
most of the other signings were minor.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs signed their remaining two free agents,
Avery Johnson and Antonio Daniels, the Vancouver Grizzlies signed
free agent forward Tony Massenburg of the Houston Rockets, the New
Jersey Nets re-signed forward Johnny Newman, Boston signed free
agent guard Randy Brown from the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix
re-signed forward Corie Blount.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 28 free agents have signed contracts during the first
three days since the NBA's one-month moratorium on trades and free
agent signings expired.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best players still available are forward Maurice
Taylor and guard Derek Anderson of the Los Angeles Clippers, Boston
forward Danny Fortson, Charlotte center Brad Miller, Indiana guards
Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson, Lakers forward Glen Rice, Miami
guard Tim Hardaway, New Jersey swingman Kendall Gill, Philadelphia
forward Toni Kukoc, Portland forward Brian Grant and Utah guard
Howard Eisley.
</P>
<P>
   The trades of Hill and McGrady climaxed a tense three days in
Orlando as the Magic tried to find a power forward to man the front
line along with Hill and center John Amaechi.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando was interested in Taylor, who is anxious to leave the
Clippers after three seasons, but no deal could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had already verbally committed to Orlando, while Atkins and
Wallace had committed to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have some work to do. Losing Grant Hill. That's a big
loss,'' Pistons coach George Irvine said. ''We're not trying to
fill Grant's shoes ... what we are trying to do is improve at every
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's news conference to announce the deals for Hill,
McGrady and DeClercq was held up for more than three hours for
unspecified reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally happened, Hill explained his thinking in taking
a seven-year deal (with an opt-out after five years).
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I came down here I seemed to add a year (to the
contract). It started out as four years and wound up at seven,''
Hill said. ''This is just where I want to be. I didn't want to go
through this again.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-round pick that Orlando sent to Toronto for McGrady is
partially lottery-protected. Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald
said his team may not be able to use it for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are still in the market for a small forward
following Hill's departure, but neither Irvine nor team president
Joe Dumars would comment on who might fill that role.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal gives Detroit room to maneuver under the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace averaged 4.8 points on 50.3 percent shooting with 8.2
rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 24.2 minutes per game. Atkins averaged
9.5 points on 42.4 percent shooting with 3.7 assists in 19.8
minutes off the bench for Orlando last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a five-time All-Star, is coming off his best season as a
pro when he averaged 25.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists.
After working on his long-range jumper last summer, Hill made 34
3-pointers -- 12 more than he had made during his first five years
in the league combined.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady, 21, moved into the starting lineup for Toronto late in
the season as he averaged 15.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.3
assists.

<HEADLINE> Former NL MVP Expelled For Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICO, Calif. (AP) -- Former NL MVP Kevin Mitchell was expelled
from the independent Western Baseball League for the rest of the
season Thursday after punching the owner of an opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former San Francisco Giants star, was playing for
the Sonoma County Crushers when the brawl occurred Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell hit Solano Steelheads owner Bruce Portner, who had come
on the field, soon after the fight had broken up. Portner was left
with a black eye and earlier this week said he planned to press
assault charges against Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The fight began when Jim Converse threw a pitch behind Mitchell
in retaliation for a brushback pitch. Mitchell rushed the mound and
punched Converse in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Western league also fined Portner an undisclosed amount and
suspended Converse for one start and fined him. Crushers president
Robert Fletcher appealed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 38, was the 1989 NL MVP while playing for the Giants.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Hold Four Foreigners  </HEADLINE>
By DANILO BURZAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two Britons and two Canadians have
been arrested in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro for allegedly
training the republic's pro-Western forces to commit ''terrorist
actions,'' the Yugoslav army announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests stepped up the pressure on the leadership of
Montenegro, which has allied itself with the West and drifted away
from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The two British detainees are instructors at the police academy
run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in
the Serb province of Kosovo, while the two Canadians work for a
private contractor. An OSCE spokeswoman quickly denied the Yugoslav
allegations about the four, saying they were simply returning to
Kosovo after a brief vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are ''absolutely absurd,'' said the spokeswoman,
Melissa Fleming. But she also said international OSCE staffers in
Kosovo were ordered several weeks ago not to travel by land to
Montenegro because of the risk of being picked up by the Yugoslav
army.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Canadian Foreign Affairs Department said
Thursday that similar accusations were becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
   ''In view of the current political environment in Yugoslavia,
such allegations must be treated with a very high degree of
skepticism,'' Marie-Christine Lilkoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The four were detained late Monday or early Tuesday near the
border between Kosovo and Montenegro. A Yugoslav army statement
said they were armed ''with military equipment'' and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are indications that the arrested foreigners were
training special units of Montenegrin police and that they are
specialists for explosives and terrorist actions,'' the statement
said. It added that police found ''enough material to prove the
true intentions and aims of the arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Yugoslav state television showed only a few cables, a
Kosovo map, pocket knives and a pair of pliers supposedly taken
from the four.
</P>
<P>
   Meridian Resources, which employed the Canadians in Kosovo,
identified them as Shaun Going and his nephew, Liam Hall. OSCE
would not release the Britons' names, but the Yugoslav army
identified them as Adrian Prangel and John Yore.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office said it was ''unacceptable to parade
British citizens -- policemen seconded to the OSCE as part of the
United Nations Mission in Kosovo -- before the world's media accused
of terrorism and espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No evidence was produced to support these charges,'' the
Foreign Office said. ''These policemen are playing a key role in
maintaining peace in Kosovo, a role endorsed by the U.N. Security
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes amid rising tensions throughout Yugoslavia
ahead of national and presidential elections set for Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has announced it will boycott the balloting. That has
raised fears that Milosevic may seek to provoke a crisis and seize
control of the republic by force.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Serbia, the larger and dominant Yugoslav
republic, recently alleged that special British forces and other
foreign experts were training Montenegrin police to prepare for its
independence from Yugoslavia. Following the announcement of the
arrests, Montenegro's ruling Democratic Party of Socialists accused
Milosevic of spreading lies to set the stage for a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ''How else can one interpret such an amount of lies and vulgar
inventions, then as setting the stage for the elimination of
Montenegro and the removal of its democratic government?'' the
party said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Yugoslav authorities announced that four Dutchmen
were arrested in July for allegedly plotting to assassinate
Milosevic. The government also claims NATO has hired mercenaries to
kidnap fugitive war crimes suspects hiding in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has waived visa requirements for foreigners, and the
republic's police allow visitors to enter and leave the republic.
But the Yugoslav army, loyal to the central government in Belgrade,
does not recognize the Montenegrin waiver.

<HEADLINE> Royals Suspend OF Carlos Beltran  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AL Rookie of the Year Carlos Beltran was
suspended without pay Thursday by the Kansas City Royals for
refusing to report to the team's Florida training complex for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The players' association immediately promised to file a
grievance Friday and a default notice if the 23-year-old center
fielder doesn't receive his full paycheck on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City said that if the union acts, they would continue to
pay Beltran. Otherwise, the team would risk having Beltran become a
free agent if arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in the union's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Royals general manager Allard Baird said the team has a policy
that players on the disabled list don't travel with the major
league club. Baird said Beltran would get back in shape to play
quicker in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I make an adjustment for Carlos Beltran, what am I saying
to the other 24 players and what am I saying to 150 players in the
minor leagues?'' Baird said as the Royals waited out a rain delay
at Yankee Stadium. ''We have to be all created equal in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltran's agent, Scott Boras, said the Royals' policy violated
the collective bargaining agreement and cited examples of other
players who travel with major league teams while on the DL,
including Atlanta's John Smoltz, Arizona's Todd Stottlemyre and San
Francisco's Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team is saying when you are injured in the line of duty
for the Kansas City Royals, you can no longer be with your major
league teammates but go to some outside colony,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best trainers the Royals have are in the big leagues. The
old Royals didn't do this. The (manager) Tony Muser Royals have set
up a policy that if you are injured, you are prevented from being
with your teammates and you're prevented from being with the major
league team.''
</P>
<P>
   The team cited a provision in each player's contract citing its
right to determine where he's treated. The Royals said the
suspension would last for 30 days or until Beltran reports to its
Haines City, Fla., training camp, whichever is earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an assignment to the minor leagues,'' union lawyer
Michael Weiner said, ''and you can't assign a player on the
disabled list to the minor leagues other than a rehabilitation
assignment, and he can't be put on a rehabilitation assignment
without his consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltran has been on the disabled list with a bruised right knee
since July 5. The Royals said their team physician, Dr. Steve
Joyce, recommended a rehabilitation at Haines City.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a great kid,'' Baird said. ''This is a difference of
interpretation of a provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltran makes $350,000 this season and each day of the
suspension his would cost him $1,923. He is hitting .247 this year
with six homers, 32 RBIs and 10 steals in 10 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Beltran batted .293 with 22 homers, 108 RBIs, 112
runs and 27 steals in 35 attempts. He became the third Kansas City
player voted Rookie of the Year, following Lou Piniella in 1969 and
Bob Hamelin in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Magic Obtain Hill, McGrady  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Heart and hustle will only carry a team so
far in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Championships are won with talent, and the Orlando Magic felt
they took a significant step toward title contention Thursday night
when Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady joined them in two sign-and-trade
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic endeared themselves to fans last season with a
relentless, scrappy style of play that produced a surprising .500
record, despite the absence of a marquee name on a roster of role
players.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and McGrady both signed seven-year, $92.8 million contracts
before being sent to Orlando from Detroit and Toronto,
respectively,
</P>
<P>
   The Magic sent free agents Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins to the
Pistons and the Raptors got a future conditional first-round draft
pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic also addressed the need for a power forward to replace
Wallace by trading Matt Harpring to the Cleveland Cavaliers for
Andrew DeClercq.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is a five-time All-Star who averaged 25.8 points, 6.6
rebounds and 5.2 assists for Detroit last season. McGrady, drafted
out of high school three years ago, is coming off his most
productive season -- averaging 15.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.3
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Hill never led the Pistons past the first round of the playoffs,
but he looks forward to the challenge of helping the Magic
accomplish a goal of getting back to the NBA Finals without
Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really look at it as pressure. I look at it as
opportunity. I had six years in Detroit. There were great times. I
had a lot of great relationships,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think sometimes to embrace the future, you have to let go of
the past. The good and the bad that's happened, it's time to move
on. ... I'm looking forward to establishing new relationships and
establishing and accomplishing new things with this organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign-and-trade agreements with the Pistons and Raptors
enabled the Magic to cement the deals, however the team wound up
committing more money to Hill and McGrady than general manager John
Gabriel anticipated it would take to land the two.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum first-year salary the players could receive was
raised from $9 million to $9.6 million and by moving to Orlando via
trade, instead of signing outright as free agents, Hill and McGrady
will get annual raises of 12.5 percent rather than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hill initially sought a four-year deal, which would allow an him
an opportunity to renegotiate a more lucrative contract after his
10th season in the league. McGrady originally intended to sign for
six years and $72 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of felt all along that if I was to leave Detroit, this
is where I wanted to go,'' Hill said. ''I've been a big fan of this
organization from afar. But I think coming down here, the first day
and just being around the different players, it was really
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The signings capped a year of wheeling and dealing by Gabriel,
who gutted the roster last summer to create salary cap room after
deciding the best way to rebuild the Magic into a championship
contender was to basically dismantle the team and start over from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Doc Rivers was hired as coach, inheriting a team returning one
starter -- Darrell Armstrong -- to training camp after Gabriel traded
Hardaway, Horace Grant, Nick Anderson and Ike Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The moves left Orlando with a roster full of role players who
embraced Rivers' ''heart and hustle'' philosophy and parlayed it
into a 41-41 record that brought the former player and broadcaster
coach of the year honors.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel began the busiest offseason in franchise history by
selecting Florida sophomore Mike Miller with the fifth pick in the
draft, then launched an all-out effort to recruit Hill and Tim
Duncan to become the new cornerstones of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   When Duncan opted to stay with the San Antonio Spurs, the Magic
focused on getting a commitment from McGrady, who grew up in nearby
Auburndale and wanted to play close to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart is here. There's no place like home,'' McGrady said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic also announced the signing of Dee Brown, a teammate of
McGrady's the past three seasons in Toronto. The team plans to
re-sign two of its own free agents -- forward Bo Outlaw and center
John Amaechi -- by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has lived in Orlando during the offseason for several
years and Amaechi spurned a more lucrative offer from the Los
Angeles Lakers to remain with the Magic. With Wallace committed to
leaving for Detroit, re-signing Outlaw also became a higher
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this is gratifying, but we're not finished,'' Rivers
said. ''Now we've got to go out and win.''

<HEADLINE> Judge decides Premo was insane during 1998 shootings  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERNON, Conn. (AP) - A Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that
a 42-year-old Willington man was insane when he opened fire on
three state troopers responding to a 1998 vandalism call outside
his trailer home.
</P>
<P>
   In acquitting Edward Premo of attempted murder, Rockville
Superior Court Judge Jonathan J. Kaplan ruled Premo's ''severe
mental illness'' was controlling his actions on Sept. 3, 1998 when
he shot Troopers Mark Pelletier, James Reidy and Michael Hoague as
they responded to a call that Premo had backed his van into a
neighbor's van.
</P>
<P>
   All three troopers were seriously injured. Reidy now walks with
the help of a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found 16 bombs, including pipe bombs, booby traps
and various homemade grenades inside the trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Premo, an Air Force veteran who was once a probationary police
officer in Norwich, had pleaded innocent to three counts of
criminal attempt to commit murder and more than 20 charges of
manufacturing a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The acquittal by reason of mental disease or defect came after a
one-day trial that included testimony from bomb and mental health
experts, and two of the troopers shot by Premo .
</P>
<P>
   Defense witness Kenneth Selig, a forensic psychiatrist, said
Premo suffered from a paranoia that ''had come to dominate his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Premo thought the government, neighbors and coworkers were
conspiring against him; that he had been injected with drugs; and
that a government agent had impregnated his wife, Selig said. Premo
had put aluminum foil over all the windows in his trailer in an
effort to prevent anyone from X-raying him; had stockpiled his van
with supplies; and videotaped any routine police stop he witnessed,
Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He truly and honestly believed these troopers were there to
kill him ... in his mind it was a war,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier testified that Premo told him ''I know what you
troopers are all about. I don't trust you troopers.'' Premo then
shot and wounded the officers using a semiautomatic handgun and a
rifle, Pelletier said. They returned fire, injuring Premo.
</P>
<P>
   As he and Hoague lay bleeding, Hoague asked ''Are we going to
die?,'' Pelletier recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Reidy was shot in the abdomen by a bullet the ripped through his
cruiser door.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt like it ripped me in half,'' Reidy testified.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Premo committed for further evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was obviously an explosion waiting to happen,'' Kaplan
said. He described the incident as ''a tragic and a chilling
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Premo is set to return to court Sept. 21, where he could be
ordered institutionalized for more than 100 years, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reidy said he considered the ruling fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man was not in his right mind,'' the trooper said. ''He
wasn't shooting at me. He was shooting at the uniform.''

<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - A woman who disappeared more than a month
ago with her two young children has been located in Lima, Peru,
federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Tania Lopez, 34, a Peruvian national who was living in
Saugerties, and her two sons, Dioson Cerron, 4, and Jortan Cerron,
2, are safe in Peru's capital city, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   There are still no details of how or why Lopez made her way to
South America. She was located after interviews by FBI field
officers here, in Westchester County and in places outside New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Lopez had filed a domestic violence case
against her boyfriend, Jorge Cerron, about a month before her
disappearance on July 1. Police are looking for Cerron, who also
has been missing since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   There are outstanding arrest warrants for Cerron for failure to
appear in family court and village court.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, an illegal alien, was living with Cerron, the father of
the two children. After a domestic violence incident on May 27, she
moved to a Family of Woodstock shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was last seen on July 1 at a shopping plaza, walking her
sons in a double stroller.

<HEADLINE> Suns Re-Sign Blount to 2-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns re-signed backup forward-center
Corie Blount to a two-year, $3.2 million contract on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blount, who has an option for the second year, opted out of his
existing contract after last season to test the free agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bartelstein, Blount's agent, told The Arizona Republic that
several teams offered him the mid-level salary cap exception figure
of $2.25 million for next season, compared with the $1.3 million he
will get from the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always a little scary when you walk away from more
dollars,'' Bartelstein said. ''But he feels real good about (coach)
Scott Skiles and (president) Bryan Colangelo. He feels great about
his situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   A knee injury kept Blount sidelined early last season, but he
wound up averaging 2.8 points and 3.0 rebounds in 38 games.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-year NBA veteran's playing time increased in the
playoffs, when he averaged 4.9 points and 6.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also signed three other free agents -- forward Ruben
Garces, guard Justin Love and center Daniel Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Garces played the last two seasons in the
Continental Basketball Association, Love is an undrafted college
player out of Saint Louis and the 7-1 Santiago played the last two
seasons in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The deals came one day after Phoenix signed backup guard Tony
Delk to a six-year contract worth nearly $17 million.

<HEADLINE> Duval Withdraws From International  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Just a day earlier, despite dropping
out of the pro-am after 14 holes because of a sprained lower back,
David Duval was confident he could overcome the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't think it's going to be a problem,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   It took only six holes in Thursday's opening round of The
International for Duval to think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, runnerup in the 1999 International, was at minus-1 under
the modified Stableford scoring system used in this event when he
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am disappointed I can't continue,'' Duval said. ''This is
one of my favorite tournaments. However, I need to get this taken
care of. Apparently, I need more rest, and I'm going to work hard
to get this resolved before the PGA championship (Aug. 17-20).''
</P>
<P>
   Duval said his back has been bothering him for about six weeks.
He was advised by doctors it might take six to eight weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, the world's third-ranked player, hasn't won in the past
16 months after winning four events early in the 1999 season. He
has, however, posted seven top-five finishes this year and ranks
eighth on the PGA Tour money list with $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STUBBORN STUART: The key to scoring in this tournament is to --
as Tom Lehman put it -- ''really abuse the par-5s.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Stuart Appleby wasn't listening.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby totaled 14 points despite playing the four par-5s at
even par on Thursday. He had two pars and a birdie, along with a
bogey on probably the easiest par-5, the 492-yard 17th, when he
hooked his drive into a creek.
</P>
<P>
   But Appleby also eagled the par-4, 403-yard 15th, holing out a
sand wedge from 117 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hit on a knob above the hole, trickled down and went right
in,'' Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said Castle Pines is vulnerable to good scores in its
current condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the quickest and smoothest I've ever seen it,'' he said.
''If the wind blows, this course can cause trouble. But it was
pretty benign this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   VIGILANT VICKERS: It's been an ongoing battle, and
International founder Jack Vickers isn't backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers remains dissatisfied with his tournament's position on
the PGA Tour schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the International was played Aug. 19-22 -- the week
following the PGA championship and the week before the World Golf
Championships-NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio. This year, the
International was moved up in the schedule, to be followed by the
Buick Open, the PGA and the WGC-NEC.
</P>
<P>
   By positioning the tournament adjacent to the PGA, Vickers
believes the International is better able to attract foreign
players, who often elect to spend more than one week in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to try to get back into the sequence that we had
before,'' Vickers said Thursday. ''And I feel very strongly that
having put the first million-dollar tournament on the Tour, we
deserve a little more consideration on this, and I'm pressing for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that is most upsetting is it was kind of sprung on
us without due process, I think. It affected a lot of people,
including the players, who make their plans well ahead of time. So
we have been hurt in terms of some of the players that aren't here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tour knows I'm unhappy about this situation. I'm going to
be very persistent in pushing to get this back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications Inc., which recently merged with US West,
is the presenting sponsor of the tournament. Joe Nacchio, chairman
and CEO of Qwest, said the Denver firm's sponsorship is ''a
natural'' and gives the fledgling firm both national and
international exposure.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Shares International Lead  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Tom Lehman, motivated by the early
successes of his playing partners, had five birdies and an eagle
over his last 14 holes Thursday and shared the lead in the first
round of the weather-delayed International.
</P>
<P>
   With half of the field still on the course, play was suspended
twice in the afternoon by lightning. The 72 players who did not
finish their first round were to return at 7 a.m. MDT Friday, with
the second round to begin about two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the 1996 British Open champion, totaled 15 points under
the modified Stableford scoring system that awards a player with 5
points for an eagle, 2 points for a birdie, zero for a par, minus-1
for a bogey and minus-3 for a double-bogey or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Also at 15 were Tom Scherrer, winner of this year's Kemper Open,
and Stephen Ames, who was in contention in last year's
International before finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Stuart Appleby had 14 points and Jeff Gove had 13.
Michael Clark II, who won last week's John Deere Classic, had 12
points thanks to two eagles at Castle Pines Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Sergio Garcia had 8 points, but countryman Jose Maria
Olazabal was at minus-3 and in danger of missing the 36-hole cut.
There also will be a cut after Saturday's third round, to the top
36 players and ties. Unlike the early years of this tournament, all
scores are cumulative for the four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Among those still on the course, Ernie Els had 9 points through
11 holes, and Greg Norman, in his first tournament since having hip
surgery five weeks ago, had 9 points through 12 holes. Two-time
International champion Phil Mickelson had 6 points through 12
holes.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's third-ranked player, withdrew after
playing six holes in the morning because of a lingering back
injury. Tiger Woods, citing the need to rest before the PGA
Championship, is skipping this event.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has won twice this season and ranks seventh on the
PGA Tour money list with $1.9 million, said he was ''the guy
pulling up the rear for a long time'' in his group. Brian Henninger
birdied three of his first six holes, and Mark Calcavecchia eagled
his fifth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our whole group played very well, which was a benefit to me,''
Lehman said. ''They were kind of dragging me along. They got me
more in an aggressive mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on No. 10, Lehman birdied the par-5 14th, then eagled
the par-5 17th, hitting a 6-iron to 30 feet and draining the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman then birdied Nos. 1, 2, 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played the par-5s at five under today -- three birdies and an
eagle -- which is what you need to do on this course in this format,
really abuse the par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like this golf course a lot, and the format is a lot of fun.
It lends itself to really aggressive play but not to being
ridiculously risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer, who said he has been struggling with his game for the
past month, had eight birdies and a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''When that putt went in on the fifth hole (for his second
birdie), I thought maybe it could be my day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ames had six birdies, an eagle and two bogeys in a round he said
could have been much better.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of opportunities on the back nine, but it didn't
go in the hole,'' he said. ''My longest putt was 25 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Play initially was suspended at 3:30 p.m. for 2 hours, 15
minutes. Players returned to the course for only 20 minutes before
another delay was called. Forty minutes later, at 6:45 p.m.,
officials suspended play for the day.

<HEADLINE> Padres 6, Cubs 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Eric Owens gave the San Diego Padres an early
lift with another big day at the plate. Still, he deflected praise
to the rookie who delivered the game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darr hit a two-run double in the eighth inning to lift the
Padres over the Chicago Cubs 6-5 Thursday for their season-high
fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his first three at-bats, he didn't look very good. But it's
a nine-inning game and he came through,'' Owens said. ''These young
guys are coming up here and proving themselves. When that door
opens, you've got to knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens hit a three-run homer for the Padres and finished 3-for-4
for his fifth straight multihit game. Over that span, he's gone
13-for-23.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we say that we're building toward next year but
anything can happen,'' Owens said. ''There are two months left. We
just have to go out hard every day. This was fun, to get the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin opened the San Diego eighth with a single off Tim
Worrell (1-3) and pinch-runner Damian Jackson stole second on the
next pitch. After Ben Davis singled, Darr doubled to center field
to put the Padres ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Darr, who was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas on Monday, had
flied out twice and struck out earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have confidence in myself, that I know that I can do the
next time,'' Darr said. ''I'm not the kind of player who's going to
snap. I just go up there and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker (4-0) went two innings for win and Trevor Hoffman
pitched the ninth for his 27th save in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa doubled twice for the Cubs, who are 15-6 since the
All-Star break. But Hoffman struck him out to end a perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got me on a changeup,'' Sosa said. ''On that, you've really
got to tip your hat to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs came back from a 4-0 deficit to move ahead 5-4 in the
sixth against Brian Tollberg on Ricky Gutierrez's RBI single. He
went 3-for-5 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Phil Norton made his major league debut and gave up
four runs -- three earned -- and five hits in five innings. He was
recalled on Monday from Triple-A Iowa, where he was 6-11 with a
5.20 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just calmed down,'' Norton said. ''Some of the guys told me
to just go out and throw. I did that and I was able to put up three
zeros in my last three innings to keep us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Don Baylor said Norton, who allowed four runs in
the first two innings, will likely be sent down after this start
since this was a temporary promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had to be a little nervous in his major league debut, not
knowing the players,'' Baylor said. ''He could have packed it in
but he ended up with a chance to win although we couldn't hold it
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens gave the Padres a 4-0 lead in the second with his fifth
homer of the season, which came on the first pitch after Tollberg
singled for his first major league hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres scored in the first for the third straight game, when
Ryan Klesko came home on a passed ball by Jeff Reed with the bases
loaded. Norton gave up a single and two walks in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago rallied for three runs in the third on five consecutive
hits, including three doubles. Sosa hit his second double of the
game to score the fist run and Mark Grace followed with a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young tied it at 4 in the fourth when he reached base on a
force out, stole second and came home a single by Gutierrez. Norton
led off the inning with his first major league hit.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Norton started in place of Kerry Wood, who was sidelined by
cramps in his left side. Norton was the third straight rookie
pitcher to start for Chicago, following Daniel Garibay and Ruben
Quevedo. ... RHP Jay Witasick, acquired from Kansas City on Monday,
is scheduled to make his first San Diego start on Friday. He will
become the 49th player to play for the Padres this season, breaking
the club record set in 1991. ... Gary Matthews Jr., obtained from
San Diego on March 23, made his first appearance against his former
club and went 1-for-4.

<HEADLINE> JFK Airport's celebration of its one-billionth passenger dimmed by delay </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - John F. Kennedy International Airport celebrated
its one-billionth passenger Thursday, holding the ceremony inside
its newest, cleanest and most efficient terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The milestone vaults JFK into an esteemed group of airports in
London, Atlanta, and Chicago that previously reached the mark.
</P>
<P>
   But the event was delayed about an hour, highlighting the woes
that have dogged the 52-year-old airport for years and placed it
among the bottom in passengers' airport rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials have acknowledged the problems and are
in the early stages of a $9 billion plan to renovate JFK's eight
other terminals, reconfigure roadways, and connect it to the mass
transit systems in Queens. The officials had hoped that by holding
the ceremony inside JFK's newest jewel, the two-year-old Terminal
1, the Port Authority's future - and not its past - would be the
aspect that received attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing here is to make it as convenient as possible
and that can be manifested in several ways,'' said Greg Trevor, a
Port Authority spokesman. ''Kennedy Airport is being reborn and
what an event like this shows is that millions of travelers, both
internationally and nationally, make it their port of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincezzo Maglione and his family were the fortunate travelers
making it their choice. Maglione, 36, was on the first day of a
10-day vacation with his wife, Tizianna, also 36, and their
children, Francesco, 10, and Barbara, 6, when he learned he was the
one-billionth passenger after deplaning from Alitalia's Flight 610,
which touched down just before 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no words, I am astonished,'' he said, adding later,
''In my life, this is the first time I won something.''
</P>
<P>
   Among a lengthy list of gifts, Alitalia gave Maglione two
round-trip tickets from the United States to Rome. The family, from
Milan, Italy, also received a limousine ride, a welcome basket
containing a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne, and a dinner for two
at the Windows of the World restaurant on top of the World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Magliones received their gifts amid the hoopla of Alitalia
employees waving red, green and white balloons and the music of a
three-piece instrumental band. Meanwhile, an audience watched while
preparing for departing flights of their own. Many looked around
the terminal, viewing the brightly lit facility that resembles an
airplane hanger and is also home to a plethora of stores and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Several people hailed Terminal 1 for its clearly marked signs,
its cleanliness and its proximity to parking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the improvements,'' said Louis Trangucci, a 42-year-old
from New Rochelle, N.Y. ''Convenience is the most important thing
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rhoda Rothstein, Jackie Blatt, and Judy Feder, all of
Brooklyn, all groaned when recalling the previous problems they've
encountered at JFK's other terminals, which can be dark and where
flights can be long-delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pretty impossible - the function wasn't there,'' said
Rothstein, who was heading with her two friends on a two-week trip
to Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt added, ''You would wait for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK, along with Newark International Airport and LaGuardia
Airport, ranked in the bottom third in eight categories rating
their customer service. The 1998 report surveyed 90,000 passengers
and was commissioned by 36 major airports.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall rankings, JFK placed 35th of 36th, while Newark
was 26th and LaGuardia 31st. Detroit Metropolitan Airport came in
last while Tampa International Airport was No. 1.

<HEADLINE> Thursday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressCorporate Sponsorships of Team Canada Trade Mission
Questioned
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Ladies and gentlemen, we give you Prime Minister
Jean Chretien and Team Canada -- brought to you by the Bank of
Montreal and Canada Post.
</P>
<P>
   For $50,000 each, the bank and the Crown postal corporation are
getting star billing as ''principal sponsors'' of the next
government-industry trade mission to China in November.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say it's a logical extension of less ambitious
sponsorship arrangements made previously to help defray costs of
the popular missions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry it means those who spend the most money will get
privileged access to the Canadian and Chinese governments.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does sort of perpetuate the perception that big bucks from
big corporations leads to big political contact,'' Garth White, a
vice-president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You almost get the feeling small business need not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Nystrom, New Democrat industry critic, agreed the
sponsorships leave the impression some businesses are elbowing
their way to the front of the lobbying line.
</P>
<P>
   The Team Canada missions, in which Chretien and provincial
premiers accompany business representatives on foreign jaunts, have
been a showpiece of Liberal trade policy since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from the Prime Minister's Office on
Thursday.

Korean Sailors Acquitted of Smuggling Chinese Migrants
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Nine South Korean sailors
sobbed with relief Thursday after they were acquitted of smuggling
a boatload of Chinese migrants into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A British Columbia Supreme Court jury deliberated four days
before returning with not-guilty verdicts on five counts against
the South Korean ship's captain and his crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans broke down, sobbing, after the jury delivered its
verdict and through translators thanked their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The nine men were accused of smuggling 131 Chinese migrants into
Canada aboard a cargo ship last August.
</P>
<P>
   They have been in detention since their arrest when they tried
to flee Canadian waters after dropping the migrants on a remote
island off the northern British Columbia coast.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers insisted the sailors were forced to take part in
the human smuggling operation -- one of four that saw almost 600
Chinese migrants brought to the British Columbia coast last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Chong Un Kim, the skipper and the only accused to testify,
said the boat and crew were hijacked in the East China Sea by
so-called snakeheads.
</P>
<P>
   But Crown prosecutor Peter La Prairie questioned whether the
tale of hijacking could be believed, telling jurors Kim had failed
to mention weapons and failed to call for help once was spotted by
a Canadian Forces plane.
</P>
<P>
   The trial made legal history in British Columbia -- the first
where news cameras and microphones were allowed to record
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   For the time being, Damon Huard is Dan Marino's
successor as the
Miami Dolphins' quarterback.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Fiedler, who was competing with Huard for the starting job,
was to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right hip Thursday. He's
expected to return late in the preseason or early in the regular
season, which begins Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past seven or eight days, Jay's right hip showed
symptoms of pain,'' trainer Kevin O'Neill said. ''As a result of
those symptoms, we did an evaluation of the hip and discovered the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was scheduled to debride a labral tear in Fiedler's
right hip joint. Fiedler had been bothered earlier this summer by a
sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unclear to tell whether this injury was related to his
earlier back pain,'' O'Neill said. ''It became apparent that this
injury existed after Jay reported his hip pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, 27, led Miami to a 5-1 record when Marino was sidelined
last season. Huard had a slight edge over Fiedler early in training
camp and was already slated to start the Dolphins' first exhibition
game Saturday at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldler, 28, backed up Mark Brunell last year for the
Jacksonville Jaguars, then signed a three-year, $3.8 million
contract with the Dolphins in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad that the injury is not a serious one,'' Fiedler said
in a statement. ''I'm looking forward to a quick recovery and
getting back on the field as soon as medically possible.''
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Denver linebacker John Mobley is scheduled to undergo surgery
Friday to repair a small cartilage tear in his right knee, the same
knee he injured last year to end his season.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, who missed 14 games last season, is expected to miss
only 10 days to two weeks this time. The former All-Pro had been
playing with pain the past few days and noticed in tapes that he
was limping. An MRI confirmed the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The operation will take place at the Steadman-Hawkins clinic in
Vail, Colo., where Mobley had reconstructive surgery to repair the
anterior cruciate ligament he tore in the second game last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Mobley's absence, Nate Wayne and rookie Ian Gold will get
more practice at training camp. The Broncos already are without
linebacker Glenn Cadrez, who has a strained hamstring.
Colts:
</P>
<P>
   The Colts signed veteran Billy Joe Hobert to contend for a
backup role to starting quarterback Peyton Manning. Quarterback
Pete Gonzalez was released to make room for him.
</P>
<P>
   A third-round draft pick of the Los Angeles Raiders in 1993,
Hobert spent four years there until signing with Buffalo in 1997
when he was released after admitting he had not studied a game
plan. He was signed by New Orleans later that season and started
seven games for the Saints last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hobert, 29, has 17 starts in 29 NFL games, completing 52 percent
of his passes for 3,371 yards with 23 touchdowns and 25
interceptions.
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati notified unsigned running back Corey Dillon on
Thursday that he will be ineligible to play in the first regular
season game unless he signs and reports in time for the team's Aug.
11 preseason game at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also said Dillon will not be paid for the first
regular season game if he doesn't meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals are trying to put pressure on Dillon, whom they
desperately need for an offense that lost top receiver Darnay Scott
to a broken leg this week and will be run by second-year
quarterback Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also threatened to withhold Dillon's pay for the
second regular season game if he doesn't sign and report for the
Aug. 19 preseason game against Chicago and withhold his pay for the
third regular season game if he doesn't sign and report for the
Aug. 25 preseason game against Detroit. He would be ineligible for
those regular season games if he doesn't meet the deadlines.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Safety Sam Garnes returned to practice Thursday, less than 24
hours after being elbowed in the throat and experiencing some
shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   ''They checked me out and everything was OK,'' said Garnes, who
said the incident was a little scary. ''I slept well last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnes was injured in a collision in the end zone with
linebacker Mike Barrow late in practice Wednesday. Barrow tweaked
his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran into each other and it's not like he's an itty-bitty
safety,'' Barrow said. ''He went one way and I went the other. I
thought I was in a matrix. It took forever for me to hit the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnes will play in the Giants' preseason opener against Chicago
on Saturday night at Giants Stadium. Barrow's status is uncertain.
Titans:
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee lost an offensive tackle Thursday when rookie Jason
White, who had been talking about leaving, left.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better off,'' coach Jeff Fisher said. ''We got him out of
here. You don't want anybody here that doesn't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   White, a rookie from Oregon State, had signed with the Titans as
a free agent, but wasn't expected to make the AFC champions'
roster.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Suzie McConnell Serio hit a 3-pointer with 21
seconds remaining Thursday night, lifting Cleveland to a 74-71
victory over the Utah Starrz and clinching a playoff berth for the
Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell Serio tried to work the ball inside, but found herself
out on the right wing with three seconds left on the shot clock and
instead launched a 22-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (16-12) moved within two games of first-place New York
in the WNBA's Eastern Conference and reached the playoffs one year
after compiling the league's worst record -- 7-25.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (16-13) had a four-game winning streak snapped and didn't
help itself as it chased fourth-place Phoenix for the final playoff
spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Merlakia Jones led Cleveland with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Korie Hlede, who led Utah with 18 points, gave the Starrz a
67-64 lead by hitting a 3-pointer with 4:44 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland tied the score at 69 when rookie Ann Wauters rebounded
a missed shot and scored with 3:38 left.
</P>
<P>
   Utah went back in front when Adrienne Goodson, who had 17
points, broke free for a fast-break layup with 2:32 left.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland again tied the score when Mery Andrade hit two free
throws to make it 71-71 with 1:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   After McConnell Serio hit the clinching 3-pointer, Utah had two
chances to tie the score in the final seconds. LaTonya Johnson's
shot rattled off the back of the rim with six seconds to play and
bounded back to Jennifer Azzi, whose off-balance shot fell well
short.
</P>
<P>
   Hlede hit all five of her shots in the second half and scored 13
points and help Utah come back from a 52-41 deficit with 13:09 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Starrz' rally also was helped by the defensive play of
7-foot-2 center Margo Dydek, who finished with three steals and six
blocked shots.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Award Medal of Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will bestow the nation's
highest civilian honor next week on 15 distinguished Americans,
including three senators, an economist, a general, an admiral and
the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced Thursday that he will recognize the
individuals at a White House ceremony on Wednesday. Established by
President Truman as a wartime honor, the Presidential Medal of
Freedom was reintroduced by President Kennedy as way to honor
civilian service.
</P>
<P>
   The award recipients are:
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. John Chafee, who died last year, served as a Marine
lieutenant in the World War II battle at Guadalcanal and fought in
the Korean War. He was a state representative in Rhode Island,
governor of Rhode Island and secretary of the Navy. In the Senate,
Chafee was a champion of environmental legislation and worked to
expand health care and reform foster care.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who as supreme allied commander of
NATO led the alliance to victory in Kosovo. Clark graduated first
in his class at West Point, served in Vietnam and helped negotiate
the Bosnia peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   --Jackson, considered both an asset and a pest by the Clinton
administration, frequently is invited to White House events even
though he flirted briefly with the idea of running for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Jackson was with the Clinton
family after the president told the nation of his extramarital
affair with Monica Lewinsky, but drew the ire of Clinton advisers
last year when he ignored their warnings and went to Yugoslavia to
retrieve three American soldiers held as prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   --Retired Adm. William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, who also served as commander of the Middle East Force in
the Persian Gulf, head of Navy plans and policy and commander in
chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.
</P>
<P>
   --Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense
Fund. She was the first black woman admitted to the Mississippi bar
and first black woman elected to the Yale University Corp.
</P>
<P>
   --John Kenneth Galbraith, a leading economist, taught economics
for nearly 30 years and has written more than 30 books. During
World War II, he was largely responsible for the Office of Price
Administration's record in controlling inflation. He advised
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and also served as U.S. Ambassador
to India.
</P>
<P>
   --Monsignor George Higgins, adjunct lecturer at Catholic
University, has spent more than 50 years working to ensure worker
justice. He has been honored several times by labor groups and once
was described as the ''labor movement's parish priest.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mildred ''Millie'' Jeffrey, a women's labor and Democratic
Party activist, was the first female to direct a department of the
United Auto Workers. She worked for the UAW from 1945 to 1976 and
served on commissions during the Kennedy and Carter
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   --Mathilde Krim, who founded the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983,
was one of the earliest leaders in the effort to find a cure for
AIDS. She has worked on topics ranging from cancer research to
human genetics and her foundation, which joined with the American
Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985, has poured millions of
dollars into AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   --George McGovern, a Democratic nominee for president in 1972,
currently is the U.S. representative to the United Nations' Food
and Agricultural Organization, where he is helping to develop a
plan to address the food needs of 500 million people -- half the
world's underfed -- by 2015. He was elected to the House in 1956. In
the Senate, he led the expansion of the food stamp program.
</P>
<P>
   --Cruz Reynoso, a private lawyer, teaches law and serves as vice
chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1982, after six
years on the California Court of Appeals, he became the first
Latino to serve on the California Supreme Court. He also has served
as a U.S. delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   --The Rev. Gardner Taylor, an author and early civil rights
supporter, has been called the ''dean of the nation's black
preachers. Under his leadership, his church, Concord Baptist Church
of Christ in New York City, became the most prestigious black
church in America.
</P>
<P>
   --Simon Wiesenthal, a Nazi concentration camp survivor, has
devoted his life to finding evidence to prosecute Nazi war
criminals. In 1977, he founded the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which
works to fight bigotry and anti-Semitism. President Carter
presented him with the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal in 1980 and he
received the French Legion of Honor in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has represented New York in the
Senate since 1977. A strong supporter of Social Security, he is the
only person to serve in the Cabinet of sub-Cabinet, including two
ambassadorial appointments, of four successive presidential
administrations, Kennedy through Ford.
</P>
<P>
   --James Edward Burke, former chairman of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, is
chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. He has helped
develop the National Youth Media Campaign and worked to discourage
young people from using drugs.

<HEADLINE> Parcells Posts Bail for Financier  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former NFL coach Bill Parcells was among
those who gathered at the federal courthouse Thursday to post bail
for former penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, now director of football operations for the New York
Jets, chatted about deep-sea fishing with three other associates of
Brennan while waiting for a receipt at the court clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speak to a reporter about Brennan, who had just
pleaded innocent to bankruptcy fraud charges at his arraignment at
federal court in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells posted $150,000 of the $500,000 federal bail set
Tuesday after Brennan's arrest, according to a source who requested
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, of Sea Girt, coached the New York Giants to two Super
Bowl victories, and also coached the New England Patriots and the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the members of a private golf course developed at
Brennan's former horse farm in Colts Neck, Due Process Stables,
according to people familiar with the bankruptcy case. The property
is among the assets seized to satisfy Brennan's creditors, although
Brennan still has an apartment in a gated community there.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan has been under house arrest at the property since
Tuesday while awaiting the posting of the $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan arrived at the Newark courthouse to finalize his bail
shortly after Parcells left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a lot of nice friends,'' said Brennan, a New Jersey
native whose official residence is in Juno Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed optimism about his case: ''I'm just going to deal
with it responsibly and bring it to closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he drove away in a green Audi convertible with Florida
plates.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 56, was also charged Tuesday by state authorities in
connection with his bankruptcy, and was released on $250,000 bail
soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael Critchley declined to say who posted that
money.
</P>
<P>
   The two indictments unsealed with his arrest charge that Brennan
attempted to hide from creditors over $500,000 he got from cashing
casino chips less than a month after he filed for bankruptcy in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   They are the first criminal charges ever faced by Brennan after
two decades of clashes with stock regulators.
</P>
<P>
   He became known in the 1980s through his television commercials
for his former flagship brokerage, First Jersey Securities Inc.,
stepping off a helicopter and urging viewers to ''Come grow with
us.''

<HEADLINE> Italy: No Authority for Civil Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's supreme court has ruled that Italian courts
have no authority to hear a civil suit brought on behalf of the 20
victims who died when a U.S. Marine jet sliced through a ski
gondola cable in 1998, Italian state radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Italian civil courts had no jurisdiction
because the U.S. military was involved, RAI radio quoted lawyers
for some of the victims' families as saying. There was no
information about when the court issued the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that union representatives
had attempted to bring a suit through the Italian courts to
challenge the Americans' practice of running training missions in
the Alpine area.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by the union for the gondola car operator,
one of the 20 victims, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, 1998, a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler jet sliced the
gondola cable on a training mission, sending the car's occupants
plunging 370 feet to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, was acquitted by a U.S.
military tribunal of 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani tells Larry King he's leaning toward radiation treatment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told Larry King during
CNN's live coverage Thursday night of the Republican National
Convention that he is leaning toward radiation treatment for his
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told King he hadn't completely made up his mind. His
other treatment options include surgery to remove the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably leaning toward radiation right now as the way to
do it, but haven't made a final decision yet,'' Giuliani said
during the interview broadcast from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure was the first time the mayor has said what kind
of treatment he is contemplating since being diagnosed with
prostate cancer in May.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that Giuliani made news this week at the
convention regarding his health. He recently told NBC's Tow Brokaw
that he has undergone hormone treatment as the first step of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Daily News cited unidentified sources saying
Giuliani was receiving hormone therapy while trying to select a
final treatment. The newspaper said the mayor was being treated
with Lupron - a medication that blocks the production of
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Lupron and other hormone blockers do not cure prostate cancer,
but they can buy time for patients who want to evaluate different
therapies. Lupron's most common side effects are hot flashes and
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Since dropping out of the U.S. Senate race against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton on May 19, Giuliani has repeatedly refused
to answer most questions about his health.

<HEADLINE> Indians 5, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Jason Bere pitched another strong
game for Cleveland, giving up four hits in eight innings as the
Indians beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bere (2-0) has won both his starts since being acquired in a
seven-player deal with the Milwaukee Brewers last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bere struck out eight and walked two. He benefited from strong
defensive support, including two double plays started by first
baseman Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson homered in the sixth for Tampa Bay's run.
</P>
<P>
   In two previous starts against Tampa Bay -- coming in 1998 while
with the Chicago White Sox -- Bere gave up nine earned runs over 9
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman, acquired from the Brewers with Bere, got the final
three outs for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar hit his fifth home run of the season, a solo shot
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel left after batting in the seventh
inning because of flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (8-8) went seven innings and gave up four runs and
eight hits. He struck out seven, with six coming in the first three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians took a 2-0 lead in the second on Travis Fryman's
run-scoring single and Kenny Lofton's RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made it 4-0 in the fourth. Alomar had an RBI infield
single with the bases-loaded and another run scored when Lofton hit
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Before the game, Indians manager Charlie Manuel said he has
no immediate plans to drop Lofton from the leadoff spot. Lofton
went 0-for-5 and has just two hits in his past 33 at-bats....
Cleveland RF Manny Ramirez, limited to DH duties since returning
from a left hamstring injury on July 13, took flyballs in the
outfield. ''He's getting real close,'' Manuel said. ... Tampa Bay
RHP Travis Harper will make his major debut Friday against the
Baltimore Orioles.

<HEADLINE> Fossella featured at GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Americans should elect Texas Gov. George W.
Bush as president so Social Security and Medicare will be preserved
for future generations, U.S. Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Saving Social Security is not a Republican thing or a Democrat
thing,'' Fossella said just before the Texas governor accepted the
GOP's nomination. ''It is the right thing. We need someone now who
will finally do the right thing. That someone is George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella said Bush's plan to give people the option to invest
Social Security taxes in the stock market will help save the
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   ''These options reflect the essence of America, the freedom of
individuals to save and to invest so that their future is truly
secure,'' Fossella said. ''Today, 80 million Americans are
investors. My friends, 80 million Americans can't be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has a personal interest in saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we act, and act now, my young sons, Dylan and Griffin,
will not see the promise of Social Security fulfilled,'' Fossella
said. ''And I refuse to let that happen. We must save Social
Security now or future generations will face certain insecurity
later.''
</P>
<P>
   He said earlier: ''I'm really thankful and grateful to the
people of Staten Island and Brooklyn who have given me their trust
and I'm really up there representing them. I hope to make them
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella, elected in 1997 to fill the unfinished term of Susan
Molinari, cited another personal interest in saving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella's great-grandfather, Staten Island Rep. James O'Leary,
D-N.Y., was in Congress from 1935 to 1944 and was among the
legislators who voted to create Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''My great-grandfather made that commitment 65 years ago when he
voted to create the Social Security system while he was in Congress
and it's a promise that must be fulfilled,'' Fossella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my great-grandfather was in Congress, he did the right
thing for my parents and my generation,'' he said. ''We're at a
crossroads: Do we do nothing and ignore future generations or do we
maintain that promise that was made 65 years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Fossella said the campaign organizers were the one who suggested
he use the connection with his great-grandfather in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had mentioned in passing to George Bush when he started
talking about improving Social Security that my great-grandfather
was in Congress and said 'I encourage you to keep talking about
this because it's an important subject,' so perhaps it was that
that filtered its way back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional GOP leaders haven't had much of a role in this
year's convention. When asked why a congressman from Staten Island
got a prime time speaking spot in the first place, Fossella just
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be Fossella's willingness to back Bush
during the raucous New York GOP primary while one of the most
powerful Republicans on Staten Island, former congressman and
current Borough President Guy Molinari, was Arizona Sen. John
McCain's state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Fossella even ran as a Bush delegate and outpolled Molinari by
more than 1,000 votes in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did what the party needed him to do,'' GOP State Chairman
William Powers said. ''He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I urged George Bush to run about a year ago, even before the
primary,'' Fossella shrugged. ''I'm very happy I made that plea.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that evening, Gov. George Pataki pledged all 101 of the
state's delegates to Bush. He even got in a quick dig at Hillary
Clinton's Senate campaign by quoting GOP vice presidential nominee
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   New York is a ''state that understands when Secretary Cheney
said it was time for them to go, he meant not just Bill Clinton and
Al Gore but Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton,''
said Pataki, in one of the few references in Mrs. Clinton on the
convention floor.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Commander Says He Needs Troops  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. commander in Sierra Leone told
the Security Council Thursday he needs many more troops quickly,
but the United States remained opposed to an immediate increase in
the 13,000-strong force.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetley said rebels from the Revolutionary
United Front, who took 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage in May and
kept 233 others surrounded for 2 1/2 months, still pose a serious
danger to the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is very much under control at the moment, but
it's tense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that the United Nations needs ''many more
troops to be given to us as quickly as possible'' but said he did
not recommend a specific number.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council initially sent 6,000 peacekeepers to Sierra
Leone to help implement a cease-fire signed in July 1999 by the
government and rebels who terrorized Sierra Leone for eight years,
killing tens of thousands of civilians and mutilating thousands
more.
</P>
<P>
   The council raised the ceiling to 13,000 in May after the rebels
reignited the civil war. At the time, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
recommended the addition of 3,500 soldiers to help the Sierra Leone
government regain authority over territory under control of the
RUF.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said last week the United
States believes that 13,000 troops are sufficient to do the job if
they are better equipped, and if the mission is restructured to
better deal with the hostile situation it is currently confronting.
A U.S. official reiterated this position Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the mandate of the U.N. force set to expire Monday, council
members agreed after Jetley's briefing to draft a resolution that
would extend it for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The British-drafted resolution, supported by the United States,
asks Annan to report to the council as soon as possible with
recommendations for restructuring and strengthening the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which is expected to be approved on Friday, will
revise the mandate of the U.N. force to respond more aggressively
to further rebel advances into government-controlled areas, help
the government extend its authority by deploying U.N. troops in
sufficient numbers at key strategic locations, and promote
conditions leading to a renewed program of disarmament and
demobilization of rebel troops.
</P>
<P>
   Jetley said, however, he did not think the mandate needed to be
changed and that recent U.N. victories securing the release of
trapped U.N. peacekeepers and rebuffing rebel advances ''proved
that the mandate is quite adequate,'' he said.

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Chamique Holdsclaw had 22 points and 11
rebounds as the Washington Mystics snapped a four-game losing
streak with a 75-71 victory over the Indiana Fever on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Murriel Page scored 13 points and Vicky Bullett 12 for
Washington (12-16). The Mystics outscored Indiana 15-4 over a
10-minute span of the second half to rally from a six-point deficit
and take a 66-61 lead with 6:11 remaining.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Resists Calif. Marijuana Law  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Department of Justice on Thursday
pledged to continue resisting California's voter-approved medical
marijuana law, arguing the government has the right to penalize
doctors who recommend cannabis by revoking their licenses to
dispense medication.
</P>
<P>
   Justice department lawyers argued their position in U.S.
District Court here during what may be the final stage of a lawsuit
brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU contends that the government's position violates
doctors' free speech rights, and that many doctors now resist
recommending pot for fear of losing their federal right to
prescribe medication.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup was expected to rule
within weeks, lawyers said, and the ruling could have broad
implications for several states with similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Measures similar to California's Proposition 215, which voters
passed in 1996, have passed in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Justice lawyer Joseph W. Lobue told the judge that
the government doesn't care whether California voters approved the
Compassionate Use Act, which allows patients to grow and possess
marijuana for medical use with a doctor's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter what California says,'' Lobue argued.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that federal law applies to the country no matter how
states may have voted, Lobue said the government would take the
same position ''in Oklahoma if they had that law.''
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has urged Attorney
General Janet Reno to ease the federal government's resistance to
California's attempts to implement its initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voters in my state have endorsed the medicinal use of
marijuana,'' Lockyer wrote to Reno in October.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' RB Jordan Rushed to Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland Raiders running back Randy Jordan
was rushed to a hospital Thursday after an on-field collision
during practice left the 30-year-old motionless on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   According to Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor, Jordan was conscious
and undergoing a battery of tests at Queen of the Valley Hospital
in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-rays were negative and he has feeling in his arms and
his legs,'' Taylor said. ''He is going to have an MRI later
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a seven-year NFL veteran, was taking part in an
intrasquad scrimmage just two days before the Raiders' preseason
opener in St. Louis. While blocking for quarterback Scott
Dreisbach, he collided with defensive end Regan Upshaw and
linebacker Travian Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was taking on Upshaw, and Upshaw whipped him around as I
was going away on the other side to avoid the quarterback,'' Smith
said. ''Before I knew it, his helmet was in my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Dreisbach's pass just as
Jordan fell. Team trainers rushed to his side, and an ambulance
arrived nine minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was talking, he had feeling in both arms and both legs and
he was breathing perfectly,'' Oakland coach Jon Gruden said. ''He's
just sore, sore in the back of his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has spent the past two seasons with Oakland after a
three-year stint with Jacksonville. Originally signed by the
Raiders as an undrafted free agent in 1993, Jordan has been
primarily a special teams player during his NFL career. He has
rushed for 288 yards and three touchdowns and has 215 receiving
yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is third on the Raiders' depth chart at running back
behind Tyrone Wheatley and Napoleon Kaufman.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Claim Brogna Off Waivers  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The best deal for the Boston Red Sox was the one
they didn't make.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to acquire Rico Brogna before the trading
deadline, the Red Sox got the Phillies first baseman anyway on
Thursday when they claimed him off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had discussions last week with Philadelphia, but we weren't
able to close the deal. They wanted more talent than we were
willing to give up,'' Boston general manager Dan Duquette said.
''We took the risk that we would have an opportunity to acquire him
by the waiver process.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogna was injured when he was hit by a pitch from Matt Blank on
May 10 in Montreal, fracturing a bone in his left arm and keeping
him out for more than two months. By the time he came back, he had
lost his job to rookie sensation Pat Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Brogna was batting .248 this year in 38 games
with one home run and 13 RBIs. Since returning from the disabled
list on July 21, he has appeared in eight games with three starts,
the last one coming Wednesday night in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a roller coaster of emotions this week,'' said
Brogna, a Turner Falls, Mass., native who had made it clear he
wanted to be traded. ''Part of me is torn to be leaving, but the
rest of me is excited to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia could have pulled Brogna off waivers, but the Red
Sox agreed to pay the rest of his 2000 salary, which is $4.2
million. He can become a free agent at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to talking with him at a later date,''
Duquette said. ''It's my understanding that having grown up in the
area, he's interested in playing here, and that's good news for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogna has hit more than 20 homers and driven in over 100 runs
in each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have needed a first baseman since Mike Stanley was
released in the midst of a slump. Jose Offerman, who has played at
first base this year because of defensive troubles at second, was
placed on the 15-day disabled list on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach has seen most of the playing time at first base
for Boston. He is hitting .266 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Brogna on the 40-man roster, the Red Sox
designated Sean Berry for assignment. They will have to clear space
on the 25-man roster when Brogna joins the team on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Duquette said pitcher Bret Saberhagen will make
at least one more rehabilitation start before rejoining the Red
Sox.

<HEADLINE> Australian Jet Drops Dummy Missile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARWIN, Australia (AP) -- An Australian air force jet
accidentally dropped a 300-pound dummy missile over the northern
city of Darwin, destroying a 1970s-era sport utility vehicle but
causing no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was being restored but it's a bit past that stage now,''
Tony Travers told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred as an FA-18 Hornet carrying the dummy
weapon as part of its payload was returning to base following joint
maneuvers with Australian, British and Singaporean forces.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-long training device came loose as the plane was
preparing to land, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The missile hit just outside Travers's home. He said he walked
outside after hearing a noise ''like a huge thunderclap'' and
discovered the demolished vehicle, which was owned by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The air force said it would pay the owner for the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was under investigation, said Australian exercise
commander Air Commodore Dave Dunlop.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Lines Face Air Pollution Fee  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL QUEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Two cruise lines face fines for violating
Alaska's clean air laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it
recommended $110,000 in civil fines for Princess Cruises and a
$55,000 penalty against Norwegian Cruise Line for violating
smokestack emissions standards last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints against Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America
Line-Westours and Celebrity Cruises are in the works, said Steve
Torok, the EPA's senior representative in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency took over enforcement of the state's marine
vessel emission standards last year after budget cuts forced the
state to abandon its own monitoring program.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships generate their own power while in port, and the
smoke from their engines can often be seen building up under the
low clouds that often cover Southeast Alaska skies.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Princess violated standards while docked in Seward on
Aug. 16, the EPA said, and the Dawn Princess in the same port on
Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's regrettable that we had these instances,'' said Dean
Brown, executive vice president of Los Angeles-based Princess
Cruises. ''They're both really due to technical and operational
issues that we're taking steps to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Dynasty was cited for violations in Juneau on Aug.
28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it's pending litigation, it's our company policy not
to comment,'' said Jorge Martinez, a spokesman for the Miami-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have 30 days to respond to the administrative
complaints. They can pay the fines or request a settlement
conference. If settlement talks fail, the cases would go to court.

<HEADLINE> Canada Navy Boards U.S.-Owned Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Backed by warships, Canadian troops
dropped from a helicopter and seized control of a U.S.-owned vessel
off the Canadian coast Thursday, after the ship refused to deliver
its cargo of military supplies because of a monthlong contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The navy boarded the 750-foot freighter, the GTS Katie, because
the ship was carrying important military supplies, said Canadian
Defense Minister Art Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
   After a warning if its intention to board, two naval ships
approached the Katie Thursday afternoon. But the freighter
accelerated, jerking from side to side, said Canadian Capt. Drew
Robertson, who was in charge of the boarding.
</P>
<P>
   As the Canadian vessels closed in, a navy helicopter lowered 14
heavily-armed soldiers to the Katie's deck to take control, said
Robertson at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The master of the ship was rather dramatic, which is
understandable,'' Robertson said. ''The crew was rather
welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship's Russian captain, Vitaly Khlebnikov, told reporters
that the boarding was ''dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our company's been shocked and horrified,'' said Peter Margan,
president of Third Ocean Marine Navigation Company, the Annapolis,
Md.-based firm that owns the freighter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said there were no injuries in the operation and no
criminal charges would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The boarding came a day after Canada said it had received
permission to board the boat from St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
the Caribbean nation where the boat is registered. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie was being escorted Thursday night to Montreal and was
expected to arrive Sunday, three weeks after the original arrival
date. Khlebnikov would continue operating the ship under the
Canadian military's direction, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleton said the Canadian and American companies involved in
the contract dispute will have to resolve the issue in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being held hostage by these companies is not acceptable,'' he
said. ''There was no confidence that short of taking control of
that ship we would have any control of our equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   The freighter was carrying five tanks, 200 of Canada's 2,000
armored vehicles, and 390 crates packed with munitions worth $150
million. Three Canadian soldiers are also on board to guard the
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter had been stationed in international waters about
140 miles off Newfoundland since Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Third Ocean was hired by a Montreal-based company, Andromeda,
which had in turn been contracted by the military to bring back the
military supplies used by Canadian peacekeepers in Kosovo, a
province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But Third Ocean has refused to deliver the cargo, demanding
payment it says it is owed. The Canadian government and the
shippers had been negotiating a settlement since early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Margan, who says Andromeda owes him $288,000, said that late
Wednesday the military had given him an ultimatum to accept an
offer of $90,000 or face being boarded.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie had been scheduled to transport the shipment from
Thessaloniki, Greece, to a port near Montreal by mid-July. But the
ship was delayed reaching Greece, increasing costs of the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Canada routinely charters foreign transport for its military
equipment overseas. The Navy has no transports equipped to carry
heavy armor and the Air Force's C-130 Hercules transports are
limited to about 20 tons of cargo.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Smith Arrives at Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Defensive tackle Mark Smith showed up at
the Arizona Cardinals training camp Thursday night, just in time to
avoid having to wait another season before becoming a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who signed a one-year, $1.03 million contract during the
off-season, held out last year then was injured and appeared in
only two games.
</P>
<P>
   Still believing he deserved better, Smith stayed away from
training camp this year. He will pay a $65,000 fine -- $5,000 for
each day he missed.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith didn't report by Friday, he would not be eligible to
become an unrestricted free agent after this season, instead he
would have been bound to the Cardinals for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin said after Thursday's workout that Smith would
not play in Saturday's preseason opener against Denver, but would
practice Monday in Flagstaff and travel with the team to San Diego
on Monday for joint workouts with the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Smith underwent a physical exam on Thursday, then
left for Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been awhile since he played football, and what he's been
doing, I have no way of knowing,'' Tobin said. ''We'll certainly
know more when we get him on the field and get him in camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had indicated earlier that he would report to camp on
time, but changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's proven year in and year out that you need training camp
to progress as a football player,'' Tobin said. ''The question is
how quickly can he catch up. That still remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A healthy, well-conditioned Smith would be a welcome addition to
the depleted defensive line. He was once part of what was
considered one of the top young defensive lines in the NFL. But
tackle Eric Swann was released after a series of knee problems and
Pro Bowl defensive end Simeon Rice is a holdout after being
declared the Cardinals' franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth member of that line, defensive end Andre Wadsworth,
is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery and has not practiced.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Speak in Code to Voters  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Integrity. Dignity. Trust. Decency.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the Republican code words for dishonor and corruption
and scandal at the White House run by Bill Clinton, with help from
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and his convention planners didn't attack the
president directly, not when Gore is their November target and
polls show that personal broadsides can backfire.
</P>
<P>
   So they settled on scripts woven with words meant to sting, not
bludgeon. With carefully chosen phrases, they sought to saddle Gore
with Clinton's lapses and give voters, in these times of record
prosperity and relative peace, reason to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   ''To lead this nation to a responsibility era, a president
himself must be responsible,'' the Texas governor said in accepting
the GOP nomination Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention Clinton's impeachment, but he did not have
to. The meaning was clear when Bush raised his right hand and said,
''When I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold
the laws of our land, I will swear to uphold the honor and dignity
of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   The line brought delegates to their feet, whistling and clanging
noise-makers.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention Clinton's Oval Office affair, but there was
no need -- not for parents whose children asked embarrassing
questions about their first president. ''This administration did
not teach our children. It disillusioned them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he need to cite the 1996 fund-raising improprieties, the
Whitewater investigation, the travel office firings, the lost legal
records, the FBI files, commodity profits or Vince Foster. ''After
all of the shouting, and all of the scandal. After all of the
bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, all week, convention speakers reminded voters
that the Clinton-Gore administration has created controversy as
well as economic prosperity. Their strategy: Gives voters weary of
Clinton-Gore a plausible, comfortable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll asked voters whether they were ''plain tired'' of
Clinton. More than half said yes, Bush's target audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can restore the ideals of honesty and honor that must be a
part of our national life,'' vice presidential candidate Dick
Cheney said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that Democrats, if returned to the White House, ''will
offer more lectures, and legalism, and carefully worded denials.''
Voters were left to decide on their own whether he was referring to
Clinton's tortured definition of ''sexual relations'' or Gore's
no-controlling-legal-authority defense of questionable fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife Laura talked about mothers and fathers thrusting
pictures of their children in her husband's face. ''They say to
George, 'I'm counting on you. I want my son or daughter to respect
the President of the United States of America.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy was the topic, but Bush adviser Condoleezza Rice
was not just talking about world affairs when she said, ''It all
begins in the Oval Office. George W. Bush is a man of his word.
Friend and foe will know that he tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the party's 1996 nominee, talked about the World War
II generation and, indirectly, Clinton. ''We look to Governor Bush
and Secretary Cheney to raise our sights, and to restore honor and
dignity to our public life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heads bowed throughout the convention hall, the Rev. Franklin
Graham closed Monday night's session with a prayer reminding
Republicans that ''we have allowed our morals to erode.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is walking a fine line, given the public's mixed feelings
about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While six out of 10 voters disapprove of him as a person, the
same number approve of his job performance. Gore is trying to link
himself to Clinton's public record. Bush wants to saddle Gore with
Clinton's personal flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ''People aren't losing their jobs. They're not worried about
going to war. There is no constitutional crisis facing the country.
That should make it difficult for Bush to argue for change,'' said
Paul Blanchard, political science professor at Eastern Kentucky
University. ''What he has to do is convince voters that there is a
moral crisis, and then link Gore to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried all week, using code words and buzz phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you give me your trust,'' Bush said, ''I will honor it.''

<HEADLINE> Texas First Lady Honored  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As George W. Bush launched into the biggest
political speech yet of his career, a teary-eyed former President
Bush and wife Barbara, jumped to their feet and cheered their son
on.
</P>
<P>
   Row upon row of Bush family members, old and young, coming from
far and near, celebrated the Texas governor -- the son, brother,
father and husband and, now, the presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wife, Laura, and his 18-year-old twins, Barbara and Jenna,
leapt to his side when he was done speaking. A small legion of
Bushes lined the stage, awash in a sea of confetti and balloons,
dancing to music.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother combines a sense of who he is with a moral compass.
... He won't be swinging in the breeze,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, the one the family always expected would run for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest brother, Marvin, never envisioned such a night as
Thursday, when his brother strode across the convention stage to
roaring applause before accepting the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's someone who has been underestimated his entire political
career,'' Marvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have suggested that being the son of George Bush is an
easy thing,'' he said on CBS' ''Early Show,'' hours before his
brother's moment. ''It's not. So he is a survivor and he's going to
win this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, George W. Bush had taken a backseat in the family while
Mrs. Bush, a former librarian and school teacher, was recognized
for her work to promote childhood learning and family reading in
her state.
</P>
<P>
   ''My experience as a mom and as an elementary school teacher
taught me how smart children really are, how eager they are to
learn and how easily we can fail them ... if we don't have high
expectations,'' said Mrs. Bush, at the tribute by the National
Federation of Republican Women.
</P>
<P>
   A cardboard prop book displaying her name and rows of school-age
children framed the stage.
</P>
<P>
   She was introduced by her husband, who called his wife a great
mother ''and if all goes well, a fabulous first lady for America.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised her convention keynote hours before delivering
his own: ''Laura certainly raised the bar, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Another family member -- budding political star George P. Bush --
prepped the convention crowds Thursday night for his uncle's
remarks with an address laced with Spanish phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates cheered as Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington introduced
him as ''one of People magazine's top 100 most eligible
bachelors.'' She hastened to add: ''Beyond the dashing good looks
and the very charming personality, meet a young man whose intellect
and heart speak volumes about why this country desperately needs
the leadership that only his uncle can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old George P. said his uncle would create a nation
where all people ''can share in the promise and the prosperity of
el sueno Americano -- the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of the Florida governor and his Mexican-born wife
Columba, George P. also painted his uncle as a candidate seeking to
represent a more diverse nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor would be a ''a leader who really cares about
those he was elected to serve, including those of us whose faces
look different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now is the time to make sure the American dream touches every
willing heart, no matter the color of your skin or the accent of
your speech,'' said George P., who has toured the nation addressing
young and Hispanic voters. ''I respect leaders who respect my
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   A former teacher in Homestead, Fla., the young Bush said he
believes the Texas governor can improve education, giving schools
and families the tools they need. He also called for an end to the
cynicism and fighting in Washington, saying it is ''time to restore
a sense of honor and decency to the White House.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Reaches Out to All Americans  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush appealed to the nation
Thursday night to ''grant me a mandate'' to lead and break the
cycle of partisan Washington feuding. ''After all the bitterness
and broken faith, we can begin again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hoped to make history by becoming the first presidential
son since John Quincy Adams to follow his father into the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told cheering delegates he would help ''end the politics of
fear'' and promised to work together with Democrats on pressing
problems, including shoring up the Social Security system and more
accountability in education policy.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers grew loudest when he vowed to pursue tax fairness and
anti-abortion laws. Bush spoke for 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans ended their four-day choreographed convention
with a dazzling blizzard of confetti, red-white-and-blue balloons
and bursts of fireworks inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined on stage by his wife Laura, running mate Dick
Cheney and his wife Lynne, dozens of Bush family members -- and
one-time rival John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The convention hall erupted in applause and cheers when he paid
special tribute to his mother and father, whose bid for a second
presidential term was thwarted in 1992 by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to work to reduce nuclear arsenals and to put into
place a national missile defense system ''at the earliest possible
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's calls for bipartisanship, he managed to get in a
few digs at his rival, Vice President Al Gore, and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our current president embodied the potential of a generation.
So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end,
to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted even before Bush went on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, Democratic National Committee co-chairman, said,
''Bush and Cheney have been presenting an air-brushed version of
themselves all week long. But we know that the true colors are
coming out. It's still the same old nasty, old guard Republican
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gore's hopes to extend Democratic rule in the White House to
a third term, Bush said, ''Not this time, not this year. This is
not a time for third chances, it is a time for new beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a refrain of disdain, Bush repeated four times:
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Texas governor cast his relatively few years in
public service as a plus, saying he ''may lack the polish of
Washington'' but at the same time he doesn't ''have a lot of things
that come with Washington experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no stake in the
bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone
of Washington to one of civility and respect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He mocked Gore for calling his policy proposals ''risky.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's view, according to the Republican nominee, the moon
launch would have been a ''risky rocket scheme.'' And Edison's
light bulb would have been a ''risky anti-candle scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   And delegates howled in delight when Bush poked fun at Gore for
claiming to have invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP nominee scolded the Democrats for not spreading the
nation's prosperity to more people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of seizing this moment, the Clinton-Gore
administration has squandered it,'' he said in a variation on
running mate Dick Cheney's assertion the night before of
''opportunities squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   His prime-time speech was aimed far beyond his well-established
GOP base. It sought to build support among independents, Democrats,
swing voters, minorities and young voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has said throughout his campaign that the Republican
Party has not always been as open as it should be, Bush told
delegates, ''We are now the party of ideas and innovation ...The
party of idealism and inclusion ...The party of a simple and
powerful hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My fellow citizens, we can begin again,'' he said. ''After all
of the shouting, and all of the scandal. After all of the
bitterness and broken faith. We can begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged the current debate over how to spend the
government's surplus. He has advocated a part of it for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest applause lines came when he declared: ''The
surplus is not the government's money.The surplus is the people's
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will seize this moment of American promise. We will use
these good times for great goals,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Cleveland Homeless Case  </HEADLINE>
By AMY BETH GRAVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A judge on Thursday ordered the city to find
shelter for homeless people who were kicked out of an abandoned
bakery building that the city condemned and started to demolish.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless advocates filed a lawsuit Wednesday to stop demolition
of the inner city building where the homeless said they've lived
for 21 years. The lawsuit was filed hours after the city started
tearing down the 1929 building, and both sides agreed the structure
couldn't be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gino Scarselli argued Thursday that the city had an
obligation to find adequate housing for the homeless who had been
living there. He said the homeless had squatters' rights and the
city violated their rights by destroying the building.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Thomas Curran ordered
Law Director Cornell Carter to work with the homeless to find
adequate shelter. The judge said the damages portion of the lawsuit
would be decided later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city and mayor are committed to working with the
homeless,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarselli said after the ruling that he was afraid the city
would do little more than look for space in a shelter for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really confident that we will see any serious effort
to bring this to a just resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's policies regarding the homeless have caused
controversy in the past. In November, Mayor Michael R. White
announced increased police enforcement aimed at panhandlers and
street crime, which advocates say targeted the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union sued, alleging the city's
arrests of homeless people for sleeping on city streets were
unconstitutional. The city settled the lawsuit by agreeing to not
arrest people who were performing innocent, harmless and
inoffensive acts, such as sleeping.

<HEADLINE> Power of Police Searches Narrowed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals panel Thursday narrowed
the power of police to search the homes of hundreds of thousands of
California criminals who are on probation and suspected of federal
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
wrote that probationers' homes can only be searched under the terms
of probation. They cannot be searched as a ''mere subterfuge'' for
the pursuit of new criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision effectively rebuffs a state Supreme Court
decision last year that officers can go into the homes on a pretext
-- even looking for evidence against a probationer's roommates --
without a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is binding only on the federal courts in the 9th
Circuit, but could undo the California Supreme Court's decision
because defendants in state courts who were the subjects of such
searches could petition a federal court to hear their case.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Federal Public Defender Hilary A. Fox said such a
request likely would be granted. ''We're thrilled with the
decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Martha Boersch, the federal prosecutor
in the case, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 case, authorities raided the home of Mark Knights to
search for evidence that he had conspired to firebomb Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. facilities as revenge for his electricity being
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out their findings on grounds that
authorities used his probation status on a state misdemeanor drug
conviction as a pretext to search his home without a warrant, and
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. GOP in Philly on Primary Day  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A lackluster election with few contested
races drew few voters to the polls but produced a close Democratic
primary in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   John Jay Hooker, a 67-year-old self-described political gadfly
who has lost three previous governor's races and three U.S. Senate
contests, opposed four other challengers in Thursday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   With no money, no campaign organization and no support from
state party leaders, Hooker hoped to take on incumbent Republican
Sen. Bill Frist.
</P>
<P>
   But Middle Tennessee State University professor Jeff Clark of
Murfreesboro was giving Hooker a good run.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of 2,444 precincts reporting unofficial results,
Hooker had 43,858 votes, or 34 percent, to 43,241 votes, or 33
percent, for Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, who had no opposition, wasted no time in declaring his
primary victory from Philadelphia, where he gave a GOP convention
speech on health care about the same times the polls closed at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to reaching out to all Tennesseans in the
coming months,'' he said in a statement released 10 minutes after
the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Tennessee's nine congressmen -- Rep. John Tanner, a
Democrat representing the 8th District -- had an opponent on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With 61 percent of 342 precincts reporting unofficial results,
Tanner had 19,577, or 86 percent, to 3,065 votes, or 14 percent for
union activist Marvin Williams of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Low turnout was reported in most areas. Brook Thompson, state
elections coordinator, estimated turnout at 20 to 30 percent of the
state's nearly 3 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, an eccentric Nashville lawyer, is running on one issue:
campaign finance reform. He says money is destroying the democratic
process and campaign contributions are bribes.
</P>
<P>
   He has made and lost millions in various business endeavors. He
was a founder of the Minnie Pearl fried chicken restaurant chain,
chairman of STP and United Press International, and publisher of
the now-defunct Nashville Banner.
</P>
<P>
   All 99 state House seats and 17 of 33 Senate seats were up for
election. The most contested races were for seats held by retiring
lawmakers. Two senators and five representatives did not seek
re-election.

<HEADLINE> Text of Bush's Acceptance Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big government is not the answer, but the alternative to
bureaucracy is not indifference. It is to put conservative values
and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I mean by compassionate conservatism. And on this
ground, we will lead our nation.
</P>
<P>
   We will give low-income Americans tax credits to buy the private
health insurance they need and deserve.
</P>
<P>
   We will transform today's housing rental program to help
hundreds of thousands of low-income families find stability and
dignity in a home of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And in the next bold step of welfare reform, we will support the
heroic work of homeless shelters and hospices, food pantry and
crisis pregnancy centers, people reclaiming their communities block
by block and heart by heart.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Mary Jo Copeland, whose ministry called Sharing and
Caring Hands serves 1,000 meals a week in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Mary Jo washes the feet of the homeless and sends them
off with new socks and shoes. ''Look after your feet,'' she tells
them. ''They must carry you a long way in this world, and then all
the way to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Government cannot do this work. It can feed the body, but it
cannot reach the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, government can take the side of these groups, helping the
helper, encouraging the inspired. My administration will give
taxpayers new incentives to donate to charity, encourage
after-school programs that build character, and support mentoring
groups that shape and save young lives.
</P>
<P>
   We must give our children a spirit of moral courage because
their character is our destiny.
</P>
<P>
   We must tell them -- we must tell them -- we must tell them with
confidence that drugs and alcohol can destroy you, and bigotry
disfigures the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Our schools must support the ideals of parents, elevating
character and abstinence from afterthoughts to urgent goals.
</P>
<P>
   We must help protect our children in our schools and streets,
and by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, we must teach our children the values that
defeat violence. I will lead our nation toward a culture that
values life -- the life of the elderly and sick, the life of the
young and the life of the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   Good people can disagree on this issue, but surely we can agree
on ways to value life by promoting adoption, parental notification.
And when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth abortion, I
will sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Behind every goal I've talked about tonight is a great hope for
our country. A hundred years from now this must not be remembered
as an age rich in possession and poor in ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we must usher in an era of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   My generation tested limits, and our country in some ways is
better for it. Women are now treated more equally.
</P>
<P>
   Racial progress has been steady; it's still too slow. We're
learning to protect ... we're learning to protect the natural world
around us. We will continue this progress, and we will not turn
back.
</P>
<P>
   At times we lost our way, but we're coming home.
</P>
<P>
   So many of us held our first child and saw a better self
reflected in her eyes. And in that family love, many have found the
sign and symbol of an even greater love, and have been touched by
faith.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered that who we are is more than important than what
we have. And we know we must renew our values to restore our
country.
</P>
<P>
   This is the vision of America's founders. They never saw our
nation's greatness in rising wealth or in advancing armies, but in
small, unnumbered acts of caring and courage and self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Their highest hope, as Robert Frost described it, was to occupy
the land with character. And that, 13 generations later, is still
our goal, to occupy the land with character.
</P>
<P>
   In a responsibility era, each of us has important tasks, work
that only we can do. Each of us is responsible to love and guide
our children and to help a neighbor in need. Synagogues, churches
and mosques are responsible, not only to worship, but to serve.
Corporations are responsible to treat their workers fairly and to
leave the air and waters clean.
</P>
<P>
   And our nation's leaders our responsible to confront problems,
not pass them onto others.
</P>
<P>
   And to lead this nation to a responsibility era, that president
himself must be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   So when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only
uphold the laws of our land, I will swear to uphold the honor and
dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the presidency, the final point of decision in the
American government, was made for great purposes. It is the office
of Lincoln's conscience, of Teddy Roosevelt's energy, of Harry
Truman's integrity and Ronald Reagan's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   For me, gaining this office is not the ambition of a lifetime,
but it is the opportunity of a lifetime, and I will make the most
of it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe great decision are made with care, made with
conviction, not made with polls.
</P>
<P>
   I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind.
</P>
<P>
   I do not reinvent myself at every turn. I am not running in
borrowed clothes.
</P>
<P>
   When I act, you will know my reasons. And when I speak, you will
know my heart.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in tolerance, not in spite of my faith, but because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in a God who calls us not to judge our neighbors but
to love them.
</P>
<P>
   I believe in grace because I've seen it, and peace because I've
felt it, and forgiveness because I've needed it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe true leadership is a process of addition, not an act
of division.
</P>
<P>
   I will not attack a part of this country because I want to lead
the whole of it.
</P>
<P>
   And I believe this'll be a tough race, down to the wire. Their
war room is up and running, but we are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Their attacks will be relentless, but they will be answered. We
are facing something familiar, but they're facing something new.
</P>
<P>
   We are now the party of ideas and innovation, the party of
idealism and inclusion, the party of a simple and powerful hope.
</P>
<P>
   My fellow citizens, we can begin again.
</P>
<P>
   After all of the shouting and all of the scandal, after all the
bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again.
</P>
<P>
   The wait has been long, but it won't be long now.
</P>
<P>
   A prosperous nation is ready to renew its purpose and unite
behind great goals, and it won't be long now.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation must renew the hopes of that boy I talked with in
jail and so many like him, and it won't be long now.
</P>
<P>
   Our country is ready for high standards and new leaders, and it
won't be long now.
</P>
<P>
   An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a responsibility
era, and it won't be long now.
</P>
<P>
   I know how serious the task is before me. I know the presidency
is an office that turns pride into prayer. But I am eager to start
on the work ahead, and I believe America is ready for a new
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, the artist Tom Lea of El Paso, Texas, captured the
way I feel about our great land, a land I love. He and his wife, he
said, ''Live on the east side of the mountain. It's the sunrise
side, not the sunset side. It is the side to see the day that is
coming, not to see the day that has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans live on the sunrise side of the mountain, the night is
passing, and we're ready for the day to come.
</P>
<P>
   God bless. God bless America.

<HEADLINE> Texas Democrat's Widow Praises Bush  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The widow of one of Texas' best-known
Democratic politicians praised GOP nominee George W. Bush on
Thursday as a governor willing to ''lay aside politics'' and work
across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming a ''unique nonpartisan perspective,'' Jan Bullock said
she joined the Republican convention lineup as part of husband Bob
Bullock's ''unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You may wonder what in the world the widow of a Texas Democrat
is doing at the Republican convention,'' Bullock told delegates.
''Did I possibly take a wrong turn?'' The delegates quickly
shouted: ''No!''
</P>
<P>
   Her late husband, the lieutenant governor, surprised his party
by endorsing Bush's re-election as governor in 1998. He died last
year at age 69, after serving 40 years in Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats complained the speech was misleading because
almost all of their party's Texas lawmakers support Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Bullock was not the Texas Democratic Party and that is the
perception that George Bush is trying to present to the country,''
said state party chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm. ''Bob Bullock was a
statesman who did some good things for the state of Texas, but he
wasn't necessarily that great of a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who presided over the state Senate, occasionally
endorsed the Republican in a Senate race. His widow described him
as ''tough and independent.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Bush told delegates the night was
''bittersweet'' without Bullock, ''a crusty veteran of Texas
politics, and my great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock said the friendship began in 1994 when candidate
Bush visited the lieutenant governor at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''George said that when elected governor, he would lay aside
politics to work for the good of our state,'' she said. Her husband
''was wary.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But sure enough, as promised, the Bush administration did
bring an era of statesmanship and cooperation,'' said Bullock, who
calls herself a political independent.

<HEADLINE> Union Protests Lead to Citations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thirty-five people were cited Thursday by
police in riot gear when demonstrators swarmed a downtown
intersection in front of a hotel where workers have been trying to
unionize for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   The citations were for misdemeanor failure to disperse from the
New Otani Hotel, said police Officer Don Cox. The 35 were given
court dates and released from a mobile police booking unit at the
scene, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Otani hotel workers and members of the Hotel &AMP;
Restaurant Employees Union gathered during the 5 p.m. rush hour,
and some began to block an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   A call and page to union spokesman David Koff were not returned,
but the union said in a news release that it plans a series of
pickets leading up to the Aug. 14-17 Democratic National
Convention.
