<HEADLINE> Kinkel: Iran's Execution of German to Cast Shadow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Tuesday said that Iran's execution of a German businessman
who had alleged "illegitimate" sexual relationship with a Moslem
woman would "cast a shadow" over bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"I just cannot imagine that Iran would allow someone to be
sentenced to death because of an alleged sexual relationship," he
said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel added that he believed that Iran would "resolve the
problem."
</P>
<P>
A Teheran court last month sentenced a 56-year-old automobile
parts dealer from Hamburg to death for his illegitimate sexual
relationship with a 26-year-old Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Berlin court ruling linked Iranian leadership to
the 1992 murder of four Iranian Kurdish dissidents in a Berlin
restaurant, which had resulted in strained German-Iranian ties as
well as the European Union's 10-month freeze on senior level
contacts with Teheran.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers just agreed to resume ministerial
links with Iran Monday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Mossad Head Resigns Over Mashaal Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli secret service
Mossad's head Danny Yatom resigned Tuesday due to the blame for
the botched assassination attempt against Hamas leader Khaled
Mashaal in Jordan last September.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
office said Netanyahu has accepted with regret the resignation
letter from Yatom, who was severely criticized by the Ciechanover
Committee in charge of investigating the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
In a 110-page investigation report presented on February 16,
the committee harshly criticized Yatom for some cracks in the
planning and operation of the assassination attempt against
Mashaal. It found out that Yatom even failed to inform Army Chief
of Staff Lipkin Amnon Shahak of the operation.
</P>
<P>
The report cleared Netanyahu of any responsibility in the
affair in contrary to the popular speculation. This was hotly
disputed by Yatom, who said in his resignation letter that the
report countered his own version of the whole affair and he did
not accept the blame put on him by the Ciechanover Committee.
</P>
<P>
Two Mossad agents were captured by Jordanian police after
injecting a special poison into one ear of Mashaal's outside his
Amman office. The incident created an international furor,
leading to Canada's protest against the use of forged Canadian
passports and sparking Jordan's angry reactions by suspending
security ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the Jordanian pressure, Israel agreed to release Hamas
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin early last October in
exchange for the two Mossad agents.
</P>
<P>
The Mashaal affair has dealt a serious blow to Mossad, the
secret agency which was renowned for its prestige in carrying out
secret missions abroad. The public has called for reorganization
of the agency, which plays an crucial role in protecting Israeli
security.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's resignation did not come as a surprise following the
release of the Ciechanover report, only the timing of his
resignation was somewhat unexpected. Netanyahu originally
intended to allow Yatom to stay in his position at least for
several months so to avoid causing further damage to the agency.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said that Netanyahu has persuaded
Yatom to agree to stay in the position until the prime minister
finds his successor.

<HEADLINE> IDB Obtains 2.33 Bln Dlrs in Cofinancing in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Tuesday reported the obtainment of 2.329
billion U.S. dollars in cofinancing for social and economic reform
projects in Latin America and the Caribbean in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cofinancing is a major instrument to support the IDB's own
lending. In 1996 the IDB attracted some 2.4 billion dollars from
outside sources.
</P>
<P>
As in 1996, Japan remained the IDB's largest source of
cofinancing last year while the World Bank was its main
multilateral contributor.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which in 1996 afforded a record 1.2 billion dollars in
cofinancing, reached a new high last year, pledging 1.487 billion
dollars to support eight IDB-backed projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank, which in 1996 provided some 1.1
billion dollars in cofinancing for IDB-backed projects, cofinanced
projects with a total 610 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
During 1997, the IDB broadened the scope of its cooperation
with donors. The bank signed two formal agreements on cofinancing
with the governments of France and Italy as well as a framework
agreement with the Netherlands' minister of development
cooperation. It also signed a memorandum of association with the
Caribbean Development Bank with a view to increasing cooperation
on behalf of their common borrowers.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Over 300,000 Rwandan Children Live in Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 300,000 children in
Rwanda are now struggling for survival in desperately impoverished
households without parents, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The children, who survived the 1994 genocide and its aftermath
in Rwanda, "are the most marginalized of the poor in an area of
almost unimaginable suffering and want", UNICEF Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are now about 60,000 parentless
households in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the exact numbers, the scale and persistence of the
problem of child-headed households in Rwanda is daunting," Bellamy
said. "The plight of these children is not only heartbreaking and
unacceptable but raises deeply troubling questions about the
long-term prospects for the country's recovery."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF cited the report of a non-governmental group, World
Vision, as saying that food shortages are chronic in child-headed
households, a problem that forces urban children to beg in the
streets and rural children to rely on what little food they can
produce or on handouts from neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The report said that shelter was also a major concern, especially
in the countryside, where many parentless homes consist of little
more than plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the report, the very existence of these
households "has barely been acknowledged" within Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
For children already traumatized, the psychological
consequences of this invisibility and powerlessness can be
devastating, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these children "can no longer talk, having learned that
when they cry out in pain, or speak their feelings, no one listens,"
the reported claimed. "So they become silent, choosing to keep their
problems to themselves."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's executive director called for intensive efforts to
give the children in parentless homes "the tools, both material
and psychosocial, that will help them take their rightful places
as healthy and productive members of Rwandan society".

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Unusual winter rains were
reported from across the country Tuesday and the capital city of
Islamabad broke the 22-year rainfall record for the month of
February.
</P>
<P>
The earlier February record was made in 1976, when Islamabad
received 208.4 mm of rain, but that figure was crossed Tuesday as
the aggregate rainfall for this month has become 232 mm, Ghulam
Qadir, deputy-director of the Meteorological Office, told
journalists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The current wet spell, which began in the wee hours Monday,
continued on Tuesday and poured down 89 mm of rain over the last
24 hours in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The 89 mm of rainfall has also set a new record for 24 hour
rain in this capital city, according to Qadir.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain in Islamabad's sister city of Rawalpindi flooded
low-lying areas and disturbed the communication system. Attendance
in offices and education institutions remained thin and people
preferred to remain indoors, according to a report by the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The inclement weather disrupted flight schedule of PIA as 14
flights from and to northern areas were canceled due to poor
visibility.

<HEADLINE> S. African Security Guards Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of security
guards in South Africa continued their nationwide strike Tuesday
to demand a pay rise as talks between the security workers'
unions and the employers remained in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Security Employers' Association
(Sansea) and the 11 unions participating in the strike, which
represented the country's registered security guards, were still
locked in talks in Johannesburg Tuesday afternoon, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
They were summoned to an all-day hearing Tuesday by the
Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, a
statutory body.
</P>
<P>
Security guards began striking Monday after their demands for
higher pay and other benefits were rejected by Sansea. Their
rallies and marches in cities across the country caused major
disruptions, with many buildings, shopping centers and banks left
without protection.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number on strike ranged from the 30,000 given
by employers to the 100,000 put out by unions.
</P>
<P>
The unions asked for a 12 percent wage increase, an annual
13th check bonus, 4 percent company contributions to a provident
fund and an upgraded status for guards carrying firearms.
</P>
<P>
But employers are offering a 10 percent wage increase, a 3
percent provident fund contributions and no bonus unless it's
drawn from the provident fund money.
</P>
<P>
Sansea said Monday that it would apply for a court interdict
to have the strike declared unlawful and unprotected if the
stalemate was not resolved Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sansea chairman Mick Barmann said that the striking guards
could be fired by the end of the week if the employers get the
interdict from the Labor Court.
</P>
<P>
But the unions said they would not back down, even if the
interdict is served.
</P>
<P>
Security guards said their demand was highly reasonable as
they stood enormous risks of being injured or killed in carrying
out their duties in the crime-laden country. South Africa is said
to have the highest incidence of murder and rape in the world.

<HEADLINE> Asian Storm Clouds Hold Uncertainty for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- While hailing the good
performance of the U.S. economy here Tuesday, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that "storm clouds" from Asia
carried unusually high uncertainty for the future.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his semi-annual economic report to a House Banking
panel, Greenspan indicated that the central bank was content for
the time being to leave interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief termed the current economic expansion, which will
enter its eighth year next month, an "exemplary performance" with
inflationary pressures falling last year despite the fact that the
unemployment rate dropped to the lowest sustained levels since the
late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for total spending on goods and services produced
in the United States is less assured of late because of storm
clouds massing over the Western Pacific and headed our way," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that the U.S. trade deficit can be expected to
increase as the plunge in Asian currency values makes it tougher
for U.S. exporters to sell their products into these markets while
at the same time Asian goods become cheaper in U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
He said whether the Fed's next move is to increase rates or
reduce them will depend to a large degree on how much of a
depressing effect the Asian currency crisis has on the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The key question going forward is whether the restraint
building from the turmoil in Asia will be sufficient to check
inflationary tendencies that might otherwise result from the
strength to domestic spending and tightening labor markets,"
Greenspan stressed.
</P>
<P>
The last actual change in interest rates took place in March
1997 when the central bank boosted its federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, by a quarter-point to 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fed leader said the large investments businesses have been
making for a number of years in new computers and other high-tech
equipment were finally beginning to show up in the government's
official measurements of productivity, the amount of output per
hour of work.
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan said the Fed remained concerned that economic
demand, if not dampened sufficiently by the Asian situation, could
outstrip the nation's ability to produce goods, because labor
markets are already tight and there is a limit to how much
increased output can come from higher production efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's own economic forecast for 1998 was very much in line
with that of the Clinton administration. The Fed said it expected
overall economic growth to slow from last year's 3.9 percent rate,
the strongest in a decade, to a more sustainable pace of 2 percent
to 2.75 percent. The Clinton administration is forecasting growth
of over 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's economic projections also forecast a continued good
performance on the inflation front with consumer prices rising by
1.75 percent to 2.25 percent. The administration is looking for a
price increase of 2.2 percent this year, only slightly higher than
last year's actual 1.7 percent increase, the best reading since
1986.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief: He Has Good Agreement With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Tuesday that he has had a good agreement with
Iraq, which will be accepted by member states.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks upon coming back to the
Headquarters of the Untied Nations from a mission to Baghdad which
averted a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the cheering U.N. staff, the U.N. secretary-general
said, "I want to thank all those who supported, who rooted, who
played for this to happen."
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good agreement, an agreement that I will
defend anywhere, and I am sure that the member states would accept
it," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"When we pull together from across the world and work together
to solve a problem, we almost always can do it. When the world
comes together, things happen. Together we are the ultimate
power," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful example of what the United Nations should
be," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the U.N. Headquarters Tuesday, hundreds of U.N. staff
gathered in the lobby cheering the U.N. chief for reaching an

<HEADLINE> Israeli Intelligence Head Says Iraqi Threat Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army intelligence
head Moshe Yaalon said Tuesday that Iraqi threat to Israel
remains as it still has the potential of producing biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee on the Iraqi situation, Yaalon said there is also the
possibility that Iraq still owns quantities of biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
In his analysis, Yaalon said Iraq still has several dozens of
Scud missiles because its arsenal of 800 Scud missiles back in
1991 could not be all launched or destroyed after the Gulf War. He
believed Iraq still owns several missile launchers that are
operational.
</P>
<P>
On Iraqi capability of producing biological and chemical
weapons, Yaalon noted that Iraq has produced thousands of liters
of biological agents used to produce such weapons. Despite Iraq's
repeated denials, the United Nations (UN) special committee on
weapons inspection uncovered a large number of chemical weapons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Iraq has very high technological potential to
produce biological and chemical weapons. He pointed out that no
less than 20,000 Iraqi scientists study abroad, who will make
it easier to produce the weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On the conventional weapons, Yaalon said the Iraqi armed forces
have been notably weakened since the 1991 Gulf War. The number of
tanks has been reduced from 6,000 to 2,300, while its planes down
to 300 from 700.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Iraq still has the capability of
penetrating Israeli airspace despite the reduced number of the
planes and their poor maintenance. This is regarded as a threat
especially if the planes might be equipped with biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the Iraqi situation, Yaalon said the latest crisis
has been only one in a long line of crises that are not over yet.
</P>
<P>
Yaalon's assessment was identical to that of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Tuesday that he doubted that if
Saddam would keep the just-signed agreement on the UN weapons
inspection.

<HEADLINE> Angola Backs Forming Portuguese-Speaking Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Angolan Defense
Minister Pedro Sebastiao said here Tuesday that Luanda welcomes
the idea of forming a peace-keeping force under the
Portuguese-speaking community.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao made the remark on his arrival at the Maputo airport
for his five-day tour of the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Angola is trying hard to find out the best
way of forming such force, adding that "we are planning to
discuss the issue with other countries."
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao disclosed that a defense ministers' meeting focusing
on this issue is to be held before June this year. Leaders from
Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Brazil, Guinea Bissau, Sao Tome
and Principe are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
On the implementation of the Lusaka Peace Protocol in Angola,
he said the February 28 deadline as outlined in the protocol is
likely to be extended again because of the delay by the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao said UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi should have moved
into Luanda earlier in accordance with the peace protocol, but he
has refused to do so on an excuse of "lack of safety".
</P>
<P>
Savimbi has been demanding to have a 400 group of bodyguards,
but the government agreed to allow him to have 150 men only.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is coming to Mozambique to learn from the
military forces which have done better in forming a joint force.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Urges Israel to Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli side must
implement the signed agreements with the Palestinians so as to
move the Mideast peace process forward, said the Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution has been found to solve the
Iraqi-U.N. crisis over arms inspection, the world attention will
focus on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Erekat told the
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
After rounds of talks, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed an agreement Monday
in Baghdad on peacefully ending the Iraqi-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks will continue, but the Palestinian side has
told the Israeli side time and time again that the signed
agreements must be implemented, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Erekat made these remarks before attending the talks with the
Israeli delegation headed by Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh at the
residence of Edward Walker, U.S. ambassador to Israel, in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Practical matters, such as projected Gaza seaport and airport,
the safe passage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the
Karni industrial park are the main issues dominating the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's talks are the third round between Erekat and Naveh in
their capacities as heads of the steering committee for bilateral
negotiations after returning from the Washington talks two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Their first meeting took place on February 18 at Walker's
residence, followed by the second one in Jericho, the West
Bank. But no agreements were reached on the above mentioned
issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Close bilateral
consulations between the OAU and U. N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) could help resolve the problems in the Great
Lakes, Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meles made the remark when meeting with the visiting Sadato
Ogata, head of UNHCR here where the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The two discussed security problems faced by refugees in the
Great Lakes region and the measures to be taken to ameliorate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted an Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying that the two sides agreed that the proposal
made by Meles for a panel of eminent figures to investigate the
genocide in Rwanda will help prevent similar atrocities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Ogata is currently on her four-day visit to Ethiopia which is
the last leg of her nine-nation African tour. She discussed the
refugees problems in Africa with Ethiopian Foreign Minister

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Have Joint Tourism Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Five Southern African states
are expected to contribute about 200 million U.S. Dollars to a
joint project of the proposed regional tourism attraction zone,
an official with the project said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Project Manager Ken Small said that the goal might be achieved
mainly through the upgrading of infrastructure, while the bulk of
the funding would come from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Small told the Zimbabwean News Agency that the governments of
Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe would contribute
about 10 percent of the total cost of the project while the
remaining 90 percent would be taken up by the private sector
which will inject about 500 million U.S. Dollars with donor
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Small said donor agencies were expected to help in areas such
as human resources, capacity building, health, research and
development of animal migration.
</P>
<P>
The project is an ambitious plan aimed at creating an
international tourist attraction area to the north of Bulawayo in
Zimbabwe, that would incorporate game parks in five Southern
Africa Development Community (SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The international tourism development zone will cover an area
of 260,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The project would incorporate international tourism assets
such as Livingstone in Zambia, Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park,
the Caprivi Game Reserve in Namibia, the Northern Okavango in
Botswana and the Mucusso and Luena National Parks in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Small said the governments' contribution to the initiative
would be through the upgrading of infrastructure such as roads,
bridges, airports and telecommunications while the private sector
would invest in hotels and related facilities.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Inspection Continues Smoothly in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Six U.N. arms inspection
teams paid surprise visits Tuesday to eight Iraqi sites with full
cooperation from the Iraqi side, Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, head of the Iraqi National Monitoring
Department, the Iraqi peer of the U.N. Special Commission, was
quoted as saying that one of those teams inspected three sites
aboard a helicopter. They video-taped and photographed the sites.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. inspectors had no trouble in carrying out
their mission and no problem was reported.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, UNSCOM has conducted tens of
thousands of visits to over 2,600 sites suspected of hiding or
producing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM's mission is to verify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. sanctions imposed on the
country after its invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
A crisis triggered by Iraq's barring of inspection of several
sensitive sites brought the country to the verge of a war with the
United States. It was eased with the signing of an accord between
Iraq and U.N. Monday.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a technical group of the International
Atomic Energy Agency continued its meeting with the Iraqi
side.

<HEADLINE> 60,000 Lebanese Teachers Strike for Higher Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 60,000 teachers in
state-run and private schools across Lebanon Tuesday began a
two-day strike in protest against the government's failure to meet
their demands for higher salary and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The strike forced some 750,000 students to remain at home,
local Future Television said.
</P>
<P>
The teachers demand the government calculate pensions on the
basis of full final salaries before retirement, but the cabinet
only agreed to calculate on the basis of maximum of 90 percent of
final salary.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that the war-drained state treasury can
not afford any fresh salary hikes in the public sector unless
adequate funding sources are secured.
</P>
<P>
Owners and managers of many private schools have also
announced that the teachers' demands would require a hefty hike
in tuition fees, a move vehemently opposed by the already
overtaxed parents of the students.
</P>
<P>
The Teachers' Trade Union, the strike organizer, issued a
statement Tuesday saying that they will take "escalatory moves" if
the government fails to adequately meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
But it also asserted the teachers' readiness to enter into a
new dialogue with the government on ways to raise the necessary
funds to meet their demands.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Agreement Between U.N. Chief, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday returned to the Headquarters of the United
Nations from his Baghdad mission, during which he reached an
agreement with the Government of Iraq on ending the current crisis
over U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief briefed the Security council on his visit to
Iraq and the agreement reached between him and Iraq in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
The highlights of the agreement are:
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq accepts all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
and will cooperate with the U.N. Special commission (UNSCOM), in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction;
</P>
<P>
-- Iraq accords UNSCOM "immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access;"
</P>
<P>
-- Eight presidential sites Iraq considers sensitive and spread
over about 31 square km will undergo inspection under special
procedures. Annan will choose a new "special group" with a new
commissioner made up of UNSCOM inspectors and diplomats;
</P>
<P>
-- UNSCOM would analyze any findings of this group in a report
to the council;
</P>
<P>
-- All other areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of
transportation will be subject to current UNSCOM procedures;
</P>
<P>
-- Annan would bring the sanctions imposed on Iraq days after
it invaded Kuwait in 1990 to the "full attention" of the council.
But it does not commit the council to lifting the embargoes, which
are in part tied to disarmament demands.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Spokesman on Turkish Cypriots' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
spokesman stressed Tuesday that the final proposal for Turkish
Cypriot participation in talks for accession to the European Union
(EU) will be submitted by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Manolis Christofides was commenting on press reports
that in a letter to Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair had ask for equal treatment of the two
communities of Cyprus in EU talks.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Blair congratulated Clerides on his re-election
for second term in office and reaffirmed British interest in a
solution to the Cyprus problem and in promoting Cyprus' European
course.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters at his daily press briefing here
that "any proposal for the participation of Turkish Cypriots,
must comply with the U.N. resolutions, particularly those of the
U.N. Security Council, which reject the recognition of any other
government in Cyprus, other than that of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU membership in 1990. The
EU summit in Luxembourg last December reaffirmed its decision to
start accession negotiations with the Cypriot government at the
end of March, a move angrily denounced by Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader has suspended bicommunal activities
and contacts with the Cypriot government since last December in
retaliation for the EU decision and threatened to seek union with
Turkey if the EU membership talks proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has put as a condition for the resumption of
bicommunal talks the recognition of the breakaway state in the
north by the Cypriot government, so that talks can be held between
two "equal entities."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third following a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Christofides described Turkish Cypriots' demand for recognition
of the breakaway state in northern part of the island as an
affront to the international community.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the solution to the Cyprus
problem is the establishment of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
and not partition.
</P>
<P>
"A position in the European family, offered by Europe to
Cyprus and its people, will secure well-being and happiness for
all," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Russia's Role, Goal in Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The tension of the Iraqi crisis
has been at last relaxed by the signing of an agreement between
the United Nations and the Iraqi leadership Monday. In resolving
this conflict, there has been practically a struggle between Iraq
and the United States, or a struggle between Russia and the U.S.,
and Moscow has scored the most points.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin Monday said that from the start Russia
had been advocating a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side had repeated the position that it would be a
grave mistake to launch a military strike against Iraq and warned
Washington the use of force could bring about untold consequences.
</P>
<P>
People haven't forgotten that at the beginning of February
Yeltsin made several telephone conversations with French President
Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, as well as
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, in order to find a peaceful way
to resolve the crisis in the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, an
Arab affairs specialist who was the envoy of the former Soviet
Union in an attempt to ward off the 1991 Gulf war, visited
European capitals, including Madrid, Brussels and Paris, to
coordinate their positions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Russian special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk had several
trips to Baghdad as a diplomatic effort to avert the use of force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts were made by Russia in an effort not only to
head off a war in the Gulf region, but also to pave the way for
strong economic ties with Iraq when the U.N. sanctions are
eventually lifted. So, the weapons inspection crisis in fact is a
question left over by the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is especially concerned about the removal of the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions over Iraq. After the agreement was
signed between the U.N. and Iraq, the Russian Foreign Ministry's
spokesman Gennady Tarasov said on the same day that in view of
Baghdad's cooperation, this should result in the lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is known that Moscow was a major arms supplier to Iraq in
Soviet times and it wants to ensure that Baghdad can eventually
repay its debts accumulated to 7 billion U.S. dollars or more.
According to Russian government experts, Russia has lost 10
billion U.S. dollars in profits over the years of sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also, some Russian oil companies have already signed deals with
Iraq with an eye to the future.
</P>
<P>
Moscow, having relatively good relations with the Middle East
country, is also eager to repeat its last-year success in
brokering a deal to end a similar crisis between the U.N. and
Iraq. It has been right to point out the risks of a U.S. strike
against Iraq and to call for a diplomatic solution to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the U.S. has been regarding Iraq as a main
obstacle and potential threat in the Gulf region, and once the
sanctions on Iraq are lifted, it may constitute a threat to the
interests of the U.S. in the region, so that Washington makes
every effort to keep the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Russia is, of course, aware that Washington does not like the
strengthening of Russia's positions in the Middle East and the
increasing role of its diplomacy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Moscow has repeatedly warned that if the U.S.
resorts to military force to the Iraq crisis, it may damage the
relations between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, through its close contacts in Baghdad, Russia knows
something the rest of the world doesn't know. After the signing of
the U.N.-Iraq agreement on the weapons inspection, Yeltsin said
that a military solution to the crisis could be extremely
dangerous -- "Iraq may have some chemical weapons."
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, Russia has gotten what it wants in dealing with the
Iraqi crisis, but it is not the end of the problem. As the
suspicion of weapons of mass destruction existing in Iraq has not
been cleared up, there will be again conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hopes Contacts to Remove Misunderstanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Tuesday expressed hope that resumed
high-level contacts between Iran and the European Union (EU)
would serve to remove existing misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Mohammadi
voiced Tehran's welcome to the decision by the EU Monday to
resume contacts with Iran at the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Terming the EU decision as "realistic and considerable,"
Mohammadi said that high-level contacts between Iran and the EU
would serve to remove the current misunderstandings over some EU
policies and provide an appropriate atmosphere for comprehensive
political, economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European block Monday decided to resume contacts
with Iran at ministerial level, which was suspended last April
after a German court rule accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring
terrorist acts against Iranian Kurdish rebel leaders in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU also expressed concern over Iran's stands
on terrorism, production of weapons of mass destruction, the
Middle East peace process and the death sentence on British writer
Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iran's late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini sentenced
Rushdie to death in 1989 because of his controversial novel "the
Satanic Verses" which was believed to have insulted the Islamic
sanctities. The British writer has been forced to live under heavy
protection of the British police.
</P>
<P>
"It is surprising the EU has repeated the same subjects on
which Iran has already declared its transparent stand," Mohammadi
said, adding that repeating the same concerns can not help remove
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we hope the EU states have reached to the
conclusion that Iran is an effective state in regional
developments and enjoys a special status in the international
community as the chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC)."
</P>
<P>
Iran formulates its policies in line with peace and stability
in the region and the entire world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi to Moscow, Mohammadi said Kharrazi would hold talks with
ranking Russian officials on ways to develop close relations,
reinforce cooperation in oil and gas fields and issues concerning
regional crises especially in Iraq and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi left here Tuesday afternoon for a three-day official
visit to Moscow, his first visit to Russia since he took office
last August.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi attacked the United States for its propaganda
campaign over nuclear cooperation between Iran and Russia, saying
that the U.S. has attempted to divert the public opinion in the
region from the large-scale armament of Israel and growing U.S.
arms supplies to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the nuclear cooperation between Iran and
Russia was for peaceful purposes and in accordance with the
international conventions, adding that Iran wants the Middle East
to be free from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to pressure Israel to
sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to allow the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its nuclear arsenal.

<HEADLINE> Public Cars Prohibited on Streets in Dar at Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Dar es Salaam Regional
Commissioner Yusuf Makamba has ordered the police in the
Tanzanian capital to detain drivers of government or public
vehicles if they run on the streets after 6 pm.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to all ministers, heads of government and public
institutions, Makamba said the order became effective Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The order is to implement President Mkapa's order given
recently in Dodoma when addressing the parliament requiring
government officials to strictly adhere to the 1992 presidential
directive on the use of government and public vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The directive, which prohibits such vehicles to go to streets,
is aimed at cutting down expenses on fuel.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's economic situation becomes difficult after
devastating floods swept across the country since last December.
The country needs as much as 110 million US Dollars to restore
damaged infrastructures and services, President Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who briefed the members of parliament two weeks ago on
the grave impact of El Nino on the national economy, said the
excessive use of government vehicles by officials in Tanzania,
one of the poorest countries in the world, is not understood by
donors and common people.
</P>
<P>
He expressed disappointment that a number of officials turn a
deaf ear to the directive that after 6:00 pm government-owned
vehicles are prohibited to go out unless authorized.
</P>
<P>
The president has also called on officials to cut spendings on
making telephone calls, consuming electricity and holding
seminars.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Commissioner also said in the letter that the
police's operation to implement the directive will be permanent.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Continue Military Training for Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein Tuesday chaired a cabinet meeting to discuss ways of
improving military training for Iraqi volunteers despite its arms
inspection deal with the U.N. signed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting examined proposals on improving the level of
training for volunteers in an attempt to achieve more desirable
results, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Saddam called on the Iraqis "capable of bearing weapons" to
volunteer for military training last month amid U.S. threats to
launch strikes against Iraq over disputes on U.N. arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
About one million volunteers have received training since
February 1, with men getting three hours of daily training and
women two hours.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan signed an agreement with the
Iraqi government Monday over weapons inspections, which may avert

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Says UN-Iraqi Deal Saves Mideast From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz Tuesday welcomed the agreement reached between the
United Nations and Iraq, saying it saved the Middle East from more
wars and destruction.
</P>
<P>
Telling a news conference, Boueiz said the region was not
dragged into the dangerous situation thanks to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz signed the agreement in Baghdad Monday to
avert a possible U.S. military attack on Iraq. The agreement
allows unlimited weapons inspection by U.N. experts inside the
country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz praised the terms of understanding relating to the
special group which will be made up of arms experts and senior
diplomats appointed by Annan to carry out the inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq crisis was triggered by Baghdad's barring entry of
some sensitive sites to U.N. weapons inspectors and accusation of
U.S. and British team members for willingly dragging on the work.
</P>
<P>
Only after the inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction, the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The special group to be made up, Boueiz said, will guarantee
more effective and more balanced work for the U.N. Security
Council free from any hegemony and bias.
</P>
<P>
Allowing inspection of the presidential sites in Iraq, Lebanon
believes, dismissed all pretexts to launch a military action
against Iraq, he added.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes the
memorandum reached between the U.N. chief and the Government of
Iraq on ending the crisis over U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin made the remarks after U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan briefed the Security Council on his agreement with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We just heard the briefing by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Iraq. We express our heart-felt congratulations for the
Secretary-General's success in reaching the agreement," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate the diplomatic efforts by the
Secretary-General and positively value the flexibility and wisdom
shown by all parties concerned in achieving this result," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the memorandum of understanding is a balanced
and comprehensive document. It emphasized that Iraq should
comprehensively implement all the relevant Security Council
resolutions and cooperate with UNSCOM. At the same time, it also
emphasized that Iraq's sovereignty and dignity and security
concern should be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The special arrangements on the inspections of the
presidential sites can not only solve the issue of access, but
also take into consideration of Iraq's sovereignty, dignity and
security concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement is special but workable and in accordance
with the relevant resolutions of the Security council. Such
special inspection is a breakthrough in UNSCOM's work," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"A great deal has been done by UNSCOM in dismantling weapons of
mass destruction. We hope UNSCOM will speed up its work and
complete its work in an early date so as to lift the sanctions
against Iraq at an early time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This memorandum of understanding is hard won and should be
implemented as soon as possible. We call on all parties concerned
to adopt a cooperative attitude so as to create a favorable
atmosphere for its implementation," Qin added.

<HEADLINE> Same Pressure Should Be on Israel Too: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat appealed Tuesday that all countries that had exerted
pressure on Iraq to comply with United Nations resolutions should
do the same with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made this remark while attending a conference in
Brussels on the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Palestinian Authorities said that the
agreement on Palestinian autonomy should start to be implemented
carefully and completely while mentioning new rounds of
negotiations in view of a definitive agreement regarding the
Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met later in the day European Commission President
Jacques Santer who briefed the visitor on the conclusions drawn at
Monday's European Council of Foreign Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers discussed the role of the European
Union in the peace process in the Middle East and welcomed a
timely analysis by the European Commission on the key issues and
on the problems faced by the Palestinian economy and their impact
on the effectiveness of EU aid.
</P>
<P>
Santer told Arafat that the European Council was concerned at
the serious decline in the Palestinian economy despite the efforts
of international donors, including the European Union as the main
donor.
</P>
<P>
Santer reiterated that economic development and effective
security are the prerequisites for political stability in the
region and that the removal of obstacles to Palestinian economic
development, including closures, is in the long term the security
interests of Israel.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Guerrillas Killed in S. Lebanon: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Two Hezbollah (Party of God)
guerrillas were killed Tuesday in an attack by an Israeli
helicopter in south Lebanon, according to the radio run by
Israeli-allied militia South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the two guerrillas were killed when they
tried to infiltrate into an Israeli post at the village of Huna on
the edge of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hezbollah denied the report on its casualties.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said earlier that an Israeli
helicopter fired two rockets on Hezbollah commandoes trying to
infiltrate into the zone. They did not mention about the
Hezbollah's casualties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Hezbollah announced that one of its
guerrillas was killed Monday during clashes with Israeli troops
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim of protecting its north from
cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks, clashes between Israeli
troops and the Iran-backed Hezbollah have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready for Territorial Talks With UAE: Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran is ready to start
dialog with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over disputed islands,
Iranian former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Tuesday
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying the resolving of
the dispute with the Gulf Arab neighbor "should be through opening
a dialog with the UAE side."
</P>
<P>
He called on the UAE to send a delegation to Tehran to
continue talks on the disputed islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs
and Abu Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The three islands occupied by Iran since early 1970s were also
claimed by the UAE which prefers to refer the dispute to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafsanjani underlined his country's intent to forge
ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf and Arab states, adding that
Iran seeks "integrated and authentic ties with all states" through
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
The past two decades saw strained ties between Iran and its
Gulf Arab neighbors, mainly over the presence of Western forces in
the Gulf, Tehran's arms-strengthening program and its advocated
export of Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
But relations between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors,
especially Saudi Arabia, have been warming up since Iran's
presidential elections last year brought to power a moderate
clergyman, Mohammed Khatami, to succeed pragmatic Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani arrived in Saudi Arabia last Saturday starting a
10-day official visit to the kingdom. He held wide scale talks
with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on boosting bilateral ties and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit to Saudi Arabia by such a high level
Iranian official since the Iranian revolution in 1979 when the
relations between the two countries soured.
</P>
<P>
Iran said the strategy of the new government of Khatami is to
develop good neighborly relations on all spheres with Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states and in particular with Saudi
Arabia whose cooperation is seen as vital for stability in the
region which has more than two-thirds of the world's oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain and the UAE, held a summit last December in Kuwait and had
welcomed Iran's friendly gestures, but requested Tehran to
translate words into deeds.

<HEADLINE> More Than Half S. Africans Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than half of South
Africa's population live below the 301-Rand (61-U.S. Dollar)
poverty line and more than nine million people, or about 24
percent of the population, live in shacks.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released Tuesday in Johannesburg at the
launch of a four-month series of poverty hearings designed to
document the experiences of South Africa's poor, according to
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The hearings will start on March 17 in Bloemfontein. They will
be conducted by the South African Human Rights Commission, the
Commission on Gender Equality and the South African
Non-Governmental Organizations Coalition (SANGOCO).
</P>
<P>
SANGOCO President Rams Ramashia said the aim of the hearings
was to give poor people the opportunity to share their
experiences and propose solutions to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Information gleaned from the hearings would be used to devise
a pro-poor development framework and would be included in human
rights poverty monitoring programs, as well as be used to draw up
a poverty budget.
</P>
<P>
Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi said the public
hearings would provide a narrow critique of what government had
or had not achieved. She said it would be an opportunity to
strengthen the abilities of the poor to fight poverty.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Agreement With Annan Serves National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Tuesday that his agreement with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on weapons inspections serves
the interests of Iraq, hailing it as a national victory.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks in a joint interview with chief editors
of Iraq's major newspapers and television stations which was
broadcast live on tv.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the agreement does not mean that Iraq
has backed down from its previous stand, on the contrary, it
reinforces Iraq's stand.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Annan signed the agreement Monday morning to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors free and unlimited access to all sensitive
sites Iraq closed to them. The accord was termed by both sides as
balanced.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement largely eased the crisis over
weapons inspections during which the U.S. and Britain threatened
military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will help lift the economic sanctions on Iraq,
Aziz added.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 can only be lifted after
U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the issue of presidential sites never came up before
September 1997 when the U.N. Special Commission under Richard
Butler "suddenly" showed interest in visiting presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Butler then spread lies that
Iraq obstructed the work of U.N. arms inspectors when they were
on the verge of finding a large quantity of chemical and
biological weapons, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he said, they want to give an impression that Iraq
stores banned weapons in presidential palaces and that it does not
implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, thus creating an
excuse to keep sanctions on Iraq in place.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Annan briefed the U.N. Security
Council members Tuesday after he returned to the U.N. headquarters
in New York. He said he had a "general sense of approval" from the
members.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Resignation of Mossad's Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Tuesday welcomed the
resignation of Israeli secret service Mossad chief Danny Yatom due
to the blame for his agency's failed assassination attempt on
Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal here last September.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister for Development and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Jawad Anani described Yatom's resignation as "a step in
the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"We in Jordan seek to have our relations with Israel on the
level of the peace treaty which we signed in 1994 ... and want
every party to implement the accord according to each one's
commitments," said Anani in an interview with the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question whether the resignation would open a
new page for Jordanian-Israeli relations, Anani said that "if
Israel understands that as a step toward achieving a
reconciliation with Jordan ... then we welcome this."
</P>
<P>
On September 25, two men holding Canadian passports injected a
special poison into one ear of Mashaal, head of political bureau
of the anti-Israeli Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), outside
his Amman office.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers were captured and soon proved to be members
of Mossad. Their passports were fake.
</P>
<P>
Jordan strongly condemned Mossad's assassination attempt on its
territory, saying Jordan was not a base for terrorist acts.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Iraq Deal's loopholes should Be Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that there were some questions
and ambiguities in U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's agreement
with Baghdad over resuming weapons inspections in Iraq and the
United States would work with U.N. Security Council to close "any
loopholes."
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she
also vowed not to let Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "take us
from crisis to crisis."
</P>
<P>
Albright said Saddam had "reversed course" by agreeing to
allow U.N. inspectors immediate, unconditional and unrestricted
access to all weapons sites, including presidential sites that
were previously off-limits.
</P>
<P>
But she also said there were "some questions and ambiguities"
concerning procedures" involving presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to work closely with the Security
Council to make sure to close any possible loopholes. That is
our task for today," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that Annan agreed to let some diplomats
accompany U.N. inspectors as they try to ferret out Iraq's
suspected weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"This may be acceptable if the inspectors are free to conduct
rigorous inspections," she said. But the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, must keep "operational control," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know", Annan's deal with Iraq does not bar
specific people from membership on the U.N. inspection team "but
this is obviously one of the things that needs to be explored,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright pledged that Saddam would not be allowed "to take us
from crisis to crisis" and said the United States would "act
firmly and forcefully and without delay" if he did not let U.N.
inspectors eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects British Proposal on Cyprus's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday rejected
Britain's proposals concerning the participation of Turkish
Cypriots in Cyprus' accession talks with the European Union (EU),
saying that Athens wanted them to be involved in the negotiations
conditionally.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides recently,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly suggested that the
Turkish Cypriots be allowed to equally participate in the island
Republic's negotiations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Blair's proposals, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Turkish Cypriots could take part in
the accession talks but the conditions were that this would not
lead to the recognition of northern Cyprus and not create
obstacles to the island's accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that no one could prevent Cyprus from joining the
EU and the Cypriot government had the means to deal with any
eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally announced the
establishment of "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", but it
has been recognized by no countries except Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last year to include Cyprus to the list of
countries waiting to join the group, and the accession talks will
begin this year, but this did lead to the opposition by northern
Cyprus and its supporter Turkey.

<HEADLINE> AL, Iraq Discuss Future Steps to Lift Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid met with Iraq's permanent delegate Nabil Nejm
Tuesday on the prospects for lifting sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Nejm told reporters that they
discussed future steps to lift the embargo imposed on the Iraqi
people on the heels of the U.N.-Iraqi agreement reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by U.S. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was intended to avert an
imminent U.S.-British military strike against Baghdad in case
diplomacy fails to force Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990
cannot be lifted unless the U.N. can verify Baghdad has destroyed
all its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Lifting the embargo represents Iraq's strategic goal
especially after it has fully honored its pledges in accordance
with the U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nejm said that he felt Abdel Meguid's understanding of
sufferings endured by the Iraqi people and voiced his country's
appreciation of Arab stances towards the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arab diplomatic circles in Cairo Tuesday sounded
positive about the success of the U.N.-Iraqi deal on averting a
U.S.-British military strike against Iraq and ending the crisis
over arms inspection, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But some of them still have reservations about the U.S. stance
on maintaining its military build-up in the Gulf area in case Iraq
fails to comply with U.N. resolutions, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Isa Darwish, Syrian Ambassador and chief delegate to the Arab
League expressed satisfaction over the agreement, which he hoped
would be a prelude for lifting the international embargo imposed
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While stressing Baghdad's response to Annan's good offices to
carry out the international legitimacy resolutions, Darwish
pointed a finger at the U.S. double-standard policy.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the U.S. administration to work for carrying out
the international legitimacy resolutions concerning the Middle
East issue.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mohamed Ahmed
Mahmoud underlined the importance of the Iraqi-U.N. agreement for
sparing the region adverse impacts of the military option.

BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of bereaved Iraqi
women and children Tuesday gathered in front of the office of
U.N. Development Program (UNDP) here, protesting against
U.S. anti-Iraq policy and calling for the lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The women dressed in black robes and children in wheel-chairs
marched to the UNDP office, holding banners reading "Save Iraq's
Children" and "Lift the Unjust Embargo" and chanting slogans
"Sanctions are Genocide" and "Down with U.S.A.."
</P>
<P>
Ghalib al-Jassim, chairman of the Health Committee of Iraqi
National Assembly (Parliament), told reporters that more than one
million Iraqi children have died of malnutrition and the lack of
medicine as a result of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said the gathering was co-sponsored by his committee and
Iraqi Women Federation with the aim of showing the people of the
world the grave consequences of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Health
Ministry, 6,983 Iraqi children under five died last month,
compared with 389 in the same period in 1989 before the sanctions
were imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
About 20 "Voluntary Human Shields" from Italy also joined the
demonstration. Fabio Alberti, one of the Italians, said they are
here to show support for the Iraqi people against possible
U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
After rounds of talks, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz signed an agreement Monday
in Baghdad on peacefully ending the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms
inspection.

The U.S. and Britain had threatened to launch military strike
against Iraq if diplomatic efforts fail to persuade Iraq to allow
U.N. arms inspectors full access to the sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) announced Wednesday they would nominate their
chancellor candidate for the September general elections on March
2, just one day after a key regional vote in Lower Saxony state.
</P>
<P>
Results of the Sunday vote in Lower Saxony state would decide
which one of the two long-time rivals, SPD chairman and Saar state
premier, Oskar Lafontaine, and the SPD premier of Lower Saxony
state, Gerhard Schroeder, would become the SPD chancellor
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be made by the SPD executive committee in
Bonn on March 2 after the crucial vote.
</P>
<P>
It is believed Schroeder needs an increase of at least half a
percentage point in vote over the 44.3 percent he gained in 1994
in order to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, recent polls have showed that Schroeder, a
moderate SPD with links to industry, would have more chances than
Lafontaine, who is a more traditional leftist, to defeat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is seeking a fifth four-year term in the elections. He has
been in power since 1982.

Association.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of American mail order corporations and enterprises
participated in the seminar, which provided participants with
access to cooperation partners, information on the Chinese
market, domestic policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
A novelty in China, mail order will surely become an effective
way for Western companies to tap the huge Chinese market in the
future, experts said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The number of credit-card holders in China has reached 54
million, and is expected to top 60 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of postal facilities and publicity about
this new purchasing method, China could become the world's biggest
mail order market, the experts concluded.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese market has strategic significance for the
development of the United States Postal Service," said James
F. Brubiak, vice-president of the Service, adding that it is now
the time for it to enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The Service has been co-operating closely with China's General
Post Office, taking the lead in setting up a global postal service
network in Shanghai.

The inaugural flight to Fuzhou departed Hong Kong this

<HEADLINE> HK Legislature Approves Five Bills (Amendment) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Five Hong Kong Bills
(Amendment) were approved after the third reading by the plenary
session of the Provisional Legislative Council here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These Bills cover the areas of housing, provident fund schemes,
 occupational deafness (Compensation), criminal procedure and
rights.
</P>
<P>
The Provident Fund Schemes Legislation (Amendment) Bill 1997
was introduced into the Provisional Legislative Council on
November 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
It has amended the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance
(Cap.485) to provide inter alia for a reconstituted Mandatory
Provident Fund Schemes Authority, the establishment of industry
schemes and a series of further enforcement measures.
</P>
<P>
The bill is aimed at ensuring the retired employees to get
accumulated fund and repayment for their investment during the
period of their work.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Bill of Rights (Amendment) Bill 1998 has removed
the uncertainties and confusion in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights
Ordinance (BORO).
</P>
<P>
The BORO was enacted in Hong Kong in 1991, making it very clear
that the ordinance binds only the government and public
authorities. It has no application to inter-citizen relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sub-sections which were added to the BORO on
June 30, last year by the previous Legislative Council caused
uncertainties and confusion in the law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Adaptation of Laws (Interpretative Provisions)
Bill moved by Elsie Leung, secretary of Justice, was read the
second time at the session.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the main purpose of the bill is to adapt the
provisions relating to the construction, application and
interpretation of laws to ensure conformity with the Basic Law and
the statues of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region of
China.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Reports Decrease in HK's Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) received a total of 1,571 corruption
reports last year in Hong Kong's private sector, a 4.85 percent
decrease compared with 1,651 cases in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The figure was disclosed by Anson Chan Fang On-sang,
administrative secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, in a reply to a question raised by a member of the
Provisional Legislative Council at its Plenary Session here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the ICAC has all along adopted a three-pronged
Approach of detection, prevention and education in fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
To combat corruption in the private sector, a more effective
liaison network has been established with the Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC), the banking industry and other important
sectors in order to gather more intelligence and information.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have also been made to strengthen the ties with the
Chinese mainland and overseas law enforcement agencies in
combating cross-boundary and international corruption offenses in
the private sector, she added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ICAC set up a Corruption Prevention Hotline to
make it more convenient for private enterprises and individuals to
enquire about corruption prevention.
</P>
<P>
On the education front, staff from more than 160 large or
listed companies were educated on corruption prevention and
encouraged to draw up specific codes of conduct for better system
controls in their companies.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, she said the ICAC will focus on preventive
education for the financial sector by closely liaising with
professional associations and bodies in the sector, strengthening
communication with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the SFC.
</P>
<P>
Education on corruption prevention will be extended to small
and medium-sized businesses in the near future, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan said in the wake of the recent financial turmoil in
Southeast Asia, the ICAC will keep a close watch on the market and
see if corruption activities are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
However, she said in the light of the number of reports
received and intelligence gathered by the ICAC since October last
year, the problems of corruption and abuse of power in Hong Kong
have not worsened as a result of the financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The latest Lebanon Banks Association bulletin has
said that the national public debt in 1997 stood at 23,175 billion
Lebanese pounds (about 15.17 billion U.S. dollars), representing a
rise of 14.9 percent over that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
TRIPOLI -- The Posts and Telecommunications Company of Libya
has finalized a 70 million-dollar contract with the Alcatel
Company of France for the introduction of the first optic-fiber
marine telecommunications system to Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libya's optic-fiber marine telecommunication network, which is
due to be completed by the middle of 1999, will cover a distance
of 1,600 kilometers offshore.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Signalling continued economic slowdown, Israel's
industrial production rose only 2 percent in 1997, the lowest
growth rate in seven years, a report published Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted a report of the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) as saying this is the latest in a
string of economic indicators that shows the deepening slowdown in
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, Israeli industrial production grew at an
average annual rate of 6.8 percent and by 5.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1997, production grew at a monthly 3
percent in annualized terms, but that figure shrank to 1 percent
in the second half, the CBS report said.
</P>
<P>
The general trend was offset to some extent by the 17 percent
growth in the field of electronic components, 80 percent of which
was for export. Electronic communications production increased 12
percent in 1997, an industry in which 50 percent of volume is
exported. The production of food, drinks and tobacco increased by
3 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of building materials, chemicals,
rubber and plastics experienced zero growth, while production of
metals and machines declined by 1 percent. The largest decline
was in the textiles, clothing and leather goods sector, which was
down 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Report Shows More EU Citizens Get Access to Telephone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- European Union citizens are
taking advantage of low prices to hook up to modern telephone
services, according to an EU report.
</P>
<P>
The study for the European Commission was the first systematic
survey into the availability of the universal service scheme
throughout the 15-member union.
</P>
<P>
It showed a growing number of citizens are getting access to
telephone services while prices have fallen in real terms for most
users.
</P>
<P>
The report monitoring the progress of universal service was
based on responses by member states to a detailed questionnaire as
well as on an independent study on prices.
</P>
<P>
But it also found that many member states are still unable to
provide an up-to-date measure of the proportion of households
without telephone service.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said that the universal service meant guaranteeing
access at an affordable price to a telephone service that allowed
the use a fax or a hook-up a computer.
</P>
<P>
It also meant that users must be offered operator assistance
and directory enquiry services and that public payphones were
widely available.

<HEADLINE> EU Enlarges SRM List to Increase Health Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
endorsed Wednesday the enlargement of its list of specified risk
materials (SRM) to increase health protection from mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged list, to enter into effect on July 1, also
included dura mater, pituitary gland, intestines from duodenum to
rectum, vertebral column beside skull, brain, eyes, tonsils and
spleens on the previous list.
</P>
<P>
The original SRM list was expected to come into force on April
1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The offal is considered to be of high risk in transmitting the
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Derogations, however, are granted up to the end of this year
for EU member states and third countries to evaluate their
geographical transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), a
human variation of the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged SRM list finally automatically enters into force
on January 1, 1999, if a derogation is not decided for member
states and third countries.
</P>
<P>
In the period while awaiting the evaluation of the TSE status,
EU member states and third countries that have native cases of mad
cow disease must remove the offal as required by the shorter list.
</P>
<P>
The one alternative to the removal of SRMs is the application
of a post-mortem test to identify TSE infectivity, once such a
test has been validated and approved by the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Tallow and gelatin, both produced from cattle offal, are used
to manufacture medicines and cosmetics for human consumption while
cattle bone meal is used as animal feed.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Ranks First Among West Asian Nations in Trade with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The trade volume between China
and Yemen topped 751 million U.S. dollars, up 11 percent over the
previous year, the International Business Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The figure tops the list of trade volume between China and
west Asian countries, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China imports mainly crude oil from Yemen. In 1997, China
purchased 260,000 tons of crude from Yemen.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Yemen include food, light industrial products,
building materials, metals and minerals, electronics products and
machinery, chemicals and textiles.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's electrical appliances for household use and
automobiles began entering the Yemeni markets. These products are
of good quality and cheap, and thus are welcomed by the Yemeni
consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Yemen established diplomatic relations 42 years
ago, economic and trade ties between the two countries have been
developing steadily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the two China visits by President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, in 1987 and earlier this month, have helped
strengthen the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The China-Yemen trade and economic cooperation, as well as China's
aid to Yemen, are proceeding well, the newspaper said, and the two
sides are working to find ways to further expand the existing
cooperation.

BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, currently on a visit to Hungary, expressed Wednesday his
welcome to the United Nations agreement with Iraq on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued here, the NATO chief said that the
agreement was made possible by the diplomatic efforts and the
determined stance of the international community, including NATO
allies, in insisting on Iraq's full compliance with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"It is now the responsibility of Iraq to implement in full the
terms of the agreement, once endorsed by the United Nations
Security Council, and to provide immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to the UNSCOM inspectors," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who flew to Baghdad over the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Youth Urged to Embrace Altruism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten young people were awarded
here today the title of "China's Top Ten Young Volunteers" in
honor of their outstanding achievements in helping other people
out of trouble and providing free community service over several
years.
</P>
<P>
The title was bestowed by the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Youth League, China's leading youth organization which
in recent years has tried hard to help the country's younger
generation, most of whom were born and reared in the period of
reform, opening up and market economy, to keep away from money
worship and hedonism, and embrace altruism.
</P>
<P>
The ten title-winners include a university student, private
business managers, ordinary employees and government officials.
Each of them was said to have spent more than 2,000 hours on
average doing free community service.
</P>
<P>
They helped mentally-retarded children to study free of charge,
looked after old people without family support for years, provided
free medical treatment for poor people, and assisted poor farmers
to get prosperous with funds and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, executive member of the Communist Youth League
Central Committee's Secretariat, said that youth organizations
across the country should urge local youngsters to follow the
example of the ten and immerse themselves in various kinds of
voluntary community services.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the services should focus on offering effective
assistance to people leading a hard life, especially laid-off
workers in the cities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Youth League initiated a nationwide campaign called
"Chinese Youth Volunteers in Action" at the end of 1993. It
claimed that over the past four years, 55.2 million Chinese
youngsters have provided over 1.1 billion hours of free service
for the general public.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Dim Hopes for Recovery of Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- After months of anxious
waiting, oil exporting countries remain frustrated as they have
dim hope to see a recovery of oil prices which continue to go down.
</P>
<P>
The price of Brent blend, world's benchmark grade, dropped to
14.15 U.S. dollars per barrel on Monday, 52 cents less than that on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was a record low in 46 months, implying a 27 percent loss
compared to an average price of 19.4 dollars per barrel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices have been falling since the end of last
year when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
decided to increase its output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5
million barrels a day from January.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, a cut of demand for oil due to a warm
winter in the northern hemisphere and an economic crisis in
Southeast Asia has spurred the price further decline.
</P>
<P>
Except for a failed attempt by Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members
have done little in the previous months to rescue the sagging oil
prices, analysts in the world oil markets said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, leading OPEC member with an output quota of more
than 8 million barrels a day, hinted last week at an emergency
OPEC meeting to trim oil output in an effort to save the prices.
</P>
<P>
The call, however, has met with a rebuff from Venezuela,
another OPEC main quota-buster, who has ruled out any output
reduction.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis over United Nations arms
inspections has also dealt a heavy blow to the recovery of oil
prices, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Iraq reached an agreement Monday, under which
Iraq will grant unfettered, unrestricted and unconditional access
to all sites to the U.N. Special Commission charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
This implicates that Iraq will continue its export of oil to
the world markets according to the oil-for-food deal signed with
the U.N., exerting a negative impact on the oil prices, oil
traders in Gulf countries said.
</P>
<P>
The news of signing the agreement sent the oil price in the
world market down to the new record.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution last
Friday to increase from 2.1 billion dollars to 5.2 billion dollars
the amount of oil Iraq can sell over six months under the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
If the OPEC and its members continue to dream about a price
rebound triggered by outside factors and refuse to seek a chance
by themselves, the oil market will slip to an edge of further
collapse.
</P>
<P>
"The group should be objective now. It is time for OPEC to
resolve the (problem of oil) oversupplies triggered by itself,"
a Gulf oil trader said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Delegation Condemns Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Fabio Alberti, head of a
visiting Italian delegation, Wednesday condemned the continuation
of the U.N. embargo on Iraq, as well as the U.S. threats to use
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Fabio Alberti, head of Italy's Airlift to
Baghdad organization, said that "the Italians will be the first to
volunteer to act as human shields in case of any threat to or
aggression on Iraq in the future."
</P>
<P>
Alberti added that another delegation made up of Italians,
Americans and Britons, is expected to arrive and stay in Iraq to
show solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
About two tonnes of medicines will be sent and distributed to
the hospitals in Basra, a port city in southern Iraq, as a gift
from the Italian people, according to Alberti, who arrived here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alberti said his delegation will visit Iraqi hospitals and
schools to deal out medicines and notebooks to Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The sanctions, which barred the country from exporting
oil, can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons inspectors in charge of
dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass destruction verify that Iraq has
been disarmed of biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed an agreement Monday on
weapons inspection that could avert a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain threatened to take military actions
against Baghdad in a bid to force Iraq to comply with
U.N. Security Council resolutions and open all suspected sites to
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan said after a briefing to the Security Council members
Tuesday that he had a "general sense of approval" from the members
for the Iraq-U.N. agreement.

<HEADLINE> Niger Army Mutiny Spreads to N. City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- An army mutiny over pay in
Niger's southeast spread Wednesday to the northern city of
Agadez, a report from Niamey, capital of the west African state
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mutineers had kidnapped Agadez' prefect, Lieutenant-Colonel
Mai Manga Oumara, military sources were quoted as saying.
Soldiers were driving through the streets of Agadez, firing in
the air.
</P>
<P>
Streets in Agadez were deserted as the rebellion unfolded and
shops closed hurriedly, the report quoted eyewitnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mutineers said they rebelled to support troops in the
south-eastern town of Diffa, some 1,000 km southeast of Agadez,
who rose up in arms Saturday, mainly over late payment of
salaries.
</P>
<P>
Yahaya Tounkari, Niger's defense minister Monday said the
revolt in Diffa erupted on Saturday but added that the government
was trying to resolve the problem of pay arrears.
</P>
<P>

on the trans-Saharan caravan routes along which Arabs traded with
west Africans before Europeans arrived, Agadez is located in the
heartland of niger's mainstay uranium mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Niger, one of the poorest countries in Africa, has faced a
prolonged political crisis compounded by severe economic
hardship caused by a slump in the world market for uranium.

<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- All economic indicators of the French economy, except that of
unemployment, have shown a tendency of growth, with exports
increasing by 13.7 percent in 1997, industrial production by 8.4
percent and the number of jobs offered by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- The signing of the agreement reached by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan with Iraqi leaders will take time, as the United States
ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson asked for clarification of
some formulas in the agreement, such as the reference to the term
``Iraqi sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council has decided to offer the
last chance to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as its 15 member
countries called the result of U.N. Secretary-General's mission to
Baghdad ``very satisfying,'' despite a U.S. demand to add a clause
warning Saddam Hussein of grave consequences if he fails to
implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- With an increase of 173.4 billion francs (2.9 billion U.S.
dollars) of trade surplus in 1997, France registered an unequal
result of exterior trade. The good side of the balance sheet is that
France's enterprises have increased competitiveness, but its
faltering domestic demand is limiting the country's capability of
import.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Reports 11 Percent Rise in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The international banking
group Standard Chartered reported on Wednesday trading profit of
904 million Britain pounds (1.48 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, up
 11 percent against the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cost to income ratio has improved from 55 percent to 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the annual results, Group Chairman Patrick Gillam
 said they "demonstrate our capacity to produce excellent results
when our main markets in Asia are suffering considerable economic
turmoil."
</P>
<P>
He, in London, told a press conference here via a satellite
transmission that the group "benefited from the considerable
investment that we have made in risk management, in developing the
 credit skills of our people and from our determination not to
lend into sectors such as commercial property development, which
are vulnerable in an economic downturn."
</P>
<P>
The group has been concentrating on the development of consumer
 banking, corporate and institutional banking and treasury
activities in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America,
while its operations in Europe and North America act as a bridge
to the emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Gillam was bullish about the long-term potential of the key
market of Asia, which was hard hit by the severe financial
crisis. He said: "We believe that growth rates across the whole
region will gradually improve and will get back towards
established levels again after two years."
</P>
<P>
As for Hong Kong where the banking group has decades of
business establishment, Gillam commented: "We have always believed
 that as the free market part of China, under the 'one country,
two systems' arrangement, Hong Kong would continue to be a most
successful and attractive place to do business" and from which to
make connections into China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
As a major subsidiary of the group, Standard Chartered Hong
Kong recorded trading profit of 3.8 billion HK dollars (487
million U.S. dollars) in 1997, up 10 percent against the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The major locally-incorporated bank "saw continued growth in
credit cards, mortgages, corporate lending and trade finance" in
the volatile year, according to Group Executive Director Mervyn
Davies.

<HEADLINE> American Experts Optimistic about US-Iran Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) - An American foreign policy
expert here Wednesday expressed optimism that relations between
the United States and Iran would be improved in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
"We will see some changes in Washington-Tehran ties," Mark
Gasiorowski, from Louisiana State University, said in an interview
with Xinhua on the sidelines of the 8th Persian Gulf seminar
which started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that cultural dialogue proposed by Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami would be the first step for the U.S. and Iran to
move toward a rapprochement, and pave the ground for talks between
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Khatami called for a dialogue between the two
peoples. However, he said "Iran feels no need to have relations
with the U.S. (government)" since Washington has not changed its
hostile policies toward Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Gasiorowski agreed that the recent visit of an American
free-style wrestling team to Iran was aimed at pursuing a
"wrestling diplomacy" for normalization of Washington-Tehran
relations.
</P>
<P>
He believed American wrestlers' visit, the participation of
American experts in the Persian Gulf seminar and any other similar
contacts would help improve relations between the two sworn
enemies.
</P>
<P>
Another American expert, Geoffrey Kemp, agreed that "the more
the Americans and Iranians exchange honest opinions about the
areas in which we disagree, the greater the chances that
ultimately the two governments would be able to repair their
relationship."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iranian daily Iran News published
Wednesday, Kemp said that "we are engaging in this conference to
put diplomacy on track and we need to do more of this."
</P>
<P>
Kemp, a security aide in the Reagan White House and a
prominent strategist at the Nixon Center, Wednesday also had a
lunch with Iranian deputy foreign ministers, Mohammad Javad Zarif
and Gholam Ali Khoshroo behind closed doors after he met with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think that small meetings between Americans and Iranians
from academic centers and think-tanks is very important," Kemp
told Iran News, "this is how we should be trying to develop our
relationship in the months ahead."
</P>
<P>
However, Gasiorowski admitted there was strong opposition
against Washington-Tehran relations both in the U.S. and Iran. He
said if President Clinton announces to release the frozen Iranian
assets, surely he would face serious criticism from the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The two countries need more steps to reach a rapprochement, he
said, "we hope the two countries will improve ties in the near
future."

<HEADLINE> China's New Oil Fields to Be Opened for Foreign Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China will open more areas
rich in oil and gas resources to foreign companies in a bid to
speed up the country's energy development.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), China will commit to a group of oil
projects with foreign companies this year.
</P>
<P>
He said there are new blocks in the western part of the country
and in the Songliao Plain of northest China that are available for
foreign cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative production of undeveloped oil and gas reserves
would mainly be in areas around old oil fields in the eastern part
of the country, and cooperation in gas would mainly be in
southwest China's Sichuan Province and the Qaidam and Tarim basins
in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that China will expand its Sino-foreign
cooperation in risky oil and gas exploration in improving recovery
rates in old fields, and in constructing long-distance oil and gas
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, China has expanded Sino-foreign continental
oil cooperation to 21 provinces and autonomous regions, on nearly
2.5 million square kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
CNPC has signed 35 oil contracts and agreements worth 500
million U.S. dollars on 150,000 square kilometers of land with 32
foreign companies, including 28 of the oil giants.
</P>
<P>
China is also taking an active part in overseas oil and gas
exploration and has the rights to develop oil fields in Peru,
Russia, Thailand, Canada and Sudan, with some early successes, the
CNPC sources added.

<HEADLINE> Intra-ASEAN Trade System to Be Finalized Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The details of the trading
system using regional currencies within the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be finalized in the first
week of March, the Philippine Presidential Press Office said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the office quoted Philippine Trade and
Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista as saying that the intra-ASEAN
trading mechanism is being formulated by a task force created by
ASEAN central bank governors in Bali, Indonesia, earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand have agreed to initially
test the innovative trading scheme, which was an idea of ASEAN
leaders during their second informal summit in Kuala Lumpur in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The intra-ASEAN trade using the regional currencies was one of
the strategies which the ASEAN plan to implement in order to
reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bautista, the task force will initiate measures
that would maintain economic stability, position the country for
fast growth once the Asian currency turmoil is over and minimize
the impact of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> NW China Tapping Hypotonic Oilfields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ansai Oilfield in
northwest China's Gansu province produced more than one million
tons of oil in 1997, marking a technological breakthrough in the
development of hypotonic oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Ansai has a hypotonic rate of 0.49 millidarcies, the lowest in
China. Hypotonic oilfields in the country usually have a hypotonic
rate of less than three millidarcies.
</P>
<P>
China has three billion tons of proven hypotonic oil reserves,
but geologists used to believe that the exploration of such
oilfields would be expensive and fruitless.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Ansai Oilfield began to organize experts to try
various new methods. As a result, improved techniques for
perforation, fracture and water flooding have made it possible to
tap hypotonic oilfields.
</P>
<P>
Now, the per-well daily oil output at Ansai has been raised
from an average of two tons to 3.5 tons, and 150 wells produce
more than five tons daily each.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation has begun to spread the
new techniques to other oilfields that have hypotonic oil reserves,
in an effort to increase the country's crude oil output, which
stood at more than 140 million tons last year.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A fierce hyena which
killed five goats in Kisarawe, a town close to Dar es Salaam, has
caused fears among local residents.
</P>
<P>
Workers commuting to Dar es Salaam have feared to catch early
buses in the morning, while other people have also restricted
their movement outdoors, said the District Forestry Officer,
Charles Secha.
</P>
<P>
Footprints of the wolf-like beast were first noticed 10 days
ago. Previously local residents presumed that their livestock
were killed by a lion, but they finally identified the beast last
week, according to a report by The Guardian Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police and game wardens have launched an operation to hunt the
hyena. They spotted the wild animal last Friday, but it escaped.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is famous for wildlife protection, but villagers
often complained that lions, crocodiles and other ferocious wild
animals pose threats to their security.

bush of the Kingale Village in the central Dodoma Region,

<HEADLINE> Gender Policy-Making Process Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Gender
Policy Formulation Process was launched here Wednesday, aiming at
raising consciousness on gender disparities in society.
</P>
<P>
Didymus Mutasa, secretary for administration for ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), read
the launching speech on behalf of President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Mugabe said the Ministry of National
Affairs, Employment Creation and Cooperatives would coordinate
the gender formulation process.
</P>
<P>
"One of the objectives of the gender policy is to facilitate
an environment conducive to full participation of women in the
social, political and economic life of the country," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The gender policy would also enable women to hold high office
in the public, private and civil society so that they participate
in decision-making, he added.
</P>
<P>
The policy would also highlight the need to integrate women in
all sectors of the development process in accordance with their
capabilities and facilitate their economic empowerment, Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
The president urged all parties interested in the process to
actively and visibly make significant contribution to the
promotion of gender equality.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, would undertake a series of
consultations with all stake holders including parliamentarians,
non-governmental organizations, the private sector, academics,
research institutions, individuals and grass-rooters communities.
</P>
<P>
"The gender policies will therefore provide a national
framework for resolving gender imbalance in order to bring about
equal and equitable access to the control and distribution of
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shuvai Mahofa, deputy minister of national affairs, employment
creation and cooperatives, said women needed to be given the
recognition they deserved.
</P>
<P>
"No single phenomenon has a greater effect on the
transformation of society at this time than the profound change
in the relationship between men and women," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to her, the development of a gender policy was long
overdue as it had been on the drawing board even before the
fourth U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing, China in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Increase Immigration from China's inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Government announced
today that the number of immigrants from China's inland
will be raised to 280 a month, double the current number.
</P>
<P>
A press release released by the Macao Governor's office said
that the number of one-way permit holders to immigrate to Macao
will increase to 280 monthly from March 1 after negotiations with
related departments in China's inland.
</P>
<P>
That figure more than doubles the current monthly immigrants of
120, which the two sides decided on in a 1983 agreement. Family
members residing separately in Macao and the inland as well as
Macao businessmen have repeatedly called for the increase of
immigration cases over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the increase in one-way permit holders to
Macao will enable more family reunions, and help ease the pressure
of a large-scale immigration after the handover on December 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they say that the increase in Macao's population
will help revive the sluggish economy and bring in more investment,
which local businessmen have hoped.
</P>
<P>
But, as some analysts pointed out, the pressure of unemployment
and social welfare will also increase.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has a permanent population of 415,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Environment
ministers supported the establishment of a regional forest fire
research and training center in Indonesia at their second meeting
on Haze Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that part of the funding for the center would come
from the 1.2 million U.S. dollar grant approved by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), Malaysian Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding told a news conference after
the one-day meeting of the environment ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held in Kuching,
Sarawak, East Malaysia, official media here reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to activate the bilateral agreement
between Malaysia and Indonesia as an immediate measure to combat
the outbreak of fresh fires in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, Law was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged the two countries to activate the procedures
and plans outlined in their Memorandum of Understanding relating
to fire and haze prevention and control, Law said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Malaysia's Disaster and Relief Management
Committee deployed its fire fighters to fight the fires in
Kalimantan and Sumatra at the height of the haze last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that the current fires in Kalimantan
would be used as the trial run of the Regional Haze Action Plan
(RHAP), which was endorsed by the Haze Technical Task Force and is
scheduled to start in March this year, to identify its weaknesses,
Law said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama, Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja, who was also present at the news conference, said
the recurrence of forest fires which had already destroyed 4,000
hectares of forests in Kalimantan could be serious if neglected.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarwono said the fires occurring around human
settlements caused by the prolonged dry spell were now under
control.
</P>
<P>
He said the spontaneous combustion of the forest fires was
difficult to control due to the inaccessibility and vastness of
the terrain.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said the deployment of the airborne operations would
cost Indonesia 3,000 U.S. dollars per hectare to put out the
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
So far countries like Canada, France and Germany have offered
assistance in the form of training and fire-fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers are scheduled to hold their next meeting in
Brunei in April this year, Bernama said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in the reform of state enterprises in the last five
years, with different localities trying different methods.
</P>
<P>
China has been trying to reform its economic system, which was
centrally planned, into a system suiting the needs of a socialist
market economy. But the most difficult part of the reform has been
state industry.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, which has the country's biggest concentration of
state enterprises, singled out its textile industry as the city's
first major battleground in the fight to put them into the black,
setting an example for the rest of city industry.
</P>
<P>
Through auction, merger, bankruptcy and other reform measures,
the assets-to-liability ratio of the city's 1,673 state
enterprises dropped from 80 percent at the end of 1994 to 60
percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The automotive, telecommunications equipment, power generator,
petrochemical and other pillar industries have seen the ratio of
their combined industrial output value in the city rise to 52.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Integrated circuits and computers, medicine, new materials and
hi-tech industries have also grown rapidly in the last five
years. The ratio of their combined output value in the city's
total was 15.1 percent last year.

use whatever means they deem suitable for the reform of their
state industry.
</P>
<P>
The experience of China's fourth municipality, Chongqing, in
reform resembles that of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has handed over its control of several hundred small

a year. Meanwhile, the city plans to merge 12 of its government
economic bureaus and agencies into one, whose sole responsibility
will be to ensure the preservation and appreciation of the state

<P>
For Beijing, China's capital, readjustment of the state
industrial structure was the prescription for its reform in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
While encouraging mergers, sales and bankruptcy to its small-

policies to support Shougang (Capital Iron and Steel) Group. and 70
other big companies so that they can grow into the city's economic
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei Province, forming big group companies
has been the local government's burden of reform, which is
particularly important in view of overseas multinationals
competing for strategic footholds in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the province's chemical industry, its 10 group companies,
formed early last year, earned sales revenue that was half of the
provincial total last year.
</P>
<P>
Hubei has set up 85 group companies in metallurgy, automotive,
textiles, chemicals, machinery, light industry and building
materials to compete with overseas multinationals.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Egypt to Focus on Reviving Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and Egypt will intensify their joint action to
propel the Mideast peacemaking in the coming weeks, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The coming weeks will witness a series of Egyptian-Palestinian
meetings in the Egyptian capital to coordinate stances on the
peace process between them," Moussa said after a meeting with PNA
President Yasser Arafat, who arrived here Wednesday morning for a
brief visit.
</P>
<P>
Their talks covered the future steps of the Mideast peace march
and the Arab-Palestinian drive to push it forward, Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister brushed aside the statements by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he voiced his readiness
to hold a new Camp David meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that, logically, the Israeli premier should first
implement his commitments towards the transitional phase so as to
pave the way for speaking about the final stage," he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "essential and fundamental question" has to
be solved first in order to build confidence that any future
meeting would be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Egyptian coordination in revitalizing the
Palestinian-Israeli peace track, "the core of the Mideast issue,"
will also be the focus of talks to be held between Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Monday that after the U.N.-Iraqi crisis subsides
the attention had to be shifted to reviving the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
For more than three months, the tensions in the Gulf has
sidelined the Mideast peace process, which has deadlocked since
last March by Israel's construction of new settlements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had pointed out that Israel should implement all signed
agreements with Arabs and abide by peace principles on the basis
of Madrid conference, the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242,
338 and 425 and the land-for-peace formula.

LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 200,000 people gathered
Tuesday in west Nigeria's Minna city in support of the military
leader, General Sani Abacha's candidacy in October's elections of
an civilian president.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, coming from all the 25 local government
areas of the Niger State, started arriving at the government
house as early as 8 a.m. in hired buses, the Daily Sketch
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They carried various placards praising Abacha's achievements
in his four years of leadership and calling on him to contest,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, state administrator Simeon Oduoye
thanked the demonstrators for their massive turn-out and promised
to forward their solidarity message to General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
As Abacha's government transition to civil rule program draws
to its end, there has been increasing calls on Abacha to shed his
military uniform to contest.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, there are now at least 18 groups
campaigning for Abacha's presidency. Though many of them exist
only on papers, some of them have been very active.
</P>
<P>
Seven of them, including the Powerful Youth Earnestly Ask for
Abacha, have announced on major national media that they will
hold a rally of two million people in support of Abacha on March
3 and 4, in national capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's traditional rulers seemed to have endorsed Abacha's
presidency. In a recent meeting with Abacha, they have reportedly
asked Abacha to contest.
</P>
<P>
Abacha himself has not declared his intentions to contest. He
said earlier that the issue would be decided by the people.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Export Increases in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports have
witnessed 17.6 percent increase in January from last December,
according to a news release from Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With a rise in export from 241,147 bags (every bag contains 60
kilogram of coffee seeds) last December to 283,556 bags in
January, there had been a 20.3 percent increase in value from
21.61 million U.S. Dollars to 26 million Dollars, The New Vision
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign exchange earnings is a result of the
world market price, which rose from 1.49 Dollars per kilogram
last December to 1.53 Dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
But compared with the 551,688 bags export in January 1997, the
performance last month was still a setback, UCDA added.
</P>
<P>
This represented a decline of 48.6 percent in volume and 32.6
percent in value, as a result of the heavy rains caused by the El
Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export is the No. 1 foreign exchange earner in Uganda,
which accounts for 65 percent of the total foreign exchange
earned by the country.

<HEADLINE> Great Number of 300,000-year-old Stone Ware Unearthed in Cave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 pieces of
stoneware dating back 300,000 years have been unearthed in a cave
in the Qinling Mountains in the northwestern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The find, among the top 10 Chinese archeological finds in 1997
that were just selected by leading archaeologists here, is
expected to contribute to the study of local "industry" in the
Early Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
The cave in Luonan County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province
was home to people dating back some 360,000 years, 270,000 years,
and 170,000 years, successively, as three different deposits of
ground from those periods have been found in the cave.
</P>
<P>
Burned bones and fossils of some 20 kinds of mammals, birds and
aquatic remains were found in the cave. Experts suggest that the
ancient locals lived by hunting and fishing and were able to cook
their food.
</P>
<P>
What experts value most are the 35,000 pieces of stoneware,
mostly found among deposits dating back some 300,000 years. The
stoneware, made of quartz, includes cores, flakes, scrapers,
pointed implements and carving tools.
</P>
<P>
The other nine top archeological finds last year
were: well-preserved building remains from 7,700 years ago found
in Shandong Province, more than 5,000-year-old shell mound site in
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the world's oldest paddy field
found in Hunan Province, a neolithic site in Hong Kong, an earlier
city site among the remains of a city of the Shang Dynasty
(16-11th Century B.C.), a storage of bronzeware from some 2,500
years ago in Henan Province, the site of an imperial summer resort
of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), a ducal stone structure from
some 2,000 years ago in Guangzhou city, and a nearly
2,000-year-old tomb group on the route of the Ancient Silk Road.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Members of the International
Organization on Control of Red Locusts in Central and Southern
Africa (IRLCO-CSA) held a ministerial meeting here Tuesday on
unified action against the migrant insect.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Noticias on Wednesday, Aleke
Banda, Chairman of the IRLCO-CSA council of ministers and
Malawian Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation, appealed in his
speech for unified actions among the member states in the fight
against red locusts.
</P>
<P>
Banda spoke highly of the efforts made by IRLCO-CSA countries
in the past three years in eliminating locusts and other insects.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the unconditional support by the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization and GTZ Germany in preventing,
controlling and eliminating red locusts.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural ministers from Swaziland, Malawi, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Tanzania, as well as assistant to Kenyan Agricutural
Minister attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, Mozambican Minister of
Agriculture and Fishery, revealed at the meeting that the red
locusts which plagued Sofala, Manica, Tete and Zambezia
provinces in central Mozambique last year have so far been under
control.
</P>
<P>
But he worried that the plague of locusts might once
again break out in some areas in the country when the rainy
season ends this year.

<P>
DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has called for international cooperation in
forecasting cyclone to reduce the loss of lives and property, the
independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made this call while inaugurating a
week-long 25th session of the Panel on Tropical Cyclone of the
World Meteorological Organization in Dhaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since cyclones and other weather patterns are constantly on the
move and can travel hundreds of kilometers in a day, therefore,
international cooperation is vital for weather information
exchange across the globe, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"The panel is a very special kind of regional platform to
promote and coordinate this type of activities to observe,
monitor, understand, predict and protect the atmosphere," she
added.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the session are representatives from the World
Meteorological Organization, the European Commission and the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and
experts from Germany, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Oman,
the Maldives and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> China's Anhui Province Addresses Textile Industry Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province will
phase out 282,000 spindles and divert 25,000 textile workers
within two years, in a move to invigorate its textile industry.
</P>
<P>
according to an official plan, the number of spindles planned
for elimination this year is 143,000.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's plan is part of a national program to cut the number of
outdated spindles and reduce excessive production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The cotton-spinning sector is the largest part of Anhui's
textile industry with the biggest losses. The spindle-cutting
effort will focus mainly on large- and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises most likely to become profitable, while the others are
expected to halt operations.
</P>
<P>
Anhui will also take measures to merge and restructure the
smaller cotton mills to pursue economies of scale, while efforts
will be made to find jobs for laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
China has 46 million spindles. The State Council has decided to
cut the country's number of spindles by 10 million and reduce its
textile workers by 1.2 million in three years.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that China has been forced to do so mainly
because its textile industry has been plagued by financial
difficulties caused by repetitive construction and excessively
redundant production capacity.

PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- All economic indicators of the French economy, except that of
unemployment, have shown a tendency of growth, with exports
increasing by 13.7 percent in 1997, industrial production by 8.4
percent and the number of jobs offered by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- The signing of the agreement reached by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan with Iraqi leaders will take time, as the United States
ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson asked for clarification of
some formulas in the agreement, such as the reference to the term
``Iraqi sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council has decided to offer the
last chance to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as its 15 member
countries called the result of U.N. Secretary-General's mission to
Baghdad ``very satisfying,'' despite a U.S. demand to add a clause
warning Saddam Hussein of grave consequences if he fails to
implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- With an increase of 173.4 billion francs (2.9 billion U.S.
dollars) of trade surplus in 1997, France registered an unequal
result of exterior trade. The good side of the balance sheet is that
France's enterprises have increased competitiveness, but its
faltering domestic demand is limiting the country's capability of
import.

<HEADLINE> FINA Official Confident in China Anti-Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Camillo Cametti, chairman of
the International Swimming Federation (FINA) press commission,
expressed his confidence in China's stance to carry out its recent
intensified anti-doping campaign here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about FINA's probe into the doping cases in China,
Cametti, on a tour to Beijing to watch the current FINA's Swimming
World Cup short-course tournament, said he tought the Chinese
Swimming Association (CSC) would keep its words to intensify its
fight against doping.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure CSC will comply with all the regulations of FINA it
has agreed on. Now it seems to me that the Chinese side is
determined to fight doping vigorously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Four swimmers tested positive for the banned drug triamterene
(diuretic) in Janauary's World Swimming Championships in Perth,
Australia, following a discovery of human growth hormones in the
baggage of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan, who later was banned for
four years for traveling the drugs.
</P>
<P>
The urine samples of Wang Wei, Zhang Yi, Wang Luna and Cai
Huijue later were confirmed by the B sample test last month.
</P>
<P>
The final sanction on the four swimmers will be announced
after the hearing of the FINA doping panel in Lausanne on March
14.
</P>
<P>
Last week, FINA send a five-member investigating group to China
to probe into the drug scandals. The delegation came to know that
the CSC had failed in carrying out a satisfying job in controlling
swimmers and coaches nation-wide.
</P>
<P>
The CSC had comfessed that it was a big headache for it to get
rid of the drug-using at the grass-roots level due to the lack of
sophisticated checking instruments and necessary fund. But the
CSC has made up its mind to strike at the root of doping at all
costs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Cametti also hoped
that the media should focus their attention on the competition
itself instead of chasing other issues.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the attention of the media here could be focused on
the competition and swimmers, because we have great names such
like Alexander Popov and a couple of world stars who deserves to
get more attention," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Expands Environmental Protection Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has established a
special environmental protection market for enterprises in a bid
to accelerate control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The market, which covers 1,800 sq.m., offers facilities for
over 50 enterprises marketing environmental protection products
and related information services, in addition to promoting
technology exchanges and raising funds for environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau plans to
open an office to standardize development of the market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the country's leading industrial and commercial city,
is home to over 600 enterprises engaged in various aspects of
environmental protection. Said enterprises have a total annual
output value of over two billion yuan (240 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry is expected to develop
into one of the city's four pillar industries by the year 2010,
with projections calling for the sector's output value to exceed
40 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Manufacturing Output Up by 8% Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased by eight percent in December 1997, bringing the
whole year growth to 4.3 percent, the government Economic
Development Board (EDB) announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the December increase cut across all three major
clusters, namely the electronics, chemicals and engineering
industries.
</P>
<P>
Output of the electronics cluster grew by 8.4 percent
year-on-year in December and the higher output came from computer,
semiconductors, computer peripherals and the printed circuits
board assembled segments.
</P>
<P>
The weak demand and oversupply situation continued to depress
the output of disk drive, while output of telecommunication
equipment and consumer electronics segments also declined, the EDB
said.
</P>
<P>
The output of the chemicals cluster went up by 18 percent in
December and the cluster grew by 14.7 in the whole year of 1997.
The engineering cluster grew by 5.5 percent in December with
increased output from the process engineering and transport
engineering sector. For 1997, the cluster grew by 3.2 percent, the
EDB said.

<HEADLINE> Result of Abacha-Kabbah Talks Still in Offing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The planned two-day visit of exiled
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah should have ended by
Tuesday but the result of it is still in the offing to feed anxiety
about the final resolution to the nine-month-old crisis in S.Leone.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah, who arrived in the Nigerian capital Abuja Monday
afternoon, have been holding talks behind closed doors with Nigerian
Head of State General Sani Abacha, the current Chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
Nothing concerning the talks has been officially disclosed so far
but observers believe the private consultations are focused on
Kabbah's return to S.Leone as president.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a statement on the consultations will be
available very soon with the high point touching on the modalities and
process of Kabbah's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
The statement may also mention plans for a military back-up for
Kabbah's government to be provided by the ECOWAS peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG, as there is now no legal national army in that
country after the collapse of the military junta two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
It can be recalled that ECOMOG still stays in neighoring Liberia
six months after the inauguration of President Charles Taylor's
post-war government.
</P>
<P>
While Kabbah has been busying with preparations for comeback,
ECOMOG does not forget to clean the S. Leonean capital Freetown to
make it safe for kabbah's return.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies have also shipped desperatedly needed
food and other relief goods to Freetown to feed the numerous embattled
civilians there.
</P>
<P>
Although international arms embargo on the country remains
effective, ECOMOG has announced the opening of the main port in
Freetown to commercial ships as peace is gradually returning.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the ban, however, came as fighting was reported in
the country's hinterlands between the remnants of soldiers loyal to
the junta and the Kamajor militiamen fighting for Kabbah, particularly
in the southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite ECOMOG's arrival to Bo, the second largest city, to
reinforce the Kamajors, the rebels hiding in the bush have kept
launching intermittent attacks on the city, forcing thousands of
civilians to flee.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front, which has been fighting successive
governments in the country since 1991 and later allied to the junta in
the wake of the coup last May, were reported to have stepped up
attacks on the civilian population in the northern city of Makeni.
</P>
<P>
It may be too early to say that rebels in Sierra Leone could be
mopped up before long. But it can be said for sure that Kabbah has to
return home to take over the state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the result of talks between Abacha and Kabbah is
esteemed by all as very important as it concerns peace and stability
not only in S. Leone, but also in the west African sub-region.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines to Downsize Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) is
downsizing its operations to ensure the company's survival from
the current currency crisis, PAL President Jose Antonio Garcia
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis still plaguing Asia have taken a heavy toll
on the viability of many regional airlines including PAL, Garcia
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Like PAL, he said, these regional carriers are particularly
vulnerable to the currency devaluation since most of them have to
make substantial payments in dollars for fuel, aircraft leases and
aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said PAL is cutting its workforce and reviewing global
operations to stem further losses if the airline is to survive the
regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In our assessment, this is the best way to address the
critical situation we are in for the good of the economy, the
employees, the riding public and the country," Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
But Garcia did not say how many PAL employees will be laid off.
</P>
<P>
Despite this move to downsize, Garcia gave assurance that
service will remain uninterrupted and that safety is top priority
of the company.
</P>
<P>
He said PAL can still boast of having one of the youngest
fleets in the region since its 3.2 billion U.S. dollars aircraft
modernization program was already half-way through when the
currency turmoil hit the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
PAL launched two years ago the ambitious modernization program
eyeing expanded operations to enable the company to retain its
bloated 14,000-strong workforce.
</P>
<P>
According to Garcia, many other regional carriers have already
been forced to downsize, reduce workforce, slash regional
operations, and delay or cancel orders to buy new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Among those reported to have taken some hard decisions are
Garuda Indonesia, Thai Airways International, South Korea's
Asiana, Cathay Pacific Airways and Vietnam Airlines, he said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review China Credited with Maturing Ability to Regulate Economy by Chen Xin and Qian Yu hong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of a market
economy in 1993, which once posed unparalleled challenges for the
Chinese government, has instead become the best indicator of its
maturing ability to regulate the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the Chinese economy successfully soft-landed from an
overheated situation five years ago, China has achieved high
economic growth and low inflation, with market forces replacing
government planning in playing a leading role in China's economic
life.
</P>
<P>
Economists universally credited the successful economic
regulation by the Chinese government as the key to the nation's
cross-century economic development, saying the government has
perfected its management of the national economy in the past few
years, and made balanced use of the "visible hand" (government
regulation) as well as the "invisible hand" through fostering all
kinds of markets.
</P>
<P>
Instead of turning to the traditional practice of cooling down
the economy immediately at the cost of economic growth in the face
of an overheated economy, the government has primarily focused on
curbing inflation and economic readjustment in the past four
years, while ensuring an adequate growth in the investment and
consumption demand.
</P>
<P>
This way, the economy has been able to keep pressing ahead while
inflation is effectively reined.
</P>
<P>
"The imbalance between the economic scale and structure has
always been a sore point for the Chinese economy, but the
government's efforts to solve the problem have been fruitful in
the past five years," said Liu Shucheng, an economist with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China has since 1993 focused its efforts on
curbing investment scale while increasing effective
supply: economic bubbles in the real estate sector was firmly
squeezed out; the infrastructures sector and basic industries such
as agriculture, transportation, telecommunications and energy, on
the other hand, received intensified government backing.
</P>
<P>
While dealing with temporary problems that kept cropping up in
its economic life, the Chinese government also paid more attention
to establishing the leading role of the market system in economic
management and downplayed the role of administrative means.
</P>
<P>
Economic leverage such as that of prices, taxes, credit,
interest rates and exchange rates came to play a leading role in
the government's economic regulation, with the economic
legislation accelerated and administrative measures also
adequately adopted.
</P>
<P>
"The market-oriented economic means is already playing an
increasingly significant role in macro-economic control in China,
which signals a notable reversal to the traditional practice of
using mainly administrative planning," according to Huang Da, an
economist with People's University of China, and also a member of
the Monetary Policy Committee under the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China unveiled a series of reform measures
concerning taxation, finance, foreign trade, investment and
circulation starting from 1994, which helped it establish the
basic framework of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese economy is still not free from
problems. The lumbering state-owned sector and the massive
lay-offs of workers, for instance, still put great pressure on the
national economy and the whole society.
</P>
<P>
But the accelerated state enterprise reform and the launching
of a "re-employment project" also presage optimism: the Chinese
government is determined to pull the large- and medium-size state
enterprises out of their financial dilemma by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
As Zhang Haoruo, vice-minister of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy has predicted, the nationwide reform of
state-owned enterprises, the banking sector, social
security system and market system is bound to make a breakthrough
by the year 2000, and the long-existing problems stemming from the
planned economy will also basically be solved by then.

The police disclosed here on Tuesday that four persons have been

</P>
<P>
According to the police, the 38-year-old pilot was strangled to
death at her home in central Lagos on January 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Alhaji Abubakar Tsav alleged that Oboh's
security guard, who had been in her service for five years, colluded

strangle her with a rope.
</P>
<P>
The police chief said the assailants then removed valuables,
including foreign currency and electronics, from the house.
</P>

What leads to the discovery of the murder is the capture of Oboh's

BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce
78 million tires in 1998, up 10 percent on 1997, according to
projections by the Ministry of Chemical Industry department in
charge of rubber production.
</P>
<P>
Production levels for radial tires are expected to rise by as
much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Estimates for tire sales are less than optimistic, with
projected demand of 66 million tires representing a mere three
percent rise on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The tire demand for new motor vehicles, including trucks
with a 4-5 ton capacity, buses of all sizes and automobiles, is
expected to remain strong.
</P>
<P>
Replacement tires for heavy-duty trucks, mini-vans and
farm vehicles will also be great demand.
</P>
<P>
Replacement tires are expected to hold at least a 50 percent
market share.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tire manufacturers are expected to overcome export
difficulties resulting from the financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia, the major production base for natural rubber.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rural Enterprises Advance Despite Difficulties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's township enterprises
are expected to overcome difficulties and witness growth rates as
high as 18 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises, which emerged following the introduction
of economic reform and open, have since grown into a mainstay of
the rural economy and a backbone of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, rural enterprises accounted for 60 percent of the
value-added generated by the overall rural economy, and 30 percent
of the nation's GDP.
</P>
<P>
They contributed about half of the national industrial
value-added, 40 percent of the country's export products, and 26
percent of state tax revenues. In addition, rural industry
contributed 38 percent to the net incomes of farmers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had 6,376 medium- to large-sized
rural enterprises and 1,039 rural enterprise conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, however, growth levels for rural
enterprises have slowed in recent years due to both internal and
external factors. For example, the growth rate for 1997 stood at
18 percent, compared to the average annual growth rate of 42
percent in 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
Wan Baorui, vice-minister of Agriculture, pointed out that high
growth rates were possible when the few rural industries in
existence had a low growth base. However, maintaining growth rates
as high as 40 percent has been unrealistic in light of the rapid
pace of development.
</P>
<P>
Rural industry currently faces problems such as diminished
returns and mounting losses, said Wan. Some 15 percent of rural
enterprises suffered losses in 1997, with total losses approaching
60 billion yuan (about 7.23 billion US dollars).

SHENYANG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese self-employed
business people and other private businesses turned in 54 billion
yuan of taxes to the state coffers last year, more than 10 times

self-employed businesses in this northeast China city.
</P>
<P>
Self-employed business people and other forms of private
companies increased their share of taxation in the national total
from 3.9 percent in 1986 to 7 percent last year.
</P>

By the end of last year, registered self-employed people had
reached 28.5 million. They employed 54.42 million people and had
sales revenue of 1.42 trillion yuan, according to statistics.

<P>
He pointed out that factors affecting the economic returns of
related enterprises include small scale production, inadequate
competitive strength, outdated operational mechanisms, redundant
low-level construction, and irrational industrial and product
structures.
</P>
<P>
Extensive modes of management, heavy debt burdens and
increasing costs also represent disadvantageous factors, according
to Wan.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts point out that increasingly fierce competition,
inadequate funding, reduced preferential terms and various
"external factors" has also obstructed the further growth of rural
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the financial crisis, affecting many East and
Southeast Asian nations, especially currency devaluations in many
countries, has reduced orders for rural enterprises, and has in
turn placed them in a disadvantageous position in terms of exports.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the development of rural industry is directly
linked to the realization of goals for national economic and
social development prompted the Chinese government to adopt
vigorous measures to solve related problems, said Wan.
</P>
<P>
One move centered on improving mechanisms by introducing the
shareholding and cooperative shareholding systems, conglomerates,
leases, mergers and outright acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises have also be asked to readjust their
industrial and product structures in line with market demand,
resources and state policies.

<HEADLINE> SKorea's New President Calls for Comprehensive Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, who took the oath
of the president of South Korea on Wednesday, said his country
must carry out comprehensive reform to overcome the most serious
national crisis since the Korean War in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"This country is undergoing a time of frustration and crisis in
all areas, including politics, economy, society, diplomacy,
national security and South-North relations," Kim said in his
inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
The political reform has to come first of all, said Kim,
stressing that the biggest task his government to face is to
overcome the crisis and make the economy take off once again.
</P>
<P>
The new president called on South Koreans to shed sweat and
tears as consumer prices and unemployment will rise this year
while per capita income will plunge with an increasing number of
companies going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
"We can do it. The story of our success from the ruins of the
Korean War proves it," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the opposition, the majority in the
291-seat-parliament, to cooperate with him. "We will never be able
to overcome today's crisis without cooperation from you," Kim told
the law makers.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Grand National Party is to boycott Wednesday
afternoon's parliament session to block the passing of a bill
appointing Kim Jong-pil as prime minister, saying that he is an
old-timer unfit for a post of steering the nation into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, 72, once served as prime minister under
President Park Chung-hee in 1971-75.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Urged to Expand Cooperation with Western Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese foreign trade
official has asked Chinese businesses to actively explore markets
in Western Europe and to expand economic and technological
cooperation with their counterparts in Western Europe, according
to the International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun
Zhenyu told a seminar on the Western European market that by
June of 1997 China had imported 5,400 technological projects from
Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
Sun proposed that Chinese businesses should increase the export
of traditional commodities and open more markets by further
improving quality, the Beijing-based newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, traditional commodities such as
electronics, machinery, textiles, garments and shoes accounted for
60 percent of China's exports to Western Europe last year, which
totaled 25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sun added that processing trade with Western Europe should be
increased.
</P>
<P>
He said China should continue to introduce funds from Western
Europe and import technology in such fields as nuclear energy,
aviation and space, automobiles, electronics, instruments,
chemical industry, environmental protection and agriculture
because Western European countries are more open to technology
transfers.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that the cooperation between
medium-sized and small enterprises of China and Western Europe
should be expanded.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Plane Hijacker Subdued, Passengers Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A plane hijacker who
kidnaped a jetliner of the Turkish Airlines (THY) was brought
under control at 01:45 Wednesday local time (23:45 GMT Tuesday)
and all passengers and crew members were unscathed, local media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Dag, an 31-year-old Islamist from Karatash County,
Adana Province in southern Turkey, was subdued by three male
passengers while he was ordering all alcoholic drink be
collected.
</P>
<P>
Then security forces boarded the plane and detained the
hijacker who was suspected of a psychopath.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the bomb in his hand is a fake before
I decided to jump on him," said a lawyer who was one of
the three passengers.
</P>
<P>
The THY aircraft was hijacked at about 21:00 local time
Tuesday soon after it took off from an airport in Adana for
the capital Ankara. The hijacker ordered that the plane fly to
Iran, saying he had a powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
The jet, with 63 passengers and five crew members on
board, then flew to the south and was forced to land at
the Diyarbakir Airport at 22:30 local time as a result of
the shortage of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish special forces and police rushed to the airport and
surrounded the plane.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker demanded that the authorities provide another
plane to fly him to Iran and negotiations lasted until he
was checked by passengers.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the hijacker released over 30 passengers in
two groups. Some of them who felt sick were sent to the
nearby hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the hijacker had a mental problem and
had been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for theft, adding
that his action had no political background.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker's wife, Fidam Dag and his brother-in-law were
also detained by police, reports said, without saying whether
the two were on board when the hijacking took place.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Another 25 prisoners on
Tuesday escaped from police custody in five separate incidents
around South Africa, bringing to 437 the number of escapes this
year, local daily the Star reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Police Commissioner George Fivaz, escapes in 1997
amounted to 0.3 percent of the 1.4 million people detained by
police that year.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of policemen facing charges relating to
escapes had doubled over the past year. These security people
ususally are charged with negligence.
</P>
<P>
However, Correctional Services spokesman Barry Eksteen said
recently that his department was at present experiencing a 50
percent drop in reported prison escapes.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past his department averaged about 100
escapes per month from the 142,000 prison population in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But following the installation of new electric fences at
prisons, Fivaz said, the department had kept the number of
escapes down below 50 per month since last December.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Real Estate Market Decline First Since 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Real estate investment in
Shanghai, China's largest commercial center, had its first decline
in 1997 since the start of the 1990s as a result of the municipal
government's macro-control and a low-tune market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's real estate market had been growing rapidly since
the early '90s. The 4.2 percent fall in total real estate
investment of 62.9 billion yuan last year indicated that the
market is undergoing an adjustment period.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that investment in real estate market
slumped 53 percent compared with the previous year to 3.1 billion
yuan. An area of 3.7 million square meters of land was allocated
for construction, down 35.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite a sluggish trade in office and commercial buildings,
residential housing sustained its growth with the sales of
individual housing increasing 7.2 percent to spur the rate of
private housing to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the sales of commercial housing made a slight rise as
some 6.1 million square meters of floor space were sold last year,
the occupancy rate was still low. So far, nine million square
meters of floor space remained idle.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo For Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat arrived here early Wednesday morning
from Brussels on a brief visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to meet with President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa later in the day to discuss the latest
developments in the stalled Middle East peace process, the
U.N.-Iraq deal, and a number of issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
His visit came hot after U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi government clinched the agreement on resolving the arms
inspection crisis in Iraq peacefully, averting a possible military
confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
For more than three months, the tensions in the Gulf has
eclipsed the Mideast peace process, which has deadlocked since
last March by Israel's construction of new settlements and dragged
near collapse by its overdue redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Monday that after the implementation of the
Iraq-U.N. deal, the attention had to be shifted to reviving the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has hoped the Iraq-U.N. deal would serve as a good
example for the world community to force Israeli compliance with
U.N. resolutions that demand its withdrawal from occupied Arab
lands. It also said the U.S. can "recover its credit" only by
being a fair broker in the future peace-making.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered before the U.N. conference on boosting
rights of Palestinian people in Brussels Tuesday, Arafat welcomed
the peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Peace efforts should continue, all U.N. Security Council
resolutions should be implemented and Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity must be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his people were firmly sticking to the peace as a
strategic option and urged the U.S., the European countries,
Russia, Japan, China, the Arabs and Muslims to work to propel the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty long years have lapsed since the Palestinian
tragedy. The U.N. and the world community must work to remove the
sufferings of the Palestinian people," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The largest delegation of
British publishers and literary agents arrived here Sunday for a
10-day visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The 21-member delegation includes every type of publisher --
fiction, non-fiction, children's, reference, academic, business
and English language teaching, according to a news conference held
today by the British Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We have a special responsibility for negotiating the transfer
of copyrights, cooperative publishing and retail training," said
Graham Greene, head of the delegation who led the first Publishers
Association mission to China in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The British publishing industry has an output of 100,000 new
titles a year, and is the world's largest exporter of books.
</P>
<P>
China has translated a great many British books of various
types since its reform and opening-up began in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The most important change in the past 20 years was China's
membership in the International Copyright Convention, which
provided a basis coming together, said Greene, who is also
Vice-President of the Great Britain China Center.
</P>
<P>
He added that China "is a huge book market."
</P>
<P>
The visit is a part of the "Britain in China" campaign launched
a month ago by the British Embassy and several other institutes
whose aim is to enhance the cultural, economic and political
interchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also visit Shanghai and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> 74 Coup Suspects in Dock in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 74 coup suspects
accused of treason appeared Tuesday in a Lusaka Magistrate's
Court for mention, state-owned Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 74 people, including Dean Mung'omba, President of Zambia
Democratic Congress, and 73 soldiers, appeared briefly before
principal resident magistrate Getrude Chawatama for mention amid
tight security at the court.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were scheduled to appear in court at 14:00 hours
but were brought in after 16:00 hours local time due to
unexplained reasons. Therefore Chawatama said she could not read
out the charges to individual suspecws because of the delay,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Chawatama adjourned the case to Wednesday and cautioned
divisional prosecutions officer to ensure that all the suspects
are brought to court on time.
</P>
<P>
The number of coup suspects so far charged with treason is 76,
including former president and opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda
who is now under house arrest, and Nakatindi Wina, a parliament
member and National Chairperson for Women Affairs of the ruling
Movement for Multi-Party Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Last October, a group of Zambian army soldiers staged a
military coup to topple the constitutional government. But the
coup was crashed in several hours and the subsequent arrests
under a state of emergency have so far reached 94.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the suspects have been tried nearly four
months since the foiled coup, perhaps due to the time consuming
police investigations into the event.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Joint Venture Made False Claims on Equipment Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-u.s. joint venture
has been found deliberately reporting a much higher value of its
imported equipment than its actual value in East China's Zhejiang
Province, the provincial bureau for import and export commodities
inspection has reported.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture claimed the value of its imported equipment
at 3.22 million U.S. dollars when its actual price was 1.42
million U.S. dollars, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, founded in January of 1995, was supposed to
have the latest equipment and technology available in the United
States for the production of multi-layered capacitors according to
its contract between the two partners, said an official from the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, the bureau found that some key
equipment was used goods.
</P>
<P>
The bureau sent inspectors to the United States and found out
the huge disparity in the local market price and the American
partner's claimed price to its Chinese partner in the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
The outdated equipment can only enable the joint venture to
produce 60 million capacitors, instead of the planned 240 million,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Industrial Output Growth Down in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Signalling continued
economic slowdown, Israel's industrial production rose only 2
percent in 1997, the lowest growth rate in seven years, a report
published Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted a report of the Central
Bureau of Statistics (CBS) as saying this is the latest in a
string of economic indicators that shows the deepening slowdown in
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995, Israeli industrial production grew at an
average annual 6.8 percent and by 5.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1997, production grew at a monthly 3
percent in annualized terms, but that figure shrank to 1 percent
in the second half, the CBS report said.
</P>
<P>
The general trend was offset to some extent by the 17 percent
growth in the field of electronic components, 80 percent of which
was for export. Electronic communications production increased 12
percent in 1997, an industry in which 50 percent of volume is
exported. The production of food, drinks and tobacco increased by
3 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of building materials, chemicals,
rubber and plastics experienced zero growth, while production of
metals and machines declined by 1 percent. The largest decline
was in the textiles, clothing and leather goods sector, which was
down 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contradicting the government forecast of a 3 percent
economic growth in 1998, Israeli Manufacturers Association said in
a report that it expected the economy to grow only 1.8 percent
this year and industry by only 1 percent, the worst in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The association also estimated that the annual growth in
industrial exports would ease to 8 percent this year, compared to
13 percent in 1997. The consumption of consumer products, not
including vehicles, is expected to grow 2 percent, while
investment in construction to drop by about 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Young Rabbit Breeder from Shandong Province Elected NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Wang Yumei seemed excited and
proud that she, a rabbit breeder and only 24 years old, could be
elected a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
the highest body of state power in China.
</P>
<P>
"In the fine circumstances of the country's reform and
opening-up, young people can accomplish something as long as they
aim high and have a pioneering spirit," said Wang, who is
the youngest deputy to the Ninth NPC from east China's Shandong
Province attending the congress's first annual session in March.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang's acquaintances, she was smart and
adventurous even when only a little girl. And she has become a
legend in the eyes of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a poor rural family, Wang was not able to enter
college after graduating from middle school. Thanks to a state
policy of economic assistance, however, she obtained a loan of
100,000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars) to establish a rabbit farm.
</P>
<P>
Then she devoted herself to experiments, poring over breeding
techniques and marketing strategies. Her farm has become the
largest rabbit-raising center in China with fixed assets of 30
million yuan. As a result, Wang had been selected as one of the 10
outstanding young farmers of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is the market economy and my firm determination that has
brought about my success," the gentle and quiet young lady said
with an air of confidence. "Relying on the assistance of the
government and my own efforts, I managed to surmount the
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Wang serves as vice-chairwoman of the China branch of the
world's rabbit-raising association and president of a large
rabbit-growers group in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, her company bought 4,000 well-bred stud
rabbits from France for 3,000 yuan each to improve rabbit breeds
in China.
</P>
<P>
And, not long ago, she leased land in her home county of Jiyang
to establish a science garden for raising rabbits. With the
support of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth
League, Wang was able to obtain 15 million yuan in low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
To help more farmers prosper, Wang gave more than 60 training
courses on rabbit-raising in Shandong and other places. Across the
country, more than 40,000 rural households were beneficiaries of
her expertise.
</P>
<P>
"At least, I want to show that young people, women in
particular, can have their dreams come true with enterprise and
hard work," she said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Scores Progress in Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province undertook 59 key projects and completed 20 in 1997, in a
move to improve its infrastructure and basic industries.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province, an economic power house in China, spent
17.1 billion yuan last year, or 33 percent more than the previous
year, on the projects including a railway line, an airport, and
expansion of a power plant, said an official with the provincial
office in charge of key projects construction.
</P>
<P>
Of the completed projects, the 251-km Jinhua-Wenzhou Railway
went into operation last August after five years of
construction. Jointly funded by a Hong Kong company and Zhejiang
Province, it is the first railway line in China built with
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhujiajian Airport, based on the Zhoushan Island, the largest
of the Zhoushan Islands, Zhejiang Province, also opened to
traffic in August with eight routes to major Chinese cities
including Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The airport, which currently has 25 flights a week, covers
200 hectares and has a 2,500-meter-long and 45-meter-wide
runway which can accommodate Boeing-737s and MD-82 jets.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-phase construction of the Taizhou Power Plant
involved the installation of two generators with a combined
capacity of 660,000 kilowatts. Completed at the end of last year,
the expansion brought the plant's generating capacity to 1.41
million kw and eased the power shortages in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Urged to Expand Cooperation with Western Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese foreign trade
official has asked Chinese businesses to actively explore markets
in Western Europe and to expand economic and technological
cooperation with their counterparts in Western Europe, according
to the International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun
Zhenyu told a seminar on the Western European market that by
June of 1997 China had imported 5,400 technological projects from
Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
Sun proposed that Chinese businesses should increase the
importation of traditional commodities and open more markets by
further improving quality, the Beijing-based newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, traditional commodities such as
electronics, machinery, textiles, garments and shoes accounted for
60 percent of China's exports to Western Europe last year, which
totaled 25 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sun added that processing trade with Western Europe should be
increased.
</P>
<P>
He said China should continue to introduce funds from Western
Europe and import technology in such fields as nuclear energy,
aviation and space, automobiles, electronics, instruments,
chemical industry, environmental protection and agriculture
because Western European countries are more open to technology
transfers.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that the cooperation between
medium-sized and small enterprises of China and Western Europe
should be expanded.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker in Sydney Wednesday, following remarks by a federal
Treasury official on the impact of the Asian economic crisis on
domestic growth.
</P>
<P>
Treasury First Assistant Secretary (economic division) Mike
Callaghan would not quantify the impact of the Asian downturn, but
he noted that "it's likely to have a significant impact."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 66.38 U.S. cents, down from
66.62 in Sydney late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We had a strong move down on the back of the comment about how
Australia will be affected by Asia, and there was some genuine
corporate selling interest as well," said John Reedyk, head of
foreign exchange sales of ANZ Investment Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The federal official told the Australian Senate estimates
committee that the government's mid-year economic and fiscal
outlook released in December noted that the impact of events in
Asia on the Australian economy is likely to be significant.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Reedyk said the economic fundamentals and Asia
suggested the Australian dollar should head lower.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian currency ended in Sydney also at
84.21 Japanese yen, from 85.39 previously, and at 1.1852 Deutsche
marks, from 1.1969.

<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned
enterprises rebounded from a slump in 1996 and witnessed rising
foreign trade momentum in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of International Business Daily reported that
state-owned enterprises registered a 1997 total foreign trade
volume of 163.6 billion US dollars, up 12.7 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
China joined the list of world's top ten trading countries in
1997, with state-owned enterprises accounting for over 50 percent
of the total 325 billion US dollar trade volume.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises maintained an annual trade increase
rate of over 10 percent between 1992-1995. However, the total
trade volume for 1996 dropped by 12.9 percent compared to the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Expanded Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged enterprises to overcome difficulties and pursue increased
exports in order to reach this year's foreign trade target of 345
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent meeting sponsored by the Chinese Medical
and Health Products Import and Export Company, Deputy Foreign
Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu pointed out the difficulties of the task
in light of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the crisis on China's foreign trade due to the
average 30 percent currency devaluations in neighboring countries
appeared slightly in January, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
In addition, trade enterprises face growing pressure from
increasing competition resulting from the deepening of reform and
efforts to accelerate China's re-entry in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's economy grew 8.8 percent in 1997, with 2.1 percentage
points of the total attributed to growth in export. This year's
target for economic growth has been set at 8 percent, with exports
expected to remain a stimulating role, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
China joined the ranks of world's top ten traders in 1997, with
a total trade volume of 325 billion dollars including exports of
182.7 billion dollars.

NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- India has welcomed the
agreement signed between United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz to defuse the
Gulf crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An official release said on Tuesday evening that India hoped
the agreement would be endorsed by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"India has always supported the resolution of the crisis
through peaceful means. In our view, (the) use of force would be
counter-productive and would not meet the objectives to which the
U.N. is committed in Iraq," the release said.
</P>
<P>
This stand had been emphasized by Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral in his letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton and leaders of
the other four permanent members of the Security Council as well
as to Annan, it said.

India is watching the developments closely, the release added.

<HEADLINE> More People in Xinjiang Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has eliminated poverty for another 420,000
people in the past year, more than one third of the region's total
population under poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw more people shake off poverty since the region
began to launch aid-the-poor project a dozen years ago, local
officials said. More than 90,000 poverty-stricken rural households
in Xinjiang gained an average per capita net income of over 1,000
yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
People with an annual income of less than 500 yuan (about 60 US
dollars) are listed as living below the poverty line in China.
</P>
<P>
The land-locked region, with a total population of 16 million,
is one of the country's areas where more poverty-stricken people live
owing to harsh natural conditions. Today, it still has some
700,000 people who got less than 650 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Like elsewhere in China, the region vows to help all people out
of poverty by the year 2000, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, local governments at various levels made
painstaking efforts which include pooling more funds, training
farmers and herdsmen and reducing and exempting taxes levied on
poverty-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region put a total of one billion yuan in
launching over 800 aid-the-poor projects which cover agriculture,
animal husbandry, foresty and processing industry.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two passenger vans collided
head-on Tuesday on the Kitale-Webuye road in western Kenya,
killing at least 24 people, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen passengers died instantly and six on arrival at the
Kitale District Hospital. Some of the injured are in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead on the spot were the drivers of the two
vehicles and twins aged 12 who were traveling with their mother.
</P>
<P>
So far only five people surely survived the clash.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses at the scene said a fast-moving Nissan van
stopped abruptly at a trading center to pick a passenger and the
ill-fated driver behind it could not break in time to avoid a
collision.
</P>
<P>
He swerved to avoid ramming into the Nissan van before his
vehicle collided head-on with an on-coming public service
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Police said that just before the accident which occurred at
about 10:30 a.m., one of the drivers had been cautioned by a
lorry driver not to overtake other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people died at the same spot last year when a truck
carrying cattle traders plunged into River Kabuyefwe.

<HEADLINE> 731 Singaporeans Reported to Be HIV Infected by End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of HIV infection
cases has been increasing in Singapore, as a total of 731
Singaporeans were reported to be HIV infected as at 31 December
1997, the Ministry of Health said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said that of the 731 infected, 357 were
asymptomatic carriers, while 133 had full-blown AIDS and the other
241 had died.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry noted that the number of reported cases of HIV
infection has increased in the island country since the first HIV
infected Singaporean was detected in May 1985 from two cases in
1985 to 139 cases in 1996 and 173 cases for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sexual transmission remained the main mode of transmission
among Singaporeans, as about 96 percent, or 702 out of 731, of all
HIV infected Singaporeans contracted their infection through
sexual transmission, it said.
</P>
<P>
Heterosexual transmission was the most common mode of HIV
transmission among Singaporeans since 1991, as most of these cases
contracted the infection through casual sex and sex with
prostitutes in Singapore and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the figures, the Ministry of Health reiterated its
advice that the only way to avoid AIDS is to remain faithful to
one's spouse and to avoid casual sex and sex with prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also reminded those who are at risk of being
infected with the HIV virus not to donate blood, but to see their
doctors for HIV screening. All females who are expecting are also
encouraged to go for HIV screening so that measures to prevent
perinatal transmission to the infant could be taken early for
those who are found to be HIV infected.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Backs Dayton Peace Accord, Says Tudjman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 24 (Xinhua) -- President Franjo Tudjman said
Tuesday that Croatia firmly supports the Dayton Peace Accord and
will do everything for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said this when meeting with international community
High Representative Carlos Westendorp, U.N. Secretary General's
Special Representative and Coordinator of U.N. Operations in
Bosnia Elisabeth Rehn, and Robert Barrey, head of the OSCE mission
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told a press conference
that during that meeting, Tudjman talked about relations between
the Croat-Muslim Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman was quoted as saying that Croatia hopes to normalize
ties with the Bosnian Serb Republic and open borders with it
again. Croatia also wants to hold talks with Serbs on issues of
refugee repatriation, property, economic cooperation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
According to Tudjman, only 400,000 Croatians now remain in
Bosnia-Herzegovina after 280,000 Croatians left Bosnia and 180,000
Croatians left the Bosnian Serb Republic during the war. The
refugee problem has blocked the implementation of the Dayton
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the international representatives expressed
their worries about the slow implementation of the accord and about
the reluctance of Croatian leaders in some areas to carry it out.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Okays Officials' Promotion Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has approved the policy of promoting government
officials, which emphasised training as the fundamental criterion
for promotion, press report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The policy made it clear that without completion of the
requisite training course or courses, none will be eligible for
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Marks of the training, merit and seniority in combined list
will be considered while disposing of the cases of promotion,
according to the policy.
</P>
<P>
Existing system of calculating the seniority on the basis of
the Public Service Commission (PSC) examination result, at the
entry point, will remain.
</P>
<P>
It was approved in the new promotion policy that the gradation
list at the entry point would be made considering the results of
PSC examination and the foundation training course.
</P>
<P>
"Extensive training is the pre-requisite for an efficient
administration but it was neglected so far, and for this reason
training has been made compulsory in the new promotion policy,"
Cabinet Secretary Ataul Haque said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Economy Seen to Grow by 2.5-4.5% in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's gross domestic
product (GDP) is projected to grow by 2.5 to 4.5 percent in 1998,
the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in the 1997 Annual
Economic Survey of Singapore which was released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The MTI said in the survey that the regional economic outlook
had deteriorated significantly since November 1997 when MTI made
its preliminary growth forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The Singapore economy will now be more seriously affected as
the regional turmoil runs its course," it said, adding, however,
that continued growth in the United States and the European Union
(EU) will sustain demand for Singapore's exports.
</P>
<P>
The ministry noted that forward-looking indicators like the
Composite Leading Index and business expectations have turned
negative, whereas the varying business sentiments indicated that
the impact of the slowdown in 1998 will not be evenly felt across
the sectors.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicted that businesses that sell final products
to the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development) markets, with revenues denominated in U.S. dollars,
should remain relatively healthy despite the regional slowdown.
However, those servicing the Southeast Asian region would be more
badly hit.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is expected to remain healthy, with
electronics demand supported by growth in the U.S. and the EU.
However, the hub-related services will be affected by the regional
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade is also expected to remain sluggish due to weak
consumer sentiments and declines in visitor arrivals. Construction
growth will be moderate but is likely to remain healthy with key
support from the public sector projects, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the financial turmoil has to run its course, the
ministry said that there is still uncertainty over the regional
political and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
If the various reform packages are effectively implemented and
investor confidence is restored, regional economic growth would
recover and Singapore in turn would benefit from the pickup in
economic activity, it said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Newspapers Hail Baghdad Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The agreement reached
between the United Nations and Iraq has come as a great relief the
world over, major English-language dailies in Nepal said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post said in an editorial that cautious response
from the United States and Britain notwithstanding, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's success in persuading Iraq to agree
to the inspection of sites in Iraq suspected of storing banned
weaponry must be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
A war would not only have meant unnecessary destruction and
loss of lives, but also have had a worldwide economic impact, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the 1990 Gulf war, this time around, the military
option did not receive support from either the Arab world or most
members of the U.N. Security Council or even many U.S. allies, the
editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that still Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would do
well to recognize that compliance to the U.N. resolution on
inspection is the key to a new chapter for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Rising Nepal commented that the role of the U.N. in
defusing the crisis merits praise as it has been able to avert a
possible conflict in the area to the detriment of all.
</P>
<P>
The comment said not only for Nepal but the world over, the
agreement between the U.N. and Iraq has been widely welcomed
because it is for peace.

<HEADLINE> Canada Balances Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada presented its first
balanced budget since 1970 due to years of austerity, said Finance
Minister Paul Martin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will balance the budget this year," Martin said Tuesday
while tabling his fifth budget in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
With the unveiling of the budget, Canada also became the first
in the Group of Seven industrial countries to eliminate a budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Martin predicted that his country will balance the budget next
year, and the year after that. If that should happen, it would be
the first time in almost 50 years that Canada has balanced its
budget three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Most economists forecast that Canada's budget balance for this
fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 1998, will turn out to be a
surplus of 2 billion dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Canada had a budget deficit of 8.9 billion dollars (6.2 billion
U.S. dollars) last year and 42 billion dollars (about 30 billion
U.S. dollars)in 1993 when Martin's ruling Liberal Party came to
power.
</P>
<P>
To sooth Canadians who have endured four years of belt
tightening, Martin promised to offer 10.9 billion dollars (7.6
billion U.S. dollars) in spending on education and health care
over four years, and 7.2 billion dollars (5 billion U.S. dollars)
in tax relief for middle and low-income Canadians over the next
three years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military to Intervene in MILF-MNLF Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military will
intervene in any armed conflict between a former Muslim rebel
group and its breakaway separatist faction in the southern
Philippine island of Mindanao, local press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Army chief Lt. Gen. Raul Urgello was quoted as saying on
Tuesday that the military will intervene in conflicts between the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a former major rebel group,
and its breakaway faction Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to
resolve their disputes in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Urgello said the military have to intervene in "any general
form of disorder" as mandated by law.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not recognize the authority of a joint MNLF-MILF
task force on reconciliation to resolve the disputes on its own.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the MNLF and the MILF were involved in some
skirmishes in some towns in central Mindanao, killing dozens of
people and displacing hundreds of villagers.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF and the MILF created the reconciliation task force to
resolve their conflict. They agreed to ask the military for
assistance only when their own efforts have failed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, MILF Vice Chairman Ghazali Jaafar said military
intervention in the internal affairs of the MNLF and the MILF
would only make the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest anti-government force in the
Philippines with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a peace deal with the government in September
1996, ending decades of war in the southern Philippines. But the
MNLF has not yet been fully disarmed and its integration into the
country's armed forces and police force has been slow due to lack
of funds.

<HEADLINE> Thais to Pay More for Gasoline, Luxury Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The people in Thailand will
have to pay more for gasoline and imported luxuries as the
government decided to raise gasoline tax and import duty on luxury
goods, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The package, adopted at a cabinet meeting Tuesday and put into
effect at mid-day Wednesday, will raise the tax on gasoline by 1
baht (2 U.S. cents) a liter.
</P>
<P>
Included in the package, which is in line with the requirements
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans, are also increases
in import duty on beer, wines and spirits, tobacco, cosmetics,
perfumes, leather goods, crystal ware and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet at the meeting also decided to transfer
responsibility for collecting land sale tax from the Revenue
Department to the Land Department to achieve higher efficiency and
to increase the charge for car registration.
</P>
<P>
The whole package is expected to generate some 9 billion baht
(210 million U.S. dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
After the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
the rises have been calculated to cause the least pain to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
He said the country is facing its most testing time during the
second quarter of the fiscal year and Tuesday's move would help
overcome the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision on gasoline tax increase triggered
comprehensive discussions here.
</P>
<P>
Most business people backed the decision while some political
groups and workers vowed to rally against it.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala's business
sector Tuesday rejected an eventual signing of a free trade
agreement with Mexico, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
President of the country's Coordinating Committee for
Agriculture, Industry and Finance Associations Juan Botran said
that the signing should not be rushed before negotiations with
all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that businessmen from the "North Triangle" of
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador agreed on the necessity of a
good negotiation with Mexico as a pre-requisite to the signing of
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said that
because of the delayed negotiations between Mexico and the North
Triangle, Guatemala will start direct negotiations with Mexico to
reach a short-term trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Enrique Lacs, coordinator of the Guatemala Business Commission
for International Negotiations, also voiced his concern that "a
direct dialogue could ruin the joint achievements."

SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Kim Dae-jung took
the presidential oath here Wednesday, vowing to do his utmost to
revive the crisis-hit economy.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Kim pledged to push for reforms of
the country's unwieldy and family-controlled companies despite
their procrastination and objections.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way for corporations to survive and for our
economy to make another leap forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that his new government will guarantee the
independence of business firms. But, he added, it will sternly
demand that they make efforts for self-reform.
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Korea was forced to ask the largest ever
bailout of 57 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to avoid defaulting on a foreign debt of 153 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 38,000 people attended the inauguration ceremony which
took place on a plaza in front of the National Assembly building.
</P>
<P>
Kim was elected president last December after decades battling
strong-man rule.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows By 7.8 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew
by 7.8 percent in 1997, despite the regional financial turmoil in
the second half of the year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
(MTI) announced on Wednesday when releasing the 1997 Annual
Economic Survey of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It said the 7.8-percent growth was faster than the 6.9 percent
in 1996 and the diversified structure of Singapore's economy
helped support the growth.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that growth momentum was uneven during the
year, being influenced by both the pickup in the global
electronics demand and the regional economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that in 1997, the manufacturing sector
recovered somewhat, expanding by 4.3 percent after slowing to 3
percent in 1996. Growth was supported by strong capacity expansion
in the chemical industry and a recovery in the semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry was, however, affected by excess
capacity in the disk drive segment and negative growth in the
personal computer segment, it said.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business sector showed a strong performance,
with a growth of 11 percent in 1997. The survey showed that within
financial services, robust offshore credit expansion and
volatility in foreign exchange and stock markets throughout most
of the year supported growth.
</P>
<P>
The commerce sector expanded by a moderate healthy 5.8 percent,
helped by growth in intra-firm trade in intermediate goods and
strong retail demand in the earlier part of the year.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sector grew by 9.2 percent, up
from 8.1 percent in 1996, while the strong growth of the
construction sector moderated in 1997, reflecting slower increase
in contracts awarded over the last one and two years.
Nevertheless, the sector continued to register the strongest
performance among the sectors, expanding by a robust 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said growth in the sector was underpinned by
strong public-sector demand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Private construction activity was also healthy, benefiting from
the stream of properties launched prior to the May 1996 property
curbs.

BELGRADE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of the Bosnian
Serb Republic Milorad Dodik said Tuesday that full compliance with

MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that major financial tasks for Russia
this year are to lower the inflation rate, reduce budget expenses

Chernomyrdin told a meeting of the Central Bank of Russia that

</P>
<P>
He hoped the parliament would adopt a balanced budget during
its fourth reading in March in order to avoid reduction of
spending during implementation.

Chernomyrdin noted that the bank's loan rate should drop to 14
-16 percent, and small banks should be merged so as to raise bank
credibility and bring a larger money flow into production fields.

<HEADLINE> China Works out Metallurgical Restructuring Objectives for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China expects to raise the
combined production volume of its four major iron and steel groups
-- Baoshan, Wuhan, Anshan and Capital Groups -- to 40 percent of
the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
The centralization of China's metallurgical industry is one of
its restructuring objectives for 2000.
</P>
<P>
The industry plans to readjust product structure and improve
quality so that it can control 95 percent of the domestic market
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The market share of domestically made products is 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, employment directly involved in iron and steel
production will be reduced to 600,000 from the current 1.3
million. Non-iron-and-steel revenue will account for 30 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years all open furnaces in the industry will
be removed. The ratio of continuous casting is expected to reach
80 percent, 20 percent more than the present level.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive energy consumption for the production of one
ton of steel will be lowered to 1.286 tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
To realize these objectives, according to an official with the
ministry, it will encourage the use of overseas funds and
technology in manufacturing high-tech and high value-added
products.

MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A large forest fire was
reported to have engulfed hundreds of hectares of virgin forests
in the mountain ranges on a central Philippine island, local press
reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fire was monitored to have been raging since Sunday night
at Mt. Kadangyasan near Baco Town, Oriental Mindoro Province and
continuing to spread to other thickly-forested areas in the
province, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Mindoro provincial disaster coordinating council
reported that thick smoke billowed as high as 4,000 feet (about
1,300 meters) above sea level.
</P>
<P>
A military helicopter dispatched to the fire site to monitor
the blaze and assess the situation was forced to return
immediately due to poor visibility caused by thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
The local police have already established advanced command
posts and identified evacuation centers to assist villagers in
Baco Town, who are expected to be affected by the fire.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Photos Exemplify Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two photographs sitting on the
desk of Wang Jiren, Party secretary for the Shanxi Provincial Coal
Department, exemplify the new ideas of reform and always remind
him of his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
One photo shows Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), and Wang discussing operations as they tour
a mine in a pit locomotive. The other photo captures a cordial
meeting between Wang and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
Wang worked as a miner for more than 30 years, and later served
as director of the Yungang Mine and director of the Fenxi Mining
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Datong Mining Administration was the first state-owned
enterprise Jiang visited after assuming his post as general
secretary. Jiang visited the mine on January 18, 1990, and urged
Wang and other mining officials to concentrate on production
safety.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji toured the Yungang Coal Mine on May 21, 1992, and
called for dispersing redundant miners to develop the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi province, a leading coal producer in north China,
produced 330 million tons of raw coal in 1997. Nonetheless, the
province still shoulders burdens related to obsolete equipment and
inefficient production management.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress, drew
great inspiration from the visits and the insightful directions of
both Jiang and Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the province will construct a number of coal
processing and building materials plants during 1998. He said high
quality coal will be shipped to other provinces, while lower
quality products will be used as construction raw materials in
related production areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi also plans to establish three enterprise groups in order
to strengthen its competitiveness on both the domestic and
international market.

<P>
SOFIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said his country will "actively support Bulgaria's bid to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the
European Union (EU)."
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who visited Bulgaria between February 23-24, said
Tuesday during a meeting with his Bulgarian counterpart Ivan
Kostov that Italy's strategy on the eastward expansion of the NATO

Europe during the enlargement. Italy will not discriminate any
country during the expansion, he added.

As a member of the NATO and the EU, Italy has recently showed
great interest in developing economic and military relations with
Southeast European countries, such as Bulgaria, Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two prime ministers discussed the issue
of building the 8th Europe-Asia corridor, which will link Italy

<HEADLINE> More Inland Chinese Residents Visiting Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
inland Chinese provinces and regions replaced Japan as the largest
source of tourists to Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Beijing Office of
the Hong Kong Tourism Association, about 2.3 million people from
inland Chinese provinces and regions visited Hong Kong last year,
accounting for 22 percent of the total number of tourists to the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in the year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourism Association opened the office in Beijing
last year to promote Hong Kong tours among inland Chinese people
residents. It plans to open another office in Shanghai this year,
said B.Y. Wong, chief representative of the association's Beijing
office.
</P>
<P>
Most inland people are chiefly interested in shopping during
their stay in Hong Kong, and inland tourists are very important to
Hong Hong's tourism industry, which witnessed a negative growth
last year, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3 million inland tourists spent a total of 15.58 billion
Hong Kong dollars in the SAR last year, accounting for 22.3
percent of its total tourism income.
</P>
<P>
Wong expressed confidence that Hong Kong's tourism industry
will rebound this year, partially as a result of the increasing
number of tourists from inland provinces.

<HEADLINE> Senior Moslem Works for Ethnic Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Weizong is well known in
this capital of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region for his efforts
to foster good relations between the Hui (Moslem) and Han people,
and that is the reason he was elected a deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Hong, 58, serves as vice-chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and vice-chairman of the region's Islamic
Association.
</P>
<P>
Both Hong's grandfather and father were local Islamic
leaders. Hong Weizong has a scroll at home which was presented to
his grandfather by the Chinese Red Army in 1936, during the Long
March led by the late Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Together with some other young ethnic-minority people from
northwest China, Hong went to Beijing at the age of 16 and
listened to the instructions of the late Chinese Premier Zhou
Enlai on ethnic relations. The People's Republic of China had just
been founded then.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1983 relations between the Han and Hui people
in two villages in Hong's home county of Tongxin were strained
because of land disputes. Hong went from household to household
explaining the importance of ethnic unity. In the end, the
villagers discarded their hatred and resumed their friendship.
</P>
<P>
"A nation with a low educational level is one without hope," Hong
always says.
</P>
<P>
In the southern mountainous areas of Ningxia, mainly inhabited
by people of the Hui ethnic group, girl school drop-outs used to
be a headache for local officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 a council for promoting education among Hui people was
set up in Tongxin County at Hong's proposal, then vice-chairman
of the county committee of the CPPCC. The council was the first
non-governmental educational organization in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition of his family, Hong used his own timber
and bricks to construct seven classrooms and offices, and spent
40,000 yuan -- a considerable sum at that time -- of his own savings to
buy desks and chairs for the first middle school in Tongxin County
for Hui girls.
</P>
<P>
Now the school accommodates 1,000 students, 20 percent of whom
are girls of the Han nationality.
</P>
<P>
For these outstanding contributions, Hong has been cited
twice by the State Council as an outstanding figure in promoting
ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to see that, under the state policy of
regional autonomy, the 1.76 million Huis, who account for
one-sixth of country's Moslems, are living happy lives like their
Han compatriots, with their political status guaranteed and their
religious beliefs and folk customs respected.
</P>
<P>
Hong said he would continue to conscientiously deliberate state
affairs together with the other deputies, and continue to promote
national unity and educational undertakings.
</P>
<P>
He is also planning to establish a school for orphans in his
home county when he returns home after the first session of the
Ninth People's Congress, due to be held this March.

<HEADLINE> Romania Welcomes U.N.-Iraq Deal on Weapons Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu expressed his satisfaction Tuesday over the success
of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's mission to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said the signing of the U.N.-Iraq accord on
weapons inspection introduced a new political solution to the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Romania favors solving disputes through diplomatic means, which
is the only constructive way out of crises, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the recently-achieved U.N.-Iraq accord would be
adopted by the U.N. Security Council and become an effective
guarantee for a lasting peace in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
In view of the easing of tensions in the Gulf region,
Constantinescu also sent letters to speakers of the lower and
upper houses of the parliament Tuesday, calling for the
postponement of discussions on the participation of Romanian
troops in military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government announced on February 14 that Romania
would support and participate in military strikes on Iraq if all
diplomatic mediation failed. Romania said they would send a
60-member medical and anti-chemical weapons team to the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of lawsuits against
law-enforcement departments has declined markedly in Tianjin, the
largest port city in north China, because of a new measure imposed
by the municipal People's Congress, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The law-enforment responsibility system, which strengthens
supervision of law-enforcement activities of the city's
administrative, judicial and procuratorial bodies, strictly
defines the responsibilities of various departments in
implementing laws and regional regulations.
</P>
<P>
For instance, cases of fake seeds had occurred in Ninghe
county, Tianjin, for several years because the three government
departments in charge of the issue lacked cooperation, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Congress then helped to define the
responsibilities of the three departments. Since then, no such
cases have been reported in the county.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xuezheng, deputy chairman of the municipal People's
Congress, remarked that "the new system not only serves to
supervise the activities of law-enforcers but also helps to
safeguard the dignity of the law."

<P>
MADRID, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar and visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed
satisfaction over the diplomatic solution to Iraq crisis and urged
Baghdad to stick to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference on Tuesday after their
summit meeting at the El Escordial monastery outside Madrid, Aznar
and Kohl congratulated United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
for his successful peace mission to Iraq over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Annan was expected to brief the Security Council later Tuesday
on the accord he signed with Iraqi authorities to allow unfettered
arms inspections, and avert a possible United States-led military
strike.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he believed the accord could fulfill a complete
implementation and make a positive contribution to peace in the
gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Also at the one-day summit, the two prime ministers discussed
their differences over how to finance the future eastward
expansion of the 15-member European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Germany, seeking to keep its contribution to the EU budget
under control, said EU aid funds, including cohesion and
structural funds, should be devoted to future members.
</P>
<P>
But Spain, fearing the expansion would reduce the substantial
funds it received from Brussels, called for an increase of the EU
budget for aid funds.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said they will hold further negotiations to try
to iron out the differences.
</P>
<P>
Defense issues within Europe and the reform of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization were also on the agenda at the
summit.

BUDAPEST, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister Goran

economic cooperation between Sweden and Hungary.

country, which ranked 10th among foreign investing nations.

During their talks, the two prime ministers also exchanged
views on issues such as the eastward expansion of the EU.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 Laid-Off Women Workers Find New Jobs in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A woman who lost her job a
few years ago in northeast China's Liaoning Province became her
own boss, and her tailor's shop and other property are now valued
at about 700,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Li Xumei, formerly working at a welfare factory in Suizhong
county, recently employed more than 30 jobless women in the shop
and a laundry she owns.
</P>
<P>
Li started her business with five m of white cloth, with which
she made sun bonnets.
</P>
<P>
Like Li, some 500,000 laid-off women workers in Liaoning have
found new jobs by themselves in recent years, said Cong Yuwen,
vice-chairperson of the province's women's federation.
</P>
<P>
The heavy industrial province, which has the biggest number of
women workers in the country, has seen over 800,000 women laid off
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, many have sought opportunities in the service
sector. Sun Lixia and her husband have earned more than they ever
did in their former factories since 1995, when they lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
The federation, a nationwide non-official organization for
women, has been in the forefront of aiding women who have lost
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
With various local branches, the federation has established 376
employment information centers throughout the province, helping
over 50,000 women find jobs so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some restaurants and insurance companies give
priority to laid-off women workers when they are recruiting
staff.

<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot man hijacked a
Turkish passenger plane in southern Turkey Tuesday night, still
holding some 40 passengers hostage on board.
</P>
<P>
Twenty passengers have been released from the plane at the
Diyarbakir Airport in southeastern Turkey, private TV station

</P>
<P>
The released included writers and reporters, the TV report

</P>
<P>
The plane was hijacked in Adana, southern Turkey, at about
21:00 local time (19:00 GMT) soon after it took off and headed for
Ankara. But it landed at Diyarbakir at 22:46 local time (20:46

<HEADLINE> Senate Democrats Struggling to Advance Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A bipartisan campaign
finance reform Bill Tuesday narrowly survived an attempt by
Republican senators to kill it off.
</P>
<P>
Supporters voted 51-48 to continue debate on the legislation
drafted by Republican Senator John McCain and Democrat Senator
Russell Feingold.
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban "soft money" -- unregulated campaign
donations to national political parties from corporations, labor
unions and individuals and crack down on advertising by lobbyists
on candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
Although there are enough votes to overcome the first hurdle,
the count is expected to fall far short of the 60 needed to
override an expected Republican filibuster -- a tactics to
obstruct a bill.
</P>
<P>
An earlier version of the bill stalled in October. McCain and
Feingold sent a modified version back to the floor.

<HEADLINE> Blair Supports Controversial Millennium Dome in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Tuesday threw his support to and unveiled the details of
the controversial Millennium Dome project.
</P>
<P>
"The Dome will be the celebration of the best of Britain," and
"We are going to make it happen," Blair told potential business
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a huge asset for the country as a symbol
of British confidence, as a monument to our creativity, and as a
fantastic day out," Blair added.
</P>
<P>
The huge dome, 320 meters in diameter and 50 meters high, is
already half-built on a derelict industrial site in Greenwich, the
London suburb where Greenwich Mean Time was first established in
1884. The total cost is expected to reach 758 million pound (1.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Blair praised the dome, the biggest building of its kind in the
world when completed, saying "It will be good for business, it
will be good for tourism, and it will be good for Britain's
standing in the world."
</P>
<P>
The project was started by the previous Conservative government
but has become closely identified with Blair's hopes for
"rebranding Britain" as modern, cool and creative.
</P>
<P>
The dome, which will open on January 1, 2000, is a huge
circular structure with a circumference of one km and 80,000
square meters of floor space, making it the biggest building of
its kind in the world.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Weighing Campaign Finance Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Democrats in the U.S.
Senate are reportedly considering whether to embrace a compromise
endorsed by Republican moderates.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, drafted by Republican Senator Olympia Snowe, won
the support of U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, an advocacy group for campaign finance overhaul,
endorsed it on Monday, and lobbied rank-and-file Democrats to
support it. "To do otherwise will play into the hands" of
Republicans attempting to "kill reform with a labor 'poison pill'
proposal," wrote Ann McBride, Common Cause president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking to the National Council of Jewish Women,
described the proposed compromise as the best hope for enacting a
campaign-finance overhaul bill this year.
</P>
<P>
Senate aides reportedly said the proposal was likely to be
discussed at Tuesday's weekly closed-door Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
Snowe's proposal would require speedy disclosure of
contributors to any broadcast commercials targeting specific
candidates within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general
election.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also prohibit the use of union or corporate
funds for such ads. It would "simply require funding to come from
sources traditionally relied upon for campaign purposes -- PACs
(political action committees) or individual, voluntary donors,"
according to a summary of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The amendment is designed as an alternative to far rigid
restrictions on union political activity sought by Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and many other Republicans. Their proposal would
give union members the right to keep their dues from being used
for political purposes by organized labor.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, being debated for the second time, is drafted
by Republican Senator John McCain and his Democrat colleague
Russell Feingold. The bill would ban unregulated "soft money"
donations to national political parties from corporations, labor
unions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan legislation also would impose new restrictions
on advertisements that attack candidates but escape regulation
because they are presented as "issue ads" not covered by current
election law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it would provide for greater disclosure of
campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
It stalled late last year.
</P>
<P>
The measure is expected to survive an early test late Tuesday,
when supporters say they will have enough votes to block Lott's
attempt to kill it, but is likely to be left short of the 60 votes
required to end a Republican filibuster.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Holds Last Hearing on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
Tuesday called for ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) expansion at the last major hearing by the
Senate before it votes on the issue next month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated reasons for expanding
the alliance, saying it will make America safer, NATO stronger and
Europe more stable and united.
</P>
<P>
"Our prospective allies are passionately committed to NATO.
Experience has taught them to believe in a strong American role in
Europe," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"They will add strategic depth to the Alliance, not to mention
well over 200,000 troops," she added.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders decided last July to accept Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as new members by 1999. The plan needs to be
ratified by all the parliaments of the 16 alliance members.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the willingness of the invitees to shoulder
responsibilities as NATO members is reflected in the recent
stand-off between the United States and Iraq over weapons
inspection
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
are already behaving as loyal allies. They will be good allies in
the future, of that I have no doubt," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright admitted there still serious critics
questioning the policy of expanding NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the concerns revolve around the potential cost of a
larger NATO... We know today that the costs will be real, but also
that they will be manageable, that they will be met, and that they
will be shared fairly," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also dismissed concern that adding new members to NATO
could diminish the effectiveness of the alliance and make it
harder to reach decisions.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the enlargement of NATO is pursued in a way
"that will make the alliance stronger, not weaker."
</P>
<P>
"We must be prudent enough to add members selectively, but we
must be smart enough to add those members that will add to our own
security. These three will. Others may in the future."
</P>
<P>
Moscow has strongly opposed the expansion of the alliance,
arguing that it endangers its national security, and insisting
that NATO is should be disbanded since the Cold War has ended.
</P>
<P>
Opponents in the U.S. believe that NATO's expansion moves its
front-line closer to Russia and may cause new confrontation
between Russia and the West in future.
</P>
<P>
"I don't pretend that everything is perfect in our relationship
(with Russia)," Albright told the Senators, citing the fact that
Washington and Moscow differ in the affairs about the Middle East
and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
However, she added that the disagreements are not resulted from
NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Our disagreements with Russia...have come about because of the
manner in which Russia is defining its national interests in that
part of the world. These differences have long existed long before
NATO decided to expand," she affirmed.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Restructure Economy in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government announced
on Tuesday that it would in next three years restructure the
country's economy in order to join the European Union's economic
and monetary union (EMU) by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar organized by the French Chamber of
Commerce in Athens Tuesday, Greece's Finance Undersecretary George
Drys said that the planned measures include the implementation of
a decision to merge or abolish 1,750 state agencies, flotation and
restructuring of 10 public utilities, gradual liberation of
telecommunications, energy and transport, upgrading of development
legislation, granting autonomy to the central bank, improving
operation of the banking and insurance systems and ensuring
greater access of private capital to major public projects, and to
the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently does not meet any of the criteria for the EMU,
but hopes to qualify by January 2001 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The Greek economy would fulfill in 1998 the criteria for public
deficits set by the Maastricht Treaty, Drys predicted, adding that
criteria for inflation and interest rates would also be met in
1999.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called upon the parties in Tajikistan to
intensify their efforts to implement fully the General agreement
and continue their efforts aimed at the institution of a broad
dialogue among the various political forces.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the security Council considered the
progress report of UN secretary-General Kofi Annan on the
situation in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
In its presidential statement, the Council reiterated its
concern that the security situation in some parts of the country
remains precarious.
</P>
<P>
It remains parties concerned that the international community
is ready to continue assisting in the implementation of the
General Agreement as well as in humanitarian and the
rehabilitation program, but stressed that its ability to do so
is linked to improvements in security conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council firmly condemned the hostage-taking of relief
workers that took place in November 1997 and urged the parties to
cooperate further in ensuring the security of freedom of movement
of the personnel of the United Nations, the Collective
Peace-keeping forces of the commonwealth of independent states,
and other international personnel, and to take steps in this
regard.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday slammed the
United States for its decision to maintain its troops in the Gulf
region, calling it a threat to regional security, peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, a government spokesman
said U.S. President Bill Clinton's order not to withdraw
U.S. troops from the region showed Washington's intention of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq's agreement with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on U.N. arms inspections thwarted a U.S. attempt to
launch a military aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States failed in preventing
the United Nations from seeking a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
arms inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was Annan's good will, not the military buildup of the
United States, that led to the conclusion of the agreement on
U.N. arms inspections, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton's suggestion that it was the U.S. military
presence that forced Iraq to sign the agreement was designed to
cover up the isolation of the United States in the world
community.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military buildup scared neither the Iraqi people nor
its leadership, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
fell Tuesday and all ended lower, depressed by Wall Street's
decline, heavy overnight losses in Tokyo and collapse of a major
drugs merger.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London had plunged two percent earlier in the
session before showing remarkable resilience and ending 0.91
percent or 51.8 points down at 5,651.0 on the FTSE 100 index.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of merger talks between Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham to create the world's biggest drugs company hit
sentiment in London.
</P>

But the index recovered from an early dive of over 100 points
and almost halved its losses by the close.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the failed merger deal would not halt the tide of
mergers and acquisitions activity.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended lower as investors took
profits in the absence of major corporate news.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that sentiment was depressed by the decline in the
dollar.

The DAX-30 index finished the session 58.00 points or 1.25

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Calls for Iraqi-U.S. Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan Tuesday
called on Iraq and the United States to hold talks in
order to avoid any conflicts between them in the future.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should cash in on the agreement signed between Iraq
and U.N. chief Kofi Annan over weapons inspection and move into "a
new stage of Iraqi-U.S. dialogue," said the king during an
interview with Jordan Television Station and the Orbit Network.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we will be successful in convincing both
concerned sides to initiate this dialogue as soon as possible
... because it is the sole way to avert any collisions in the
future," said Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring forth such a meeting, Hussein asked the
U.S. administration to give up its choice of military option but
adopt the form of dialogue in which it could submit its demand
directly.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. side has some stands or demands, it should put
forward them directly and get, by thus, the answers from the
concerned party," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without achieving this, neither the (U.N.) inspection team
nor other means will achieve the wanted target," he added.
</P>
<P>
The king also called on both sides to hold dialogues between
their top leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that dialogue should be conducted with him (Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein), since he represents the regime in
Baghdad," he said.
</P>
<P>
The king also insisted that the dialogue would not only help
iron out the difference between Iraq and the U.S., but also help
lift the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should meet the U.S. demands in fully implementing the
U.N. resolutions, and then "this should be accompanied by
initiating work for relieving the Iraqi people's suffering" caused
by the sanctions imposed by the U.N. for Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, said the king.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue should be dealt with, that is, the issue of the
Iraqi people's suffering and the maintaining of Iraq's integrity
and sovereignty," he added.
</P>
<P>
The king's interview came one day after Annan signed the
agreement with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi has promised to open all the suspected sites under no
preconditions to U.N. arms inspectors charged with dismantling the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only when the weapons inspectors certify that all the banned
weapons are destroyed in Iraq, can the sanctions be lifted.

UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Tuesday that He has the general sense of
approval from the Security Council for the agreement reached
between him and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks after he briefed the Security
council of the United Nations on his visit to Baghdad and his
deal on resolving the current crisis over U.N. weapons inspection
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I had the general sense of approval from the membership of
Security Council for the agreement I signed in Baghdad," he told
reporters. "In my judgement, the agreement can and will work,
could and should work."
</P>
<P>
"There is a qualitative difference about this agreement that
the others did not have. The United Nations has been present in
Baghdad and many agreements have been signed, but none have been
negotiated and approved with (Iraqi President)Saddam Hussein.
This one was negotiated with President himself, and the leadership
has got the message that he wants cooperation, he wants it done,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We should have a mechanism for resolving conflicts before
they become dilemmas and almost bring us to the verge of war,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there are lessons in this for everyone. But this
could not have happened if all involved -- including the Iraqi
leadership -- had not shown what I asked for: courage, wisdom,
flexibility," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"But it is a victory not for me, if we call it victory, but a
victory for the United Nations, for the Organization, which
sent me there as a servant," Annan added.

UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The agreement reached

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Agreement With Annan Serves National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Tuesday that his agreement with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on weapons inspections serves
the interests of Iraq, hailing it as a national victory.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks in a joint interview with chief editors
of Iraq's major newspapers and television stations, which was
broadcast live on TV.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will help lift the U.N. economic sanctions on
Iraq, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a special group of inspectors selected by Annan
will carry out inspections at eight presidential sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not rule out the possibility that the United States
and Britain will meddle in the work of the special group, he
said, adding that Iraq will monitor the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, senior diplomats appointed by Annan, along with
experts from the U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and International Atomic Energy
Agency would carry out inspections at the presidentials sites.
</P>
<P>
Aziz called the agreement a balenced one. Iraq will not impose
any conditions and restrictions on the work of the U.N. arms
inspectors, while they will respect Iraq's sovereignty and
national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement does not mean that Iraq
has backed down from its previous stand, on the contrary, it
reinforces Iraq's stand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq's new stance to open presidential sites to
inspectors will prove that Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction, adding that the U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq
should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Aziz and Annan signed the agreement Monday morning to allow
U.N. weapons inspectors free and unlimited access to all sensitive
sites in Iraq. The accord was termed by both sides as balanced.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement largely eased the crisis over
weapons inspections, during which the U.S. and Britain threatened
to resort to force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 can only be lifted after
U.N. weapons inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the issue of presidential sites never came up before
September 1997 when the U.N. Special Commission under Richard
Butler "suddenly" showed interest in visiting presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and Butler then spread lies that
Iraq obstructed the work of U.N. arms inspectors when they were
on the verge of finding a large quantity of chemical and
biological weapons, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he said, they want to give an impression that Iraq
stores banned weapons in presidential palaces and that it does not
implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, thus creating an
excuse to keep sanctions on Iraq in place.

<HEADLINE> Greece Replys to Turkish Proposals for Improving Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Tuesday replyed to
Turkish proposals for bettering strained relations between the two
countries, saying that Turkey should refer all its disputes with
Greece to the international court of justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement later Tuesday, the Greek Foreign Ministry
urged neighboring Turkey to accept the "sincere and
well-intentioned" proposals by Athens because they were the only
way to improve the Greek-Turkish relations gradually and
substantially.
</P>
<P>
Greece's response to a five-point proposal made recently by
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has been reportedly submitted
in Ankara by Greece's ambassador to Turkey Dimitris Nezeritis.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the Turkish proposals, the Greek foreign ministry
stressed that the cornerstone of any improvement in bilateral
relations would be the respect by Turkey of the international law
and recognition of jurisdiction of the international court of
justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The announcement hailed the Madrid Communique signed last July
by Turkish President Sulyman Demirel and Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis as "a political commitment" by the two sides to
respect the principles of international law and good neighborly
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government supported the contact between the
committees of experts, set up last May to review the procedural
matters regarding Greek-Turkish differences, to be conducted
through the European Union, said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement at last urged Turkey to recognize the
jurisdiction of the international court and reiterated Athens's
desire for substantial progress in Greek-Turkish relations which
have been at odds over decades for differences in the Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> U.S. High School Seniors Lag World in Science, Math </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. 12th graders lagged
behind nearly all their counterparts in a 21-nation survey in
science and math skills and tied for last in calculus and physics.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the Third International Math and
Science Study released Tuesday, U.S. students begin with
above-average scores in the fourth grade, then drop to average by
the eighth grade and plummet by the 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
U.S. seniors only performed better than their counterparts from
Cyprus and South Africa in overall math and science. It was the
only country participating the survey showing such a gradual drop
in these fields.
</P>
<P>
Learning the results, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the
poor performance was a failure by generation of adults responsible
for educating the children. "There is no excuse for this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the National Council of Jewish Women,
Clinton said America's showing in the study is "a leading
indicator" of the real problems with public education. He urged
Congress to act quickly to correct them.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Education Richard Riley said that one reason for
the sharp decline is that many American students stop taking math
and science after 10th or 11th grade. Even among college-bound
seniors, 51 percent have not taken four years of science.
</P>
<P>
For those who have taken four years of science, their courses
are less rigor and depth than that for their counterparts in
other nations, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the education chief said, too many teachers in the
United States are teaching out-of-field. As high as 28 percent of
high school math teachers and 18 percent of high school science
teachers neither majored nor even minored in the subjects they're
teaching, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the physical sciences, where U.S. performance lags most
dramatically, almost half the students are taught by teachers
without a major or minor in the field.
</P>
<P>
Riley also said that less than a quarter of eighth grade U.S.
students have taken algebra, while almost all students in the rest
of the developed world by that time have studied the fundamentals
of algebra and some geometry.
</P>
<P>
Among U.S. high school students, only 25 percent take physics
and 10 percent take calculus, he said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, administered by researchers at Boston
College, may help push Clinton's education reform plan including
improving math and science instruction and voluntary national
eighth-grade math test.

<HEADLINE> UK Economic Growth Slows Owing to Strong Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) - British economic growth in the
final three months of last year was revised down, largely
reflecting a deterioration in exports because of the strength of
the pound.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics now estimated that the
economy grew by 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, giving
year-on-year growth of 3 percent. This compares with earlier
estimates of 0.5 percent and 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the City said, the figures underlined the policy
dilemma facing the Chancellor and the Bank of England,
highlighting a divergence between the domestic economy and the
internationally traded sector.
</P>
<P>
Service sectors grew 1.1 percent while industrial production,
sensitive to the exchange rate and events overseas, contracted
1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said the economy
had evidently begun slowing last year and further interest rate
rises were unnecessary.
