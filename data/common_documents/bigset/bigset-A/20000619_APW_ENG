<HEADLINE> House Seats Likely To Shift by 2020  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By 2020, New York stands to lose five House
seats while California, already the largest state delegation with
52 members, would add nine if current Census Bureau population
projections hold true, a private statistical group predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 25 of the House's 435 seats could shift between now and
2020, with the South and West gaining at the expense of the
Northeast and Midwest, researchers at the Population Reference
Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a continuation of recent population trends,'' said Mark
Mather, an analyst at the nonprofit, Washington-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group forecast the size of states' House delegations based
on population projections for 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --California, already No. 1 with a population of 32.6 million,
could grow by 17 million over the next two decades. The state could
gain one seat after this year's census and nine seats by 2020,
increasing the delegation from the current 52 to 61.
</P>
<P>
   --New York's delegation stands to drop from 31 now to 26 in 2020,
even though statisticians estimate the state's population will have
grown from 7.6 percent between 1990 and 2020, from 17.9 million to
19.3 million. By comparison, California's predicted growth rate is
52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Also projected to lose seats by 2020 are Pennsylvania (four),
Michigan and Ohio (three each) and Illinois (two). Their current
size: Pennsylvania with 21 House members, Illinois with 20, Ohio
with 19 and Michigan with 16.
</P>
<P>
   --Forecast to add House members are Texas (five), Florida (three)
and Georgia and Arizona (two each). Their current size: Texas with
30 House members, Florida with 23, Georgia with 11 and Arizona with
six.
</P>
<P>
   --Montana, which has one at-large representative now, would gain
a second seat after this year's census and would keep the seat
through 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be careful we don't exaggerate the influence and
the corresponding lack of clout because a state loses numbers in a
congressional head count,'' said G. Terry Madonna, political
science professor at Millersville University in Millersville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''While more is better, I'm not convinced you'll have a small or
medium-sized state that doesn't have significance in national
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Brace of the Washington-based Election Data Services Inc.,
which projects House seats no more than 10 years ahead, said,
''Overall, this shows trends of what might be potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem you have in projecting way out to 20 years down
the road is that there's a lot of things that can happen in
between,'' he added. ''Long-term projections should be treated only
as potential change.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Brace's forecast of the 2000 reapportionment shows
Georgia keeping the House seat that Mather projects Montana would
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to look far enough in the future so that you have
some exciting change to look into, but not too far off so that it's
not beyond the lifetime of the people who are interested in it,''
said John Hagga, another analyst at the Population Reference
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brace's count is based on 2000 census population projections,
while Mather's forecast for 2000 is based on 1999 population
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a distribution of House seats as
fairly as possible among the states, based on census data, every 10
years. For many years, the House of Representatives has been fixed
by law at 435 members. That means that when one state gains a seat,
another must lose one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that this process -- known as
reapportionment -- must be based on actual, raw population figures,
instead of statistically adjusted data.
</P>
<P>
   Those raw figures from the 2000 census will be released by Dec.
31, and the House seats will be reapportioned soon after. Mather's
analysis projected reapportionment after this year and in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, eight seats could change states after this year's
count, and 25 by 2020, Mather predicted.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Efficiency Standards Cheered  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If politics is the fine art of compromise, the
Senate produced a masterpiece on the delicate issue of auto fuel
efficiency standards that left both sides claiming they'd won.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who faces a tough re-election
race in his auto-industry state, said the compromise last week was
''a big victory for Michigan'' because it maintained the current
freeze on Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, a major
environmental group, said the deal allowing the Transportation
Department and the National Academy of Sciences to at least study
changes in CAFE standards was a ''major victory for consumers and
the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the CAFE law in the oil crisis year of 1975,
requiring the auto industry to reach certain fuel efficiency
standards. For more than a decade, they have remained at 20.7 miles
per gallon for light trucks, including sport utility vans, and 27.5
mpg for passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry says tougher standards would drive up the
costs of new cars and force people to buy vehicles that are smaller
and less safe. Since 1995, the Republican-led House has included
language in the annual transportation spending bill banning the
administration from even studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts in the Senate to remove the House ban have been led by
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a conservative seeking re-election this
year in a state where the environment is an important political
issue.
</P>
<P>
   He has joined environmental groups in asserting that the
industry now has the know-how to produce vehicles that burn less
fuel, thus saving consumers money, slowing global warming and
reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the Senate has acceded to the House position.
This year, Gorton, joined by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
stepped up the pressure, pointing to skyrocketing gas prices that
have grabbed the nation's attention.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a compromise Thursday with Abraham and senators
close to the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   When they negotiate this year's transportation bill with the
House, senators will argue that the Transportation Department and
the National Academy of Sciences should be allowed to study CAFE
standards and report their findings to Congress by July 1, 2001.
Nothing would go into effect without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether the House will go along. But Gorton
called it a surprising and stunning victory, ''the first
breakthrough in more than six years'' on the CAFE issue.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham saw it a little differently. The compromise, he said,
requires that any study on CAFE standards also consider the impact
on vehicle safety and auto jobs, and ensures that Congress will
have the final say over any changes in fuel efficiency standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this agreement we accomplish that important goal,''
Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton acknowledged it would be tough to get a majority in
Congress to support tougher standards. He also said it was likely
he would be standing in the same spot a year from now still trying
to ''get America's head out of the sand'' on the CAFE issue.
</P>
<P>
   At least with a study, ''We'll be arguing about real standards
and not about false fears,'' Gorton said.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Rejects Calls To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The investigation into the disappearance -- and
mysterious reappearance -- of two computer hard drives holding
nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory is narrowing
on several scientists who have given contradictory answers,
government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists being scrutinized most closely are among 26
people who had free access to a high-security vault in the New
Mexico complex where the data storage disks vanished more than six
weeks ago, only to be found under suspicious circumstances Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts hoped, possibly as early as Monday, to determine
definitively whether the material on the two drives had been
compromised, copied or in any way tampered with. The devices were
flown to Washington on Sunday for electronic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, while acknowledging the
devices were found in a room already searched several times, said
he had ''no evidence that they ever left the X Division'' -- the
high-security part of the lab where nuclear weapons designers work.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said the investigation was focusing on
''several'' members of a nuclear emergency response team that had
free access to the vault holding the devices. These individuals
have made ''contradictory statements'' and given ''suspicious''
answers during polygraph tests, said Edward Curran, the Energy
Department's director of counterintelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the two hard drives -- and Richardson's
assurances that security is his top priority -- did little to ease
the sharp criticism by congressional Republicans of the Clinton
administration over security lapses in the nuclear weapons programs
and elsewhere
</P>
<P>
   ''They are worried more about political correctness,'' Rep.
Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,
said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' He cited not only the Los
Alamos incident, but loss of a classified laptop computer at the
State Department and disclosure that a former CIA director often
took classified information home and left it in his unsecured
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Justice and Energy departments and the
FBI were strongly criticized for their handling years of
investigations into alleged theft of nuclear weapons secrets by
China.
</P>
<P>
   The probe focused on Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, who has
been charged with illegally copying secret documents and awaits
trial. But there has never been enough evidence to charge Lee or
anyone else with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Goss and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, who also made the television talk show
rounds Sunday, called on Richardson to resign over security lapses
in the nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not the man for the job,'' Shelby said on CBS' ''Face the
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has dismissed such a notion. And White House
spokesman Jim Kennedy said: ''We have full confidence in Secretary
Richardson, who is working hard to get to the bottom of this. And
that kind of a partisan finger-pointing should not be taken too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson launched a vigorous defense of his yearlong effort to
improve security at the labs and said he wanted to avoid ''a
partisan food fight'' over the latest controversy. In a few days
''we will know what happened,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be disciplinary action. There's going to be
accountability,'' said Richardson, using similar language on
several TV programs and in other interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drives at the center of the Los Alamos incident were
part of response ''kits'' used by the lab's Nuclear Emergency
Security Team. They contain technical information needed to locate
and dismantle U.S. or even foreign nuclear devices that might be
used in a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   The drives, each about the size of a deck of cards and designed
for laptop computers, were discovered missing May 7 when two
scientists wanted to make sure they were protected from a wildfire
that threatened the lab. The lab was evacuated the next day because
of the fire threat, but no one reported the devices missing until
May 31, triggering the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that while one scientist reported seeing the
drives in the vault on April 7, it remained unclear when they were
last inventoried; they could have been missing longer.
</P>
<P>
   Classified as ''secret'' -- as opposed to ''top secret'' -- the
drives did not have to be signed in or out, making it more
difficult to determine who might have had them last and when,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 policy change, initiated by President Bush and continued
by President Clinton, eased the tracking requirements for material
classified as secret, no longer requiring specific sign-out
procedures, officials said.

<HEADLINE> E! Takes Funny New Turn  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lot of TV talk these days is about digitized
this, satellite-fed that.
</P>
<P>
   In such a high-tech climate, it's ironic that TV's brain trust
has done a fast rewind to the medium's infancy -- an age of vacuum
tubes and kinescopes -- for creative inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems. Consider the new-found fascination with live
dramas, such as CBS' April airing of ''Fail Safe'' (live and in
black-and-white, to boot!). Professional wrestling, a mainstay of
TV's formative years, is kicking rump on both cable and broadcast
networks. And ABC's smash-hit ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is
a throwback to the big-money quiz shows of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe these seeming echoes from yesteryear are anomalies. But if
the TV community is really living in the past, here's one other
old-time idea worth trying anew: the TV anthology.
</P>
<P>
   While the luster of the anthology-dominated ''Golden Age'' of
television has somehow taken on a greater sheen with the passage of
time, today the term ''anthology'' is scorned, if not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, its modern-day potential is here for all to see thanks
to E! Entertainment Television, which three weeks ago unveiled a
comedy anthology, ''Hollywood Off-Ramp.''
</P>
<P>
   Airing Monday at 10 p.m. Eastern, ''Hollywood Off-Ramp'' is not
only fresh and fun, but also serves as a persuasive argument for
how the anthology form could be adapted in numerous other ways to
revitalize network lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Anthologies abounded on TV in the 1950s. Series like ''U.S.
Steel Hour'' and ''Armstrong Circle Theater'' were showcases for
stand-alone teleplays by some of the nation's finest writers. The
only continuity from week to week was the series' imprimatur and,
sometimes, a host.
</P>
<P>
   The ''anthology'' term also applies to such long-ago fare as
''Twilight Zone,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' and the Ronald
Reagan-hosted ''General Electric Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the early 1960s, the anthology form has hung on mostly
thanks to little-watched, short-lived series with ''story'' in
their titles (remember ''Ghost Story,'' ''Medical Story,'' ''Love
Story,'' ''Lifestories,'' ''FBI: The Untold Stories'' or ''Amazing
Stories''?).
</P>
<P>
   Now ''Hollywood Off-Ramp'' suggests that anthologies are ripe
for a comeback, at least as an alternative to the creatively barren
half-hour sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Off-Ramp,'' the first fictional series E! has mounted, stays
true to that network's sensibilities by focusing on Hollywood --
past, present and future -- and mining its rich comic possibilities.
The host is Brian Unger (best known as a correspondent on Comedy
Central's ''The Daily Show''), who lends the perfect macabre touch
that Rod Serling brought to ''Twilight Zone,'' plus the dry wit of
Alfred Hitchcock on his longrunning series.
</P>
<P>
   Already, ''Off-Ramp'' has presented ''Looking for Mr.
Campbell,'' a saucy little tale about a ruthless producer and the
hotel maid who outsmarts him. ''Simple Simon'' depicted the
downfall of an actor who tries in vain to escape his identity as
the star of a string of slasher flicks.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, ''Death by Gossip'' re-created 1940s Hollywood in
film noir (and shot in black-and-white), as a vicious gossip
columnist meets his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's installment returns to the present day for ''Big
Screen,'' a cautionary fable for everyone who watches too much
television.
</P>
<P>
   That would include Gabriel Briggs, a recovering TV addict whose
wife, a struggling actress, wins a large-screen set as first prize
in a contest.
</P>
<P>
   Having invaded his home, the TV takes over Gabriel's life with
Dazzlevision, a channel only he can see, featuring a lovely
round-the-clock anchor, Tessa Rand. This is TV as a drug and as an
infatuation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible,'' Unger sums up, infinitely deadpan, ''to
just say no to TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the first four episodes and, happily, there are 22
scheduled weekly after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll give 'Off-Ramp' all the time it needs to catch on,''
vows Greg Brannan, E! programming vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He explains that ''a year ago we decided we wanted to expand
into the area of fiction, and do it in a way that would make sense
to the E! viewer. For some in the entertainment industry, there's a
fine line between passion and pathology, and we thought 'Off-Ramp'
would let us have fun with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The result (which he likens to ''26 little movies'') pays
gleeful tribute to the anthology tradition and, says Brannan,
proved to be a form ''more liberating than confining from the
creativity standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps other networks' execs will take note. An anthology can
serve as a magnet for big names, both in front of and behind the
camera, who are looking for a change of pace. And it can be a
launching pad for episodes worth turning into series of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging in its own right, ''Hollywood Off-Ramp'' outshines many
sitcoms, which too often are done in by their limited concept or
expensive cast.
</P>
<P>
   A new set of laughs every week? Maybe ''Off-Ramp'' is onto
something.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a million low-income parents have lost
their Medicaid coverage and probably are uninsured as a consequence
of welfare overhaul, says a new study by an advocacy group that
lobbies for universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA examined Medicaid figures in 15 states with most of
the uninsured low-income population and found that 945,880 adults
with children had been dropped from the program from 1996 to 1999,
a decline of 27 percent. More than 2.5 million were enrolled in
Medicaid in the 15 states at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Monday, blamed the problem on states, saying
they mismanaged the implementation of the 1996 welfare reform law
and improperly kicked people off of Medicaid once they left
welfare, created barriers for people to sign up and set income
eligibility requirements way too low.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, for example, a family of three earning more than
$3,168 a year would be ineligible for Medicaid, the study
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic thrust of welfare is to move people to jobs, but
unfortunately when they do so they are considered to have too much
income for Medicaid,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of
Families USA. ''So the reward of moving off welfare is getting no
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack and other advocates for the poor complain that state and
federal officials have been too quick to declare welfare overhaul a
success because so many people have dropped off the rolls. They say
that doesn't take into account side effects like losing health
benefits, which can destabilize families.
</P>
<P>
   States have recognized the problem and are taking steps to fix
it, said William Waldman, executive director of the American Public
Human Services Association, whose members include state welfare
agencies. Many states focused first on dealing with uninsured
low-income children and now are shifting attention to uninsured
adults, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It remains an issue that needs to be addressed,'' Waldman
said. ''I think you'll see some very significant developments in
the states.''
</P>
<P>
   New York and Ohio are expanding Medicaid eligibility and other
states are reinstating people who were wrongly cut off. The
government recently ordered all states to find people improperly
dropped from Medicaid and sign them back up.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA did not check whether those dropped from Medicaid
had other insurance. But Pollack said studies have shown that many
low-income workers and people leaving welfare have jobs that don't
offer health insurance and those they are offered insurance usually
can't afford the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The group looked only at parents with family Medicaid coverage.
The 15 states in the study are those with the largest number of
uninsured poor people and represent 70 percent of all low-income
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has one of the highest rates of uninsured people,
had the biggest percentage drop in Medicaid enrollees. Some 106,000
people lost Medicaid during the 4-year period, a 46 percent
decline, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said several programs had been put in place to
get families signed up or provide transitional benefits to people
whose incomes exceed the cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to outreach to families that may be still eligible for
Medicaid,'' said Charles Stuart, spokesman for Texas' health and
human services department. ''We know there are people who have gone
off (welfare) and lost Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, the state sent notices to more than 275,000 Texas
families that left welfare since 1996 informing them they may still
be eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid status is now automatically
reviewed when someone leaves welfare and transitional Medicaid
benefits are available to those with ''earnings issues,'' Stuart
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Republican presidential campaign, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush has proposed giving $2,000 tax credits to help poor people
purchase health insurance. His Democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore, wants to raise income limits on a federal health program for
poor children and let their parents into the program. President
Clinton has a similar proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid cost an estimated $181 billion last year, with the
federal government picking up $103 billion and the states the rest.
Enrollment dropped by 200,000 to 41.4 million in 1998, the last
year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Texas and Louisiana, the study looked at Arizona,
California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading
Monday, with blue-chip stocks rising as financial stocks mounted a
modest recovery from Friday's crushing losses. Technology stocks
lagged.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 71.07 at 10,520.37.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 1.53 at 1,465.99, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 13.68 at 3,846.88.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were bouncing back from steep losses on Friday,
when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks will have
trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $1.688 to $120.188 and Citigroup rose 81.25
cents to $63.563.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intel rose $4.313 to $130.375. The company said it will
invest $2 billion in a new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers
analyst Dan Niles said Intel's stock price should reach $175 within
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where early volume came to 113.66
million shares, well behind Friday's busy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected trading to remain fairly quiet and volatile
this week. The Federal Reserve will announce its next decision on
interest rates on June 28, leaving many investors unwilling to
stake out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   The coming week will give investors little new guidance. A
report on the trade deficit, due out Tuesday, is the only economic
report expected to influence the market this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.77 to 510.97.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Japan's
version of the technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market opened on
Monday, with eight stocks trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange. It
plans to introduce its own trading system next year linked to and
modeled after the original Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 0.4
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was up 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Refuses Evolution Disclaimer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused to let a public
school district require that the teaching of evolution be
accompanied by a disclaimer mentioning ''the biblical version of
creation'' and other teachings on life's origin.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote Monday, let stand rulings that
struck down a Louisiana school board's disclaimer policy as a
violation of the constitutionally required separation of government
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action was not a precedent-setting decision but only a
denial of review.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas voted to hear arguments in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Tangipahoa Parish school board in 1994 voted to require
teachers to tell students about to study the theory of evolution
that is ''presented to inform students of the scientific concept
and not intended to influence or dissuade the biblical version of
creation or any other concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclaimer drafted by the school board also said: ''It is
the basic right and privilege of each student to form his-her own
opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very
important matter. ... Students are urged to exercise critical
thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine
each alternative toward forming an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Three parents of students sued in federal court to challenge the
policy, and a federal judge blocked its enforcement. The judge said
the disclaimer was unconstitutional because it had a religious
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed that the disclaimer had to be struck down but cited a
different reason -- it had the effect of promoting religion.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not rule out the possibility that a school board
could require some type of disclaimer stating that evolution was
not the only accepted explanation of the origin of life. But it
said the Tangipahoa Parish disclaimer ''under the facts and
circumstances of this case ... is not sufficiently neutral'' to be
constitutionally permissible.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for the school board
argued that ''the mere mention of the biblical version of creation
by way of illustration does not present a significant risk of
perceived endorsement of Bible-based religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal said reasonable high school or elementary students
would not interpret the disclaimer as a pro-religion message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central message of the disclaimer resolution is that there
are no outsiders or insiders, no one who is favored or disfavored,
on the issue of life's origin but persons of all viewpoints are
full members in the school community.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for those who challenged the disclaimer disagreed. ''By
disclaiming only evolution -- the one element of the school
curriculum that generates religious controversy -- the school board
has violated both the constitutional mandate of neutrality toward
religion and its obligation to provide its students with secular
educations free from religious indoctrination or partisanship,''
they said.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the disclaimer was drafted shortly after the
school board voted 5-4 to reject a proposal to teach
''creation-science'' in the district's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Creation-science teaches that Earth and most life forms came
into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago. Critics have
attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of the Book of
Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that Earth
is billions of years old, and that life forms developed gradually
several million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1987 barred states from requiring the
teaching of creationism in public schools where evolution is
taught, calling such a Louisiana law a thinly veiled attempt to
promote religion.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching of evolution has been controversial since the
famous 1925 ''monkey law'' trial in which teacher John Scopes was
convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution when Tennessee law
made it a crime to teach anything but the Biblical version of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Scopes' conviction later was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme
Court on a procedural matter, and never reached the nation's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education vs. Freiler,
99-1625.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court's three dissenters Monday, Scalia
criticized the court for standing by while an appeals court ''bars
a school district from even suggesting to students that other
theories besides evolution -- including but not limited to, the
biblical theory of creation -- are worthy of their consideration.''

<HEADLINE> Court Limits State Prison Oversight  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reinstated a key provision
in a federal law aimed at limiting federal court oversight of state
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision Monday in an Indiana case said Congress
lawfully imposed a deadline for federal judges considering state
officials' requests that court monitoring and supervision of prison
conditions be ended.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 would
automatically suspend a federal judge's supervision of a state
prison if he or she failed to respond to such a state request
within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court said that provision violates the
constitutionally required separation of powers between the
legislative and judicial branches of government because it is ''a
direct legislative suspension of a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Supreme Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PLRA does not deprive courts of their adjudicatory role,
but merely provides a new legal standard for relief and encourages
courts to apply that standard promptly,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Courts long have responded to inmate lawsuits over prison
conditions by ordering state officials to relieve those that
violate some constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   Congress enacted the 1996 law out of its concern that federal
courts were intruding too far into state prison management. The law
limits a judge's power to order changes in conditions of
confinement ''no further than necessary to correct the violation of
the federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, remedies must be the ''least intrusive means
necessary'' to correct any violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana dispute dates back to a 1975 class-action lawsuit
filed in behalf of inmates at the Pendleton Correctional Facility,
which then was called the Indiana Reformatory.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in 1982 ordered prison authorities to make many
changes and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his
ruling. The appeals court said Congress ''cannot take away the
power of the court in a particular case to preserve the status quo
while it ponders these weighty issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana officials and the Clinton administration appealed to the
Supreme Court. The administration's lawyers argued that the 7th
Circuit court misinterpreted the law, which they said did not strip
judges of the power to ignore the 90-day deadline ''based on
traditional equitable standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The court Monday rejected the administration's interpretation.
''This would be plainly contrary to Congress' intent in enacting
the stay provision,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Duckworth vs. French, 99-224.

<HEADLINE> Court Gives Indians River Rights  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court jeopardized the allocation
rights of urban water users in Arizona and Southern California
today by ruling that an Indian tribe is entitled to seek additional
rights to Colorado River water.
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the Quechan tribe should have
the opportunity to prove its claim that it owns about 25,000 acres
of Fort Yuma Reservation land straddling the river on the border
between the two states.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the tribe is found to be the land's owner, it would have
no claim to the water.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, although it does not end the dispute that in one
form or another has been before the nation's highest court since
1952, is a victory for the tribe and the Clinton administration. It
signals a defeat for Arizona and California officials who had
argued that the tribe sold the disputed land to the federal
government for $15 million in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Quechan tribe's claim is the last unresolved part of a case
that began as a water-use feud between Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, California and six other states appeared on the
verge of a historic agreement that would give Southern California a
15-year deadline to cut its use of Colorado River water.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1922 agreement, California, Arizona and Nevada share 7.5
million acre-feet of water from the river's lower basin, with
California getting 4.4 million, Arizona 2.8 million and Nevada
3,000.
</P>
<P>
   An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or a year's supply of
water for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   The upper basin apportionment is also 7.5 million acre-feet --
with Colorado receiving 3.8 million, Utah 1.7 million, Wyoming 1
million and New Mexico 838,000 in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   But California's average demand over the last decade has been
about 5.2 million acre-feet, and the state traditionally has taken
surplus water from Arizona and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Quechan tribe's claim on river water is relatively small, at
about 1 percent of that allocated from the lower basin.
</P>
<P>
   But the 78,000 acre-feet ''is not an insignificant amount of
water,'' the justices were told when the case was argued in April.
''It comes out of the hide of the Arizona and Southern California
urban water users.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision ordered a court-appointed special master to
study the tribe's claim to the land and, if it is legitimate, how
much water should accompany the land. The special master then would
make a recommendation to the justices, who would decide whether to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe contends it has owned the disputed lands since the
reservation was created in 1893, and that $15 million it was paid
in 1983 was to compensate for previous trespassing and a history of
broken promises by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold that the claims of the United States and the tribe to
increased water rights for the disputed boundary lands of the Fort
Yuma Reservation are not precluded by the consent judgment'' in
1983, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Her opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the three, Rehnquist said the federal government and
the tribe were barred from raising the claim now because it could
have been decided in an earlier phase of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Arizona vs. California, 8 Original.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Limit Use of RICO Law  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused to bar use of a
federal anti-racketeering law against outside professionals accused
of conspiring with a business client to commit fraud even if they
did not help manage or operate the business.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, acting without comment Monday, let stand a federal
appeals court ruling that gave a broad scope to the conspiracy
provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling in January left a law firm and
investment banking firm potentially liable to investors who were
defrauded out of millions of dollars by a now-bankrupt Indianapolis
company.
</P>
<P>
   Firstmark Corporation is a holding company whose subsidiaries
engaged in various financial services. Beginning in the mid-1980s,
the financially shaky Firstmark allegedly sought to conceal its
condition by increasing the margin between the quantity of notes
sold to investors and those redeemed by investors.
</P>
<P>
   As explained by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, those
involved in the scheme ''are alleged to have deceived investors
into purchasing new notes, rolling over current notes or otherwise
refraining from redeeming their notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result was an ever-growing pyramid of debt that forced
Firstmark into bankruptcy in 1988,'' the appeals court said, with
investors owed $57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors sued Firstmark and others -- including the
underwriting firm Raffensperger, Hughes &AMP; Co. and the Indianapolis
law Barnes &AMP; Thornburg that had done work for Firstmark.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge threw out the case against those two
defendants, relying on a 1993 Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the nation's highest court said the RICO law cannot be
used to sue outside professionals if they did not help manage or
operate an allegedly fraudulent business.
</P>
<P>
   The law, aimed primarily at fighting mobsters, has both criminal
and civil provisions. It is considered a potent legal weapon
because, unlike federal securities anti-fraud laws, it offers
successful plaintiffs triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit court, however, reinstated both firms as
defendants and ruled that the 1993 Supreme Court decision does not
govern allegations against outside professionals filed under RICO's
conspiracy provisions.
</P>
<P>
   To be liable under those provisions, the appeals court said,
''one must knowingly agree to perform services of a kind which
facilitate the activities of those who are operating the enterprise
in an illegal manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Its decision said an illegal conspiracy ''is an agreement, not
to operate or manage the enterprise, but personally to facilitate
the activities of those who do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for the law firm and
underwriting firm said the 7th Circuit court's ruling allows all
RICO plaintiffs to circumvent the liability limitation the Supreme
Court imposed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''It creates civil and criminal liability where Congress has not
imposed it,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Raffensperger, Hughes &AMP; Co. v. Brouwer, 99-1637.

<HEADLINE> Girls Ordered To Prove Gender Lose  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Oglala Sioux girls who were
required to prove their gender before playing in a 1995 basketball
tournament in Rapid City, S.D., lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, refused to revive a lawsuit by the
girls and their mothers against the tournament's sponsor, their
school and others.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, contending that the incident left the girls
depressed and embarrassed, sought to collect monetary damages for
racial and sexual discrimination, invasion of privacy, intentional
infliction of emotional distress and mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts threw out the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, all 10 to 12 years old at the time, represented the
Pine Ridge Reservation's Loneman School in a tournament sponsored
by the Young Men's Christian Association.
</P>
<P>
   After the Loneman team won a semifinal game against the Hermosa
School, that team's coach complained that one or more of the
Loneman squad's eight members were really boys.
</P>
<P>
   Before the championship game, the eight Loneman team members
were taken into a restroom where the girls demonstrated that each
was in fact a female.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 lawsuit named the YMCA, the Loneman School, the Custer
School District (where the Hermosa School is located) and various
individuals as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge dismissed the case after ruling, among
other things, that the girls and their mothers had failed to offer
any proof of racial or sexual bias.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal acted on Monday argued that the girls and their
mothers were not given enough time to gather evidence that might
have pointed to racial and sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''No other teams were subjected to the search. ... The Indian
coach's word that his players were female was not sufficient to end
the matter when challenged by a white team and coach,'' the appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Davenport v. YMCA, 99-1732.

<HEADLINE> Play About Ellington Comes to TV  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The musical ''Play On,'' based on Shakespeare's
''Twelfth Night'' and fortified with 20 songs by Duke Ellington,
ran on Broadway in 1997 and has since been touring the country.
</P>
<P>
   When it was staged at the Pasadena Playhouse in California last
fall, it was filmed for TV. That performance will be shown
Wednesday from 9 to 11 p.m. Eastern, as a ''Great Performances''
presentation of Thirteen/WNET.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington's granddaughter, Mercedes Ellington, choreographed
''Play On,'' which is set in Harlem in the 1940s. The idea of
adapting ''Twelfth Night'' and using Ellington songs that fit the
story belonged to Sheldon Epps, artistic director of the Pasadena
Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sheldon thought he'd bring these two great men together,''
Mercedes says. ''He didn't know they'd already met.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellington, who died in 1974, had immersed himself in
Shakespeare, and composed ''Such Sweet Thunder,'' music for the
Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Canada. Mercedes gave Epps the
recording.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Play On,'' a young woman named Vy arrives in New York from
a small town to meet her Uncle Jester in Harlem. She hopes to show
some of the songs she has written to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Women don't write songs, Jester tells her. He dresses her as a
man, calls her Vy-Man, and introduces her to Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington, meanwhile, is pining for a glamorous jazz singer
named Lady Liv, and sends Vy-Man to her as a go-between. Lady Liv
has an uptight assistant called the Rev and a comic dresser named
Miss Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Ellington had plenty of scope for creating dances, and
the camera work for TV captures them to fine advantage. When Vy
arrives at Grand Central Station, she sings ''Drop Me Off in
Harlem.'' That leads into ''Take the A Train,'' with Vy in the
center of the dancing ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The opening is so vigorous that the dancers get short of breath,
and the leading actors backstage are miked to join in on singing
''A Train.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I did a lot of modern stuff for the dancers in the station,''
Mercedes says. ''Then it explodes into color and swing when they
get to Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Raum Ruffin as Duke Ellington, the eight principals
also dance. Mercedes has changed the choreography for each new cast
in each city, taking advantage of individual strengths, the way her
grandfather would change musical arrangements when new musicians
joined his band.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Venetia Belcon, who plays Vy in the televised
performance, has the most dance training of anyone who has played
the part, Mercedes says, so her character dances more than in
previous versions. Nikki Crawford and Richard Allen, hired for
their rich voices as Lady Liv and the Rev, also do a lot of
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes' mentor, choreographer Donald Saddler, told her to be
true to the period of the show. She had danced his choreography in
the revival of the 1920s ''No, No, Nanette'' on Broadway, and, ''He
taught me to have respect and not make fun of people, to be genuine
and to start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Play On,'' she used tap, soft shoe and jitterbug but no
modern jazz dancing. She watched 1940s films with scenes of people
doing the dances of the day. ''The show's dancers are trained. I
want them to look like people who did not have that training.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music is basically swing,'' Mercedes says. ''The dance for
'I'm Beginning To See the Light' is jitterbug. People who are old
enough can look at it and say, 'I used to do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes is the oldest child of Mercer Ellington, Duke
Ellington's only child, who died in 1996. Mercer was a classmate of
Luther Henderson's at Juilliard, where they both studied music.
Henderson arranged the music for ''Play On.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Juilliard, too, Mercedes studied dance, and her
first job was as a dancer in ''West Side Story'' in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   As choreographer For ''Play On,'' she eagerly awaited each day's
rehearsals with the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see them make the transition from the '90s to the '40s was
a great feeling,'' she says. ''It's like it wasn't a job.''

   MORE POIROT: Fans of a certain vain, fussy sleuth can rejoice:
Two more feature-length Poirot mysteries are in the works for
airing on A&AMP;E next year, the cable network has announced. David
Suchet, who first portrayed the character in 1988, will be back as
the Belgian hero of Agatha Christie's famed series of page-turners.
The new films, both of which begin production in July, include
''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and ''Evil Under the Sun.'' They bring to
four the Poirot films commissioned by A&AMP;E since the original series
ended in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 57, Nasdaq Up 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Monday, with blue-chip
financial and technology shares leading the way. Intel led the Dow
Jones industrial average higher after announcing plans to expand
its chip-making facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In late-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow average was up
57.28 at 10,506.58.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 5.61 at 1,470.07, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 12.51 at 3,873.07. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 0.44 to 514.18.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were bouncing back from steep losses on Friday,
when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks will have
trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $3 to $121.50 and Citigroup rose 93.75 cents to
$63.688. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $3.25 to $84.375.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intel rose $5.688 to $131.75. The company said it will
invest $2 billion in a new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers
analyst Dan Niles said Intel's stock price should reach $175 within
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 262.67 million
shares at late morning, well behind Friday's busy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected trading to remain fairly quiet and volatile
this week. The Federal Reserve will announce its next decision on
interest rates on June 28, leaving many investors unwilling to
stake out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the market was rattled by some of the first signs
that rising interest rates are beginning to take a toll on
corporate profits. With the second quarter winding down, companies
are in the midst of the ''preannouncement'' period leading up to
next month's earnings reports, giving Wall Street advance notice of
any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said any company that misses profit expectations is
likely to face a harsh penalty in the market. To hedge against wild
fluctuations, investors are seeking out defensive stocks, like
utility and drug shares, whose earnings are not tied entirely to
the strength of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''An economic slowdown would translate into lower corporate
earnings,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg. ''The predictability of earnings will become a prime
concern of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming week will give investors little new guidance on the
strength of the economy. A report on the trade deficit, due out
Tuesday, is the only economic report expected to influence the
market this week.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Japan's
version of the technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market opened on
Monday, with eight stocks trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange. It
plans to introduce its own trading system next year linked to and
modeled after the original Nasdaq market.

<HEADLINE> Justices Make HMO Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ordered a lower court Monday
to reconsider whether a Pennsylvania health maintenance
organization can be sued in state court by a man who says
inadequate care left him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ordered Pennsylvania courts to restudy the case in
light of the Supreme Court's ruling last week that barred some
federal lawsuits by patients against HMOs. That decision said
patients cannot use a federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a
financial incentive to cut treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday in a similar case, the justices turned down an
appeal by an HMO in New Jersey that sought to fend off a lawsuit by
a couple whose newborn baby died after being sent home from the
hospital one day after birth.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involve a federal law that governs employee benefits
known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. The
HMOs argued that the lawsuits against them belonged in federal
court under ERISA, which bars damage awards to compensate for harm
caused by improper processing of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania case began with a lawsuit by Basile Pappas of
Newtown Square who said inadequate care left him a quadriplegic. He
went to Haverford Community Hospital with a spinal problem, and his
HMO refused to authorize his transfer to a hospital outside the HMO
network for specialized emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas settled his claim against a doctor and Haverford. The
hospital then sued the HMO, United States Healthcare Systems of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge said the federal law pre-empted the lawsuit. But
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court let the lawsuit go forward, saying
it was a negligence claim that belonged in state court.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey case was filed by Steven and Michelle Bauman over
the death of their 2-day-old daughter from meningitis after being
sent home from a hospital in Washington township one day after
birth. Their HMO, U.S. Healthcare, had a 24-hour discharge policy
for normal births.
</P>
<P>
   The Baumans' lawsuit accused the HMO of providing inadequate
care. The HMO moved the case to federal court, saying it was
pre-empted by the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case returned
to state court. The federal law does not pre-empt state lawsuits
over the quality of care, the court said, even though it does bar
state lawsuits over erroneously withheld benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeals acted on Monday, the HMOs' lawyers said the
lawsuits did not involve the quality of care but HMOs'
administrative decisions on what treatment to offer. Therefore,
they said the state cases were pre-empted by ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Baumans and the Haverford hospital's insurers
said ERISA does not displace state courts' role in hearing claims
of inadequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are United States Healthcare Systems of Pennsylvania
vs. Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., 98-1836, and U.S.
Healthcare vs. Bauman, 99-1383.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Supreme Court Decisions  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   --SCHOOL PRAYER: The court ruled that public schools
cannot let
students lead stadium crowds in prayer before high school football
games. The 6-3 decision in a Texas case said such prayers violate
the constitutionally required separation of government and
religion. The decision could carry enormous significance beyond
football games or other high school sports events. ''School
sponsorship of a religious message is impermissible because it
sends the ancillary message to members of the audience who are
nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the
political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that
they are insiders, favored members of the political community,''
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   --STATES-FOREIGN POLICY: The court, ruling that states cannot
infringe on the foreign policy-making prerogatives of the U.S.
government, made it harder for states to refuse to buy from
companies that do business in nations known for human-rights
abuses. The court voted unanimously to throw out a Massachusetts
law that limits state purchases from companies doing business with
Myanmar, also known as Burma. The law is pre-empted by the federal
government's own sanctions against Myanmar, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   PRISONS -- The court on a 5-4 vote reinstated a key provision in
a federal law aimed at limiting federal court oversight of state
prisons. The decision in an Indiana case said Congress lawfully
imposed a deadline for federal judges considering state officials'
requests that court monitoring and supervision of prison conditions
be ended. Part of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 would
automatically suspend a federal judge's supervision of a state
prison if he or she failed to respond to such a state request
within 90 days. On Monday, the court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   EVOLUTION: The justices refused to let a public school district
require that the teaching of evolution be accompanied by a
disclaimer mentioning ''the biblical version of creation'' and
other teachings on life's origin. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, let
stand rulings that struck down a Louisiana school board's
disclaimer policy as a violation of the constitutionally required
separation of government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   WATER RIGHTS: The court jeopardized the allocation rights of
urban water users in Arizona and Southern California by ruling that
an Indian tribe is entitled to seek additional rights to Colorado
River water. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the Quechan tribe
should have the opportunity to prove its claim that it owns about
25,000 acres of Fort Yuma Reservation land straddling the river on
the border between the two states. Unless the tribe is found to be
the land's owner, it would have no claim to the water.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Monday, with blue-chip
financial and technology shares leading the way. Trading was
volatile, with every major index struggling to hold onto early
gains.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow average was up 20.51
at 10,496.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

was up 7.70 at 3,868.26. The Russell 2000 index of smaller

</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were bouncing back from steep losses on Friday,
when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks will have
trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $2.375 to $121.875 and Citigroup rose 87.5
cents to $63.625. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $3.125 to $84.25.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intel rose $5.813 to $131.875. The company said it will
invest $2 billion in a new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers
analyst Dan Niles said Intel's stock price should reach $175 within
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But Honeywell International, an industrial company formed by the
merger of AlliedSignal and Honeywell, fell $7.563 to $41.188,
undermining the Dow's advance. Although Honeywell hasn't made any
official statement, analysts have begun questioning the company's
second-quarter profit outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about corporate profits have returned to the market as
companies enter the ''preannouncement'' period leading up to next
month's earnings reports, giving Wall Street advance notice of any
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While profit growth is expected to be quite strong, early
reports have suggested that rising interest rates are beginning to
take a toll. The market's strike against Honeywell proved that any
company perceived as facing earnings problems is likely to face a
harsh penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''An economic slowdown would translate into lower corporate
earnings,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg. ''The predictability of earnings will become a prime

<HEADLINE> Justices To Hear Sex Shops' Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to clarify
whether adult bookstores that are denied city licenses must be
allowed to continue operating while they go to court to appeal the
denial.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear a Waukesha, Wis., bookstore's
argument that licensing laws that act as a prior restraint on
speech must prevent harm to free-speech rights during a court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   City News and Novelty sold sexually explicit books and
videotapes, and each year renewed its city license to operate an
adult business.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995 it applied for renewal, but the city council
rejected the application, saying the store had allowed minors to
loiter at the store and let patrons engage in sexual activity in
the store's viewing booths.
</P>
<P>
   City officials rejected the store's administrative appeal. A
state court also ruled for the city, as did the Wisconsin Court of
Appeals, although it threw out one part of the ordinance involving
requirements for a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled against the store's argument that the
ordinance was unlawful because it did not allow the store to
continue operating as an adult bookstore while the case was in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The city cannot order state courts to rule promptly on such
cases, the appeals court said. Such an ordinance is lawful as long
as prompt judicial review is available, the court said, disagreeing
with other courts that have said the status quo must be preserved
until a final court ruling is made.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on Monday, the bookstore's lawyer said the
ordinance ''has the potential for long-term suppression of
expression prior to any type of judicial review.'' Such ordinances
should be required to spell out that a company must be allowed to
continue operating during a court appeal, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   City News and Novelty is currently operating as a nonadult
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The case is City News and Novelty v. City of Waukesha, 99-1680.

<HEADLINE> Fashion World Honors Its Desginers  </HEADLINE>
By SAMANTHA CRITCHELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Any line that remained between the worlds of
fashion and entertainment was erased at the American Fashion
Awards, often called the Oscars of the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Designers Jean-Paul Gaultier, Vera Wang, Betsey Johnson and
Kenneth Cole strode the red carpet leading into Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall like runway pros, then watched supermodels and
starlets do the same, wearing their designs.
</P>
<P>
   First the clothes, then the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Actress/model Elizabeth Hurley, in a pink strapless column gown,
and supermodel Claudia Schiffer, in a black dress with white polka
dots and tiers of ruffles, wore Valentino, who was presented an
award for lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Michele of NBC's ''ER'' wore a long black tank dress
with a pleated bottom by Carolina Herrera. Esther Canadas, one of
Donna Karan's favorite supermodels, chose (not surprisingly) an
olive Donna Karan halter-top gown with sequins. Supermodel Naomi
Campbell, ''Will &AMP; Grace'' actor Sean Hayes and designer Randolph
Duke also walked the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Sean ''Puffy'' Combs, nominated as a new menswear designer for
his Sean John clothing line (he didn't win), wore a pink Versace
tuxedo. His sneakers had color-coordinated pink stripes. Combs was
a standout. Most of the men played it safe in traditional formal
wear.
</P>
<P>
   The women were more daring. Halter, sheer and beaded tops were
popular. Purple was hot; big designer jewels were not. The pashmina
wrap was nowhere in sight, signaling the end of its status as the
accessory of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the awards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the history of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America that the winners weren't announced in advance.
Both established designers and fresh faces were honored.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta won the womenswear award. Helmut Lang, who was
nominated in three categories, won the menswear award. Richard
Lambertson and John Truex of Lambertson Truex won the award for
accessories. Gaultier received an international award.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the Perry Ellis Award for new designers were Miguel
Adrover for womenswear, John Varvatos for menswear and Dean Harris
for accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The awards presentation was patterned after the big-budget Oscar
and Emmy shows, with retrospectives and heavy statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   With images of Barbra Streisand in Scaasi, Cher in Bob Mackie
and Gwyneth Paltrow in Ralph Lauren flashing onstage, actress Ellen
Barkin paid a special tribute to the Oscars for providing a global
stage for fashion designers.
</P>
<P>
   She also thanked the designers ''who make it easy for us to walk
down the red carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   Host Sandra Bernhard wore many outfits during the evening,
including a black cowl-neck top, long leather coat and a man's hat,
a takeoff on Samuel L. Jackson's role as New York Police Detective
John Shaft in the new ''Shaft'' film directed by John Singleton.
(The film, an update of the 1970s detective franchise, took in an
estimated $21.1 million in its weekend debut.)
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard promised -- and delivered -- a fast and interesting show.
After all, the winners were tabulated by Ernst &AMP; Young, ''the most
fashionable accountants,'' she told the audience. This was in sharp
contrast to last year's show, which dragged on for hours.

   In presenting the evening's final honor to Valentino, Ashley
Judd noted how important designers and their beautiful gowns are to
Hollywood actresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel utterly gorgeous in this dress,'' said Judd, wearing
Valentino's white scoop-neck tiered gown with fringe at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Valentino's acceptance speech was interrupted by several
anti-fur protesters. But the crowd drowned out their shouts with
applause until security guards removed them from the auditorium.
Valentino then made a brief speech -- an obvious departure from the
Oscars -- and graciously said he bowed to the audience and the
American public for their support.

<HEADLINE> Royal Opera House Chief Quits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The American credited with getting the Britain's
troubled Royal Opera House back on track announced Monday he would
resign as executive director next year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kaiser, 47, joined the Royal Opera House in November
1998 after three other directors left in quick succession. Before
Kaiser's arrival, the opera house had twice faced insolvency, and
the entire board had resigned after criticism from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The house is now on solid financial ground, having reopened in
November after a three-year, $350 million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his staff, Kaiser said he would resign at the end
of the coming season in June 2001 for ''personal reasons,'' calling
the decision ''the most profoundly difficult one of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of the opera house's board,
praised Kaiser's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael's achievements during his tenure at the Royal Opera
House have been countless,'' Southgate said. ''He has approached
this enormously challenging job with unrelenting energy, commitment
and determination. The Royal Opera House is now on a very sure
footing both financially and artistically, and we owe him a huge
debt of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser joined the opera house from New York's American Ballet
Theater, which he also is credited with rescuing from financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters at London's Covent Garden site have been home to opera
since 1732, with some of the most important productions in opera
history getting their English debuts there.
</P>
<P>
   Since the marriage of the opera and ballet companies under the
umbrella of the Royal Opera House in 1946, the list of performers
gracing the Covent Garden stage reads like a who's-who of the
20th-century arts.

<HEADLINE> Congress Funds Tobacco-Cancer Study  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Can tobacco cure cancer?
</P>
<P>
   Legislation passed recently by Congress devotes $3 million to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The money, part of a $7.1 billion package of aid to farmers,
will go toward research on the use of tobacco plants to cultivate a
vaccine against cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million will be shared by North Carolina State University
and Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Dretchen, dean of research at Georgetown University
Medical Center, said the goal is to take genetic material from the
human papiloma virus and incorporate it into tobacco seeds. ''When
the plant grows the fragments multiply,'' he said, and can be
harvested to make a vaccine that researchers hope can attack
cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C., who faces a potentially difficult race
for re-election, claimed credit for the research money in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This funding could represent a brighter future for North
Carolina tobacco farmers and potentially a giant leap forward for
women's health around the world,'' he said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   His office said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who was one of the
lawmakers involved in allocating the $7.1 billion in farm money,
pushed for funding the research.

<HEADLINE> Businessman Wants To Go to Mir  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAR CITY, Russia (AP) -- An American investment manager
announced plans Monday to hitch a multimillion-dollar ride on the
Russian Mir space station as the first tourist in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Tito, a former rocket scientist from Santa Monica,
Calif., hopes to make the trip next year. The trim, energetic
59-year-old said he has wanted to travel to space ever since
hearing of the launch of the first satellite, more than 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted to fly and hopefully that will be my
opportunity to realize my life's dream,'' Tito told reporters at
the Star City space center near Moscow, a mixture of training
facilities and shabby apartment buildings dating from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came three days after two Russian cosmonauts
returned to Earth after spending more than two months performing
repairs and maintenance on the 14-year-old space station. The Mir
had been flying unmanned for some eight months before their trip,
which was funded by the same private investors who have offered
Tito a ride on Mir.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands-based MirCorp stepped in after officials of
Russia's cash-strapped space program warned the Mir would be
decommissioned if investors could not be found to keep it aloft.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp and Tito are still negotiating the fee for the
approximately weeklong trip to Mir, and MirCorp president Jeffrey
Manber said the price tag was expected to be tens of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier plan to put tourists on the Mir flopped after the
British businessman being touted as a candidate turned out not to
be a multimillionaire. Peter Llewelyn had reportedly promised to
pay $100 million to fly on the Mir, but later said he never
intended to pay for the flight, planning instead to seek sponsors
for each mile he traveled and use the funds to build a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In another colorful attempt to keep the Mir afloat, a Russian
filmmaker pledged to pay the space agency to send up an actor to
film scenes for a movie about a renegade cosmonaut. That plan
fizzled weeks before the actor was to blast off in April, when the
space agency said it hadn't received any money for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, Manber said he expected other
''citizen explorers'' would follow Tito's example. He said
investors were showing increasing interest in the company's plans
to open the first Internet portal in space, which would be capable
of relaying live images of the Earth surface, and its plans to
produce highly pure medicines and alloys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are receiving a very good reception from international
investors,'' Manber said. ''They believe in the Mir space
station.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito is the founder of Wilshire Associates, an investment
management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Before he qualifies for the flight, Tito will be subjected to
grueling tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be going through months of training,'' Manber said.
''There is no sacrifice of safety. We all understand the steps
necessary to send a person into space.''
</P>
<P>
   Mir has been the site of a series of accidents and breakdowns,
including a terrifying fire and a near-fatal collision with a cargo
ship in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Tito said he studied Mir's record and was convinced the
space station is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian space program has a very excellent safety record
and I feel that the risks are very low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tito said he had successfully passed a crucial centrifugal test
and several other preliminary exams, but has many more to go before
he's judged fit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Before he goes into orbit, another team of cosmonauts will be
sent to the space station to resuscitate it after the unmanned
flight. No date for that mission has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The two cosmonauts who touched down last week, Sergei Zalyotin
and Alexander Kaleri, said Monday the space station was in fine
working shape.
</P>
<P>
   If found fit, Tito would travel to Mir with two Russian
cosmonauts. It's still not clear what he would do for a week on the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to experience space. That is my first desire,'' he
said. ''I want to be able to assist the crew where I can, not be a
burden to the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian space officials view MirCorp as the only hope to save
the space station, the last symbol of the once glorious Soviet
space program that put the first satellite in orbit and the first
person into space. The firm is 60 percent owned by RKK Energiya,
the Russian company that built and operates the Mir; the rest is
owned by private investors.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has objected to Moscow's decision to extend Mir's life,
saying it diverts scarce Russian resources from the International
Space Station project. The new station is behind schedule because
of Russia's failure to deliver a key component, the Zvezda service
module, currently set to be launched July 12.

<HEADLINE> Cellini's 'Perseus' Back on Display  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- After 3&AMP;frac12; years of restoration work,
Benvenuto Cellini's massive bronze statue of Perseus was returned
to public view Monday in Piazza della Signoria.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-foot baroque masterpiece was first placed in the square
in Florence upon its completion in 1554. In December 1996, the
Uffizi Galleries moved ''Perseus'' to a room 100 yards away, where
a team of artists cleaned the statue.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tourists watched Monday as the towering sculpture
was lifted across the square by a crane.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, financed by a bank in Florence, cost about $1
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Monday, with blue-chip
financial and technology shares leading the way. Honeywell
International became the latest big name to warn that its
second-quarter earnings will miss expectations, and its stock
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   In early-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 73.89 at 10,523.19.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 11.28 at 1,475.74, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 50.41 at 3,910.97. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 1.95 to 515.69.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were bouncing back from steep losses on Friday,
when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks will have
trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $3 to $121.50 and Citigroup rose $1.25 to $64.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $4.563 to $85.688.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intel rose $7.625 to $133.688. The company said it will
invest $2 billion in a new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers
analyst Dan Niles said Intel's stock price should reach $175 within
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But Honeywell fell $7.938 to $40.813, undermining the Dow's
advance. Confirming speculation that swirled around Wall Street in
morning trading, the industrial company said it expects earnings to
come in between 73 cents and 77 cents a share, below analysts'
forecasts of 78 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell, which was formed in 1999 by the merger of
AlliedSignal and Honeywell, cited unexpected parts shortages in its
aerospace unit, higher-than-expected raw material prices in its
performance materials unit and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about corporate profits have returned to the market as
companies enter the ''preannouncement'' period leading up to next
month's earnings reports, giving Wall Street advance notice of any
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While profit growth is expected to be quite strong, early
reports have suggested that rising interest rates are beginning to
take a toll. The market's strike against Honeywell proved that any
company facing earnings problems is likely to face a harsh penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''An economic slowdown would translate into lower corporate
earnings,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg. ''The predictability of earnings will become a prime
concern of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 560.25 million shares
in the early afternoon, well behind Friday's busy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected trading to remain fairly quiet and volatile
this week. The Federal Reserve will announce its next decision on
interest rates on June 28, leaving many investors unwilling to
stake out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   The coming week will give investors little new guidance on the
strength of the economy. A report on the trade deficit, due out
Tuesday, is the only economic report expected to influence the
market this week.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Japan's
version of the technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market opened on
Monday, with eight stocks trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange. It
plans to introduce its own trading system next year linked to and
modeled after the original Nasdaq market.

<HEADLINE> Food Safety Mistakes Caught on Tape  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Think you're savvy about food safety? That you
wash your hands well, scrub away germs, cook your meat properly?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists put cameras in the kitchens of 100 families in Logan,
Utah, who thought they did a pretty good job. What was caught on
tape in this middle-class, well-educated college town suggests why
food poisoning hits so many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   People skipped soap when hand-washing. Used the same towel to
wipe up raw meat juice as to dry their hands. Made a salad without
washing the lettuce. Undercooked the meat loaf. One even tasted the
marinade in which bacteria-ridden raw fish had soaked.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the mom who handled raw chicken and then fixed
her infant a bottle without washing her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Or another mom who merely rinsed her baby's juice bottle after
it fell into raw eggs -- no soap against the salmonella that can
lurk in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shocking,'' was Utah State University nutritionist Janet
Anderson's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But experts call this typical of the average U.S. household:
Everybody commits at least some safety sins when they're hurried,
distracted by fussy kids or ringing phones, simply not thinking
about germs. Even Anderson made changes in her own kitchen after
watching the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration funded Anderson's
$50,000 study to detect just how cooks slip up. The ultimate goal
is to improve education of consumers on how to protect themselves
from the food poisoning that strikes 76 million Americans each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the great barriers in getting people to change is they
think they're doing such a good job already,'' said FDA consumer
research chief Alan Levy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show most Americans blame restaurants for foodborne
illnesses. Asked if they follow basic bacteria-fighting tips --
listed on the Internet at http://www.fightbac.org -- most insist
they're scrupulous in their own kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy says most food poisonings probably occur at home. The
videotapes suggest why.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have no idea'' they're messing up, said Anderson. ''You
just go in the kitchen and it's something you don't think about.''
</P>
<P>
   She described preliminary study results at a food meeting last
week, but promised the families anonymity and so she didn't show
the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   For $50 and free groceries, families agreed to be filmed. Their
kitchens looked clean, and presumably they were on best behavior,
but they didn't know it was a safety study. Hoping to see real-life
hygiene, scientists called the experiment ''market research'' on
how people cooked a special recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists bought ingredients for a salad plus either Mexican
meat loaf, marinaded halibut or herb-breaded chicken breasts with
mustard sauce -- recipes designed to catch safety slip-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras started rolling as the cooks put away the groceries.
</P>
<P>
   And there was mistake No. 1: Only a quarter stored raw meat and
seafood on the refrigerator's bottom shelf so other foods don't get
contaminated by dripping juices.
</P>
<P>
   Mistake No. 2: Before starting to cook, only 45 percent washed
their hands. Of those, 16 percent didn't use soap.
</P>
<P>
   You're supposed to wash hands often while cooking, especially
after handling raw meat. But on average, each cook skipped seven
times that Anderson said they should have washed. Only a third
consistently used soap -- many just rinsed and wiped their hands on
a dish towel.
</P>
<P>
   That dish towel became Anderson's nightmare. Using paper towels
to clean up raw meat juice is safest. But dozens wiped the
countertop with that cloth dish towel -- further spreading germs the
next time they dried their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty percent didn't wash the lettuce; others placed salad
ingredients on meat-contaminated counters.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists checked the finished meal with thermometers, and
Anderson found ''alarming'' results: 35 percent who made the meat
loaf undercooked it, 42 percent undercooked the chicken and 17
percent undercooked the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Must you use a thermometer? Anderson says just because the meat
isn't pink doesn't always mean it got hot enough to kill bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's study found gaps in food-safety campaigns. FDA's
''Fight Bac'' antibacteria program doesn't stress washing
vegetables. And Levy calls those dirty dish towels troubling;
expect more advice stressing paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's main message: ''If people would simply wash their
hands and clean food surfaces after handling raw meat, so many of
the errors would be taken care of.''

   Investors' concerns about corporate earnings set the tone for

of the technology companies that are expected to post the strongest
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>

after strong earnings,'' he said. ''That means technology companies
that do hardware and infrastructure.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Would Want Barbara Walters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- If Barbara Walters is thinking about jumping
ship when her ABC contract expires this fall, CBS News would gladly
welcome her aboard, according to TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she is open to exploring a future at CBS. CBS News
President Andrew Heyward had dinner with her recently to discuss
the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people (at CBS) whom I like and admire, and I'm
happy to hear what they have to say,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Walters denied that exploring options outside ABC, where she has
worked for 24 years, had anything to do with a rivalry with Diane
Sawyer -- for example, the network's decision to schedule Sawyer's
newsmagazine ''Prime Time Thursday'' after the popular ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Diane and I are friends and colleagues. We have not had any
problems with each other. I can't remember the last time we had any
severe problems or situations,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   She insisted her dinner meeting with Heyward was not arranged
because she was dissatisfied, ''but because it's always interesting
to see what's out there.''

<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- A plane piloted by Harrison Ford sustained
minor damage while trying to land in shifting winds.
</P>
<P>
   The actor was at the controls of the six-passenger Beechcraft
Bonanza when it touched down at Lincoln Municipal Airport on Sunday
night. The ''Indiana Jones'' star and an unidentified passenger
were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was bound for Lincoln from Fort Wayne, Ind., when Ford
''reported wind shear as he was coming in for a landing and clipped
the runway,'' said Elizabeth Isham Cory of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She said the plane damaged its wing tips.
</P>
<P>
   Ford could not immediately be reached for comment. His
whereabouts were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Jane Seymour Inaugurates Hike Trail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Jane Seymour on Monday helped inaugurate
a hiking trail through Irish landscapes that have served as the
backdrop for a number of Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   The actress is in Ireland filming ''Yesterday's Children.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail meanders through scenic County Wicklow. Hikers will
guide themselves with the help of storyboards detailing the area's
movie connections.
</P>
<P>
   Among the movies featured on the trail are ''Michael Collins,''
''Braveheart,'' ''Angela's Ashes,'' ''My Left Foot'' and ''The Spy
Who Came in From the Cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rowley of Ireland's Millennium Committee, which helped pay
for the project, said he expects it to be a huge tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Visitors will have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of
some of the legends of the cinema as they visit the places where
memorable scenes were shot,'' Rowley said.

<HEADLINE> Musicians Battle Rep. Coble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., has crossed
swords with Don Henley and upset other big-name musicians with a
four-line amendment to copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   Henley recently referred to the veteran congressman as ''a
pygmy'' and complained that recording artists got ''reamed in
Washington'' courtesy of Coble and some of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   He even wrote a song about it; it is the title track of Henley's
just-released album, ''Inside Job.''
</P>
<P>
   Coble, chairman of a House subcommittee on copyright issues,
seemed puzzled by Henley's anger over the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy, I didn't even know until he started raising hell,''
Coble said. ''Should I know him? I wouldn't know him if he walked
in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Performers are upset about an amendment to copyright law that
Coble helped put into an unrelated bill on home satellites late
last year. The amendment received congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies requested the provision, which affects
ownership of recorded music 35 years after its release.
</P>
<P>
   Artists believe the provision robs them of the right to reclaim
ownership of their old recordings from record labels. The recording
companies contend the artists never really had that right to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   Coble said he believes the amendment merely put into law what is
accepted practice in the industry.

<HEADLINE> What's Still Allowed in Prayer Form  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some prayers and religious activities still are
allowed in
public schools, despite the Supreme Court's decision Monday barring
public schools from letting students lead stadium crowds in prayer
before football games. Some examples:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --Individual students are free to pray, as the court said, ''at
any time before, during or after the schoolday'' as long as their
prayers do not interfere with other students.
</P>
<P>
   --Groups of students can meet for prayer or worship, either
informally or as a formal school organization as long as other
student clubs are allowed at school.
</P>
<P>
   --All students are allowed to pray before eating a school meal,
as long as their prayers are not disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   --In some states, lower court rulings allow student-led prayers --
invocations and benedictions -- at graduation ceremonies. Monday's
decision could provide new ammunition for attacks against such
public school policies. In other states, such prayers are banned by
lower court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   --Some states and public school districts let school officials
provide a daily ''moment of silence'' during which students who
want to pray can do so. The court struck down such an Alabama law
in 1985, saying the law encouraged students to pray. But the court
never has said a truly neutral moment-of-silence law runs afoul of
the constitutionally required separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision could make it harder for moment-of-silence
laws and policies to survive court scrutiny. ''It is ... the duty
of the courts to distinguish a sham secular purpose from a sincere
one,'' the justices said.

<HEADLINE> 'Rogue State' Term Softened  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The term ''rogue state,'' generally applied by
the State Department to nations on its list of countries that
sponsor terrorism, has been stricken from the official lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   It has been replaced by the more benign ''states of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday the change was instituted
because of a ''certain evolution'' among some countries in the
rogue state category.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some places that were described that way have embarked upon
more democratic internal life,'' Boucher explained. ''Others have
been willing to address some of the issues that are of primary
concern to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Libya, for example, may no longer be as entrenched in
the terrorism camp as it once was, but he noted that many questions
remain unanswered about its alleged role in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the change in terminology does not necessarily mean
a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're able to encourage them (the former rogue states) or
pressure them or otherwise produce changes in their behavior, and
therefore change in our relationship, we're willing to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're not, then we're going to keep our sanctions on,
we're going to keep our restrictions on, and we're not going to
change our policies.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher talked about the stylistic change on the day that the
United States eased sanctions against North Korea, once among the
most disreputable of ''rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, North Korea has achieved more respectability in
official circles because of the tension-relieving summit last week
between the leaders of North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the rogue state tag was first disclosed Monday by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as she was asked about the
countries so designated during an interview with Diane Rehm, host
of a talk show on WAMU, a local radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the term had actually been dropped some time ago
without announcement. Just as there was no official list of rogue
states, there is none for states of concern, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, the rogue state label has been applied most
frequently to North Korea, Iran and Iraq -- countries considered to
be among the most likely to attack the United States with a long
range missile.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries are favorite targets of proponents of a
national missile defense. They claim such protection is needed
because the United States has no way of intercepting such
launchings at present.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Reviews Missile Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of the Pentagon's missile defense
project by a panel of independent experts found no fatal flaw but
questioned whether it can be completed by 2005 as scheduled,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon set 2005 as its goal for completing the project
because it coincides with the CIA's estimate of when North Korean
is likely to have a long-range ballistic missile capable of
striking American territory.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not yet given the go-ahead to build a
national missile defense, but the Pentagon is proceeding under a
congressional requirement to develop the required technologies as
quickly as it can.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that the technology for shooting down
missiles in space is fatally flawed because a hostile nation could
fool U.S. interceptor rockets by using decoys and other measures.
The independent review panel advised the Pentagon to put more
emphasis on overcoming such decoys, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of former military officers and weapons scientists,
headed by retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, presented its
conclusions in a classified report to Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who is preparing to make a recommendation to Clinton in
August on whether to move forward with deployment.
</P>
<P>
   A newly released report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, makes similar points. The GAO report
notes that key decisions about moving ahead with missile defense
are scheduled to be made this year before the actual rocket used to
boost the missile interceptor into space is fully tested.
</P>
<P>
   The booster to be used in the next missile intercept test, in
early July, is a stand-in for the three-stage rocket that would be
part of an actual missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization that is running the project, said his
office is confident the actual booster will be ready for use in
flight tests in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be a problem,'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides questions about feasibility, some critics question the
cost of missile defense. The Pentagon estimates that a system with
100 missile interceptors would cost $36 billion over a 20-year
operational life.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told reporters
Monday that he believes missile defense ''can be affordable,'' but
he added that ''We don't have great definition on how much (it) is
going to cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite cautioning that the project's timetable may be overly
ambitious, the Welch panel concluded that the missile defense
system is technically feasible and eventually could be made to work
reliably, according to a senior defense official who has seen the
report. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers saw ''no reason to change the schedule at
present,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions, first reported Sunday by The Washington Post,
carry considerable weight with Pentagon decision-makers. The Welch
panel, which is granted access to secret military data, has
performed periodic assessments of the program; in response to last
fall's report the Pentagon asked Congress for additional money for
testing and extra equipment that the Welch panel had flagged as
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said he could not comment on
the latest report because it is classified. But he said it does not
raise issues that necessarily jeopardize the 2005 target date for
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard this as an encouraging report because it says we're
on the right technical path to meet the planned 2005 deployment
date,'' even though everything will have to fall neatly into place
to make that date, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other Pentagon officials have publicly acknowledged a
high risk of failing to meet the 2005 deployment target date. They
say they will adjust the schedule if necessary, based on such
factors as flight test results, arms control issues, cost and
intelligence estimates of the evolving ballistic missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Welch panel recommends that the Pentagon put the system -- a
combination of powerful radars, ground-based missile interceptors
and high-speed computers -- through more demanding tests than
presently planned. It says tests so far have been ''less realistic
than they should be,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of realism in the tests is, in part, limited by
restrictions on how the Pentagon uses its missile test range in the
central Pacific Ocean, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Some Lawmakers Want Slavery Apology  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America will continue to be haunted by slavery
until the government makes amends, beginning with a formal apology,
an interracial group of lawmakers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue ... is still with us. It will not go away,'' said
Rep. Tony Hall, a white Democrat from Dayton, Ohio. ''This hurt
lingers unless you settle it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hall described his proposal for Congress to apologize and set
up a commission to look at slavery's continuing impact in America's
society, the shouts of dozens of marchers echoed down Independence
Avenue in celebration of ''Juneteenth,'' the anniversary of June
19, 1865, when the last slaves officially were freed.
</P>
<P>
   Hall offered an apology resolution three years ago, but he
failed to consult with black lawmakers and leaders before
introducing it, and it went nowhere. This time he sought advice
from black lawmakers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among co-sponsors of the apology resolution is Rep. John Lewis,
a black Democrat from Georgia and a prominent veteran of the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very serious issue for our country. We need to deal
with it,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with an apology, the resolution recommends that the
government appoint a commission to examine slavery's legacy; issue
a public school curriculum about slavery; and consider setting up a
scholarship fund. It also proposes a national slavery museum but
says nothing about cash payments demanded by some black activists
because of their ancestors' mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Lewis, co-chairwoman of the National Coalition of Blacks
for Reparations in America, said reparations and an apology are
owed descendants of those deprived of life, liberty, education and
family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ancestors created material wealth'' for the slave-holders,
she said. ''We have inherited the impoverishment that the theft of
the wealth of our ancestors created.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she liked the suggestions in Hall's proposal but only
as an adjunct to reparations. ''We're not having a damn thing in
lieu of reparations. No 'in lieu of,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and others at a Juneteenth rally gave Hall enthusiastic
applause, but their T-shirts bore reminders of Reconstruction's
largely broken promise of ''40 acres and a mule'' and endorsements
of H.R. 40, a reparations bill offered by Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Civil War, various offers of reparations
have been made to blacks, with perhaps the best-known being the
''40 acres and a mule.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Gen. William T. Sherman issued an order on Jan. 16, 1865,
setting aside land in Georgia and South Carolina for freed slaves.
Each family was to receive 40 acres. Later, Sherman offered to lend
them Army mules.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40,000 blacks were resettled on land seized or confiscated
in the Confederacy, but many more than that got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1865, Congress put under the control of the Freedmen's Bureau
about 850,000 acres of land that was supposed to help blacks make
the transition from slavery to freedom. By that summer, President
Andrew Johnson undercut the plan by allowing former Confederates to
reclaim their land.
</P>
<P>
   Two reparations bills failed in the 1860s. Conyers has for the
past 10 years introduced a bill setting up a commission to examine
the issue and suggest reparations to Congress, but it has never
received a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H. Con. Res. 356

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Cuba Migration Talks Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S.-Cuban migration talks set for next week
have been postponed at the request of President Fidel Castro's
government, officials from both countries said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the postponement was due to the Elian
Gonzalez case, which remains unresolved after almost seven months.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives of Elian, 6, are seeking to overturn a
federal appeals court ruling this month that the boy's father
should be allowed to return to Cuba with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington, said his government wants the case resolved before
migration talks resume.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Cuban officials
were told the United States ''strenuously objected'' to the
last-minute postponement because U.S. officials were prepared for
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on migration issues are the sole fixture on the U.S.-Cuban
agenda because the United States generally does not welcome
discussions on other subjects. Such talks have been held
periodically for two decades.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: 3 Civilians Hurt in Bombings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Three civilians were injured Monday in
bombings by U.S and British warplanes in southern Iraq, the
official Iraqi News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The agency quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying
that the bombing targeted ''civil and service installations,'' a
term used by Iraq to identify non-military positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bombing resulted in the injury of three innocent
civilians,'' the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman also said warplanes carried out 20 sorties over
three northern provinces and ''dropped three fire flares over the
innocent people'' before being confronted by Iraqi anti-aircraft
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in Florida, which
monitors the southern no-fly zone, said there were no strikes over
southern Iraq on Monday, but there was one strike on Sunday in
response to anti-aircraft artillery fire. There were no U.S.
reports of strikes on northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been enforcing northern and
southern no-fly zones in Iraq since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
Iraq says the zones violate national sovereignty and has been
challenging the patrols since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were set up ostensibly to protect Shiite Muslims in
the south and Kurds in the north from attacks by Iraq's army.

<HEADLINE> Insurance, Pension Rulings Expected  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday to clarify
whether state law can override many people's decisions on who will
receive their life insurance and pension benefits after they die.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear a Washington state woman's argument
that she is entitled to the life insurance and pension benefits of
her ex-husband, who died in an accident shortly after they were
divorced. His children from a previous marriage say they should
receive the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Rae Egelhoff and David A. Egelhoff were married in 1988 in
Tacoma, Wash., and were divorced in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The following June, David Egelhoff was injured in an auto
accident, and he died the following month. He died without a will,
and Mrs. Egelhoff remained the designated beneficiary under his
life insurance and pension plans, which he had received through his
employment at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   His children from a previous marriage, Samantha and David
Egelhoff, sued in state court, saying they were entitled to the
pension and life insurance benefits. They relied on a state law
that said divorce revokes a spouse's designation as beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge ruled for Mrs. Egelhoff. The judge said a federal
law that governs employee benefit plans, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, overrode the state law and therefore she
remained the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court and the Washington Supreme Court reversed
and said the children were entitled to the benefits. The federal
law did not pre-empt the Washington law that revoked her status as
beneficiary, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal granted review Monday, Mrs. Egelhoff's lawyers
said ERISA aims to protect plan participants and beneficiaries by
overriding state laws that would allow someone else to receive
pension and life insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Egelhoff's two children said that allowing Mrs.
Egelhoff to collect the benefits would amount to ''unjust
enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Egelhoff vs. Egelhoff, 99-1529.

<HEADLINE> Convicted War Criminal Loses Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A man convicted of murdering Jews during World War
II lost his final bid for a new hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Sawoniuk, 78, was the first person tried under Britain's
1991 War Crimes Act, which permits prosecution on charges alleging
crimes committed outside Britain.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers had argued that his trial was an abuse of the
British court process, saying it was impossible for him to receive
a fair hearing after so much time had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Court of Appeal turned down Sawoniuk's
application for leave to appeal his conviction. The House of Lords
followed suit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sawoniuk, a retired British Rail employee, served in the local
police in German-occupied Belarus during World War II. He was
convicted of killing a woman who was among at least 15 people mowed
down with a submachine gun as they stood naked by a pit in
Domachevo, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found him guilty of shooting an unidentified woman
-- one of three Jews shot in the back of the head and pushed into an
open grave in December 1942.
</P>
<P>
   He received a life sentence last year for each of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 Jews were killed in Nazi-occupied Belarus
during the war.

<HEADLINE> Tallulah Bankhead Play Premieres  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tallulah Bankhead used to say that her father,
the speaker of the House of Representatives, warned her about the
dangers of men and cigarettes but never said a word about women and
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cocaine isn't habit-forming,'' the actress was quoted as
saying. ''I should know -- I've been using it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Her vices -- especially the one of sacrificing her talent to a
greed for attention -- are explored in a Washington world premiere
play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Queen of Clubs'' portrays Bankhead at 54, on the opening night
of one of her few failures: the part of Blanche, the overripe
southern belle in Tennessee Williams' ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life Tallulah lasted another dozen years after the
'Desire' flop and made a success in TV as the Black Widow in
''Batman'' and as herself in ''Lucy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington's Church Street Theater Paula Gruskewicz, a well
known Washington actress, takes the part of Tallulah. A pervasive
ghostly character is an unnamed ''Female Impersonator'' -- John C.
Bailey -- who mocks and mimics her. But the ghost of ''Daddy'' --
played by Timmy Ray James -- appears to approve her going on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''After all your granddaddy is a senator and I'm speaker of the
House,'' Rep. William Brockman Bankhead, D-Ala., reminds her, ''and
if that ain't theater I don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   But he reproaches her as a little girl for turning a cartwheel
at a birthday party and ''showing your drawers to half the
population of Alabama.'' She refuses to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life she had a reputation for answering the door in the
nude. Showbiz gossip gave her ''romantic links'' with a dozen or
more celebrities of both sexes, from Billie Holliday to Winston
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Gruskewicz plays Tallulah with great decorum despite her rough
language and nervously tying and untying the belt of her long
dressing gown for most of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Frank Donnelly is a New York psychotherapist. His
play runs until July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bankhead was known for his occasional dramatic oratory on
the floor, courageous opposition to the Ku Klux Klan, and to some
as ''the best-loved man in Congress.'' He ran the House for four
years when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president. He died in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his career, his daughter was having ups and
downs on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   One critic said of her performance in Shakespeare's ''Antony and
Cleopatra'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Miss Bankhead barged down the Nile last night as Cleopatra --
and sank.''
</P>
<P>
   Another praised her ''superb example of mature acting fully
under control'' in Lillian Hellman's ''The Little Foxes.'' That won
her the New York Drama Critics' award for best acting.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 109, Nasdaq Rises 129  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel drove the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Nasdaq composite sharply higher Monday as investors rewarded
the company for its strong growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But while the market averages rose, there were notable pockets
of weakness. A bastion of the old economy, Dow component Honeywell
International, became the latest big name to warn that its
second-quarter earnings will miss expectations, and its stock
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow average rose
108.54 to close at 10,557.84.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.54 at 1,486.00, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 129.15 at 3,989.71.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was running well behind
Friday's busy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' concerns about corporate earnings set the tone for
the session. Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP;
Reed in Overland Park, Kan., said investors were seeking out shares
of the technology companies that are expected to post the strongest
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past week or two, there's been a tendency to chase
after strong earnings,'' he said. ''That means technology companies
that do hardware and infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $10.438 to $135.125, accounting for more than half of
the Dow's gains. The company said it will invest $2 billion in a
new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers analyst Dan Niles said
Intel's stock price should reach $175 within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Rambus rose $14 to $90 after signing a deal last
week to license memory technology to Japanese chip maker Toshiba
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks bounced back strongly from steep losses on
Friday, when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks
will have trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows
down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $2.75 to $121.25 and Citigroup rose $1.313 to
$64.063. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $4 to $85.125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said many investors felt Friday's selloff was overdone.
Also, expectations that the Federal Reserve will leave interest
rates unchanged at its June 28 meeting helped the financial sector,
which is highly sensitive to rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in technology and financial stocks helped the
market overcome Honeywell's earnings warning.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming speculation that swirled around Wall Street in
morning trading, the industrial company said it expects earnings to
come in between 73 cents and 77 cents a share, below analysts'
forecasts of 78 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell fell $8.688 to $40.063. The company, which was formed
in 1999 by the merger of AlliedSignal and Honeywell, cited
unexpected parts shortages in its aerospace unit,
higher-than-expected raw material prices in its performance
materials unit and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are in the midst of the ''preannouncement'' period
leading up to next month's earnings reports, giving Wall Street
advance notice of any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While profit growth is expected to be quite strong, early
reports have suggested that rising interest rates are beginning to
take a toll. The market's strike against Honeywell proved that any
company facing earnings problems is likely to face a harsh penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''An economic slowdown would translate into lower corporate
earnings,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg. ''The predictability of earnings will become a prime
concern of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected trading to remain fairly light and volatile
this week. The Federal Reserve will announce its next decision on
interest rates on June 28, leaving many investors unwilling to
stake out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   The coming week will give investors little new guidance on the
strength of the economy. A report on the trade deficit, due out
Tuesday, is the only economic report expected to influence the
market this week.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Japan's
version of the technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market opened on
Monday, with eight stocks trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange. It
plans to introduce its own trading system next year linked to and
modeled after the original Nasdaq market.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Eyes Aerial Strike Crafts  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Air Force is experimenting with putting
miniature bombs on its Predator aircraft, the unmanned surveillance
planes that were used extensively during last year's war over
Kosovo, the Air Force's top officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told reporters
that experimenting with arming the Predator is part of a broader
effort to develop aerial strike capabilities that do not put
pilots' lives at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange with reporters on the Air Force's future
direction, Ryan said his service intends to focus on finding
improved ways to use existing aircraft -- and those already on the
drawing board like the F-22 stealth fighter -- instead of sinking
large amounts into developing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan provided no other details on the Predator experiments. He
raised the subject in the context of efforts to stay ahead of
technological advances in air defense, such as new generations of
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo conflict, Predator surveillance planes
provided real-time views of refugee movements and bomb damage. They
are still being used in the Balkans to monitor enforcement of the
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters, appearing with Ryan, said
the feasibility of unmanned bombers is under serious study. That is
one reason, Peters said, that the Air Force is not yet ready to
commit to building a new bomber to follow the B-2 stealth bomber
which saw its first combat over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we will want to buy a new manned bomber between
now and 2020,'' Peters said. ''The question of whether you want a
manned bomber versus an unmanned bomber versus a space vehicle is a
question that can't be answered because the technology won't be
available'' before 2020, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Proceeds Cautiously on Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His ban on U.S. surveillance planes is
considered a boon for drug traffickers. He is Fidel Castro's
baseball buddy and cites Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as a role
model.
</P>
<P>
   At another time, with another country, the United States might
have taken a hard line against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a
former paratrooper who was once imprisoned after leading a failed
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has proceeded with caution. It characterizes
relations as close, shrugs off Chavez's overtures to U.S.
adversaries and quietly works to resolve differences.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the delicate U.S. approach has much to do with
Chavez's popularity, Venezuela's strategic importance -- both in
location and as a major oil producer -- and fears that taking a
tougher line may only hurt U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the U.S. has tried very hard -- and so far successfully
-- not to fall into the trap of becoming perceived to be Chavez's
chief critic and opponent,'' said Bernard Aronson, who headed the
State Department's Inter-American Affairs bureau during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is the fourth largest exporter of oil to the United
States at a time when Americans are pressing the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production to lower
soaring gas prices. Venezuela's oil minister heads OPEC, which
meets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chavez dampened hopes for a price drop, saying world
oil prices are ''fair and just'' and that OPEC should try to keep
the price around $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was elected president in December 1998 with the support
of poor voters fed up with corruption and the disparate wealth. The
populist and nationalist rejected some U.S. flood relief aid last
year because he wanted to limit the number of U.S. soldiers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has reached out to adversaries of the
United States, stressing his close relations with Cuba and playing
baseball against a team coached by Castro. Last month, he cited
Gadhafi's Libya as a model for Venezuelan democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the lack of cooperation in the fight against illegal
drugs that worries some U.S. officials. They are losing patience
because Chavez has not reversed his decision last June to ban U.S.
surveillance planes from flying over Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., said it's time to consider sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venezuela has thumbed its nose at the United States, and by
allowing drug traffickers to fly in and out of Venezuela air space
at will, it has created a new path for a credible volume of
narcotics ending up at our shores,'' said Mica, chairman of the
House Government Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug
policy and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on surveillance planes has raised the greatest concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge problem,'' White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   With the closing of Howard Air Force base in Panama, much of the
U.S. drug surveillance is being handled by planes based in Curacao
and Aruba, both just north of Venezuela, and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The planes monitor suspected drug flights between Colombia, the
world's largest producer of cocaine, and Caribbean transfer points.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1999, the United States has asked Venezuela 46 times
for permission to enter its air space in pursuit of suspected drug
flights. Permission was granted just three times.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the ban has created a ''black hole'' in regional
surveillance, and traffickers are taking advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela says it has been pursuing drug flights on its own.
''When we have been notified of the presence of illegal flights in
our territory, the response has been very good,'' Venezuelan Vice
President Isaias Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say that in most cases when the United States
has informed Venezuela of a suspicious flight, Venezuela didn't
respond or couldn't follow the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Venezuelan Air Force operating on its own is manifestly
incapable of stopping this traffic,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said overall drug cooperation has been good. Seizures
have quintupled, he said. Last year, Chavez agreed to allow the
United States to install its third anti-drug radar.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department plays down the overflight ban, noting that
it affects a relatively small part of drug shipments, which are
more often carried by sea.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Clinton administration certified Venezuela as
''fully cooperating'' in the drug fight.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, there may be pressure for a tougher line. Sen.
Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Caucus on International
Narcotics Control, said he may consider the overflight issue as
part of the certification process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that our administration is trying to work out a deal,
but there's not much to show for it,'' Grassley, R-Iowa, said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts caution that a harder line could result in less
drug cooperation and push Chavez closer to U.S. adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the administration just doesn't want to do anything
that can be seen as adding fuel to the fire,'' said Otto Reich, a
senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies and a former ambassador to Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Stonehenge To Be Open for Solstice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- For the first time in 16 years, the public will be
able to greet the dawn of the summer -- the first of the new
millennium -- at the ancient stone circle of Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   But fearing a return of the unruly revelers who have defiled the
monument in the past, site owners English Heritage have agreed to
open the stones for just eight hours, starting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Security will be tight at the site on Salisbury plain, 80 miles
southwest of London. And camping, fires, dogs and amplified music
will be forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Stonehenge, a double circle of large stones erected by
prehistoric Britons 5,000 years ago, became a popular spot for
solstice celebrations in the late 1980s, when pagan worshippers
flocked to the site to perform age-old ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a group of 4,000 revelers tried to break police lines
to join the white-robed druids. Following clashes, nine people were
injured and 70 arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 100 people were allowed to attend the solstice by
prior arrangement, an event which proved peaceful. But last year
riot police had to be called in after gatecrashers pushed down
fences and clambered on the stones.
</P>
<P>
   Druids, for whom the solstice is the holiest day of the year,
believe Stonehenge was a center for pre-Christian and astronomical
worship and therefore consider it a sacred site.
</P>
<P>
   English Heritage has said it will decide whether to open the
stones for future solstices after seeing how people behave this
year.

<HEADLINE> Kelsey Grammer's 'Macbeth' to Fold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Out, out poor ''Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The critically panned Broadway production of Shakespeare's
drama, starring television's Kelsey Grammer, will close on Sunday
after just 13 performances and a loss of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Frasier'' star put his own money in the show after its
producers reportedly wanted to close the revival after its Boston
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Macbeth,'' directed by Terry Hands, received some blistering
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Brantley, in The New York Times, called the production
''blunt-witted,'' while Variety termed Grammer's performance ''an
empty star turn.'' The Associated Press said, ''Lady Macbeth isn't
the only one sleepwalking on stage at Broadway's Music Box
Theater,'' describing Grammer as ''a curiously muted villain.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival had been scheduled to run until July 30.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Accredit Observers  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States urged Zimbabwe on Monday to
quickly accredit American observers for this weekend's fiercely
contested parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither the National Democratic Institute nor the
International Republican Institute have yet received their
accreditations despite multiple requests to the government'' in
Harare, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the authorities in the southern African nation have
provided no explanation for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the United States was ready to fund more than
10,000 observers for the election, in addition to the ones from the
two U.S. institutes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know whether U.S. diplomats in Zimbabwe would
need special accreditation to observe the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the European Union confirmed that Zimbabwe's
government had refused to accredit 17 EU-sponsored African election
observers who were to monitor the election. The government said the
10 Kenyans and seven Nigerians were not European nationals and
should have been sponsored by their own countries, EU official Tana
de Zulueta said.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence has scarred campaigning for the election that
poses the biggest threat to President Robert Mugabe's ruling party
since he led the nation to independence in 1980. At least 31
people, mostly opposition supporters, have died in political
violence since February, when ruling party militants and war
veterans began illegally occupying more than 1,400 white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has ordered police not to remove illegal squatters from
white-owned farms, insisting land-hungry blacks are protesting
unfair land ownership by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International,the human rights group, and other foreign
observes have accused the government of instigating or condoning
the violence. The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front claims the opposition is responsible.

<HEADLINE> Aristide Partisans Paralyze Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Militant supporters of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide paralyzed Haiti's capital Monday,
setting a fire outside the U.S. Embassy, trying to burn an American
flag and blocking streets to demand the release of last month's
election results.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters stoned vehicles and set tire barricades aflame. They
blocked Port-au-Prince's main arteries with hulks of vehicles,
junked refrigerators and large rocks. Shops and schools stayed
shut.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, protesters also reportedly paralyzed Gonaives,
Haiti's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, demonstrators lit a
large pile of debris on fire and chanted anti-American slogans.
Haitian police watched but did not intervene. The protesters then
moved to the nearby United Nations Plaza, where they lowered an
American flag and tried to set it ablaze before police grabbed the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is a nation of thieves. It has tried to
steal our votes, that's why we're burning the flag,'' one protester
said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's violence was the second time in a week that Aristide
supporters had shut down the capital. On Friday, they threw stones
and threatened more violence if election results were not
published.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's Radio Galaxie quoted election chief Leon Manus as saying
Monday that he refused to give in to pressure from President Rene
Preval to sign off on incorrect results. The station, in a report
from its correspondent in the United States, quoted Manus as saying
that Aristide candidates won only seven Senate seats but Preval had
insisted that they had won 16 and that Manus make that official.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station did not say where Manus was. He fled to the
United States after receiving a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining six members of the electoral council -- minus their
president and two members who resigned on Thursday -- promised to
publish final results later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The council members have already published mayoral results from
eight of Haiti's nine electoral districts. The results gave
Aristide candidates control of all the biggest towns and of
metropolitan Port-au-Prince, where a third of the country's 8
million people live.
</P>
<P>
   To restore constitutional government, Haiti held elections May
21 for the lower house of Parliament and 19 of 27 Senate seats.
Preliminary results showed Aristide's Lavalas Family party winning
16 Senate seats and more than 20 of 83 lower house races -- a
victory opposition leaders say would set Haiti on the road to a
one-party state under Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, United Nations and Organization of American
States have challenged the vote-counting process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority to avoid a
second round of voting. But officials counted the votes of only the
top four contenders and not the others who ran and may have gotten
a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Those missing votes created an erroneous winning percentage
count, observers say, giving at least eight of 16 Senate seats to
Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the objections, a pro-Aristide parliament should be
installed by July. Aristide -- who served as president from
1991-1995 -- is expected to win presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a constitutional government since Preval, an
Aristide ally, shut down Parliament in January 1999 to resolve an
18-month power struggle with the opposition majority party. Preval
then appointed a new premier by decree.

<HEADLINE> Judge commits bank robber to up to 10 years in hospital.  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Wallingford man who robbed a bank while
in a drug- and alcohol-induced mania was committed Monday to a
maximum-security psychiatric hospital for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Richard Arnold said there was no other way
to ensure that Christopher DeAngelo, 30, would not have another
violent episode.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's primary concern must be the protection of
society,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence must be reviewed by the Psychiatric Security Review
Board in the next 90 days. The board could decide to continue
DeAngelo's commitment or to release him with treatment
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelo's lawyer, John Williams, said he also plans to appeal
to the state Appellate Court. He maintained DeAngelo posed no
danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think by the end of this year, Chris should be released on
some kind of conditional release,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelo was found innocent by reason of insanity in February of
robbing the First Union Bank in Derby. Arnold ruled DeAngelo fell
into a manic state from taking Prozac and Xanax and by drinking
alcohol. The Prozac was prescribed to control his
obsessive-compulsive disorder and Xanax to ease anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's branch manager, Alea Witt, testified Friday that she
has had nightmares and panic attacks since DeAngelo robbed the bank
at gunpoint in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not the person I was before the incident,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, in his 26-page ruling, noted several times that DeAngelo
had failed in the past to take steps to control his illness.
</P>
<P>
   He did not take his medicine and failed to show up for doctor's
appointments while he was free on bond after his arrest for the
bank robbery and three other holdups in the Wallingford area.
DeAngelo also drank alcohol, even though his doctors told him not
to, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been committed to Whiting Forensic Institute in
Middletown since Arnold acquitted him of the robbery charges in
February. Doctors at the hospital recommended that DeAngelo be
committed for further treatment and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors testifying for the defense said DeAngelo should get
outpatient treatment under close supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cynthia Epperson, an expert on obsessive-compulsive
disorders at Yale-New Haven Hospital, testified she believes
DeAngelo's mania was entirely due to a reaction to the medications
he had been prescribed, since he had never demonstrated any manic
behavior before taking the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Additional charges against DeAngelo related to the robbery of a
K-mart, a service station and a bank in Wallingford were on hold in
New Haven Superior Court awaiting the ruling in the Derby case.

<HEADLINE> Egan installed as New York archbishop  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Edward Michael Egan celebrated his first Mass as
archbishop of New York Monday during an elaborate installation
ceremony beneath the massive stone arches and tall stained-glass
windows of St. Patrick's Cathedral and exhorted followers to fight
racism, poverty and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''May we tolerate discrimination because of race or creed?''
asked Egan, before posing similar questions about poverty and
euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   ''May we stand idly by while the being within the mother is
killed, even though no one has ever been able to prove it has
anything but an inalienable right to live?''
</P>
<P>
   The remark brought sustained applause among opponents of
abortion rights in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   After the clapping subsided, Egan added, ''To all of these
questions, the answers must be a resounding, 'No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Egan replaces the late Cardinal John O'Connor as the spiritual
leader of 2.4 million Roman Catholics. It is considered the most
prominent Catholic post in America.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 invited guests included Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer,
D-NY, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Gov. George Pataki, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate
candidate from Long Island, as well as other state and city
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Schumer were among the politicians who did not
applaud the archbishop's remarks about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the Vatican's ambassador to the
United States, read a letter from Pope John Paul II entrusting the
New York archdiocese to Egan and noting ''the sad passing'' of
O'Connor on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''His legacy will not be forgotten,'' said Montalvo.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was escorted to the ornately carved, throne-like bishop's
chair in the cathedral sanctuary, where he was greeted by clergy
from the archdiocese and by representatives of other Christian
churches as well as Jewish and Muslim officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, Egan referred to St. Patrick's as a ''basilica,''
and said the cathedral was only as strong as the faith of its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be a prayerful people in the Archdiocese of New York
... if our basilica is to stand,'' he said. ''There can be no
hesitations, no compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan concluded his homily by thanking New Yorkers for welcoming
him to the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''How privileged am I, how honored am I, how humbled am I to
join you in our basilica,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's namesake nephew, Edward Michael Egan, presented the gifts
- bread and wine - for the communion.
</P>
<P>
   Prayers were said in nine languages ranging from Spanish to
Polish to Creole representing the diverse heritage of New York's
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was followed by a performance by opera star Renee
Fleming, whom Egan referred to as ''a dear friend,'' singing
''Alleluia'' from Mozart's ''Exultate Jubilate.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-day installation rituals began Sunday with an afternoon
prayer service in which Egan was made archbishop and officially
took command of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ceremony featured an installation Mass and opened with
a hour-long procession of nearly 1,000 priests, dozens of bishops,
eight cardinals and other religious officials.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had led the archdiocese for 16 years. Egan, 68, led the
diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., for 12 years before replacing
O'Connor, but he also served for three years in New York under
O'Connor in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Egan told his new flock, ''I feel very much at home here,'' but
some worshippers couldn't help but compare his upright bearing and
cerebral manner to O'Connor, who always peppered his homilies with
jokes, asides and folksy anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find he carries himself more formally, and he has a lot of
dignity,'' said Rosemary Russo, who came from her Bronx parish to
attend the service. ''But we'll adjust to him, and he'll come down
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he feels at home, and I think he's trying to be a part
of the community,'' said Donna Galasso, also of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is the 12th man to lead New York Catholics since the first
bishop was named in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese covers Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx,
Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, Sullivan, Putnam and
Ulster counties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Eases North Korea Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration moved on Monday to
lift a half-century of trade restrictions on North Korea, putting
new regulations into place that will allow the United States to
resume a variety of economic contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The action was heavy in symbolism, coming one week after an
historic summit between North and South Korea. But economists
predicted that trade flows would remain tiny for a number of years
given that North Korea is emerging from decades of extreme
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be some interest on the part of American companies,
but it won't happen overnight. North Korea is one of the world's
poorest economies and it has been closed off to the world for a
long time,'' said Franklin Vargo, head of international economic
affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, published in the Federal Register on Monday,
relax a once near-total trade embargo imposed on North Korea during
the early days of the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The revised rules will allow North Korea to export raw materials
and finished goods to the United States and will allow U.S. firms
to sell American goods -- without military uses -- and farm products
to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also will open up air travel and shipping routes
between the two countries as well as banking transfers between
individuals and companies. It also eases restrictions on investment
by American companies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had announced plans to ease the trade embargo
nine months ago, as a reward for North Korea's agreement to halt
missile testing. But formal implementation did not take place until
Monday -- just days after the groundbreaking summit in Pyongyang
between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said easing the trade
embargo reflected the administration's view that North Korea will
continue to observe the moratorium on testing long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
South Korea hoped to travel soon to North Korea on a fact-finding
mission, but he said, ''I think we have to be realistic and
understand that the actual opportunities for trade may be limited
by the state of North Korea's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Communist North Korea, one of the most impoverished and isolated
nations in the world, has faced widespread famine and disease in
recent years that have claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands
of North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   It has an economy that has shrunk steadily throughout the 1990s
after its support from the Soviet Union and other former communist
bloc countries in Eastern Europe was cut back.
</P>
<P>
   The country has significant reserves of various minerals from
iron ore to copper and zinc and some analysts forecast that the
first U.S. companies to invest in North Korea might come from the
mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hufbauer, trade analyst at the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think tank, said the most likely first
impact of the U.S. decision will be to encourage South Korean
manufacturing companies to establish operations there to take
advantage of lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   Low-end consumer goods such as shoes could be shipped directly
to the United States while component parts such as car bumpers and
other component parts could be shipped to South Korea for assembly
into products for export.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea will need help from South Koreans to learn how to
export. They have been so insular,'' Hufbauer said. But he noted
that China was in a similar situation when it decided to open up to
the rest of the world in the late 1970s, triggering two decades of
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is conceivable that North Korea could have a period of very
rapid growth if they allow things to go forward, but they will have
to make the investment atmosphere more friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea exported just $743 million in products, according to
the most recent published estimate by the Central Intelligence
Agency, compared to $133 billion in exports for its rich neighbor
South Korea in 1998. South Korea has enjoyed an export boom over
the past 20 years that was slowed only temporarily by the Asian
financial crisis of 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers Help on Korea Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin spoke Monday with his
South Korean counterpart Kim Dae-jung and offered Russia's help in
peace talks between North and South Korea, the Kremlin press
service said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who is finding his footing in the international arena
after being elected March 26, has suggested Moscow might play a
mediating role between the two Koreas, in a conflict Moscow once
stoked during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Putin congratulated Kim for a successful summit
meeting last week, where he and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il
agreed to steps toward reconciliation after a 50-year standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ''underscored Russia's determination to do all it can to
create the external conditions to guarantee the agreements between
the North and South,'' the press service statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, after decades of supporting the Communist North,
recognized South Korea in 1990. In 1995, Russia backed out of a
defense agreement with the North.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said he will pay a visit to North Korea in the near
future, but the Kremlin has not released an exact date.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon
met with Russian foreign ministry officials in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, the Clinton administration on Monday
formally implemented steps to ease half-century-old economic
sanctions against North Korea.

<HEADLINE> Egan brings first-grade teacher to Mass  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The new archbishop of New York had a special
guest in the audience of St. Patrick's Cathedral for his
installation Mass Monday: His 96-year-old first-grade teacher,
Sister Mary Donatilla Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny white-haired lady in a pale green suit stood up to the
thunderous applause of the other 4,000 guests when 68-year-old
Archbishop Edward Egan introduced her as one of his formative
influences growing up in Oak Park, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''She writes me at Christmastime,'' he said. ''She always begins
her letters, 'Dear Father Eddie.' ... They always contain
suggestions and directives.''
</P>
<P>
   The nun, a member of the Sinsinsewa Dominican Order, which is
based in Wisconsin, lives in a convent in River Forest, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking of a little boy, a beautiful, handsome
youngster, somebody who was interested in everything I did,'' she
recalled dreamily after the service was over. ''He loved to read.
He wanted to know everything. And all his life he's been a
student.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no idea he'd grow up to join the priesthood.
''I thought he was going to be an artist. He did these wonderful
drawings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he was never naughty in her class. ''He wanted to do
everything right,'' she said. ''He was a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said sometimes the other kids blamed him for their
misdeeds because he was so well-liked ''he'd always be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to him now, she said, is just ''to keep on doing what
he's doing.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Reeling After Random Violence  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A man beaten to death in a fit of road rage; a
teen-ager stabbed to death during a fight for a beach chair; a
toddler beaten to death for disturbing a televised soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   Some blamed the searingly hot summer for the succession of
brutal killings, but others wonder if the rancor signifies the loss
of a much-cherished national belief in a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   The three unrelated crimes -- and the failure of bystanders to
act in two of them -- prompted a televised address Monday from Prime
Minister Ehud Barak calling for a realignment of national
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''No soccer game or argument over a parking space or over a
beach chair should stand between us and preserving life,'' Barak
told Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every citizen in the country ... must act to stop these
incidents, with all our means,'' Barak said, adding that he planned
to convene his Cabinet to examine the surge in violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a red light for Israel's social culture,'' said Police
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami. ''The norms of violence, the arrogance of
power that we have internalized.''
</P>
<P>
   A World Health Organization-sponsored study last year ranked
Israel in the top 10 Western countries for schoolyard violence -- a
classification reserved for bullying, but not extreme violence such
as stabbing or shooting.
</P>
<P>
   That set off alarm bells, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
published a report Monday describing the problem as ''serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the police seemed taken aback by the recent wave of
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the scene of the road-rage attack Monday, Col. Shahar
Ayalon said: ''It happened for no reason in the middle of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Michael Bar-Am and Efraim Dawishe wrangled
over traffic lanes and at one point, Bar-Am sideswiped Dawishe in
anger. Dawishe then followed Bar-Am to his workplace south of Tel
Aviv, where they argued and exchanged blows in the parking lot --
before a crowd of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Dawishe, 28, then knocked Bar-Am to the ground and kicked him
repeatedly in the head. Neither Dawishe nor the victim had a
criminal record, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the weekend killings of 19-year-old Alon Michaeli,
stabbed to death with a broken beer bottle in the beach chair
dispute, and the beating death of a 2-year-old -- allegedly for
disturbing his mother's boyfriend during a champion soccer match --
the violence prompted Israelis to ask themselves hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami, the police minister, displayed a chart on Channel 2
television showing that incidents of violence had climbed from
10,000 a year in 1991 to 40,000 in 1999. Asked who was responsible,
he blamed an increasingly fractious political culture, where
epithets such as ''Nazi'' and ''racist'' are easily exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who should calm others are not doing their job,''
Ben-Ami said, chiding fellow politicians appearing with him on a TV
talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Nava Amir, Michaeli's sister, agreed. ''We ought to be more
tolerant with each other,'' she said. ''We have to give way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the huge influx of immigrants over the last decade,
together with Israel's economic growth, contributed to an
increasingly alienated culture.
</P>
<P>
   Amotz Asa-El, a Jerusalem Post columnist, suggested that
immigrants, once effusively greeted in the Jewish state, were now
marginalized into anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''You no longer know the social class, the tribe, the social
circle of the people you see on the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some said the problem was exaggerated. Simha Landau, a
criminologist, told Israel television that the myth Israelis once
shared of common cause against hostile Arab neighbors, against an
anti-Semitic world was just that -- a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Landau said violence in Israel rated about average for violence
in Western societies. He blamed the recent surge, in part, on a
heat wave that has taken temperatures into the high 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Another sociologist agreed -- but said that was not a reason for
complacency.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Harel said the government ignored his recommendation to
set up a committee on violence modeled on successful U.S. violence
reduction programs that targeted schools and communities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Spur House Debate  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican Conference Chairman J.C.
Watts is vowing to reintroduce a resolution calling for speedier
payments to black farmers and wants the support of Democratic black
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's black farmers deserve our united support,'' Watts of
Oklahoma and the only black Republican in Congress said as he was
surrounded by about 60 black farmers, mostly from his home state.
''We must reject those who attempt to play politics with their
plight for purely political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fight over a resolution that has no legal authority
has been mired in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which would call on the federal government to speed
payments to black farmers in a discrimination lawsuit against the
Agriculture Department, failed in the House last month.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, black lawmakers accused its sponsor, Rep. Jay
Dickey, R-Ark., of playing politics and trying to curry favor with
blacks for his re-election bid. Congressional Black Caucus Chairman
James Clyburn of South Carolina said then, ''Once you get past the
smoke and mirrors, this resolution does nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey angered black farmers in his district in January when,
after being approached by a group of farmers for help in getting
their settlement payments, he told them it would be difficult to
support them when they refused to support him politically. He later
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the four-term congressman denied that his sponsorship of
the measure was motivated by political gain. ''We should give our
attention to the plight of the black farmers. I am not trying to
capitalize on this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey is running in a heavily Democratic district against state
Sen. Mike Ross. With an electorate that is 27 percent black,
Dickey's district is Arkansas' largest black voter population. He
is the first Republican elected to the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department last year reached a settlement that
is expected to spend millions of dollars paying black farmers who
were discriminated against when applying for loans and subsidy
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have complained that payments have been slow and many
claims have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers, carrying signs saying ''We Represent Black
Voters,'' said they want their money and care little about the
partisan fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to support folks who support us, bottom line,''
said Jeff Hawkins, a farmer from Warrenton, N.C. ''Right now the
black caucus is not supporting us as we feel they should.''

<HEADLINE> City to sue 30 gun makers for negligence  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The city plans to sue approximately 30 gun
manufacturers for negligent marketing and distribution of guns,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the city's head lawyer announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is to be filed Tuesday in Brooklyn federal court,
which has handled similar gun cases, said Corporation Counsel
Michael Hess.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's move follows similar lawsuits
filed against the firearms industry by cities including New
Orleans, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said his office has been compiling evidence in this case
for months, and the lawsuit would have been filed even if the mayor
had not dropped out of the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my mind it has nothing to do with the mayor running, not
running - it has to do with what the manufacturers have done
illegally and the many, many, unfortunately, thousands of injuries
and deaths that have occurred throughout the country from the
illegal distribution of these guns,'' Hess said at the mayor's
daily press availability.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages but Hess said it could run
in the tens of millions of dollars. Among the defendants will be
Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gunmaker, Hess said. The city
will be joined in their lawsuit by City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, the City Council and the New York City Health and
Hospitals Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''The HHC is claiming damages in the millions of dollars in
costs that the HHC has had to expend because of people having been
wounded - or worse - by illegal guns,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the timing of the lawsuit, Hess said the city
wanted to make sure the case was well-researched. The main claims
against gun makers will be negligent marketing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Manufacturers sell guns and have guns distributed in states
with very weak gun laws, knowing that these guns will be
transported from weak gun law states to strong gun law states,''
Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   The city will also cite deceptive advertising used by gun
makers, such as saying that homes with guns are safer than homes
without firearms. Hess said there are numerous studies that prove
that theory wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Brooklyn federal jury found several major handgun
makers liable for shootings because of irresponsible marketing. But
only three defendants - American Arms, Inc., Beretta USA, Inc., and
Taurus International Manufacturing, Inc. - were ordered to pay
$500,000 to a man who had survived being shot in the head with an
illegal handgun. The mixed verdict left both sides claiming
victory.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein did dismiss
the cases against gun makers in the shootings of six victims
because the jury, despite finding liability, failed to award the
victims any damages.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Disperse Kosovo Crowd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russian peacekeepers on Monday fired
warning shots to disperse a rock-throwing crowd angry at being
denied permission to affix a plaque honoring the Kosovo Liberation
Army to a monument, a NATO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at Kosovska Kamenica, 20 miles southeast
of Pristina, said Specialist William R. Putnam, a spokesman at Camp
Bondsteel, the main U.S. base in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a statement, Putnam said U.S. military police were
also threatened by the rock-throwing crowd. One Russian peacekeeper
sustained light injuries after being struck in the face by a rock,
said Putnam. There were no other injuries
</P>
<P>
   The violence began after a peaceful gathering of about 3,500
ethnic Albanians erected a monument to mark the first anniversary
of the Serb pullout from Kosovo, following NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said that although expressly prohibited from doing so,
some in the crowd tried to affix a plaque to the monument
mentioning the KLA, which fought Serb troops and the Yugoslav army.
When prevented from doing so, about 500 people began throwing rocks
at the peacekeepers, consisting of Russian troops and U.S. military
police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd dispersed after the warning shots were fired, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Defense Review Encouraging  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of the Pentagon's missile defense
project by a panel of independent experts found no fatal flaw but
questioned whether it can be ready to use by 2005 as scheduled,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon set 2005 as its goal because it coincides with the
CIA's most recent estimate of when North Korean is likely to have a
long-range ballistic missile capable of striking American
territory. Pentagon officials have said last week's steps toward a
permanent peace between North and South Korea would not diminish
their drive toward the goal of having 20 missile interceptors ready
for use by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not yet given the go-ahead to build a
national missile defense, but the Pentagon is proceeding under a
congressional requirement to develop the required technologies as
quickly as it can.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, the top
military officer directing the project, will address questions at a
Pentagon news conference Tuesday, along with Jacques Gansler, the
Pentagon's top technology official.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that the technology for shooting down
missiles in space is fatally flawed because a hostile nation could
fool U.S. interceptor rockets by using decoys and other measures.
The independent review panel advised the Pentagon to put more
emphasis on overcoming such decoys, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of former military officers and weapons scientists,
headed by retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, presented its
conclusions in a classified report to Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who is preparing to make a recommendation to Clinton in
August on whether to move forward with deployment.
</P>
<P>
   A newly released report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, makes similar points. The GAO report
notes that key decisions about moving ahead with missile defense
are scheduled to be made this year before the actual rocket used to
boost the missile interceptor into space is fully tested.
</P>
<P>
   The booster to be used in the next missile intercept test, in
early July, is a stand-in for the three-stage rocket that would be
part of an actual missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization that is running the project, said his
office is confident the actual booster will be ready for use in
flight tests in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be a problem,'' Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides questions about feasibility, some critics question the
cost of missile defense. The Pentagon estimates that a system with
100 missile interceptors would cost $36 billion over a 20-year
operational life.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told reporters
Monday that he believes missile defense ''can be affordable,'' but
he added that ''We don't have great definition on how much (it) is
going to cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite cautioning that the project's timetable may be overly
ambitious, the Welch panel concluded that the missile defense
system is technically feasible and eventually could be made to work
reliably, according to a senior defense official who has seen the
report. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The reviewers saw ''no reason to change the schedule at
present,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions, first reported Sunday by The Washington Post,
carry considerable weight with Pentagon decision-makers. The Welch
panel, which is granted access to secret military data, has
performed periodic assessments of the program; in response to last
fall's report the Pentagon asked Congress for additional money for
testing and extra equipment that the Welch panel had flagged as
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Cohen, said he could not comment on
the latest report because it is classified. But he said it does not
raise issues that necessarily jeopardize the 2005 target date for
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard this as an encouraging report because it says we're
on the right technical path to meet the planned 2005 deployment
date,'' even though everything will have to fall neatly into place
to make that date, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and other Pentagon officials have publicly acknowledged a
high risk of failing to meet the 2005 deployment target date. They
say they will adjust the schedule if necessary, based on such
factors as flight test results, arms control issues, cost and
intelligence estimates of the evolving ballistic missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Welch panel recommends that the Pentagon put the system -- a
combination of powerful radars, ground-based missile interceptors
and high-speed computers -- through more demanding tests than
presently planned. It says tests so far have been ''less realistic
than they should be,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of realism in the tests is, in part, limited by
restrictions on how the Pentagon uses its missile test range in the
central Pacific Ocean, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Monmouth County town proposes cell phone ban for drivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARLBORO, N.J. (AP) - Want to reach out and touch someone?
Better pull over, or it could cost you a lot more than your roaming
charges.
</P>
<P>
   This Monmouth County borough could become the first municipality
in the state to ban cellular telephone use by drivers. An ordinance
introduced by Township Council Vice President Barry Denkensohn
would ban all but police, fire and emergency personnel from using
hand-held cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones that can be operated by speakerphone would be
allowed. Violators could face a $200 fine under the measure, which
will have its first reading Thursday and could get final approval
July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, 22 states have proposed such bans - including New
Jersey - but none have enacted them, Denkensohn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows it's a distraction,'' Denkensohn said Monday.
''I don't know why no one has stood up and said, 'Let's regulate
this conduct.' I don't want to be intrusive, but the government can
regulate drunken driving and it should regulate this, too, because
it's distracting and it causes accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded
that drivers using cell phones were four times as likely to be
involved in a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   It found that hands-free cell phones were no safer.
</P>
<P>
   Denkensohn got the idea for the ban after hearing about the
death of Morgan Lee Pena, 2, of Hilltown, Pa., who was killed last
November when the car she was riding in was broadsided by a driver
using a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Hilltown and three other Pennsylvania municipalities have since
banned cell phone use by drivers. Denkensohn said it is not a big
issue in this town (pop. 36,000) but that he wants Marlboro to set
an example.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state hasn't done anything and I want our township to set
a good example for other municipalities and countries, even.
Sometime an issue requires leadership. I think this is a good
idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phone users aren't convinced it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so second nature to answer the phone if it rings while
I'm driving that I couldn't think of getting in the car without
being able to talk on the phone,'' said real estate agent Mary Lynn
Mills.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John O. Bennett III, the state Senate majority
leader, said the two bills pending before the Legislature to ban
cell phones for drivers will probably not be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Car phones have become such a reality - and many people even
consider them such a necessity at this point - that it would be
unlikely (the Legislature) would vote to ban them in automobiles,''
said Bennett, R-Monmouth.

<HEADLINE> Licensing recommended for casino exec with tax problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A casino executive who fudged his tax
returns should have his license renewed anyway, New Jersey's top
casino regulator said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   James Hurley, chairman of the state Casino Control Commission,
said Mirage Resorts Inc.-Atlantic City president Mark Juliano
demonstrated ''extremely poor judgment and an acute lack of
sensitivity regarding his financial reporting responsibilities.''
But Hurley said it wasn't serious enough to deny Juliano a license
to work in New Jersey casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano, 44, of Haddonfield, a former president of Caesars
Atlantic City Hotel Casino, wrote off $8,965 for a ''phantom''
personal computer, reported gambling losses as a business expense
and told the IRS he drove 180,000 miles on a car found to have
traveled only 69,000 total miles, according to an investigation by
the state Division of Gaming Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano paid $1.4 million in taxes on $3.7 million in total
income for 1995, 1996 and 1997, or $55,996 less than he would have
if he had filed accurate information about his business expenses,
the DGE said.
</P>
<P>
   The returns were prepared by an out-of-state CPA who was a
gambler at Caesars, with input from Juliano.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, who chaired a hearing on the matter, said he found
Juliano remorseful and that he was fit to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Applicant's cavalier attitude toward his income tax
obligations and the need for accurate record keeping, which caused
the recent turmoil in his life, cannot be condoned nor will it be
tolerated in the future,'' Hurley wrote in a 20-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member Casino Control Commission will decide Wednesday
whether to accept Hurley's recommendation and renew Juliano's
license.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Peace Force Being Worked Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The size, composition and timing of U.N.
peacekeeping force to patrol a buffer zone on the border between
Ethiopia and Eritrea is being worked out, State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the U.N. Security Council has yet to approve
sending such a force. A similar mission has been approved for Congo
but no troops have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said it was too early to say whether the United States
would provide troops or logistical support for the peacekeeping
force, which the Organization of African Unity will sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The two African nations, who have been at war for two years,
signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement Sunday in Algiers,
Algeria. Anthony Lake, a former American national security adviser,
helped broker the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. is going to be asked to deploy a peacekeeping mission
under the auspices of the OAU,'' Boucher said. ''It'll terminate
when the demarcation of the border is completed. The size and
composition has not been determined.''
</P>
<P>
   He said discussions between the OAU and the United Nations on
these points was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether U.S. troops would participate in the force, he
said ''I wouldn't prejudge it one way or the other at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Demarcation of the border was never settled when Eritrea, for a
generation the northernmost province of Ethiopia, gained its
independence in 1993.

<HEADLINE> US Sees More Milosevic Opposition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department said Monday that
opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is growing, and
he is responding by lashing out at these critics.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher made the comment in denying a
published report that the United States and other countries are
exploring the possibility of allowing Milosevic to leave office
with guarantees for his safety and his savings.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there has been no change in U.S. policy that
Milosevic must go to The Hague to stand trial for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The policy is fairly simple. It's he should be out of power,
out of the country and in The Hague,'' he said. Milosevic was
indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal a year ago for crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said it is clear that ''the people of Serbia don't feel
like they've had a choice. And it's quite clear also that Milosevic
is lashing out at independent voices, be they in the media or the
opposition or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He reaffirmed the U.S. view that Milosevic's government has
created a climate of lawlessness that ''really harms all the
Serbian people.''

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Reports on Congo Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- At least 518 people, including 319
Congolese civilians, died during the week Rwandan and Ugandan
troops battled over the northern Congolese city of Kisangani, the
International Red Cross said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the United Nations' special envoy for Congo, Kemal
Morjane, said both Rwanda and Uganda had completed withdrawing
their troops from Kisangani as demanded by the U.N. Security
Council in a resolution adopted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can confirm that today there are no soldiers officially in
the town of Kisangani, Rwandan or Ugandan,'' Morjane said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Spoerri, a Red Cross representative in the city, said
the death toll could rise as local aid workers clear away the
rubble of bombed-out houses and apartments. In addition to the 319
civilian deaths, 120 soldiers died, he said, but he did not give
their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan army said it had killed at least 140 Ugandan
soldiers. The Ugandans did not say how many Rwandans they killed.
Neither side mentioned its own losses.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 1,668 people were injured in the heavy shelling
and automatic weapons fire, including 569 wounded who received
treatment in Kisangani's four hospitals and medical centers, Stoeri
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three rebel factions are fighting to oust President Laurent
Kabila, and five foreign armies are backing one side or the other.
Rwanda and Uganda fell out over their support for rival insurgent
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said he was now concerned whether two of the Congolese
rebel factions would start fighting over Kisangani now that their
Rwandan and Ugandan backers have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which has only 30 unarmed military observers
in the city, has put in an urgent request that at least 240 armed
troops be deployed to Kisangani to fill the vacuum left by the
Rwandan and Ugandan withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said Tunisia will send a technical team to Congo on June
30, the 40th anniversary of Congolese independence. Deployment of
armed troops would depend on whether the U.N. criteria of freedom
of movement and a commitment to a cease-fire could be met, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy, the main rebel
group in control of much of eastern Congo, is the only armed force
in Kisangani. Although it earlier promised to leave Kisangani,
rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said the Rally for Democracy
forces would remain as the ''legitimate Congolese authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan-backed Congolese Liberation Movement, based in
northwestern Congo, has threatened to take Kisangani. Its units
fought alongside Ugandan forces during the June 5-10 clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Red Cross estimated that 150 civilians had died
in the fighting between the two erstwhile allies in Congo's
2-year-old civil war. The fighting ended when the Rwandans drove
the Ugandans out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides dumped an estimated 6,000 mortar rounds and artillery
shells on Congo's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement that both sides had withdrawn from
Kisangani came a day after U.N. military observers there said the
Rwandan army had withdrawn to at least 60 miles south and southeast
of Kisangani, while Ugandan forces were in the process of
withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   A group of European Union diplomats who visited Kisangani
Saturday from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, said the Ugandan
troops had requested more time to complete their withdrawal from
Kapalata camp 6 miles north of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, spokesman Manoel de Almeida e
Sliva said that ''in recent days there has been fighting reported
in the north, with government aircraft bombing positions held by
the rebel Congolese Liberation Movement near Libanda, Imese and
Basankusu in Equateur Province.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been unconfirmed reports that more than 70
civilians were killed as a result of the bombing, and the U.N.
Mission is investigating those reports. The mission is concerned
about the reported attacks, which if verified would be contrary to
the Kampala cease-fire of April 14,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Against Stadium Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a crushing defeat for school-prayer
supporters, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that praying in public
schools must be private. By a 6-3 vote Monday, the court barred
officials from letting students lead stadium crowds in prayer
before football games.
</P>
<P>
   The court's sweeping language in a Texas case could extend far
beyond school sports events -- eventually affecting graduation
ceremonies, moments of silence and more.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling said a school district's policy of allowing such
student-led prayers violated the constitutionally required
separation of government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of a strict church-state separation exulted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court's decision signals a reaffirmation of the
appropriate role of religion in public schools -- one in which
private religious expression is constitutionally protected but
officially sanctioned religious observances are not,'' said David
Harris of the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were aggrieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's 'benign neutrality' toward religion in this
country is now nothing short of malevolent hostility,'' said Jan
LaRue of the conservative Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court: ''Nothing in the
Constitution ... prohibits any public school student from
voluntarily praying at any time before, during or after the
schoolday. But the religious liberty protected by the Constitution
is abridged when the state affirmatively sponsors the particular
religious practice of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   As the latest word on a politically volatile issue that has
bedeviled the nation's highest court for 40 years, the ruling
offered a ringing endorsement of a landmark 1962 decision that
outlawed organized, officially sponsored prayers in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Worship is a responsibility and a choice committed to the
private sphere,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas case was argued in March, an ABC News poll said
two-thirds of Americans thought students should be permitted to
lead such prayers.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas' Republican primary election that same month, 94
percent of voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing
student-initiated prayer at sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who had filed a brief urging the
Supreme Court to uphold student-led prayer, said he was
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in voluntary
student-led prayer,'' said the Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic presidential
nominee, thought the court got it right.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels ... in this case that the prayer was found to be
government-sponsored and participation was not truly voluntary,''
said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway. ''He does support private
prayer in school and at school-related events as long as
participation is truly voluntary and ... is suitable within the
school environmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a former candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination, noted that Republican presidents appointed four of the
court's six-justice majority. ''This underscores that my party has
got to be more serious about the men and women we put on the high
bench,'' said Bauer, who now leads the Campaign for Working
Families.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court recognizes ''the important role that
public worship plays in many communities, as well as the sincere
desire to include public prayer as a part of various occasions so
as to mark those occasions' significance.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ''Such religious activity in public schools, as
elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment.'' That amendment
prohibits an ''establishment of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the three, Rehnquist said he found the tone of the
court's opinion more disturbing than its substance. ''It bristles
with hostility to all things religious in public life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' opinion relied heavily on the court's last major ruling
on school prayer, when in 1992 the justices barred clergy-led
prayers -- invocations and benedictions -- at public school
graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision is sure to be cited in challenges to
student-led prayers at such ceremonies, and could be powerful
ammunition in attacks against laws or school policies calling for
daily moments of silence for prayer or meditation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, four high school students and their parents
sued the Santa Fe Independent School District in Galveston County
in 1995 over its policy of letting students elect a ''chaplain'' to
lead ''prayers'' at graduation ceremonies and home football games.
</P>
<P>
   Two families -- one Catholic and one Mormon -- challenged the
policy. Their identities were sealed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   After their lawsuit was filed, the policy was changed to let
student-elected representatives -- no longer called chaplains -- give
a ''message or invocation.'' Speakers were free to choose what they
say so long as it promotes good sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed only to focus on the football games,
passing up the graduation-ceremony dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be decided before the 1999-2000 court term ends next
week is a Louisiana dispute over the constitutionality of using
taxpayer money to buy computers and other instructional materials
for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling will affect federal efforts to connect every
American classroom with the Internet and also could carry
significance for the politically charged legal fights over tuition
vouchers -- help for families who send their children to religious
schools.

<HEADLINE> Justices say HMO suits belonged in state courts  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court ordered a lower court Monday
to reconsider whether a Pennsylvania health maintenance
organization can be sued in state court by a man who says
inadequate care left him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ordered Pennsylvania courts to restudy the case in
light of the Supreme Court's ruling last week that barred some
federal lawsuits by patients against HMOs. That decision said
patients cannot use a federal law to sue HMOs for giving doctors a
financial incentive to cut treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday in a similar case, the justices turned down an
appeal by an HMO in New Jersey that sought to fend off a lawsuit by
a couple whose newborn baby died after being sent home from the
hospital one day after birth.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involve a federal law that governs employee benefits
known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. The
HMOs argued that the lawsuits against them belonged in federal
court under ERISA, which bars damage awards to compensate for harm
caused by improper processing of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania case began with a lawsuit by Basile Pappas of
Newtown Square who said inadequate care left him a quadriplegic. He
went to Haverford Community Hospital with a spinal problem, and his
HMO refused to authorize his transfer to a hospital outside the HMO
network for specialized emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas settled his claim against a doctor and Haverford. The
hospital then sued the HMO, United States Healthcare Systems of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge said the federal law pre-empted the lawsuit. But
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court let the lawsuit go forward, saying
it was a negligence claim that belonged in state court.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey case was filed by Steven and Michelle Bauman over
the death of their 2-day-old daughter from meningitis after being
sent home from a hospital in Washington Township one day after her
birth. Their HMO, U.S. Healthcare, had a 24-hour discharge policy
for normal births.
</P>
<P>
   The Baumans' lawsuit accused the HMO of providing inadequate
care. The HMO moved the case to federal court, saying it was
pre-empted by the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case returned
to state court. The federal law does not pre-empt state lawsuits
over the quality of care, the court said, even though it does bar
state lawsuits over erroneously withheld benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeals acted on Monday, the HMOs' lawyers said the
lawsuits did not involve the quality of care but HMOs'
administrative decisions on what treatment to offer. Therefore,
they said the state cases were pre-empted by ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Baumans and the Haverford hospital's insurers
said ERISA does not displace state courts' role in hearing claims
of inadequate health care.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Spielberg, the Baumans' lawyer, welcomed the Supreme
Court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a very good decision from the 3rd Circuit. Obviously
the Supreme Court doesn't feel they have to do anything to change
the 3rd Circuit decision. That decision says when HMOs have
policies that cause medical malpractice or when they act in a way
that constitutes medical malpractice, they will be held liable
under state law,'' Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baumans' story helped persuade government officials
nationwide to require insurers to cover a minimum 48-hour hospital
stay after birth. They are seeking an unspecified sum of money from
U.S. Healthcare, the hospital and their pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Michelina, born May 16, 1995, had an undetected
strep infection when discharged from Kennedy Memorial Hospital in
Washington Township, Gloucester County, N.J., the day after her
birth, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms developed at home, but instead of having the baby
brought in for examination, the pediatrician, Dr. Kamila Nemeh of
Williamstown, N.J., told the Baumans to give her nonprescription
drops for indigestion, Spielberg has said.
</P>
<P>
   The infection spread and developed into meningitis, and
Michelina died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Baumans, formerly of Williamstown, N.J., have moved to
Spring Hill, Fla. Their telephone number is unlisted and they could
not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are United States Healthcare Systems of Pennsylvania
vs. Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., 98-1836, and U.S.
Healthcare vs. Bauman, 99-1383.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 109, Nasdaq Gains 129  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel drove the Dow Jones industrial average and
the Nasdaq composite sharply higher Monday as investors rewarded
the company for its strong growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But while the market averages rose, there were notable pockets
of weakness. A bastion of the old economy, Dow component Honeywell
International, became the latest big name to warn that its
second-quarter earnings will miss expectations, and its stock
plunged.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, down 265.52 on Friday, rose 108.54 points Monday, or by
1 percent, to close at 10,557.84.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.54 at 1,486.00, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 129.27 at 3,989.83. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 9.06 to 522.79.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' concerns about corporate earnings set the tone for
the session. Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP;
Reed in Overland Park, Kan., said investors were seeking out shares
of the technology companies that are expected to post the strongest
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past week or two, there's been a tendency to chase
after strong earnings,'' he said. ''That means technology companies
that do hardware and infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel rose $10.438 to $135.125, accounting for more than half of
the Dow's gains. The company said it will invest $2 billion in a
new plant in Ireland. Lehman Brothers analyst Dan Niles said
Intel's stock price should reach $175 within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Rambus rose $14 to $90 after signing a deal last
week to license memory technology to Japanese chip maker Toshiba
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks bounced back strongly from steep losses on
Friday, when investors sold shares amid reports that some banks
will have trouble collecting loan payments as the economy slows
down.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $2.063 to $120.563 and Citigroup rose $1.375 to
$64.125. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose $3.313 to $84.438.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said many investors felt Friday's selloff was overdone.
Also, expectations that the Federal Reserve will leave interest
rates unchanged at its June 27-28 meeting helped the financial
sector, which is highly sensitive to rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in technology and financial stocks helped the
market overcome Honeywell's earnings warning.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming speculation that swirled around Wall Street in
morning trading, the industrial company said it expects earnings to
come in between 73 cents and 77 cents a share, below analysts'
forecasts of 78 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell fell $8.688 to $40.063. The company, which was formed
in 1999 by the merger of AlliedSignal and Honeywell, cited
unexpected parts shortages in its aerospace unit,
higher-than-expected raw material prices in its performance
materials unit and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are in the midst of the ''preannouncement'' period
leading up to next month's earnings reports, giving Wall Street
advance notice of any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   While profit growth is expected to be quite strong, early
reports have suggested that rising interest rates are beginning to
take a toll. The market's strike against Honeywell proved that any
company facing earnings problems is likely to face a harsh penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''An economic slowdown would translate into lower corporate
earnings,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg. ''The predictability of earnings will become a prime
concern of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.10
billion shares, compared with 1.43 billion at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected trading to remain fairly light and volatile
this week. The Federal Reserve will announce its next decision on
interest rates on June 28, leaving many investors unwilling to
stake out major new positions.
</P>
<P>
   The coming week will give investors little new guidance on the
strength of the economy. A report on the trade deficit, due out
Tuesday, is the only economic report expected to influence the
market this week.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.7 percent. Japan's
version of the technology-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market opened on
Monday, with eight stocks trading on the Osaka Stock Exchange. It
plans to introduce its own trading system next year linked to and
modeled after the original Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's DAX index rose 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Texas Schools React to Prayer Rule  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- The Supreme Court has spoken, but that
doesn't necessarily mean there won't be any prayers anymore before
football games at Santa Fe High.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling Monday, the court barred school officials in
this Houston suburb of 10,000 from letting students lead stadium
crowds in prayer before games.
</P>
<P>
   However, school board member Robin Clayton warned that the
mostly Baptist district cannot control what students or others say
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spontaneous things happen, don't they?'' Clayton said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said the school improperly sponsored religion by
allowing the student body to elect someone to give an invocation
before football games.
</P>
<P>
   School board members said they do not yet know what kind of
rules will be adopted in place of the old ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a very disappointing, disturbing and disillusioning
answer from the Supreme Court this morning,'' said John Couch II,
president of the Santa Fe school system for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the invocation was delivered by Marian Ward,
daughter of the Rev. Bob Ward, a Southern Baptist minister. She was
attending a church camp and unavailable for comment Monday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During Marian Ward's speech, graduate Amanda Bruce sat in silent
protest. She said Monday she believes the school district will find
a way to work prayer into football games in spite of the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every self-righteous person around here wants'' prayer, said
Bruce, a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision was filed by
two women -- one Catholic and one Mormon -- whose identities were
sealed by the courts. Both still have children in the district and
were elated by the decision, said friend Debbie Mason.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God, thank God,'' said Mason, a Baptist who has put four
children through the district. ''This time it was football games,
next it could have been the classroom. It is a slippery slope. This
school district knew what it was doing and kept pushing and
pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the seven board members attended the news conference at
the school administration building.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about recent allegations that a Jewish middle school
student was harassed, they denied that there is any climate of
exclusion in the district, which is predominantly white, Hispanic
and Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Richard Ownby noted that the middle school has
taken field trips to Holocaust Museum Houston, and that ''The Diary
of Anne Frank'' is part of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   At his business across the street from the news conference,
Kenneth Jacob was disappointed by the high court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''You walk down the school hallway any day and you'll hear the
Lord's name taken in vain, but you can't pray,'' Jacob said. ''When
you take God out of anything, you put the devil in his place.''

<HEADLINE> US Seeks New Probe of Chile Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has asked Chile for a full
accounting of the deaths of two Americans and the presumed death of
a third during the period of military rule in that South American
country, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the request was submitted to
Chilean authorities in March about the cases of Charles Horman and
Frank Teruggi, killed in 1973, shortly after Gen. Augusto Pinochet
overthrew an elected socialist government; and Boris Weisfeiler,
who is presumed to have died in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a Chilean commission in 1991 expressed the
conviction that Horman and Teruggi were executed without charge or
trial by agents of the state in violation of their human rights,
Boucher noted.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commission lacked sufficient information to reach a
conclusion about Weisfeiler.
</P>
<P>
   Chile responded to the U.S. request by noting investigations
under way in Chile on the Weisfeiler case and pointing out that no
further investigation of the other two can take place outside the
framework of the Chilean judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Franks picks up where Florio left off with money attack on Corzine  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Republican U.S. Senate candidate Bob Franks
came out blistering Monday at Democratic opponent Jon Corzine,
mainly over his money.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, picked up where former
Democratic Gov. Jim Florio left off in his bitter primary fight
with Corzine, who spent a record of at least $33 million just to
win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Steve Goldstein criticized Franks for going
negative right out of the blocks with five months to go before the
Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressman Franks is obviously committing to running a
negative campaign from the outset,'' Goldstein said. ''It is rather
sad that the Republicans, including Congressman Franks, have chosen
to make their first impression a negative one with the kind of
negative mudslinging that will turn voters off.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks attacked the former Wall Street financier for his lavish
spending on the campaign and said his expensive federal proposals
would wipe out budget surpluses in Washington and require tax
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he has signed a pledge never to raise taxes and
challenged Corzine to do the same. He was joined at a mini-rally of
Republican politicians on the Statehouse steps led by Gov. Christie
Whitman and featuring Franks' three Republican opponents together
in public for the first time since the June 6 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine denounced such no-tax pledges in the primary campaign
and Goldstein Monday said he would continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last Republican to make a no-new-taxes pledge wound up
eating his word, so we will let Congressman Franks stand with that
pledge and perhaps eat his words,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   An Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University-Star Ledger poll
Sunday showed Corzine leading Franks 43 to 36 percent, with 20
percent undecided, among registered voters who said they were
likely to vote. The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage
points, which means the outcome could in fact be dead even.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the campaign was pleased with the poll result.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he was behind only because of name recognition and
that Corzine should be chagrined that after such heavy spending,
much of it on TV commercials, he could show support from fewer than
50 percent of the poll respondents and had a virtually meaningless
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is amazing what $34 million can't buy,'' Franks said in a
speech largely centered on the defects of his opponent. ''Yes, I am
the underdog in this race, but I have to tell you, I like the odds.
You can't buy the trust of the voters of New Jersey. You have to
earn it, and I intend to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks said Corzine's proposal for preschool education, free
college tuition and health care would wipe out federal budget
surpluses and force an increase in taxes.

   ''His incredibly lavish spending during his campaign
demonstrates that Jon Corzine has little regard for his own
money,'' Franks said. ''And if he has no regard for his own money,
what regard will he have for yours, for your children's, for your
parents'?''
</P>
<P>
   After remaining steadfastly neutral in the GOP primary, Whitman
joined in, referring to Corzine as ''someone who thinks he can buy
the trust of the American people.'' She said programs Corzine
outlined in the primary against Florio would cost $340 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Corzine ''is the only candidate who had real
world experience, who on Wall Street is recognized as a world class
financial mind who has actually practiced fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the weeks and months ahead, Jon Corzine will be outlining
an agenda based on bold ideas and fiscal responsibility,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' three primary challengers - state Sen. William Gormley,
R-Atlantic, Essex County executive Jim Treffinger and Ramapo
College professor Murray Sabrin - all spoke and endorsed him
heartily.
</P>
<P>
   The primary result was neck-and-neck between Franks and Gormley.
Each of them had more than double the vote of Treffinger and Sabrin
combined.
</P>
<P>
   While Franks and the others during the primary had tried to
dismiss Sabrin, the former Libertarian, as a fringe entry into the
Republican fold, the nominee embraced Sabrin Monday, saying, ''I
want you at my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabrin in his remarks compared Corzine's proposals to those of
failed Communist regimes.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ministers Willing To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In a last minute bid to save Israel's tottering
coalition government, ministers from a secular party offered Monday
to resign if that would prevent the departure of a rival religious
party.
</P>
<P>
   The three ministers from the dovish Meretz party are prepared to
give up their posts in order to keep the ultra-Orthodox Shas party
from leaving the coalition, Education Minister Yossi Sarid said.
</P>
<P>
   The three ministers were to meet Barak late Monday night to
submit their offer, Meretz legislator Anat Maor said. She hoped
that the resignations of the Meretz ministers would not be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak's 11-month-old government falls, it could paralyze
Middle East peacemaking for months. But similar crises with Shas,
which represents Israelis of Middle Eastern origin, have been
resolved before.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz will not hinder Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to
reach agreement with Shas, Education Minister Yossi Sarid said. If
the agreement is acceptable to Meretz, he and his two colleagues
will not resign, he told Israel radio. If it is not acceptable, the
three will resign but will not quit the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not under any circumstances support any vote which
will threaten the government or place its survival in question,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, which is the second-largest party in the coalition, has
accused Sarid, the Meretz leader, of withholding money from the
Shas network of religious schools and has demanded that Barak
deprive Sarid of control over financing of the network.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid said he is merely enforcing financial rules and trying to
end irregularities that have plagued Shas schools in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days Barak has agreed to most of the financial
and other demands of Shas. Shas, not satisfied, has announced that
its four ministers would submit their resignations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A minister's resignation takes effect 48 hours after it is
submitted, so Barak would still have two days to try to reach
agreement with Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has offered to transfer responsibility for the Shas
schools to another minister, but Shas insists on full control. The
sides also remain at odds over the legalization of Shas-run pirate
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz strongly supports the peace process. Without Shas, Barak
would be forced into forming a weak minority government, and it
would be much harder for him to pursue his peace policies with the
Palestinians and Syria. In addition, Barak values the support of
Shas' religious, hawkish constituency.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers study says gas tax needed to fund highway bill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Days after Republican leaders agreed to a
$3.75 billion deal for highway improvements, a Rutgers expert says
motorists could pay 10 cents more per gallon in gasoline taxes to
cover the costs of those repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In one funding scheme, lawmakers would have to raise the
gasoline tax only 5 cents. But in the plan now being considered,
they will need the 10-cent increase in four years to pay for all
the money they plan to borrow, according to the study released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As the funding bill unanimously cleared an Assembly committee,
lawmakers who brokered the compromise dismissed the study and the
need for a tax increase
</P>
<P>
   ''He is totally wrong,'' state Senate President Donald T.
DiFrancesco, R-Union, said of the author's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The package must be approved by both houses of the Legislature
before funding for the Transportation Trust Fund ends in July.
Until Thursday, differences between bills pending in the state
Senate and Assembly delayed any decision on how much the state
would put into the trust, which funds improvements to highways,
bridges and public transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers disagreed on the amount, the length and the source of
the funding plan. DiFrancesco pushed for $4 billion over four
years. Assembly Speaker Jack Collins had backed the $3 billion
version of the bill introduced in his house.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal, legislators praised the new bill, saying it
capped borrowing, limited spending, curbed suburban sprawl and
forced the state to pay for improvements as they were built.
</P>
<P>
   If eventually approved and signed by the governor, the fund will
provide a record $900 million for improvements next year. The next
three years will each be funded at $950 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bill caps state borrowing at $650 million each year.
The remaining money would be taken from a variety of sources,
including the state's general revenues, gasoline taxes and
dedicated sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In his analysis funded by the New Jersey Policy Perspective
Group, Martin E. Robins says that borrowing will eventually corrupt
the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   In four years taxpayers will be paying more on financing
projects than they would on the actual improvements, said Robins,
director of the Transportation Policy Institute at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate and Assembly bills simply delay the inevitable
arrival of instability in transportation capital finance,'' Robins
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point, New Jersey's political leaders will have to
return to the obvious answer: state motor fuels tax as a main
source of new funding for a revived Transportation Trust Fund,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robins said eventually the state would have to raise the gas tax
by 10 cents to pay for all of the improvements as well as the cost
of borrowing the money. Lawmakers could increase the tax by 5 cents
and still pay for the repairs if they changed the funding sources
for the trust fund, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco disagreed, saying the brokered plan is fiscally
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a 9-cent plan. We are reducing the debt ceiling. We
are talking more money out of the budget, pay as you go. That
resolves problems. It doesn't help create them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's tax of 10.5 cents per gallon, one of the lowest in
the nation, has not changed since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman tried to add 5 cents more and dedicate it
to the fund in 1998. Her proposal was rejected by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has a plan to spend $900 million in road improvements in
her budget that begins in July, said spokesman Peter J. McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're reasonably confident there is enough funding to cover
that level of spending next year as well. But it is not a long-term
solution,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has not fully reviewed the current trust fund
proposal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins declined to comment Monday, saying he has not read the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will be considered by the Assembly Appropriations
Committee and then by the full House. A floor vote has not been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   If the Assembly approves the bill, the Senate could concur that
same day, DiFrancesco said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explosions Kill Two in India  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Investigators raided hotels and guest
houses Monday in a search for attackers who detonated two bombs in
a busy marketplace, killing two people and wounding 11.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts Sunday night in the
heart of New Delhi, the fourth attack this year in India's capital.
In the past, police have blamed explosions in the capital on
Islamic separatists, particularly closer to national or other
holidays. India celebrates its Independence Day anniversary Aug.15.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are surprised at this sudden appearance of serial blasts,''
New Delhi's north district police chief, Mukund Upadhye, was quoted
as telling The Times of India on Monday. ''But it may have been an
effort to send out some kind of warning signal with Independence
Day coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that the frequency of attacks in New Delhi has come
down since a separatist campaign was put down in early 1990s in
northern Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants have been fighting a separatist war in Kashmir
since 1989. Insurgency has also rocked Punjab state and several
remote northeast states.
</P>
<P>
   The two bombs went off Sunday night within five minutes of each
other at a bus stop and the nearby bazaar, killing a man and an
8-year-old girl. At least 11 people sitting in a bus were injured
as the explosion shattered glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts happened near the 17th century Red Fort, a popular
tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Press Trust of India news agency quoted a senior New Delhi
police official as saying that the types of explosives used were
similar to those that exploded Jan. 3 in a train at the nearby old
Delhi railway station, injuring 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, police said they suspected a group based in
western Uttar Pradesh state, and the unidentified official told
Press Trust the same group was suspected in Sunday's attack.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Increases on Mexican Media  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As the July 2 presidential election
approaches, election officials, journalists and watchdog groups say
the news media are drifting away from the relatively balanced
coverage -- remarkable for Mexico -- they had been providing.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing the opposition running neck-and-neck with the
party that has governed Mexico for 71 years, some newspapers,
television networks and radio stations have stepped up coverage of
the ruling party candidate, while portraying the main challenger in
a negative light -- if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Woldenberg, who heads the independent Federal Electoral
Institute carrying out the elections, said campaign coverage by
both newspapers and broadcast media ''started out balanced but is
no longer so.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme example brought to light so far, two
journalists at the English-language newspaper The News said Monday
they were ordered by a newspaper executive not to run stories about
leading opposition candidate Vicente Fox or use photographs of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the latest step in steadily increasing censorship at
The News,'' said national news editor Josh Tuynman.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of The News staff confirmed the order, but didn't
want his name published for fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the newspaper group that owns The News, Romulo
O'Farrill, said Tuynman had been perceived as biased in favor of
Fox and was told not to run election stories without consulting his
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   But he denied a blanket prohibition on Fox coverage and pointed
to coverage of all the candidates' campaigns by the half-dozen
other newspapers his company owns.
</P>
<P>
   The News hasn't mentioned Fox or run a photograph of him since
Wednesday, when the staffers said the order was issued. It has run
at least a brief story on ruling party candidate Francisco
Labastida every day and carried a front-page photograph of him
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It is an example of what many news media executives concede is
common practice at newspapers and radio and television stations,
which favor candidates of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City has two dozen daily newspapers and hundreds of
newspapers pepper the provinces, but circulation is low and most
people get their news from television or radio.
</P>
<P>
   Woldenberg said the two national television networks have
reported on the race in a balanced manner, although many election
watchdog groups disagree, saying his agency places too much
emphasis on the quantity -- rather than the quality -- of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While the networks give roughly the same time to each candidate,
watchdog groups say Labastida is usually shown making ringing
promises amid crowds of cheering supporters. Fox is usually shown
being peppered with tough questions, or making less-choice quotes
on barely audible tape.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Sarmiento, director of the editorial committee at the TV
Azteca network, said the PRI ''offers better (technical) conditions
for transmissions'' of campaign news -- resulting in a better image
-- but denied his network was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Leopoldo Gomez, vice president for news at Mexico's largest
network, Televisa, said Fox often answers impromptu questions from
reporters -- something that Labastida's closely orchestrated
campaign rarely allows.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers are unabashedly partisan. One of Mexico's
largest dailies, Excelsior, routinely features lengthy reports and
copious photographs of Labastida, while Fox gets unflattering or
microscopic coverage. On Monday, the newspaper devoted the front
page, a three-page spread inside and the top editorial to
Labastida. A brief story about Fox ran on page 26, without a
photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided on an editorial line based on what's best for the
country. ... The PRI is the most serious party and has the best
plan for the country,'' said Excelsior director Jose Barrenechea.
</P>
<P>
   Notimex, Mexico's government-funded news agency, offers a
similar explanation. ''That's freedom of expression: the right to
say anything you want, to have any bias you want,'' said its
director, Jorge Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Virgilio Caballero, president of the Mexican Committee in
Defense of the Right to Information, said government advertising
revenues and funding are important for many newspapers and
broadcasters, and that the ruling party can influence their
business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowhere in the world is there a more beautifully crafted
convergence of interests between the media and the government than
in Mexico,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, this year's election coverage has by and large been
fairer and more balanced than that of any previous election.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, the news media all but ignored opposition
candidates and served mainly as a platform for the PRI. In many
cases, government officials dictated articles by telephone to
newspaper editors, who published them under reporters' bylines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Woldenberg and independent media watchdog
groups praised the news media for their improved campaign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But many editors, election officials and free-press advocates
say the pressure on news outlets mounted as the race tightened in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage ''was much broader and more balanced than in the
past, but it appears that in the last few weeks it has leaned
toward the ruling party,'' said Jose Santiago Healy, publisher of
El Imparcial in the northern city of Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   A top Labastida aide, Javier Trevino, denied the ruling party
had an unfair influence on coverage. ''We have regular contact
between the PRI and the media, trying, like anybody else does, to
tell our story.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure hasn't been limited to the PRI, although because it
has long been synonymous with the government it is far more
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Editors get calls from all of Mexico's main political parties
seeking to put their spin on articles, and journalists from at
least three newspapers say reporters were reassigned from the Fox
campaign after his aides called editors.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Fox's spokeswoman nor a spokesman for the PRI
immediately returned phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many writers and editors like Tuynman are eagerly awaiting
election day so they can get back to their normal jobs: reporting
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some of us who are looking forward to July 3,''
Tuynman said.

<HEADLINE> Liberal activist Fulani withdraws support of Buchanan  </HEADLINE>
By DOUGLAS KIKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Liberal activist Lenora Fulani resigned from
Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign and withdrew her support,
saying the socially conservative candidate has divided the Reform
Party by excluding other viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, in response, defended his efforts to keep his
anti-abortion stance and other social issues at the forefront of
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am and remain proudly pro-life,'' he said in a letter to
Fulani. ''Political leaders must defend the moral order rooted in
the Old and New Testament and natural law that is under relentless
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani, in a letter to Buchanan announcing her resignation as
campaign co-chair, criticized him for putting his conservative
issues above their common interests in political reform, trade and
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must and do object to your efforts to transform the party
into a party of, and for, only social conservatives,'' Fulani wrote
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She said Buchanan's political maneuverings to consolidate power
in the party, which was founded by Ross Perot, were ''contributing
to polarizing, rather than unifying the disparate forces in the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani pointed to a contentious party meeting in Nashville,
Tenn., in February in which former party chairman Jack Gargan was
ousted. Buchanan's refusal to support her in trying to get Gargan
re-elected ''demonstrated that you were more than willing to 'stick
it' to your friends as well as your enemies to achieve ... your own
ends,'' Fulani wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, in his letter, said he, too, regretted the turmoil of
the Nashville meeting. ''We want to put off any further intra-party
feuds until we have given reform the kind of leadership, campaign,
and national recognition we believe will put the Reform Party on
America's political map - for good,'' Buchanan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, who quit the Republican Party for the Reform
Party, vowed not to back away from his social conservative
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe the deepest problems in our society are not
economic or political, but moral,'' Buchanan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani, who will remain in the Reform Party, also complained
that Buchanan and his sister and campaign manager, Bay Buchanan,
refused to support her bid to become the national chairwoman of the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supporting me for chair was the test of whether you still
intended to broaden your coalition and maintain the party's
commitment to left/center/right alliances,'' Fulani wrote.
Rejecting her, Fulani said, shows Buchanan is trying to move the
Reform Party ''in a direction that most American independents do
not support.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani said that she hopes Green Party presidential candidate
Ralph Nader will consider entering the fight for the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strongest independent running right now in terms of his
appeal to a broad movement is Ralph Nader,'' Fulani said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Fulani said she met with Buchanan on Thursday
and discussed her feelings about the campaign and who he might
choose as a running mate. Fulani had hoped he would consider
choosing someone more liberal, but he did not show any interest in
that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat has chosen to run his campaign in a much more narrow way
to appeal to the right and he has not taken the effort to reach out
beyond his initial base despite his initial interest in doing so,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani and Buchanan are on the opposite end of the political
spectrum on almost every issue. Buchanan wooed Fulani with his
support of same-day voter registration, political reform, campaign
finance reform, opposition to some international trade agreements,
and foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greeks Sacrifice for Europe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal (AP) -- Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis said Monday the fact his country can join Europe's
single currency, the euro, next year showed Greek people ''were
willing to make sacrifices'' for European integration.
</P>
<P>
   Simitis said in 1994 ''many doubted'' Greece could implement the
economic reforms needed to join the euro. ''We succeeded because
all these years we followed a consistent economic policy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Greece will become the 12th member of the single currency bloc
on New Year's Day. It was barred from doing so when the currency
was launched Jan. 1, 1999, because it failed to meet the entry
requirements of low inflation, deficit and debt.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, tight economic policies by the Simitis government
have seen Greece fulfill the monetary union membership terms.
</P>
<P>
   Greek membership will leave Britain, Sweden and Denmark as the
only EU nations outside the eurozone. Denmark is holding a
referendum on joining in September. The Swedish and British
governments also plan to put the currency to a popular vote, but
have yet to say when.
</P>
<P>
   ''EMU is a not a panacea,'' Simitis said. ''But we have to know
that with this historic step ... Greece makes a big, qualitative
and developmental leap (toward) more stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou painted an upbeat
picture of Greece's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall have half the interest rates we now have, because
national interest rates are still high. Low interest rates,
continued price stability and faster growth -- together with a
strong currency -- are the immediate effects of eurozone membership
for Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Bank of Greece's key 14-day deposit rate is 8.75
percent, compared with the European Central Bank's main refinancing
rate of 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the expected acceleration in growth would be
broad-based, saying, ''The Greek economy (covers) services,
manufacturing, agriculture, tourism. I believe in all these sectors
we have large scope for growth.''

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg calls for lower limits for drunken driving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg has renewed his
push to get states to adopt lower limits at which drivers are
considered drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, D-N.J., along with U.S. Rep. Rush Holt, D-Princeton,
and Millie Webb, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, called
on Congress on Monday to pass legislation that would require states
to adopt 0.08 as the legal limit or risk losing federal highway
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a driver is considered drunk in New Jersey when his
blood alcohol content is 0.10 percent or above.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate passed the drunken driving provision last week
as part of a $54.7 billion transportation bill. The bill would give
states three years to adopt the lower limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress has a chance to save lives by passing a national
drunk driving standard of .08,'' Lautenberg said. ''I strongly urge
New Jersey's House members to endorse this provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, a longtime advocate of the national standard, said a
0.08 limit nationwide would save 500 to 700 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the House has blocked past Senate efforts to make the
standard 0.08, which is now the limit in 18 states and the District
of Columbia. The other 32 states have less stringent 0.10 percent
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving says the risk of a fatal crash is
11 times greater from a driver at 0.08 than for a non-drinking
driver. The American Beverage Institute contends that it's more
important to get real problem drinkers off the road and cites a

<HEADLINE> Radiating Clogged Arteries Endorsed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Radiating the inside of coronary arteries may
soon be offered to certain heart patients whose blood vessels
reclog after angioplasties: Government advisers recommended
approval Monday of the first angioplasty radiation device.
</P>
<P>
   About 750,000 Americans have angioplasties each year, where a
balloon is threaded into arteries to push back plaque that can
cause a heart attack. The procedure can work very well. But in many
people, the artery reclogs, a process called restenosis.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists thought they could solve that problem with stents,
scaffolding-like devices threaded into the artery to hold it open.
But some people's arteries still reclog, as scar-like tissue builds
around the stent.
</P>
<P>
   It is those toughest patients that researchers hope to help by
threading radiation-emitting devices inside the arteries during
repeated angioplasties, in the theory that radiation might stop new
clog-forming cells.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously
recommended that Cordis Corp.'s Checkmate intravascular radiation
device be approved for those very severe patients, as long as the
company meets some conditions. The FDA isn't bound by its advisers'
recommendations but typically follows them.
</P>
<P>
   Studies showed the radiation helped keep arteries open for six
to nine months, said FDA cardiovascular chief James Dillard.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA questioned if radiation also prevented heart attacks
and deaths, or if the procedure might cause heart attacks. The
advisers said there was too little data to be sure, so the
Checkmate should be approved only if Cordis continues to study
recipients for five years to settle that serious question, Dillard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the device also will require a specially trained team of
doctors, the advisers said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Govt., Rebel Group Meet  </HEADLINE>
By FABIOLA SANCHEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Representatives of Colombia's
government and its largest leftist rebel group met in the
Venezuelan capital on Monday in preliminary talks about a possible
cease-fire in the country's 36-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting proves ''roads to peace'' are opening up, government
envoy Luis Guillermo Giraldo said after a one-hour meeting with
senior commander Raul Reyes of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, who has met in recent days with Colombian officials and
intermediaries in Madrid and Havana, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will meet separately with Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, who has been using his credentials as a left-leaning
politician to urge peace in Colombia's war with the rebels,
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think finally the peace process is advancing,'' Rangel
added. ''I see very good will on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   FARC, which has about 15,000 fighters, is the larger of the two
main guerrilla groups fighting since the 1960s in a conflict that
has claimed more than 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Caracas meeting comes as Chavez faces accusations by his
former intelligence chief, Jesus Urdaneta, of taking sides in the
Colombian dispute.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Urdaneta accused Chavez of ordering a former interior
minister to funnel some $300,000 to the rebels. He said Chavez's
Fifth Republic Movement sent arms to the rebels and accused the
president of blocking a raid on a party office where investigators
believed weapons were stored.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Urdaneta left Chavez's government in January and is now an ally
of Francisco Arias, Chavez's main opponent in an upcoming
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> State police superintendent, local officers denounce killer's parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Police officials outraged by a ruling that
said a man convicted of killing two officers should be paroled
gathered Monday to urge the state Supreme Court to keep him in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   All law enforcement officers should be ''shocked and dismayed''
that an appeals court ordered Thomas Trantino released, said Robert
L. Herndon, president of the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs
of Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Likewise all New Jerseyans who enjoy the safety of their
families and homes should be appalled at the prospect of the
release of this cold-blooded assassin, whose brutal and gruesome
acts of murder still shock decent society,'' Herndon said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen police chiefs gathered at Princeton Borough's
police headquarters. They were seeking more than just public
support, Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs were hoping the public outrage would sway the state
Supreme Court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9 the appellate panel ordered Trantino transferred to a
halfway house and gave the state Corrections Department 30 days to
prepare him for release. Trantino has been in prison for 37 years
since the murder of Lodi police officers Gary Tedesco and Peter
Voto in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the high court said it would hear Attorney General
John J. Farmer's petition for the justices to consider the case on
July 5. A two-page order signed by Associate Justice Gary S. Stein
delayed the order to release Trantino but offered no reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lower court tells us that Trantino has been treated
unfairly. With all due respect, this represents to me a gross
distortion of all notions of fairness and justice,'' Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   The police chiefs were joined by State Police Superintendent
Col. Carson Dunbar. Dunbar said he remembers being shocked by the
killings as a police recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was as cold-blooded an act as I have ever heard. These
specific murders should never be looked upon as just murder,''
Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, 37 years living in prison is a long time. Yet, how do we
explain this to the two slain officers and their families,'' Dunbar
said.

<HEADLINE> FBI records detail kidnapping plots against John F. Kennedy Jr.  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - In his 38 years of life, John F. Kennedy Jr.
was the target of at least three kidnapping threats - the latest
just four years before he died in a plane crash, according to FBI
records released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, confirmed by the U.S. government, occurred more
than two decades ago when Kennedy was still in elementary school.
The 162 newly released records, which The Associated Press obtained
through a Freedom of Information Act request, contain sketchy
details about two more threats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, someone called the FBI in New York offering information
about an alleged plot to kidnap Kennedy in New York City, according
to an FBI report dated July 13, 1995. The caller told the FBI that
the alleged kidnappers ''had determined that Kennedy rode a bicycle
in Manhattan and did not have any body guards,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ''ARMED AND DANGEROUS'' was typed on several of the
FBI documents about the plot. But the individual told the FBI
''that he never heard any statements from any of the suspects that
suggested they would harm Kennedy,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Few details about the suspects, who were believed to have some
connection to Colombia, South America, could be gleaned from the
pages, which were heavily redacted, or blackened out, before their
release.
</P>
<P>
   ''The security firm that handles security for the Kennedys has
been apprised of the potential threat to John F. Kennedy Jr.,'' one
report said. ''A representative from the firm advised that Kennedy
would be notified.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI bureaus in Florida and California also were advised of the
alleged kidnapping scheme, which was never carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington office of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was
contacted but chose not to comment on the new release of FBI
records.
</P>
<P>
   The documents reveal a second kidnapping threat on May 14, 1985,
two years after Kennedy graduated from Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   The Herndon, Va., police department received a call from an
apparently intoxicated white male who told them that ''he and seven
other individuals intended on kidnapping John Kennedy that evening
at 8 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You know Massachusetts?'' the man added before he abruptly
hung up.
</P>
<P>
   The other kidnapping threat occurred in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government announced on July 15, 1972 the arrests of
eight Greeks on various charges, including an alleged plot to
kidnap Kennedy, who was in elementary school at the time. He was to
be abducted while visiting the Greek island of Skorpios, which was
owned by his stepfather, Aristotle Onassis, a shipping tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI records were replete with fuzzy details about the two
kidnapping plots. But one report concerned a letter, postmarked
Aug. 26, 1994, that Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., received from
Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dear Sen. Biden,'' the letter said. ''You are a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was signed ''John F. Kennedy Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting was analyzed. Fingerprints were lifted from the
letter. But no suspects were identified, and the case was closed at
the end of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Bills Can End Tobacco Suit  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department will drop its
multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry if the
House approves legislation forbidding other agencies to pick up
some of the cost, Attorney General Janet Reno said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying her agency could not afford the legal costs, Reno said
stopping other departments from supporting the suit would prevent
the government from reaping a bonanza similar to the $246 billion
settlement the states have reached with cigarette companies. The
federal lawsuit seeks to recover billions spent by Medicare and
other federal programs to treat illnesses caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some members of Congress are now trying to shut America's
taxpayers out of the courtroom,'' Reno said as the House prepared
for a pivotal vote on the issue. ''Without these critical funds, we
will have no choice but to seek to dismiss this litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's remarks came as the House began debating a $101.1 billion
measure financing veterans, housing, environment and space programs
for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. The bill would block plans by
the Department of Veterans Affairs to transfer $4 million from its
medical care account, which includes legal costs, to the Justice
Department for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''These funds are precious and dear,'' said Rep. James Walsh,
R-N.Y., chief author of the spending bill. ''Let the Justice
Department take it out of their own hide. That's their job. They're
the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said the bill language was an
effort to protect cigarette companies, whom Waxman has spent years
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question who is behind this rider,'' he said,
referring to the legislative language. ''It is the tobacco
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's earlier comments, delivered with lawmakers and leaders of
veterans and health-care groups at her side, upped the political
ante in the government's confrontation with an industry that many
politicians are reluctant to be seen as helping. The congressional
and presidential elections are less than five months away.
</P>
<P>
   Several House and Senate spending bills would either prohibit
other agencies from giving money to the Justice Department for the
suit or simply fail to provide money for the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers supporting the ban on helping finance the lawsuit
found themselves opposing the powerful veterans lobby. In a letter
distributed at Reno's news conference, four veterans groups called
it ''inappropriate for Congress to attempt to undermine this
litigation by manipulating the resources needed to support this
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups were AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed
Veterans of America and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is expected to cost the government $26.2 million
next year alone, said White House budget chief Jack Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Under current plans, the Justice Department would pay for $14.2
million of that, he said. The remainding $12 million would be
divided evenly among the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense,
and Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed its lawsuit last September. At the
time, Reno said federal health plans pay more than $20 billion
annually treating smoking related diseases, while kill 400,000
Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that for 45 years, tobacco companies
conspired to mislead the public about the health perils of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers have called the lawsuit ''blatantly political''
and ''the height of hypocrisy'' because the government warned the
public of smoking dangers in the 1960s. Tobacco companies have also
challenged the government's right to recover payments it has made
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be transferred to the Justice Department under a
1995 law that allows it to be reimbursed for legal costs by other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A separate House spending bill would limit that 1995 law to only
suits in which the government is defending itself, not aggressive
actions like the tobacco case. Rogers has said the five-year-old
law, passed when the Defense Department was being sued after
canceling a contract for a Navy fither plane, was meant to apply
only to such situations.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate spending bill would repeal the 1995 law.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said the tobacco suit had a $13.8 million price tag, $5.8
million of which came from the Justice Department. The rest came
from the three other agencies.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general announces $1.6 million settlement with credit card company </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut has reached a $1.6 million
settlement with a credit card company accused of taking advantage
of hundreds of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal announced the settlement
Monday with Providian Financial Corporation, the nation's sixth
largest credit card provider. The company, based in San Francisco,
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of consumers in Connecticut were financially harmed by
Providian's marketing and credit card practices, Blumenthal
charged.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints included: unjustified finance charges and late fees,
billing mistakes, failure to promptly credit payments or refunds,
erroneously increasing interest rates on credit cards, and charges
for add-on services or products without clear consent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Providian sought to enrich itself by taking advantage of
consumers with less than perfect credit ratings - charging for
unauthorized services, and inadequately disclosing certain fees -
ultimately causing them more damage,'' Blumenthal said. ''They were
too frequent to be characterized as accidents or coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, consumers will receive full restitution and
court ordered protection against the alleged practices. Blumenthal
said the amounts of financial damage vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Providian has 167,000 customers in Connecticut and received
about 100 complaints over two years, said Robert Langer, a lawyer
representing the company. He said the company resolved the
complaints and implemented procedures to make it less likely
consumers would be harmed, including better training of
telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has done a very admirable job,'' Langer said.
</P>
<P>
   Langer denied the company intentionally harmed consumers. He
said Providian wanted to resolve the issue on acceptable terms and
avoid a protracted battle with the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Providian was cooperative during the
investigation, which began last November after his office received
several complaints from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal called the settlement a national model for ending
credit card abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement imposes fundamental reforms that provide a
road map for safeguarding consumers' rights and stopping abuses in
this industry nationwide,'' Blumenthal said.

<HEADLINE> States Lose Trade Discretion Case  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, saying states cannot
infringe on the federal government's foreign policy-making role,
made it harder Monday for states to boycott companies that do
business in nations known for human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously threw out a Massachusetts law that limits
state purchases from companies doing business with Myanmar, also
known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   The law is pre-empted by federal sanctions against Myanmar, the
justices said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state act is at odds with the president's intended
authority to speak for the United States among the world's
nations'' to promote democracy and human rights in Myanmar, ruled
by its military since 1962, Justice David H. Souter wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see the state Burma law as an obstacle to the
accomplishment of Congress' full objectives under the federal
act,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Trade Council, which challenged the
Massachusetts law, said the ruling ''reaffirms the federal
government's predominant role in foreign policy and should help put
an end to state and local efforts to make foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling upholds a federal appeals court decision that
invalidated the Massachusetts law.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General Tom
Reilly. ''We feel this law addressed basic human rights and allowed
the state to decide who it did business with.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Byron Rushing of Boston, author of the invalidated
law, said he would push for a new law to divest any of the state's
$32 billion pension fund that is invested with companies that trade
in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that American corporations get a sense that
they are really going against a growing trend in the U.S. -- that
people care about human rights around the world,'' Rushing said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law was similar to the boycotts of South
Africa by many states and cities during the era of racial
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Souter wrote, however: ''Since we never ruled on whether state
and local sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s were
pre-empted or otherwise invalid, arguable parallels between the two
sets of federal and state acts do not tell us much about the
validity of the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of state and local governments, including New York City
and Los Angeles, restrict their purchases from companies doing
business in places like Myanmar, China or the British province of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts -- home of the 1773 Boston Tea Party, in which
colonists dumped tea in Boston Harbor rather than pay taxes to
England -- argued that it had a right to apply a ''moral standard''
to its spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging the law, the foreign trade organization said
foreign policy must be exclusively controlled by the federal
government because allowing states and cities to have their own
policies would harm trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supported the challenge, citing the
federal government's ''pre-eminent role in acting for the United
States in the international arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' 1996 law allowed companies doing business with
Myanmar to sell goods and services to the state only if their bid
was 10 percent lower than any other bid. The law made exceptions
for some medical devices, newsgathering and international
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Congress imposed its own sanctions on Myanmar later in 1996, and
under the law President Clinton barred new U.S. investments in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw
out the Massachusetts law, and the Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress clearly intended the federal act to provide the
president with flexible and effective authority over economic
sanctions against Burma,'' Souter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply implausible that Congress would have gone to such
lengths to empower the president if it had been willing to
compromise his effectiveness by deference to every provision of
state statute or local ordinance'' that might conflict with federal
action, Souter added.

<HEADLINE> Bookstores plan marketing extravaganza for fourth Harry Potter book </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Bookstores are hoping Harry Potter will create
some cash-register magic with next month's publication of the
fourth story in the best-selling series about the young wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Many stores will be open just after midnight on July 8 to offer
the as-yet-untitled book the moment it is released. Some are
organizing Harry Potter theme parties with magic shows and live
owls. And Amazon.com is countering by promising free overnight
FedEx delivery for the first 250,000 people who order the book
online.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are extremely anxious for it,'' said Becky Whidden, a
manager at The Children's Book Shop in the Boston suburb of
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Harry Potter book was released in Britain in
1997, the series by J.K. Rowling has been a runaway sensation,
remaining a constant on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   The 752-page fourth book will have a first printing of 3.8
million copies, which many in the publishing business say is a
record. It will be launched simultaneously in the United States and
Britain; the first three books appeared overseas first.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been so great for No. 4 that its U.S. publisher,
Scholastic, has set up a help desk for booksellers just to ask
questions about orders of the new book.
</P>
<P>
   The craze for Harry Potter, the orphan who hones his magical
skills at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, has managed
to turn many children on to reading in general. And while it was
written for the younger set, it has become a phenomenon among
adults, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're going to be classics, like right up there with
'Old Yeller' and 'A Wrinkle in Time,''' said 12-year-old Leah
Williams, who plans to be at Square Books in Oxford, Miss., the
morning the new book goes on sale. ''I like stuff that's not real
because it takes me into a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention, many bricks-and-mortar stores see the
launch as a way to offer shoppers something more than they could
find at the Internet superstores, most of which will take a few
days to deliver the new book.
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Balloon Bookshop in St. Paul, Minn., face-painters
will be drawing lightning bolts on children's foreheads - just like
the one Harry Potter has on his skull - and there will be three
live owls, which are considered friends and messengers in the
books.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at The Blue Marble in Ft. Thomas, Ky., will dress up
like witches and wizards and offer cinnamon oatmeal from a black
cauldron for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Many cyberstores are offering deep discounts, with Amazon
slashing 40 percent off the $25.95 price and Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
cutting 30 percent. That's something that most smaller stores can't
afford to do.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Anderson, a Lake Tahoe resident shopping in San Francisco,
said she bought her 8-year-old grandson his first Harry Potter
book, and as soon as he finished it, he asked, ''Nana, when is the
next one coming out?''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to see kids excited about a book coming out,''
Anderson said.

<HEADLINE> Police search for suspect who stole police car, injured officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLBURN, N.J. (AP) - A man crashed a stolen car in traffic
outside a shopping mall Monday, then stole one of the police cars
chasing him and took off, ramming into one officer as he left,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Millburn police car was recovered in Irvington a few miles
away after the incident outside the Short Hills mall, Capt. Greg
Weber said. The suspect, who police fired shots at as he fled the
scene, is still at large, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer on a motorcycle saw the suspect driving a car
around the mall parking lot, checked the license plate and found
out that the car had been stolen in Elizabeth on Saturday, Weber
said.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcycle and other police cars began chasing the stolen
car after it left the parking lot in the eastbound lanes of Route
24 until the suspect's car crashed into a police car and drove it
off the road, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's car drove across a grass median and three lanes of
westbound traffic and overturned, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   The man got out of the car, ran across the median and into an
empty police car abandoned by officers who had begun a foot chase,
Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed the car door on the arm of Officer Reginald Hay, then
hit Officer Gino Baldani with the vehicle, throwing him 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Baldani, a five-year veteran, was treated at a hospital for head
and back injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired at the car as it left, although Weber couldn't
say how many officers fired or how many shots were fired. At least
two bullet holes were visible in the police car when it was
recovered on an Irvington residential street.
</P>
<P>
   No police cars chased the stolen car because officers were
helping Baldani, Weber said.

<HEADLINE> Family Court hearing examiner says Jagger must disclose finances  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A court hearing examiner said Monday that
Rolling Stone Mick Jagger must reveal his financial worth so the
court can decide how much he must pay to support the son he
fathered with a Brazilian model.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing Examiner David Kirshblum of Manhattan's Family Court
told Jagger's lawyers to provide him with a net worth statement by
Aug. 1 when he will question Jagger, 56, by telephone from England
about his finances.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger's lawyer, John Vassallo, said he will appeal the ruling.
He said Kirshblum's order is unnecessary because the veteran rocker
says he can pay any legal and reasonable child support amount that
the court orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should the entire world know what he (Jagger) is worth in
order (for the court) to fix support for a 1-year-old?'' Vassallo
said after the all-day hearing adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the best-known Stone acknowledged to Kirshblum via
transatlantic telephone that he is the father of Lucas Morad
Jagger, born May 18, 1999, to Luciana Morad, a native of Rio de
Janeiro and now a New York resident.
</P>
<P>
   After that admission - which followed DNA tests, Kirshblum
boosted the child support Jagger had to pay from $5,600 to $10,000
a month. Monday's hearing was on Morad's request for child support
of $35,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Morad, 29, who testified for several hours during the all-day
hearing, told the court that she had met Jagger last Friday in a
room he rented in a London hotel. She said she slept at the home of
the son of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Morad said later outside court that she and Jagger are still
very good friends and she had hoped they could sort out their
financial differences.
</P>
<P>
   Morad told Kirshblum she needs more money for rent; nannies;
housekeepers; trips to Europe and Brazil for herself, the baby and
the nanny; and security - especially when she visits her family in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, Brazil is a very, very dangerous country right
now,'' Morad testified. She added that her father and her best
friend had been kidnapped. Apparently, they were eventually
released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshblum said that on Aug. 1, he will ask Jagger about security
and travel arrangements for his other children because Morad said
she wants Lucas to have similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Morad said she wanted a three-bedroom apartment - a separate
room for herself, the baby, and his nanny - and asked for at least
$6,000 a month. She now pays $3,300 a month for two bedrooms on the
upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Replying to Vassallo, Morad said she lives in New York because
Jagger told her to live there. She said he didn't want her in
London because it embarrassed his other children, meaning the four
he had with model Jerry Hall.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Apologizes for Comment  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERICK J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ranking Democrat on the House
Transportation Committee apologized Monday for what he said was an
''offensive'' remark about the creation of a black-owned airline as
part of the proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., in a speech on the House
floor, said he was still concerned that the planned carrier under
the ownership of Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L.
Johnson would be tied too closely to the newly merged United and
not be an effective competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Oberstar, at a Transportation Committee hearing last week on the
proposed merger, said DC Air, which would lease equipment,
personnel and maintenance service from the merged airlines, would
have a ''plantation'' status.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the use of the word in reference to a black-owned
company was racist and demanded an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, Oberstar said, ''called upon me to change my attitude.
I came to the well today to apologize to Mr. Johnson and to the
committee for my careless, inappropriate and offensive remark.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he has been a champion of minority rights and a
stalwart backer of Haiti and ''I cannot let that record of 40 years
be tarnished by one ''ill-chosen'' word.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposed the proposed merger but hoped that if the
Justice Department approves it it would require the merging
airlines to divest additional assets to DC Air to make the startup
carrier a more viable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he accepted Oberstar's apology, and commented:
''His statement showed me that as a man he searched his soul and
searched his heart, and realized what he said, and apologized for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch, who testified against
the merger and has been one of its most outspoken critics, kept the
controversy alive, accusing Johnson of exploiting the comment for
his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it very sad that an executive of a communications
company would play a race card to further the monopolization of the
airline industry,'' Hatch, a Democrat, said in a telephone
interview Monday. ''He should know better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hatch is certainly not a man of the character of Mr.
Oberstar,'' replied Johnson, who only three days earlier said
Oberstar was either a closet racist or someone who had lost all
sense of decency and fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Hatch) is still in denial. I frankly feel that he ought to
talk again with Congressman Oberstar and change his attitude the
way the congressman changed his.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said accusing him of playing the race card is ''like
saying a rape victim screaming she's been raped is playing the rape
card. Congressman Oberstar used the word plantation, not me. I
simply pointed out the error of his ways, and the congressman is
man enough to admit it. Mr. Hatch ought to be man enough to admit
the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> Aristide Partisans Disrupt Capital  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Militant supporters of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide paralyzed Haiti's capital Monday,
setting a fire outside the U.S. Embassy, trying to burn an American
flag and blocking streets to demand the release of last month's
election results.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters stoned vehicles and set tire barricades aflame. They
blocked Port-au-Prince's main arteries with hulks of vehicles,
junked refrigerators and large rocks. Shops and schools stayed
shut.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, protesters also reportedly paralyzed Gonaives,
Haiti's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, demonstrators lit a
large pile of debris on fire and chanted anti-American slogans.
Haitian police watched but did not intervene. The protesters then
moved to the nearby United Nations Plaza, where they lowered an
American flag and tried to set it ablaze before police grabbed the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is a nation of thieves. It has tried to
steal our votes, that's why we're burning the flag,'' one protester
said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's violence was the second time in a week that Aristide
supporters had shut down the capital. On Friday, they threw stones
and threatened more violence if election results were not
published.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's Radio Galaxie quoted election chief Leon Manus as saying
Monday that he refused to give in to pressure from President Rene
Preval to sign off on incorrect results. The station, in a report
from its correspondent in the United States, quoted Manus as saying
that Aristide candidates won only seven Senate seats but Preval had
insisted that they had won 16 and that Manus make that official.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station did not say where Manus was. He fled to the
United States after receiving a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining six members of the electoral council -- minus their
president and two members who resigned on Thursday -- promised to
publish final results later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The council members have already published mayoral results from
eight of Haiti's nine electoral districts. The results gave
Aristide candidates control of all the biggest towns and of
metropolitan Port-au-Prince, where a third of the country's 8
million people live.
</P>
<P>
   To restore constitutional government, Haiti held elections May
21 for the lower house of Parliament and 19 of 27 Senate seats.
Preliminary results showed Aristide's Lavalas Family party winning
16 Senate seats and more than 20 of 83 lower house races -- a
victory opposition leaders say would set Haiti on the road to a
one-party state under Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, United Nations and Organization of American
States have challenged the vote-counting process.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States wants the Haitian government and the country's
electoral authorities to complete the vote count in accordance with
''the Haitian constitution and the electoral law.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority to avoid a
second round of voting. But officials counted the votes of only the
top four contenders and not the others who ran and may have gotten
a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Those missing votes created an erroneous winning percentage
count, observers say, giving at least eight of 16 Senate seats to
Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the objections, a pro-Aristide parliament should be
installed by July. Aristide -- who served as president from
1991-1995 -- is expected to win presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti hasn't had a constitutional government since Preval, an
Aristide ally, shut down Parliament in January 1999 to resolve an
18-month power struggle with the opposition majority party. Preval
then appointed a new premier by decree.

Report shows steep drop in Medicaid enrollment
By NANCY PARELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey is one of a handful of states
that allows former welfare recipients to stay on Medicaid, but the
state has still seen steep drops in its Medicaid rolls, according
to a national study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because so few people know about the continued benefit,
child advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is possibly the worst unintended consequence of welfare
reform,'' said Ciro Scalera, executive director of the Association
for Children of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Families USA study, New Jersey saw a 30 percent
drop in its Medicaid caseload from January 1996 to October 1999.
Most of that occurred in the past two years when almost 25,000
parents - 22 percent of the total caseload - lost Medicaid
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state ranks fifth in the nation, with 42 percent of
low-income adults, age 19 to 64, lacking health insurance,
according U.S. Census data.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA, an advocacy group that lobbies for universal
health coverage, examined Medicaid figures in 15 states with most
of the uninsured low-income population and found that 945,880
parents had been dropped from the program from 1996 to 1999. More
than 2.5 million were enrolled in Medicaid in the 15 states at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   State officials acknowledge a problem exists, but they say they
are addressing it.
</P>
<P>
   The state is mailing letters every month to people who have left
welfare, telling them they can continue to receive Medicaid and
other benefits for two years after they leave welfare, said
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the state Department of Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are also planning to knock on doors of former
welfare recipients this summer, informing them of the benefits. The
state set up a hot line and retrained welfare caseworkers to better
inform people about available benefits, Tencza said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said some of the drop in the Medicaid rolls is because
people got jobs that provide health insurance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Tencza said, is that the two-year Medicaid
extension that New Jersey extends to former welfare recipients is
now running out for many people.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the state Legislature needs to enact ''FamilyCare
Health Coverage Act,'' a program that would provide health
insurance for the working poor, said Scalera. Gov. Christie Whitman
has proposed the program, but lawmakers have not yet acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   A state-financed study released last fall found that most people
- 75 percent - were aware of the various welfare benefits but
didn't understand they could use them, she said. Others said the
paperwork was too complicated.

Jagger to pay $10,000 a month in child support.
</P>
<P>
   Morad, 29, is now requesting $35,000 a month. She told Kirshblum
she needs more money for rent; nannies; housekeepers; trips to
Europe and Brazil for herself, the baby and the nanny; and security
-- especially when she visits her family in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, Brazil is a very, very dangerous country right
now,'' Morad testified. She said her father and her best friend had
been kidnapped. Apparently, they were eventually released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Morad said outside court that she and Jagger are still very good
friends and that she had hoped they could sort out their financial
differences.

RSC Stages Swift, Savage 'Macbeth'   
An AP Entertainment Review
BY MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Fierce ambition followed by even fiercer
paranoia reign in the Royal Shakespeare Company's swift, savage
production of ''Macbeth,'' the crown jewel of Connecticut's 2000
International Festival of Arts and Ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in the same week as Broadway's underdone Kelsey Grammer
''Macbeth,'' the marvelous RSC version of the Scottish play
bristles with an energy and theatricality missing from its New York
counterpart, which is folding Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Credit director Gregory Doran and his two stars, Antony Sher and
Harriet Walter, with igniting one of Shakespeare's most difficult
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Though not tall, Sher is a physically mesmerizing actor --
disturbing, dark and deep-set eyes offset by a wide, toothy smile
that can turn suddenly from sweet to snakelike. Vocally, he is
astonishingly adept, negotiating some of Shakespeare's best-known
soliloquies with an intensity that does not shortchange poetry for
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Sher, dressed in a black beret and army fatigues, uses this
scariness to his advantage as Macbeth climbs to the Scottish throne
over the bodies of Duncan, the king, and Banquo, his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the murderous deeds are done does this Macbeth suffer
second thoughts. Sher twitches and quakes, turning the man into a
haunted creature, spooked and stymied by eerie sounds and the
spirits of those he has brutally dispatched. The actor captures
this fear and indecision brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   Walter's coolly calculating Lady Macbeth is a helpmate of equal
stature. Her Lady Macbeth is almost patrician, steely in egging on
her husband to more killing. Yet the woman's unraveling is adroit,
unnerving and weirdly heartbreaking. In the famous sleepwalking
scene, this Lady Macbeth clutches and claws at the air as she
grapples with the crimes her husband has committed with her
support.
</P>
<P>
   There's sturdy support and several memorable portraits from the
other actors, too. Stephen Noonan's Porter, who provides the play's
few moments of comic relief, matches Sher's dark humor. The
production has been Americanized a bit, adding jokes by the Porter
about Clinton that in England were aimed at Prime Minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Even the three witches, who are the most traditional aspect of
this production, manage to make an impression, particularly when
they upend a dining room table after the appearance of Banquo's
ghost.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the Broadway and RSC productions of
''Macbeth'' are remarkably similar. Both are about two hours in
length, without intermissions and are done in a spare, dark,
modern-dress style that lets the story proceed with remarkable
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the RSC version, done on Long Wharf Theater's thrust stage,
has a vitality that can't just be attributed to its two stars and a
strong supporting cast. Doran, the director, tells the story
clearly, letting the horrors simply unfold, tumbling out of the
dastardly actions of two of the most fascinating villains
Shakespeare put on stage.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Sponsor Presidential Debates  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several corporations that spend millions of
dollars lobbying Congress -- including AT&AMP;T, Anheuser-Busch and Sun
Microsystems -- are also paying to put on this fall's presidential
debates. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader wants it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed Monday, the Green Party presidential hopeful
contended that federal laws prohibiting corporate contributions to
campaigns also apply to the October debates. Nader is seeking to
overturn a Federal Election Commission ruling allowing the
donations.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Anheuser-Busch and Sun Microsystems are among companies
making tax-deductible contributions to the Commission on
Presidential Debates, which is sponsoring the debates in Boston,
St. Louis and Winston-Salem, N.C., along with one vice presidential
debate in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Previous sponsors include Philip Morris, Ford and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlawful corporate contributions to the debates corrupts the
political process, tilts the electoral playing field sharply toward
the Democratic and Republican parties, undermining third parties
and limiting the choices of voters,'' Nader said in the lawsuit
against the FEC, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   FEC spokesman Ron Harris said the agency does not comment on
pending lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the debate commission, said
she hadn't seen the lawsuit but that the panel follows FEC and
Internal Revenue Service regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, co-chaired by former Democratic National
Committee Chairman Paul Kirk and former Republican National
Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., ruled in January that only
candidates with at least 15 percent support in national polls could
participate in the debates.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, whose support in the polls is far below the 15 percent
threshold, is not the only third-party candidate challenging the
debate structure. In March, Pat Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform
Party nomination, filed a complaint with the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   A government watchdog group said the corporate donations as
another way for companies to buy access to policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are they getting out of it besides the opportunity to
hobnob and negotiate with aides and principles in the presidential
campaign?'' said Charles Lewis, director of the Center for Public
Integrity. ''Like everyone else, they want access to power.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said donors get nothing but tickets to attend the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I wanted access to the candidates, a contribution to the
commission isn't a very effective way to get it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's sponsors have issues before Congress and the federal
government. AT&AMP;T recently received Federal Communications
Commission and Justice Department approval to buy the cable
television company MediaOne. AT&AMP;T also spent $7.6 million on
lobbying expenses last year, according to FECInfo, an Internet
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch spent $1.4 million on lobbying in 1999. Last
week, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to make the 0.08
percent blood alcohol content a nationwide standard for drunk
driving. The company and the rest of the alcohol industry opposes
the standard, which is more stringent than in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems has supported the Justice Department's lawsuit
against Microsoft Corp. and testified in support of the government.
It spent $1.1 million lobbying last year.

<HEADLINE> Daughter of defendant testifies in murder conspiracy trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - The daughter of a South Texas millionaire on
trial for arranging the murder of his ex-wife testified Monday that
her father pressured her for her mother's address just days before
the woman's 1997 slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him the address,'' said Daryl Bellush, who said she
spoke to her father, Allen Blackthorne, by phone from a Florida
youth shelter. ''He said he wanted the address so he could come
visit me at Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Bellush was killed three days later in her Sarasota,
Fla., home. Her 2-year-old quadruplets from her second husband were
discovered unharmed, two of them crawling in their mother's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne has been linked in the shooting and stabbing death
of Bellush - the mother of six. He is charged with interstate
conspiracy to commit murder for hire and interstate domestic
violence. He faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl also testified that her father told her he had hired
someone to follow her mother after the Bellush family moved to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him my mom believed someone was following her,'' the
girl said.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl was in a youth shelter at the time, following accusations
that her mother physically abused her several months earlier in San
Antonio. Charges against Bellush were dropped after a police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A worker from the Florida shelter testified Monday that
Blackthorne had called the shelter repeatedly, seeking an address
for the Bellush home.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne's trial, which started last week, could last another
month. Last week, testimony centered around the bitter custody
battle between Blackthorne and Bellush, who divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne voluntarily terminated his parental rights in July
1997 after his ex-wife said for a second time he had abused one of
their two daughters, according to testimony from Ken Nunley, an
attorney who represented Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   Previous court testimony has been admitted into evidence in
which Stevie Bellush said her mother lied about the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley also testified that in September 1997 neighbors of
Bellush sought custody of Darryl after Bellush was accused of
hitting the girl with a belt. The neighbors, who were represented
by Blackthorne's lawyers, later dismissed their suit.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl said Monday that her father urged her to speak with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was encouraging me to talk to the police because it was
time my mom was arrested. I exaggerated. I wanted her arrested. At
that time, I was mad at her. I would rather live with my dad than
my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying at the trial was Daniel Rocha, 30, who is
serving a life prison term in Florida for solicitation of capital
murder in Bellush's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony has linked Blackthorne to Jose Luis Del Toro, the
alleged gunman. Rocha testified he proposed the killing to friend
Sammy Gonzales, who in turn hired his cousin Del Toro.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence in Florida,
also is expected to testify. He pleaded guilty to solicitation of
capital murder and testified against Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, Gonzales said Rocha told him the money and
the murder plot came from Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Employees of former hotel say social security funds are unaccounted for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTICELLO, N.Y. (AP) - Since late last year, an average of 10
former Concord Hotel employees a month have contacted the Social
Security Administration with statements that either under-reported
or didn't report their 1997 and 1998 income, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel officials deny this.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Hotel - the largest of the Catskills' famed
''Borscht Belt'' hotels - closed last November after operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for more than a year. Like
many other upstate New York hotels, the resort's heyday was in the
1920s and '30s when thousands of tourists visited the area.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, up to 200 nonunion employees discovered their medical
insurance had been canceled because the Concord failed to pay the
premiums, even though it continued to deduct money from workers'
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   ''After everything that happened to us, what's next?'' former
dining room employee Joe Blum said to the Middletown Times
Herald-Record.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, a former shop steward with Local 76 of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, estimates as much as $1
million could be unaccounted for. Blum's own W-2s showed an income
of $25,890 for 1997, more than six times the $4,116 indicated on
his Social Security statement.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar discrepancy for 1998 His W2s showed he'd
made $22,235 working in the hotel's dining room that year, but only
$2,656 showed up on his statement.
</P>
<P>
   After the first few people showed up at Social Security
Administration district manager Jim Whittle's office, Whittle
contacted the inspector general's office, which turned the matter
over to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   By law, employers have to match the 7.65 percent they take out
of workers' paychecks for Social Security and Medicare, and fill
out a quarterly 941 form reporting that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ''Occasionally, employers slip up. But when it's more
widespread, there's usually a more significant problem with the
employer,'' Whittle said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parker, the Concord's chief executive officer and a
trustee of its pension fund, said any money taken out of employees'
paychecks since March 1997, the month after it declared bankruptcy,
was ''definitely paid'' to Social Security. But he referred
specific questions to the Concord's bankruptcy attorney, Richard
Braverman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first I've heard of it,'' Braverman said. ''I'm an
attorney, not an accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   Braverman referred questions to the hotel's Liberty accountant,
Irwin Gitlin. Gitlin did not return calls.

<HEADLINE> FTC approves $90 billion Pfizer, Warner-Lambert merger  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission cleared the way
Monday for a $90 billion merger between drug manufacturing giants
Pfizer Inc. and Warner-Lambert Co. that is expected to make the new
Pfizer the largest pharmaceutical company in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a defining moment for Pfizer,'' said William C. Steere
Jr., Pfizer chairman and chief executive officer. ''Combining the
two fastest-growing companies in the industry creates a global
leader in the discovery of health and consumer products that will
benefit millions around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger leaves the combined company dominating many U.S.
medicine cabinets. Together, they hold many of the world's
best-known brands, including Halls, Benadryl, Sudafed, Listerine,
Schick, Visine, Ben Gay, Lubriderm, Zantac and Cortizone.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC agreed to the merger after the companies consented to
divest themselves of some businesses that federal regulators
believed might otherwise constitute a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which makes the male impotence drug Viagra, and
Warner-Lambert, which manufactures the cholesterol drug Lipitor,
first announced they intended to merge Feb. 6. But shortly
thereafter, the FTC filed a complaint contending the corporate
marriage would lessen or eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators initially said the merger would hurt
consumers of the leading class of antidepressants; of treatments
for head lice, which is one of the most prevalent communicable
diseases among young school children; of drugs to treat Alzheimer's
disease; and of drugs being developed to treat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposed
consent agreement but the commissioners will accept public comment
on the proposal until July 19. The agency is expected to make the
agreement final sometime after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competition in pharmaceutical markets encourages lower prices
and spurs innovation for drugs that continue to improve the health
of the American public,'' said Richard G. Parker, director of the
FTC's bureau of competition. ''The commission's order preserves
competition for several very important drugs that treat diseases
suffered by millions of Americans annually - head lice in children,
depression, Alzheimer's and cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger, Pfizer is exchanging 2.75 shares of Pfizer
common stock for each share of Warner-Lambert common stock in a
tax-free transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pfizer had profits of $3.38 billion, or 87 cents per
share, on sales of $16.2 billion. Warner-Lambert's earnings for the
year were $1.73 billion, or $1.96 a share, on sales of $12.93
billion. Pfizer stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange Monday
at $47, a drop of 87 1/2 cents, while Warner Lambert closed at
$129.75, down $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC order says the companies must divest in four areas -
treatments for depression, lice, Alzheimer's and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer said it did not expect the divestitures to have much
effect on the current or future performance of the company. Company
officials also said they expect to realize at least $1.6 billion in
merger-related cost-savings by 2002.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) - The New York State Broadcasters
Association on Monday named state Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno as ''New Yorker of the Year'' for his work to win approval of
a tax cut for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It helps us stay in New York,'' said Joseph Reilly, president
of the association, in presenting the award to the Republican
leader. ''Joe Bruno is going to keep this industry in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   In a short acceptance speech, Bruno told the broadcasters that
cutting taxes was one of his major missions in government and he
vowed, ''We are going to keep working at cutting taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was honored for pushing legislation adopted this year that
makes broadcasters exempt from state sales tax on broadcasting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Previous winners of the broadcasters' award have included New
York's first lady Libby Pataki and both former Gov. Mario Cuomo and
his wife, Matilda Cuomo.

<HEADLINE> Navy Planning More Vieques Tests  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The Navy this week plans to stage
its largest bombing tests on Vieques island since exercises were
suspended last year after a fatal accident, according to documents
released Monday by Puerto Rico's Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   Five ships from the USS George Washington Battle Group will fire
as many as 600 rounds onto the Navy range starting Wednesday,
according to a letter written by Rear Adm. J.K. Moran and Navy
documents, which the Planning Board distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft will drop between 550 and 830 dummy bombs -- including
120 500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs -- during the exercise, which
could last two to five days.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials were surprised by the board's release of the
documents and refused to comment on Vieques operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1983 accord, the Navy provides Puerto Rico's State
Department at least 15 days' notice before Vieques bombing. Puerto
Rico's government cannot publicize the Navy notifications. It
wasn't immediately clear why the Planning Board would have been
notified.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican Secretary of State Angel Morey told The Associated
Press he knew nothing about the documents and would investigate.
Board officials did not immediately return telephone calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Moran's letter to the planning board letter certified that the
training won't have a significant impact on endangered species or
Vieques coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy frequently announced many of its live-fire activities
on Vieques until two stray bombs killed a civilian security guard
on the range in April 1999. The accident unleashed a frenzy of
anti-Navy protest.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters occupied the range and stayed there until
May, when federal officials evicted them. Days later, Navy aircraft
bombed the range and a warship shelled it using dummy munitions, as
is now required under an executive order by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's directive also calls for the Navy to abandon Vieques
by May 2003 if the island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a
referendum expected next year. If the Navy wins, it gets to use
live munitions again.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy insists Vieques is the only place its Atlantic battle
groups can hold simultaneous land, air and sea exercises using live
fire before deploying abroad. That training has saved countless
lives since World War II, the Navy says.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques islanders blame decades of bombing for a high cancer
rate, environmental damage and stunted tourism. Puerto Rican
political and religious leaders embraced their cause. Gov. Pedro
Rossello negotiated a compromise that led to Clinton's directive,
believing that residents will oust the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters still sneak onto the range; 56 were arrested
Saturday. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., meanwhile, was barred on Sunday
from collecting range soil samples for a lawsuit his Natural
Resources Defense Council plans against the Navy.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Firefighters' Work Pays Off  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) -- Three days of backbreaking work paid
off as fire crews fully contained one of two Colorado wildfires
Monday, despite a return of high temperatures and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobcat fire, which burned 10,600 acres about 50 miles
northwest of Denver near Rocky Mountain National Park, was declared
100 percent contained at 6 p.m. Monday, said fire information
officer Susan Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today it was a little drizzle, a lot of hard work and a few
bucket drops,'' Haywood said. ''The wind was good because it tested
the lines and they held.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Meadow fire, about 35 miles southwest of Denver, was
declared 95 percent contained Monday evening, and officials
predicted full containment by Tuesday evening, a day earlier than
previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made it through the day without incident. The wind we
expected did not materialize,'' said Gina Owens, a fire information
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters were able to focus on mop-up efforts instead of
chasing flare-ups caused by gusting winds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite mapping prompted officials to increase their size
estimate of the blaze from 10,500 to 10,800 acres, though the fire
did not grow Monday, Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's feeling pretty good about the progress we made
today and over the last three days,'' Owens said. ''It's due to the
weather and the hard work of the firefighters out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fires started June 12. A cold front blew in on Thursday,
leaving several inches of snow in higher locations and giving
firefighters the break they needed to surround the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Meadow fire burned at least 51 homes, 6 outbuildings and
one sawmill, but authorities said the number might increase as
investigators cover more area. The Bobcat fire destroyed at least
22 structures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, roads in the area were festooned with signs of
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you men and ladies for saving our dreams,'' read one.
''Way to go Hotshots,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have identified a man suspected of starting the
Bobcat fire as Kenneth Winchester, 33, of Loveland, and said he has
refused to talk to sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials initially thought the Hi Meadow fire was caused by
lightning, but this weekend said no signs of lightning were found
where it started. Its cause was being investigated.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A group that accuses Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush of misspending earthquake settlement
money posted recall petitions on the Internet on Monday seeking to
force him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state's office cleared a group called People's
Veto to gather petition signatures using its Web site,
www.peoplesveto.org. The group is asking registered California
voters to download petition forms, sign them and mail them in.
</P>
<P>
   People's Veto has until late November to gather 964,325
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are investigating Quackenbush's decision to let
insurers avoid up to $3 billion in potential fines for violations
related to the 1994 Northridge earthquake by instead giving far
less to a nonprofit fund he created.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush denies wrongdoing but acknowledges none of the $12
million the California Research and Assistance Fund took in has
been spent on the quake research and consumer aid it was created to
provide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unfortunate when things like this occur when the
people have not been provided with all the facts on this particular
issue and the commissioner's positive record in helping California
consumers,'' Quackenbush campaign spokeswoman Michelle Pereira
said.
</P>
<P>
   People's Veto is led by Sandi Webb, a former city councilwoman
in Simi Valley, one of the areas hardest hit by the 1994
earthquake. Her organization, which consists of just Webb, her
husband and another person, cannot afford to hire people to gather
signatures.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts Hispanics in Texas  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- President Clinton ventured into Gov. George W.
Bush's Texas turf Monday and sought support among
Hispanic-Americans, accusing Republicans of blocking the judicial
nominations of qualified minority nominees with ''a high
politicized confirmation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first stop was Houston, to address a fund-raiser for
the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, which conducts
voter campaigns among Hispanics in 12 states and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton took aim at Texas' Republican senators,
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison for blocking one of his
judicial nominees, El Paso lawyer Enrique Moreno. The senators say
Moreno lacks the necessary experience for the judgeship; Clinton
accused the senators of blocking nominees like Moreno as ''part of
a distinctive pattern'' of thwarting candidates that the GOP feels
are not conducive to using the courts ''as an instrument of
partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want them on the court, but they don't want the
people you're trying to register to vote to know they don't want
them on the court,'' Clinton said. ''The answer is to blur
everything ... and hope nobody will know what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited the cases of Ricardo Morado, nominated for the
U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas, and Kathleen
McCree-Lewis of Detroit, who would be the first black woman to
serve on the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals if confirmed. Clinton said
Morado's nomination has been put on hold, while McCree-Lewis can't
get a confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The president stood in a hotel ballroom before a red-and-green
banner reading ''Su Voto es Su Voz,'' or ''your vote is your
voice.'' His audience was small, seated in chairs beside two
oversized charts illustrating Latino voting power. Officials with
the voting project said there are more than a million potential
Hispanic voters to be reached in Texas alone.
</P>
<P>
   The president stressed the need for hate crimes legislation,
citing FBI statistics that showed there were nearly 8,000 hate
crimes reported in 1998, the latest year available. Clinton said
that translated into a rate of one hateful, criminal act for each
hour of the day.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted family members of James Byrd, the black Texas man who
was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white men in
June 1998; Byrd's family has advocated the hate crimes legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different,
and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton
said. ''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family. We have
to pass this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit coincided with Juneteenth celebrations, which
mark the emancipation of slaves in Southwestern states roughly two
years after the end of the Civil War. He said Juneteenth ''should
be a day for rejoicing, but also for reflection and for reminding
ourselves there is still a lot of hardship out there, still a lot
of discrimination against people.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Clinton headed to Austin for two more events to raise
$1 million for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I want to know when I walk out the door Jan. 20 is the
American people took this election seriously, that they understood
that we turned this country around,'' Clinton said. ''I know if
that happens, everything is going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton's main goal was to try to bolster
Hispanic turnout for Democratic candidates from Vice President Al
Gore to those opposing Texas' Republican senators, Phil Gramm and
Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are a swing vote. We are making a pitch,'' said White
House spokesman Jake Siewert. ''The president and vice president
have an outstanding record of helping Hispanic families build
better lives for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts by the lame-duck Clinton in a state where Bush,
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is wildly popular,
drew something close to a yawn from the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is winning Texas just like he's winning the rest
of the country right now,'' said RNC spokesman Chris Paulitz. ''I
don't think Governor Bush or we at the RNC would feel any threat by
President Clinton going down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore trailing badly in Texas, pulling in only 23
percent of likely voters while Bush enjoys 66 percent to 70
percent.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Death Penalty-Protest,345  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hundreds of anti-death penalty activists marched
down the east side of Manhattan on Monday, calling on presidential
hopeful and Texas Gov. George W. Bush to stop that state's imminent
execution of death row inmate Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of activists held signs saying, ''Stop Bush from
Executing an Innocent Man'' and broke into chants like, ''1-2-3,
Stop Bush's killing spree.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Murder is murder, whether it's by the state or by people,''
said Paul Robeson Ford, speaking to the crowd that swelled to about
500 people at its largest point.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, convicted of a 1981 murder, is scheduled to die by
lethal injection on Thursday. If he is executed, he would become
the 222nd person put to death in Texas since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Graham contends he is innocent and that a single eyewitness who
identified him as the killer was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Bernadine Skillern, has reaffirmed her trial
testimony, saying she was certain Graham was the gunman. Nothing
had changed in 19 years, she has said.
</P>
<P>
   The activists started their protest at Madison Avenue and 45th
Street before marching down to a building at Lexington Avenue and
40th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Several activists from the International Action Center, the
organization sponsoring the event, went into the offices of the
state Republican Party in that building to call on New York state
Republicans to pressure Bush into pardoning Graham, organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those activists were arrested, according to the organizers, but
police had no information on the arrests Monday evening and could
not confirm them.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the death penalty are hopeful that the
spotlight of an election year will get more people, especially
politicians, talking about the issue and hopefully coming out
against capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's becoming a hot topic,'' said Sarinya Srisakul, 19, of
Brooklyn. ''If more people were educated about it, I'm sure they
would be against it also.''

<HEADLINE> Radio Host Don Imus Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Radio host Don Imus was hospitalized with
multiple injuries after being thrown from a horse at his ranch in
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Imus suffered five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken
collar bone and a shoulder separation after being thrown up to 10
feet off a horse, Charles McCord, a news anchor for ''Imus in the
Morning,'' told listeners Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened Sunday afternoon at the ranch in Ribera,
N.M., near Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Imus, 59, was in fair condition Monday at Heart Hospital of New
Mexico, said Vince McVittie, the hospital's vice president of
development.
</P>
<P>
   McVittie said it's likely Imus would be released on Wednesday,
adding that Imus was able to do some walking on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Imus' talk show on WFAN in New York boasts about 10 million
listeners nationwide on more than 90 stations. His program also
appears on the MSNBC cable network.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be out of commission for a little while,''
McCord said. There was no immediate word on when Imus would be able
to return to his show; a person answering the phone at MSNBC had no
details. Imus had been scheduled to go on vacation for the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just continues with this knucklehead, the poor guy,''
McCord told listeners, before reading the morning news.
</P>
<P>
   Imus has said he is working to establish the 3,000-acre ranch as
a haven for sick children.

Gore Questions Oil Company Profits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toughening his stand on high gas prices, Vice President Al
Gore voiced suspicion today over oil companies' huge profits and called for an
investigation into collusion, antitrust violations and price gouging. Gore said
he just learned that the ''big oil companies'' saw a steep increase in profits
for the first quarter of the year. ''Now you put two and two together and look
at the huge price increases that they say they can't explain and look at the 500
percent increase in profits and look at the way they've been getting bigger,''
Gore told CNN.

Developing Nations Hold Summit

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Leaders of developing nations lashed out Monday at a
wealthy world benefitting from open markets, and reflected more briefly on what
they can do to pull their struggling economies forward. Globalization is harming
the world's poorest countries, presidents and top officials from nations of the
G-15 economic group said at the opening of their two-day summit. Many developing
nations accuse wealthy countries of protectionist trade policies and say
regulation is too little -- or too unjust -- to ensure fairness on global
financial matters. ''Our societies are overwhelmed by the strident consequences
of globalization and its twin phenomenon of trade liberalization,'' Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasango said.

Records Detail JFK Jr. Kidnap Plots

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr. was the target of at least three
kidnapping threats -- the latest just four years before he died in a plane
crash, according to FBI records released today. The first threat, confirmed by
the U.S. government, occurred more than two decades ago when Kennedy was still
in elementary school. The 162 newly released records, which The Associated Press
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, contain sketchy details
about two more threats. In 1995, someone called the FBI in New York offering
information about an alleged plot to kidnap Kennedy, according to an FBI report
dated July 13, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Coxsackie inmate dead from stab wounds, investigation ongoing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST COXSACKIE, N.Y. (AP) - An inmate at the maximum-security
Coxsackie Correctional Facility died Sunday from multiple stab
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Correctional Services spokesman Mike Houston
said 40-year-old George Holden approached the officers' desk about
7:10 p.m. Sunday and collapsed. Holden was taken to the prison
infirmary then brought to Albany Medical Center where he was
pronounced dead at 8:53 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Holden was serving a 20-year term for two burglaries committed
in the Bronx. He was at Coxsackie sine August 21, 1998 following a
transfer from Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining. His
earliest release date was in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officers conducting a search of the 1,070-inmate
facility Monday found three shanks in garbage cans. Officials have
not determined whether the knives - one fashioned of metal and two
of plastic - were used in the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Houston said the prison would remain on lockdown for several
days as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, Coxsackie was locked down for several days after four
corrections officers sustained minor injuries while breaking up
inmate fights.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, the prison was locked down after a pair of
fights injured 26 inmates and one guard.

   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) -- Tens of thousands of demonstrators from
across Europe rallied Monday in this northern Portuguese city to
call for more jobs and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, representing 150 trade unions from the 15
European Union nations, carried banners that read: ''For a Europe
of full employment'' and ''Jobs in quantity, work with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe has been dominated by monetary and financial
policies,'' Carvalho da Silva, a Portuguese trade union leader,
told the crowd. ''This path will not allow full employment and a
new distribution of wealth to be accomplished in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the EU is currently under 9 percent. At a March
summit in Lisbon, EU leaders pledged to create more and better
jobs, but set no targets for slashing unemployment.
</P>

Vancouver Woman Spends Two Years Caring for Dead Father
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) -- A woman is under psychiatric care in hospital
after she was found caring for her dead father.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man had apparently died as long as two years ago,
police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made Friday night when a friend called at the
house where the dead man had been living with his mentally
challenged daughter, 45.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was of a state where she believed her father was OK and
that she was still taking care of him,'' said Const. Anne Drennan,
spokeswoman for Vancouver police.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, it was found that the elderly gentleman had died
quite a long time ago, possibly as much as two years earlier.''
</P>

   Drennan said the daughter believed her father was still alive
but very ill.

Shrimp Dispute Cools Liberal Hopes for Political Gains in East
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A divisive debate over East Coast shrimp quotas
echoed through the federal cabinet Monday, just as ministers were
trying to draft an economic strategy to boost Liberal fortunes in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal made it clear he is sticking to
his plan to award licenses to Prince Edward Islanders to take 1,500
tons of shrimp off Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
   He accused John Efford, the Newfoundland fisheries minister, of
going over the top in his virulent criticism and of pitting one
province against another.
</P>
<P>
   Efford has branded the federal policy arrogant and insensitive
and predicted ''rioting in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Premier Brian Tobin, usually a staunch ally of Prime Minister
Jean Chretien's federal Liberals, has called the move a betrayal
and said he has ''no idea why he (Dhaliwal) made the decision he
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Dhaliwal noted that other provinces have long shared the shrimp
grounds and the latest quotas leave 70 per cent of the total catch
of more than 100,000 tons to Newfoundland.

Alliance Memberships Raise Questions as Candidates Hit Home
Stretch
</P>
<P>
   WINNIPEG (AP) -- Campaign organizers paying for new members to
sign up to the Canadian Alliance is no different than newspapers
handing out free copies or subscriptions, leadership candidate Tom
Long said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Long is facing criticism amid reports that some of his workers
in Quebec bought memberships for people instead of selling them for
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reported 2,800 members in the Gaspe region have told
reporters they never signed up to the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''But once again, does it impair the credibility of the Globe or
the National Post or the Star that they're handing free
subscriptions to people or offering them free newspapers? I think
that's a fair question.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival Preston Manning, former Reform party leader, showed more
concern about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Buying memberships on behalf of someone else isn't going to do
much for the image of a party that has promised a new kind of
politics, he said.

Aboriginal Man Walks 1,491 Miles For Residential School Victims,
War Vets
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Distraught over the residential school legacy of
violence, cultural loss and injustice, Robert Desjarlais took a
walk on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   He says he kept going until Monday when he reached Parliament
Hill -- 2,400 kilometers from his Edmonton home.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the last 100 miles barefoot, one mile for every year
from 1900 to 2000 that aboriginal people have been denied justice,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Desjarlais demanded not money for victims at residential
schools, but education programs to restore lost languages and make
up for other cultural damage. He also wants more recognition for
aboriginal war vets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until 10 years ago, I couldn't talk about these things,''
said Desjarlais, 53, as he showed his blistered, calloused and
peeling feet to TV cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the sexual and physical abuse he says he
endured from a priest at the Muskowekwan Residential School in
Lestock, Saskatchewan, southeast of Saskatoon.

<HEADLINE> Federal jury has tax case against Pirro brothers  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The federal tax evasion case against
Albert Pirro, husband of the Westchester district attorney, went to
the jury Monday afternoon after a month-long trial and two hours of
instructions in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors deliberated for about 45 minutes, until 3:55 p.m.,
then asked for a fresh start on Tuesday, which Judge Barrington
Parker granted.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his wife, District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, strode from
the courthouse together, with Mrs. Pirro saying of the jurors,
''They'll find justice and they'll find truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro and his brother Anthony, who was his accountant,
are accused of conspiring to hide $1.2 million of Albert's income
by disguising personal spending as deductible business expenses.
Before learning of the investigation and redoing his returns,
Albert Pirro was more than $400,000 short on his federal taxes, the
prosecution says.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has exposed Albert and Jeanine Pirro's lavish
lifestyle, which the prosecution claimed was underwritten by tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Parker dealt in secret with a mistrial motion from the defense,
which cried foul on Thursday when prosecutor Cathy Seibel compared
Albert Pirro to Richard Nixon. After two hours of arguments in the
judge's chambers, the motion was denied. Parker then carefully
instructed the jurors in the nuances of conspiracy, tax evasion and
filing a false tax return.
</P>
<P>
   A major element of Albert Pirro's defense has been his assertion
that he paid little attention to his bookkeeping, trusting his
brother and others. But the judge told the jurors that ''conscious
avoidance'' was not a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace University Law School and
a regular observer of the trial, said he thought Parker's
instructions ''dovetailed quite nicely with the government's proof
and seemed to contradict some claims the defense was making. ... If
I was the defense I'd be worried.''

<HEADLINE> State installs signs that tell truckers where they can drive  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state this week is putting up the last
of 230 road signs that tell truck drivers which roads they can use
without fear of being fined.
</P>
<P>
   But some truckers said the signs are ambiguous and will confuse
out-of-state drivers.
</P>
<P>
   A sign with the number 102 written on the back of a truck and
circled in green indicates that a road is an acceptable interstate
roadway. A sign with a slash through the same graphic instructs
truckers they can only travel these secondary roads to make pickups
or deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of confusion right now,'' said Sam Cunninghame,
executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association. ''The
signs don't list the exceptions to the prohibitions''
</P>
<P>
   Several truckers resting at the Pilot truck stop on Route 206 in
Bordentown agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Hemmings, an independent trucker from Florida, noticed one
of the new signs after dropping off a load of produce in upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the sign and wondered what it was,'' he said. ''It
doesn't explain nothing. You got to put something in writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Thornhill, an independent trucker from Jeffersonville,
Ohio, said the signs will only be helpful if they are well
maintained because many out-of-state truck drivers would not
otherwise know which roads are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you run 48 states, it's almost impossible to keep up with
all the new laws. Sometimes you get the wrong information from
word-of-mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A state official said the law is clear and truckers have been
informed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no ambiguity here,'' said John Dourgarian, a spokesman
for the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Last July Gov. Whitman announced the ban that restricts
102-inch-wide trucks to the New Jersey Turnpike, the Atlantic City
Expressway and other interstates on the national network of
highways. Since then the state has informed the trucking community
how the law works and posted signs using nationally recognizable
symbols, Dourgarian said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're doing business or passing through the state, you
need to know our laws,'' he said. ''It's being enforced. It's their
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey State Police began enforcing the ban on May 20.
In the first three weeks, the only figures available, the troopers
issued 78 summonses at $400 each as part of a truck-safety roadside
inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty people were killed in tractor trailer related accidents in
New Jersey last year, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dourgarian said the number of tractor trailers on secondary
roads has dropped about 30 percent since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''No longer can these roads be used as a convenient
cut-through,'' Dourgarian said. ''The signs have been posted to
reinforce that.''
</P>
<P>
   DOT employees are making and installing the signs, which will
cost $5,000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers star sues NJ company to clarify contract obligation to sign cards, collectibles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant has sued
a New Jersey sports memorabilia company to clarify his obligations
to sign between 15,000 and 32,800 trading cards and other
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant wants a Superior Court in Los Angeles to determine if the
contract holder has made demands beyond contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues is Bryant's claim the contract, which expires
Sept. 15, is limited to trading cards and collectibles and does not
include paintings, lithographs and pennants made by contract
holder, Oxxford Express Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant also wants the court to determine if he must meet
Oxxford's demand he appear on the Home Shopping Network or QVC
cable shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he has signed 3,286 autographs under the contract,
but told Oxxford in April that due to a sprained wrist he could do
no more until the injury healed. He said he has offered to schedule
six signing sessions of two hours each in the remaining three
months of the contract, and make one appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Oxxford Express, located in Pequannock, N.J., did not return
phone calls Monday seeking comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Oxxford took over Bryant's autographs contract when The Score
Board Inc., filed for bankruptcy. Oxxford notified the NBA early
this month that Bryant was in breach of the agreement, said
Bryant's attorney, William Temko. Temko filed the lawsuit against
Oxxford Express last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sports memorabilia companies ask $25 per signed
8-inch-by-10-inch Bryant photo, and $100 for a basketball with his
autograph.

<HEADLINE> Molecule May Help Alzheimer's Study  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dye-like compound that moves into the brain
and pinpoints areas affected by Alzheimer's disease has been
demonstrated in laboratory animal experiments, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine say they have made a molecule called BSB that in
mice will link specifically with brain tissue affected by
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   When injected in the bloodstream, the molecule travels to the
brain and attaches itself to the diseased tissue. Researchers say
the molecules is visible on medical imaging equipment. If the
technique can be developed for human use, it would enable
clinicians, for the first time, to see the extent of brain tissue
affected by Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The molecule probe also would enable doctors to monitor the
effects of any new drugs developed to treat Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease involves the formation in the brain of a
waxy substance called amyloid plaques. These plaques are thought to
play role in the killing of neurons, the disease process in
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The plaques, however, cannot be seen well on X-ray and other
imaging equipment. This is one reason that Alzheimer's cannot be
positively diagnosed except by autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The BSB molecule, if it can be made to work in humans, could
change that. The molecule is small enough to slip through the blood
brain barrier, a natural filter that protects the brain, and has
been shown in the mouse studies to find and attach to the amyloid
plaques.
</P>
<P>
   A radioactive marker attached to the molecule will make it
possible to visualize plaque formation on clinical imaging
equipment, said Dr. Virginia Lee, a university researcher and
co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''This research is an enormously important step toward
developing an imaging method that could pinpoint telltale signs of
plaque development associated with Alzheimer's disease in a living
brain,'' said Marcelle Morrison-Bogorad of the National Institute
of Aging, one of the agencies of the National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Iraq on Kuwaiti Property  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council urged Iraq Monday to
return property seized from Kuwait after its 1990 invasion and
account for hundreds of missing people, adding its weight to a
similar demand from Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   A council statement issued after a briefing by retired Russian
ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, who was appointed by Annan in February
to try to resolve the Kuwait-related issues left over from the 1991
Gulf War, stressed ''the importance of dialogue among parties.''
</P>
<P>
   A report last Thursday by Annan on missing Kuwaiti property
called for ''understanding and goodwill'' from Iraq in returning
government archives, museum pieces and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The council said it agreed with Annan's conclusion ''that
understanding and goodwill are of critical importance for the
success of Mr. Vorontsov's mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has withdrawn from an international committee set up to
look into the issue of persons who have been missing since the Gulf
war. Baghdad claims that the committee, which is scheduled to meet
again in Geneva on June 21, has not applied enough pressure on
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait has repeatedly accused Iraq of continuing to hold 605
Kuwaitis and other nationals. Baghdad accuses Kuwait of failing to
disclose information about 1,150 Iraqis who went missing during the
Gulf War crisis. Both countries insist they are not holding any
detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council urged Iraq ''to cooperate to ensure the
repatriation or the return of all Kuwaiti and third country nations
or their remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The council also echoed Annan's report last week that Iraq has
returned ''a substantial quantity of property'' but it still has an
obligation to return ''many items, of fundamental importance for
Kuwait''
</P>
<P>
   Annan noted that in December 1998, his special envoy in Baghdad,
Prakash Shah, was told by Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
that the property issue was not a major one and could be easily
settled.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit of developing nations in Havana, Cuba, in April,
Annan said he urged Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf to cooperate on the return of Kuwaiti property and
archives, and was told the issue should be addressed under the 1991
Security Council resolution that ended the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general said Vorontsov is prepared to go to
Baghdad at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the return to
Kuwait of several small items Iraq reported finding in local
markets in 1997 and 1998, including a green leather bag, a
revolver, a hunting rifle and several decorated dishes.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Carlotta Forms Off Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlotta, the first hurricane of the season,
formed late Monday off Mexico's southern Pacific coast, but it was
not expected to hit land.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service in Miami uprgraded Carlotta from a
tropical storm after it developed maximum-sustained winds of 74
mph, the minimum strength necessary to be named a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, Carlotta was centered about 120 miles
south-southwest of Puerto Angel on the southern Oaxacan coast.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system was dumping rain on much of southern Mexico,
which was put on alert for flooding and mudslides. A hurricane
warning was in effect from Puerto Angel north to Zihautanejo in
Guerrero state, and included the Guerrero resort city of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In Acapulco, authorities evacuated 100 families from high-risk
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Carlotta was moving west-northwest about 14 mph. Winds were
forecast to strengthen to 103 mph within 48 hours, but the
hurricane was expected to continue heading west, further out to
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains also took their toll on other parts of the country:
In the Gulf coast state of Tabasco, hundreds of people fled their
homes Sunday after improvised dikes began to leak and river water
entered several neighborhoods in the capital of Villahermosa, which
spent weeks under floodwaters last year.

<HEADLINE> NHL's Wild Names Lemaire As Coach  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jacques Lemaire has won Stanley Cups as a
player, a coach and in the front office. Now the Hall of Famer
faces a new challenge: directing an NHL expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a brand new team. I know that I will have to be
patient, the fans will have to be patient,'' Lemaire said Monday
after being introduced as the Minnesota Wild's first head coach,
''but I'm telling you, we will win our share of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire, 54, won eight titles in 12 seasons as a player, all
with the Montreal Canadiens. He was an assistant general manager
when Montreal won the Stanley Cup in 1986 and 1993, and coached the
New Jersey Devils to the 1995 championship.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned as Devils coach after the 1997-98 season, and spent
the past two seasons as a consultant to Canadiens general manager
Rejean Houle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lemaire, known for an effective if dull neutral-zone trap
defense, is reunited with Wild general manager Doug Risebrough, a
teammate when the Canadiens won four straight Stanley Cups from
1976-79.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship played a big part in Lemaire's decision to
accept the Wild job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the fact that we were pals,'' said Lemaire, who was
the league's coach of the year in 1994. ''I think it's the fact
that we played and I knew exactly how he thinks, what he wants, how
he wants a team to be, what's important on a hockey team. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''(Risebrough) and I share the same commitment and patience
necessary to develop young players and we understand the devotion
required to win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The two had long discussions at Lemaire's home in Sarasota,
Fla., in April, in which they discussed coaching theories and the
challenges facing an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ''When (Risebrough) approached me, I was really excited,''
Lemaire said. ''It's funny -- when we spent a couple of days in
Sarasota, I thought he wanted me because he wouldn't have taken a
plane to come down and see me. But I really realized when he called
me the week after. He really showed me he wanted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire has had his eye on returning to an NHL bench and said he
considered overtures from several teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as I left coaching in New Jersey,'' he said, ''I
started to go to the arenas and look at the players and I started
to regret a little bit the coaching part because I said, 'Why don't
I coach, because I know I can do this type of job and do it
well.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire has not studied the list of players available in this
week's expansion and entry drafts, and he knows the time until the
season starts will be extremely busy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest challenge is probably first to pick the right
people,'' Lemaire said.
</P>
<P>
   Risebrough said he and his staff have been working for the past
nine months on evaluating players, so Lemaire won't be integrally
involved in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be able to select the players, and he'll be able to
coach the players,'' Risebrough said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemaire knows the Wild's early days could be a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to lose,'' he said. ''I think that I have enough
patience to work with the players. I want the guys to give what
they have to give, do what they do best.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners' McLemore Appeals Suspension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Mariners second baseman Mark McLemore appealed
his five-game suspension Monday before Paul Beeston of the
commissioner's office for charging the mound against Tampa Bay's
Esteban Yan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will hear about it tomorrow,'' McLemore said. ''I said what
I needed to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners hope Beeston, the chief operating officer of the
commissioner's office, will reduce McLemore's suspension that was
ordered by Frank Robinson, the new dean of discipline in the
commissioner's office. But they expect McLemore to be lost for some
games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll start his suspension tomorrow,'' said manager
Lou Piniella, who attended McLemore's hearing at Safeco Field.
''But that's an assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore had called timeout when Yan threw a pitch that went
between his legs while he was out of the batter's box on May 20.
Yan denied he was throwing at McLemore. McLemore was ejected from
the game.
</P>
<P>
   If McLemore is suspended, Piniella will move David Bell from
third base to second and replace Bell with John Mabry. That would
leave the Mariners with one extra infielder, Charles Gipson.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners opened a series at home against Tampa Bay on Monday
night. Yan is scheduled to start for the Devil Rays on Wednesday
night.

<HEADLINE> Victims Speak Against Condemned Man  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Four victims of crimes committed by a condemned
killer on Monday described the terror of their encounters with the
man, trying to counter publicity generated by his supporters who
say he was unfairly sent to death row.
</P>
<P>
   ''My story is a nightmare with a killer,'' David Spiers said of
being shot by Gary Graham during a robbery. The injury left him
hospitalized for three months and unable to walk for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If our courts, our legal system, and all these protesters, if
they let a guy like Gary Graham out of prison, they might as well
just open up the floodgates and let everybody out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers and three others told of being terrorized by the then
17-year-old Graham during a weeklong crime spree in May 1981 that
began with the fatal shooting of Bobby Lambert in the parking lot
of a Houston supermarket. The news conference was organized by the
victims rights group Justice For All.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is set to be executed Thursday for the Lambert slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two crimes were linked to Graham in that one week in
1981. He pleaded guilty to 10 aggravated robberies but has said he
did not shoot Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   His case has drawn together death penalty opponents who insist
Graham unfairly was convicted by the testimony of a single
eyewitness to the shooting and that other witnesses have not been
allowed to present testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous appeals to the courts have failed to overturn his
conviction and sentence. A request before the Texas Board of
Pardons and Paroles is Graham's last hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so sick of this whole case,'' Graham robbery victim Rick
Sanford said. ''For 19 years, making him out for some kind of
unjustly, unfairly convicted murderer. This man is one of the worst
criminals in Harris County history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Blackburn was 57 on May 20, 1981, filling her car with
gasoline when she was approached by Graham.
</P>
<P>
   When she declined his offer of help at the gas pump, Graham
pulled a gun on her, stuck it in her ribs and they drove away. She
was robbed and repeatedly raped.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin Monday, Bianca Jagger, a director of Amnesty
International USA, which opposes all executions, said Graham should
get a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would serious miscarriage of justice if the state executes
Gary Graham, an innocent man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger presented Gov. George W. Bush's office and Gerald
Garrett, chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, with a
letter asking they halt the execution.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the
Congressional Black Caucus and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Later, more than a dozen people opposed to Graham's execution
were arrested after blocking the only driveway into the Governor's
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, hundreds of anti-death penalty activists marched on
Monday, calling on Bush to stop the Graham execution.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in a telephone conference call with reporters, said he
hoped to pray with Graham in Huntsville in the hours leading up to
Thursday's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that my presence ... will get Mr. Bush's attention and
there will not be an execution on Thursday,'' Jackson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vicky Bullett had season highs of 22 points
and eight rebounds as the Washington Mystics held Detroit's offense
in check and defeated the Shock 80-55 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bullett went 8-of-12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw added 17 points and Murriel Page had 11
points and 11 rebounds for the Mystics, while Nikki McCray added 12
points in just 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (5-3) remained second in the Eastern Conference. It's
a half game behind the Cleveland Rockers, who defeated Sacramento
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (4-5) set a WNBA record for points in a half and in a
game in its 111-74 rout of Indiana on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock scored the league-record 66 points in the second half
of that game, but never got its offense in gear against the Mystics
and appeared tired at times.
</P>
<P>
   Washington shot 53 percent from the floor, and its defense
limited the Shock to just 20 second-half points and held them to 34
percent shooting from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Detroit starters made it into double figures;
reserve Tamicha Jackson led the Shock with 13 points. The Shock's
starters combined for only 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics made five of their first six shots and hit 61
percent from the field in the first half en route to a 45-35
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Washington took charge with an eight-point run that gave it a
30-24 lead with 5:51 left in the first half. Detroit had four
turnovers and went scoreless during a stretch of 4:51 as the
Mystics took the lead for good.

<HEADLINE> Annan Names Peacekeeping Chief  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has appointed
French defense expert Jean-Marie Guehenno to head U.N. peacekeeping
operations, which the United States has accused of inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Guehenno, 50, is to replace Bernard Miyet, current
udersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations on Oct. 1, U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A former diplomat, Guehenno was France's representative to the
Western European Union, a military alliance, from 1993 to 1995. He
is currently member of U.N. Advisory Board for Disarmament Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Guehenno will be under pressure to ensure that
U.N. peacekeeping missions operate smoothly and achieve their
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has launched four new peacekeeping operations
just in the past year in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, East Timor and in
Congo. More than 35,000 military personnel and police currently
serve in 14 peacekeeping operations across the world.
</P>
<P>
   Washington says the U.N. peacekeeping system is on the brink of
collapse and urgently needs to reform its organization and
financing. Criticism grew after 500 U.N. peacekeepers were taken
hostage in Sierra Leone in early May for several weeks by the rebel
group led by Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we act together, peacekeeping will fail, crippled by an
organizational and financial system that cannot support the
increasing demands now being put on it by the member states,'' U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Costs have also increased, leading to strong objections by the
United States, which according to a scale established in 1973 for a
peacekeeping mission in the Sinai pays 31 percent of all
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has made U.N. reform a condition of paying its
arrears, which the United Nations says now total $1.8 billion.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Gore Savings Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- George W. Bush suggested Monday that
presidential rival Al Gore was parroting his ideas with a plan to
reward Americans for investing their retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to let taxpayers invest some of their Social Security
payroll taxes, while Gore's proposal would provide matching funds
to Americans who invest tax-free savings, without steering money
away from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Gore's ''ever-changing Social Security vision'' was a
politically motivated response to the popularity of his own plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, the stock market was 'roulette' and 'risky.' Now
(that) the heat is on, he changes his position,'' Bush told
reporters. He called Gore ''a man chasing polls and focus groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, outlining his ''Retirement Savings Plus'' proposal for
reporters summoned to the driveway of the vice presidential
residence, said Bush misinterpreted his comments on the ''risky''
nature of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I criticized was investing Social Security trust fund
money in the stock market. I think that's a huge mistake,'' Gore
said. ''I've always encouraged individuals to invest in the stock
market and to save. The difference is this: I protect Social
Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would allow individuals to deposit tax-free income
into accounts for retirement, first-time home purchases,
catastrophic medical expenses or a child's college costs. The
individual accounts would be managed by private financial
institutions with matching contributions -- in varying degrees
according to income level -- from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Gore first spoke of creating individual tax-free retirement
accounts nearly a year ago. Aides said the time is right to push
ahead with them because the cost could be borne by bigger budget
surplus projections that revised federal forecasts are expected to
make official any day.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's proposal also comes as polls suggest voter interest
in Bush's Social Security plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor took the swing at Gore during a three-day
West Coast tour focused on education and courting support from
California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said he would set a Silicon Valley fund-raising
record with two events Monday night: a Palo Alto, Calif., event
expected to raise $400,000 for the campaign and a second
fund-raiser at the home of Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, to
raise $4 million for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   A darker matter shadowed Bush through Washington state and
California: The scheduled execution in Texas on Thursday of Gary
Graham, and its political implications for the presumptive
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Palo Alto, Calif., late Monday for the first of the
two fund-raisers, Bush's motorcade sped past several dozen death
penalty protesters. Two of them slipped into the event and began
shouting, ''Stop the execution of Gary Graham!'' and ''Don't kill
an innocent man!'' as Bush began speaking, with his wife Laura at
his side. The crowd started chanting, ''Bush, Bush, Bush'' and the
protesters were escorted from the room.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to ''stand my ground in the face of pretty
significant movement to try to undermine the credibility of the
death penalty in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, faces lethal injection based on the testimony of a
single eyewitness who says she saw him shoot a man to death in a
holdup in Houston. Graham's supporters argue that he didn't get a
fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is going to be treated no differently than any other
case,'' said Bush, whose state has put the most prisoners to death.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had allowed 131 executions during his 5 1/2 years in office
before granting a 30-day reprieve to another convicted killer June
1 to pursue DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Because Graham already got a similar reprieve from Bush's
predecessor, the governor cannot act to spare his life unless the
Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, whose members are appointed by
the governor, recommends a pardon, a reprieve or commutation of his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Having gotten an update on the case from his legal counsel, Bush
boarded his campaign plane in Austin and told reporters he keeps
''an open mind'' about reforms to the death penalty system.
</P>
<P>
   However, he bristled at attacks on Texas' record and said any
doubts about Graham's case were ''for the appellate court system''
to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also announced Monday a plan to spend $400 million over
five years to prod schools to use the Internet as a learning tool,
not a substitute for real education.
</P>
<P>
   Former Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hundt, a
Gore supporter, dismissed Bush's plan as inadequate because the
federal government already spends about $3 billion for education
technology through a wide range of programs to help schools.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 2, Marlins 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jamey Wright came within three outs of his first
career shutout as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Florida Marlins
2-0 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (3-1) allowed three hits, three walks and struck out a
career-high eight before being replaced after walking Mark Kotsay
to lead off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth start of the year for Wright, who was on the
disabled list until May 23 with a rotator cuff tear in his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman got three outs for his ninth save in 10 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored both of its runs in the second inning off
rookie Chuck Smith (0-1). Geoff Jenkins doubled home Santiago
Perez, who had been hit by a pitch. Jeromy Burnitz added an RBI
single to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a 30-year old rookie, gave up two runs and four hits over
7 2-3 innings, striking out 11 and walking one. In 13 2-3 innings
in his two major league appearances he has allowed three runs and
struck out 17.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 strikeouts are a season high for the Marlins, who saw
their four game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The attendance of 7,612 was the third smallest home crowd
in Marlins history. The team's six lowest home attendance figures
have been recorded this season. ... Florida's Preston Wilson
extended his hitting streak to seven games. ... Jenkins has hit
safely in 13 of 17 games since coming off the disabled list on May
29. ... Burnitz has reached base safely in 17 of his last 20
contests. ... Milwaukee's Charlie Hayes is in a 0-for-19 skid.

<HEADLINE> Officials say plate's reference to Adirondacks has double meaning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVERPOOL, N.Y. (AP) - One couple says their love of the
Adirondacks was cheapened by someone who read the wrong things into
their license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie and Jamison Deapo of Liverpool just celebrated their 25th
anniversary by renewing their wedding vows at a church in the
Adirondacks. They spend as much time as possible at their Pine Lake
camp. They're also members of the Adirondack Mountain Club.
</P>
<P>
   They declared that love for the Adirondacks on the license
plates on Lorrie's minivan, which say ADK LUVR.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, Deapo received a letter from the Department of
Motor Vehicles telling her the plates were being yanked.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV letter said: ''... we have been receiving complaints in
regards to your license plate ADK LUVR.'' The DMV said the plates
had to go because they could be construed as ''obscene, lewd or
lascivious.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a child asked his mother what the plates meant, and
the mother drew conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Deapo said she talked to a DMV representative and pressed him to
tell her what is so offensive about her plates.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 20 minutes he finally told me,'' she told The Syracuse
Newspapers. The DMV man said her plates could refer to a part of
the male anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Deapo credits Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman with intervening.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV's deputy commissioner called her Thursday to tell her
she could keep the plates.

House Votes To Bar Tobacco Suit Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to bar the Justice Department from
accepting funds from another agency to help pay for the federal lawsuit against
the tobacco industry, dealing a blow that Attorney General Janet Reno had said
would force her to drop the multibillion-dollar litigation. By a 207-197 vote,
the House stood behind language in a spending bill that would force the
Department of Veterans Affairs to abandon its plans to give the Justice
Department $4 million to help it pay for the huge lawsuit. The legal action
seeks to recover billions spent by Medicare and other federal programs to treat
illnesses caused by smoking.

he just learned that the ''big oil companies'' saw a steep increase in profits
for the first quarter of the year. ''Now you put two and two together and look
at the huge price increases that they say they can't explain and look at the 500
percent increase in profits and look at the way they've been getting bigger,''
Gore told CNN.

Developing Nations Hold Summit

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Leaders of developing nations lashed out Monday at a
wealthy world benefitting from open markets, and reflected more briefly on what
they can do to pull their struggling economies forward. Globalization is harming
the world's poorest countries, presidents and top officials from nations of the
G-15 economic group said at the opening of their two-day summit. Many developing
nations accuse wealthy countries of protectionist trade policies and say
regulation is too little -- or too unjust -- to ensure fairness on global
financial matters. ''Our societies are overwhelmed by the strident consequences
of globalization and its twin phenomenon of trade liberalization,'' Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasango said.

Records Detail JFK Jr. Kidnap Plots

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr. was the target of at least three
kidnapping threats -- the latest just four years before he died in a plane
crash, according to FBI records released today. The first threat, confirmed by
the U.S. government, occurred more than two decades ago when Kennedy was still
in elementary school. The 162 newly released records, which The Associated Press
obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, contain sketchy details
about two more threats. In 1995, someone called the FBI in New York offering
information about an alleged plot to kidnap Kennedy, according to an FBI report
dated July 13, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chile To Auction Pinochet's Cars  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Two armored Mercedes Benz automobiles
that one protected former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet will be
auctioned off by the Chilean government on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government is hoping that the name behind them will drive up
their minimum asking price of $23,500 for each car.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet ordered the light-brown cars in the final days of his
1973-1990 dictatorship, and kept them after stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the cars have only been used for visiting foreign
leaders. Current President Ricardo Lagos said they were an
unnecessary luxury and ordered them sold.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers claim the car can reach 140 mph and each has two armored
gasoline tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, meanwhile, continues to get around in a small fleet of
armored vehicles owned by the army.
</P>
<P>
   He is awaiting a Supreme Court decision on his appeal of an
earlier ruling that stripped him of his congressional immunity.
Without immunity, Pinochet could stand trial for human rights
abuses during his regime.

<HEADLINE> Fans Cool To Lakers' Performance  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a city known for its sunshine, Angelenos
are notorious for a fair-weather attitude toward their basketball
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Los Angeles Lakers are winning, some fans have
trouble shedding their apathy.
</P>
<P>
   In the City of Angels, there were no banners, no billboards and
little fanfare on Monday as the Lakers played Game 6 of the NBA
Finals against the Indiana Pacers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''People here come late to games, and leave early,'' said season
ticket-holder Sergio Munoz, a self-described fan who sold his four
seats for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather have the money than be there in person if
the Lakers beat Indiana to win the NBA championship. He also wanted
to avoid the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were flashes of enthusiasm Monday as scores of
purple-and-yellow clad fans gathered outside Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the team's increased popularity has been the sale of
Lakers merchandise, which has been rejuvenated by the team's
performance in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers gear ''didn't move much before,'' said Jerry Poole,
manager of a SportMart store in Cerritos. But sales of T-shirts,
jerseys and hats have picked up since the playoffs began, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bruce, director of sports marketing at Foote, Cone &AMP;
Belding, an ad agency in San Francisco, said Angelenos have
generally little interest in sports because of the city's many
other entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles fans don't ''place a sporting team's progress or
accomplishments above what's going on in their lives,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will come ''only if it's a big see and be seen type of
game,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side of the Mississippi, things are much
different.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis mayor Bart Peterson declared June ''Pacers Pride
Month'' on June 8 and encouraged citizens to wear blue and gold,
the team colors, on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are car flags flying all over. Almost every other car''
has one, said Peterson spokesman Justin Ohlemiller.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also staged rallies before each home game, and has
temporarily renamed two city streets Pacers Place and Bird
Boulevard, after Pacers coach Larry Bird. The streets intersect
next to Conseco Fieldhouse, the Pacers' home arena.
</P>
<P>
   Even online, Indiana' pride shows. ''Go Pacers'' is prominent on
the Indianapolis city government site, while the Los Angeles city
government's page makes no mention of the Lakers at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Angelenos are unfairly characterized as poor fans, said
Peter Hidalgo, spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty thousand free tickets to watch last Wednesday's game on
Staples Center big screen televisions were gone in 10 minutes, a
clear show of Lakers pride, Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no banners hung around the city because of
possible city ordinance issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Laker pride in Southern California is going to be
evident,'' Hidalgo said. ''I think the public will react
enthusiastically on their own.''

<HEADLINE> Disabled Golfer Doesn't Qualify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIR OAKS RANCH, Texas (AP) -- JaRo Jones, who sued the U.S. Golf
Association over the right to use a cart, failed to qualify for the
U.S. Senior Open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Using a court-authorized cart, Jones shot a 12-over-par 84 at
Fairway Oaks Ranch Country Club near San Antonio. He missed the
last of six qualifying spots by 15 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will definitely be back next year,'' Jones said. ''The only
thing we can do is explain the issues. I pay careful attention
where I drive this cart. I respect golf courses and I'm careful
where I drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 53-year-old former teaching pro from Baytown, needs a
cane to walk and a cart to play. He has a debilitating muscle
disease that affects his legs and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Jones approached the USGA about riding a cart for the Senior
Open qualifying tournament, but was denied. He sued, claiming it
was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James R. Nowlin issued a preliminary
injunction Thursday, forcing the USGA to allow Jones to use a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether I qualify or not ... it's the point that I do have the
opportunity to try,'' Jones said after the injunction was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Jones got his opportunity, but not everyone in the field was
happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm upset about the slow play and the depressions,'' said
Larry Timpe, who claimed Jones' cart left marks on the fringe
around the greens. ''I want everyone to play, but there was not a
level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had polio when he was 4 and was diagnosed with post-polio
syndrome, which causes the muscles in his shoulders and legs to
atrophy, when he was 46. Since 1995, he has traveled the country
teaching other disabled people how to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the right to ride this time, but the issue could
ultimately end up with the U.S. Supreme Court as federal appeals
courts have issued conflicting rulings in cases similar to Jones'.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court in Chicago ruled in March against a
disabled club pro from Indiana. The court said a cart would change
the nature of competition and that such rules were best left to the
governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court in San Francisco upheld a
lower court ruling that allows Casey Martin to ride a cart on the
PGA Tour. The USGA allowed Martin to use a cart for U.S. Open
qualifying, but he failed to advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Open starts June 29 at Saucon Valley C.C., in
Bethlehem, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Co. Faces Environment Charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories (AP) -- The first major
diamond mine in North America has been charged with harming fish
habitat in three lakes and could face fines totaling more than $5
million, a federal fishing official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BHP Diamonds Inc. was charged with eight counts under the
Fisheries Act for violations during construction of the Ekati Mine,
180 miles northeast of Yellowknife, from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Allen, the federal fishing director for the Western Arctic,
said each charge carried a maximum fine of $650,000.
</P>
<P>
   The mine is owned by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia. A
hearing on the charges was scheduled for July 4 in Yellowknife.
</P>
<P>
   Ekati mine opened Oct. 14, 1998, and sold more than $150 million
worth of rough diamonds from February to July of 1999. It was
expected to produce $7 billion in high-quality diamonds -- roughly 5
percent of the world's total -- over 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Rockers 81, Monarchs 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Rushia Brown's steal and layup sparked
Cleveland's 18-2 run to close the game and the Rockers rallied to
beat the Sacramento Monarchs 81-70 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brown scored six points during the decisive run as Cleveland
(6-3) snapped a two-game losing streak and Sacramento's four-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Nemcova led Cleveland with 21 points, but reserves Brown,
Mery Andrade and rookie point guard Helen Darling keyed the
turnaround over the final five minutes. Brown scored 12 points,
Andrade, who forced several turnovers with tenacious defense, had
11 and Darling added 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs did not score over the final 5:23 after Tangela
Smith's drive gave Sacramento a 68-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith led Sacramento (5-4) with 19 points, while Kedra
Holland-Korn scored 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's swarming defense at the outset of the second half
helped turn an 11-point deficit into a five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Holland-Korn turned three quick turnovers into seven points --
twice scoring on fastbreak layups following steals and then hitting
a 23-foot 3-pointer to tie the score at 59.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Tichia Penicheiro's passing led the Monarchs on the
13-2 run to start the second half. She finished with a game-high 11
assists, but missed all five of her shots from the field and scored
one point.
</P>
<P>
   Darling scored all of her career-high 10 points in a 3:22 span
midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made all six of its shots from 3-point range in the
first half and opened a 53-42 lead by halftime.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indians' Nagy Makes Rehab Start  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Cleveland right-hander Charles Nagy,
recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his throwing elbow, worked
five innings Monday night in a rehab start for the Indians'
Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, working against the Charlotte Knights in his first minor
league start in seven years, allowed four hits and one run and got
the win in Buffalo's 7-3 victory. He walked one and struck out one
-- throwing 74 pitches, 46 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a little strange, the first time I faced hitters in a
month,'' Nagy said. ''My velocity wasn't where I wanted it to be,
but I was able to keep the ball down and hit my spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy retired the first two batters in every inning, and didn't
have a three-ball count his first time through the order.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old former All-Star underwent surgery to remove bone
chips May 19, three days after earning a win in a five-inning
appearance against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy is on the disabled list for just the second time in his
10-year major league career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been able to bounce back pretty well,'' he said. ''My
body will tell me if I'm rushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy, who has pitched at least 200 innings in each of the last
four seasons, was 2-4 with a 7.19 ERA before the surgery. He
surrendered seven home runs in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   He last appeared in a minor league game in 1993 with Double-A
Canton-Akron, while recovering from right shoulder surgery. Monday
was his first game ever at the Triple-A level.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3-1 or 3-2 on three of the next four batters, he
settled down to throw strikes on 11 of his last 13 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Nagy allowed a run when Desi Wilson
singled home Scott Lydy. Lydy reached on an infield single and
stole second.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy might return to pitch for Cleveland on Saturday or Sunday
against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends on how my arm bounces back,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA redshirt freshman linebacker Asi Faoa II
pleaded innocent Monday to charges of mayhem and assault.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed after an alleged attack at an off-campus
fraternity party left a fellow student severely brain damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Richard Berry assigned a $25,000 bail for
Faoa and ordered the 19-year-old to return to court July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa enrolled at UCLA last September, but did not play. Faoa has
been suspended indefinitely from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will investigate the situation before making any other
decisions,'' said UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 268-pound Faoa was charged with one count each of
mayhem and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Dezubriria, 22, was left severely brain damaged in the
April 30 attack.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Leading Lakers in Game 6  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark Jackson's over-the-shoulder heave from
near midcourt at the first-quarter buzzer gave the Indiana Pacers a
26-24 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 6 of the NBA Finals
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held a 3-2 edge in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers inbounded the ball at midcourt with 0.6 seconds
remaining in the quarter. Sam Perkins got the ball to Jackson, who
was in front of the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, about four feet inside
midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   In a single motion, Jackson caught the ball, turned and launched
the shot, the ball hitting nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis scored nine points for the Pacers in the opening
period.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Glen Rice had seven points each for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's jumper with 40 seconds left in the quarter put Los
Angeles up 24-23. Another jumper by Bryant missed as the game clock
wound down, but the officials restored the .6 seconds on the clock
and Jackson made his spectacular shot -- his first basket of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   No more than three points separated the teams in the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal's three-run homer capped a
four-run eighth inning and lifted the Philadelphia Phillies to a
5-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies, who took three of four in the series, rallied in
the eighth after Greg Maddux left the game. Mike Remlinger (2-2)
relieved after a one-out walk to Ron Gant and allowed a base hit to
Bobby Abreu and a game-tying RBI single by Scott Rolen.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen is 6-for-12 off Remlinger with three homers, but Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox kept the left-hander in to face the third baseman
even though right-hander Kerry Ligtenberg was warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal then drilled a 1-2 pitch into the left-field bullpen
off Ligtenberg for his 11th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, off to his best start at 9-1 since going 12-1 in 1995
when he won his fourth straight Cy Young award, allowed two runs
and four hits in 7 1-3 innings. He struck out seven, walked three --
one intentional -- and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (2-4) pitched a scoreless eighth and Jeff Brantley
worked the ninth for his eighth save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux retired 14 in a row after a leadoff single by Doug
Glanville and had all seven strikeouts in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras gave Atlanta a 2-0 lead in the sixth with his
third homer, deep into the left-field seats off Randy Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux escaped a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh by
getting Desi Relaford to pop out and pinch-hitter Kevin Jordan on a
fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck
out three and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Gant's RBI infield single cut it to 2-1 in the sixth. Maddux hit
Relaford to start the inning. Relaford moved to second on a
sacrifice by Wolf and to third on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Gant was 9-for-66 against Maddux before beating out a bouncer to
deep short.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta took a 1-0 lead in the third when Wolf's pickoff attempt
sailed over the head of first baseman Pat Burrell, allowing
Fernando Lunar to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   Lunar led off with a double to left-center. After a one-out walk
to Veras, Lunar moved to third on a fielder's choice by Andruw
Jones before scoring on Wolf's errant step-off toss to first.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had three straight subpar outings before Monday, allowing
15 earned runs in his last three starts after giving up four earned
runs in his previous five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Lunar, who made his major league debut on May 9 as Maddux's
personal catcher, had his first career three-hit game. He had five
hits before Monday.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Since the start of the 1996 season, the year after he won
his fourth straight Cy Young award, Maddux has allowed two earned
runs or less in 113 of 164 starts (69 percent), including the
postseason. He's 70-16 in those starts. Atlanta is 84-29. ...
Chipper Jones extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a
first-inning double. His career high is 18 in June 1997. ... Wolf
has allowed a homer in all but one of his 14 starts. ... The teams
completed the season series with Atlanta winning 8-5. ... Relaford
made his 19th error at shortstop in the seventh.

   MONTREAL (AP) -- Wilton Guerrero's tiebreaking single with two
outs in the eighth inning led the Montreal Expos to a 2-1 victory
Monday night over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took a 1-0 lead in the seventh on John Vander Wal's
sixth home run, off Carl Pavano (8-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Expos rallied in the eighth when Chris Widger drew a one-out
walk. One out later, pinch-runner Terry Jones stole second and
scored on a double by Peter Bergeron off reliever Rich Loiselle
(0-2). Guerrero followed with the game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano allowed one run on five hits in eight innings. He struck
out seven and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline pitched the ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva worked six shutout innings for the Pirates in his
first start since 1999. He allowed four hits and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos were the last team Silva beat as a starter on May 15,
1999. He also defeated them twice this season in consecutive relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Montreal began its second of three 12-game homestands this
season. The Expos are 23-11 at Olympic Stadium but just 12-20 on
the road. ... The Pirates have lost five of six. ... The Expos have
a league-leading 142 doubles, three more than Pittsburgh. ... The
Pirates recalled Aramis Ramirez from Triple-A Nashville and started
him at third base after Emil Brown was put on the 15-day DL. Brown
is scheduled to undergo urological surgery.

<HEADLINE> Gore Questions Oil Company Profits  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, toughening his stand
on high gas prices, voiced suspicion of oil companies' huge profits
and called for an investigation into collusion, antitrust
violations and price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate told reporters Monday he
had just learned that the ''big oil companies'' saw a steep
increase in profits for the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now you put two and two together and look at the huge price
increases that they say they can't explain and look at the 500
percent increase in profits and look at the way they've been
getting bigger,'' Gore told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that all adds up to a need for investigation of
collusion, antitrust violations and price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has opened an informal inquiry
focused mainly on the Chicago and Milwaukee areas, where gas prices
now exceed $2 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's time for a much broader investigation,'' Gore
told ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Gore commented in the driveway of his vice presidential
residence, where news correspondents from all the TV networks had
been summoned so he could promote the retirement savings plan he
will formally unveil Tuesday in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also used the interviews to address the gas issue,
which is particularly problematic in the Midwest, a critical
battleground in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Tuesday, Gore had demurred, telling The Associated
Press in an interview: ''I don't want to comment on an
investigation of that kind but if evidence is uncovered of price
gouging, there should be strong action.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign strategy meeting three days later, Gore instructed
aides to look deeper into the problem and come up with some
solutions, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort dug up a June 14 report by Public Citizen using
data from the Energy Department's Energy Information
Administration. For Gore to suggest a fivefold, across-the-board
gain was a bit of an overstatement when, in fact, EIA found that
profits for the largest companies had, on average, tripled.
</P>
<P>
   According to Public Citizen, it was Texaco's first-quarter
profits that jumped 473 percent over 1999, which was a particularly
bad year for the industry. Conoco and Phillips, respectively, saw
profits go up 371 percent and 257 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Republican presidential rival George W. Bush
blamed Gore and President Clinton for the higher gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like Al Gore is now trying to divert attention away
from the Clinton-Gore administration's failed leadership when it
comes to addressing high gas prices and developing a national
energy policy,'' said spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the country needs ''a president who will provide
leadership'' to get petroleum exporting countries to produce more
crude, reduce the nation's dependency on foreign oil and increase
domestic exploration, including in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's driveway interviews were an attempt to restore control to
his message after a spate of distractions last week. He and wife
Tipper also gave an extensive, at-home interview to ABC, which is
due to air Friday on ''20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore later accepted an award from the friendly National Jewish
Democratic League, where he expanded on his claim that the
administration should be credited with growing the economy. He
argued that it has renewed the nation's sense of purpose, in
addition to ending years of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued the economic theme in an address at a
fund-raising dinner for 55 people who anted up at least $10,000
apiece at the same Embassy Row hotel where Gore, a senator's son,
lived for part of his boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner of mahi mahi was expected to raise at least $550,000
for the Democratic National Committee's ''federal victory fund,''
which collects the restricted donations known as ''hard money''
that the party can use in direct support of Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers were laced throughout this second week of the
''progress and prosperity'' tour meant to highlight Gore's economic
record and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to headline party fund-raisers in Denver, and
in Palo Alto and San Jose in California, with additional events
next week in Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday in Minneapolis, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is
expected to join Gore for one of his eight-hour ''school days'' --
this one with an emphasis on special education, aides said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 12 points to lead the
Indiana Pacers' balanced scoring Monday night and they led the Los
Angeles Lakers 56-53 at halftime of Game 6 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held a 3-2 edge in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller added 11 points for the Pacers and Austin Croshere
scored all of his 10 points in the second quarter. Indiana led by
as much as 12, 47-35 with 6:45 remaining in the half, only to see
Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers chip away at the lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal kept Los Angeles close with 21 first-half points, 15 in
the second quarter, and six rebounds. Kobe Bryant had 12 points
despite 4-for-12 shooting in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson's over-the-shoulder heave from near midcourt at the

<HEADLINE> NASA: La Nina Weather Effect Fading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- La Nina, the pool of unusually cool
water that dominated the tropical Pacific Ocean for more than two
years and has affected the nation's weather, seems to be fading
away, NASA scientists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory cautioned,
however, that the influence of La Nina on the nation's weather may
persist, and that a year ago La Nina also seemed about to vanish
but was reinvigorated by fall 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not forget that the legacy of two years of La Nina will
be with us this summer and into the fall,'' JPL oceanographer
William Patzert said in a statement. ''Much of the nation's
farmland is really dry in many regions. The reality is that the
atmosphere is still acting as though La Nina remains.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has predicted continuing drought
for much of the Midwest and Southeast and an active hurricane
season in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists monitor La Nina and the ocean-warming phenomenon El
Nino with the U.S.-French Topex/Poseidon satellite, which
determines ocean temperatures by measuring sea surface height: warm
water produces higher levels while cool waters are lower.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data, gathered in a 10-day cycle that ended June 9,
show the equatorial Pacific continuing to warm up toward normal
levels, JPL said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few areas of cooler, lower sea levels remain in the
tropics.
</P>
<P>
   Sea levels and temperatures remain higher than normal in the
far-western tropical Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   JPL scientists said that it appears the global climate system is
emerging from three years of dramatic swings from the big El Nino
of 1997-98, which was followed by two unusually cool and persistent
La Nina years.

<HEADLINE> Cadets Get Big Anthrax Vaccine Dose  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) -- Twenty-five ROTC cadets at an Army
training camp were administered nearly double the proper dose of
the anthrax vaccine, Army officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan Army Medical Center officials blamed the higher doses on
a ''communications error.'' The vaccines were given Friday during
the 2000 Advanced Camp for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at
Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   There are few side effects associated with receiving a higher
dose of the vaccine, other than soreness in the arm where the shot
was administered, the medical center said in a statement. The
cadets were given Tylenol and Benadryl to ease any discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The cadets have since returned to training and have not
complained of any adverse symptoms, Madigan spokeswoman Sharon
Ayala said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a disease that typically afflicts animals, especially
sheep and cattle. Dry anthrax spores, which can be put into
weapons, can be fatal to humans when inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all 2.4 million
active duty and reserve troops to get shots of the anthrax vaccine,
starting with soldiers most likely to encounter biological warfare
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as
soldiers have expressed concerns. Complaints included fevers,
muscle pain and dizziness, and some members of the military have
said morale was plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have repeatedly said the vaccine is safe.

By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Orlando Hernandez, diagnosed with a sprained right
elbow Sunday, will meet with noted orthopedic surgeon Dr. James
Andrews on Wednesday in Birmingham, Ala. Hernandez asked for a
second opinion. ... The Yankees made their first visit to Fenway
Park since winning the clinching Game 5 of the AL championship
series last October. ... The Yankees started out 6-7 in their
stretch of 21 straight games against teams with winning records.
... RHP Dwight Gooden threw batting practice at the Yankees' player
development center in Tampa, Fla. He could join Triple-A Columbus
later this month. ... RHP David Walling, one of the prospects
mentioned in trade talks, was promoted from Class-A Tampa to
Double-AA Norwich. ... 2B Andy Stankiewicz, 35 and coming off an
arm injury, went 0-for-3 and walked twice in a Gulf Coast League
game.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: OF Troy O'Leary, slumping while in the midst of a
difficult divorce, and LHP Jeff Fassero were placed on the 15-day
DL. ... Several Red Sox fans sitting behind Boston's first base
dugout held up targets with bull's-eyes -- supposedly for Yankees 2B
Chuck Knoblauch to aim at. ... The Red Sox held a moment of silence
for Elizabeth ''Lib'' Dooley, a fan who held season tickets for 50
years.
Indians-White Sox:

<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy allowed one run and five hits in
five innings during a rehab start Monday night for Triple-A
Buffalo, his first such start since he had bone chips removed from
his right elbow May 19. Manager Charlie Manuel said Nagy, who
earned the victory, could join the big league team this weekend.
... OF Manny Ramirez underwent an MRI Monday in Cleveland on his
sore hamstring. He began a rehab assignment Saturday with Double-A
Akron but did not play Sunday because of a setback. ... RHP Paul
Shuey, who has a torn labrum in his right hip, threw on the side
Monday and will likely begin a rehab assignment at the end of the
week with RHP Sean DePaula, who is sidelined with tendinitis in his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox sold 7,000 tickets in the first five
hours the ticket office was open Monday for that night's game
against Cleveland. The White Sox entered the game averaging 20,358
at home. ... White Sox manager Jerry Manuel entered Monday's game
with a 199-192 record. A win would make him the 13th manager in
team history to reach 200 victories. ... The White Sox have played
41 of their first 68 games on the road and opened a 13-game
homestand Monday. ... A small group of fans greeted the team at the
airport when it arrived home Sunday night. ''That was definitely
neat to see,'' said pitcher Bob Howry. ''Even if it was only 10, 15
people, it shows people are paying attention to what we're doing.''
Orioles-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Luis Matos, recalled from Bowie of the Eastern League
on Sunday when Rich Amaral was placed on the 15-day disabled list
with a strained left calf, was in the starting lineup for Monday
night's game against the Athletics. He was scheduled to make his
major league debut in center field, giving Brady Anderson a
much-needed day off. Baltimore manager Mike Hargrove said he was
happy to get Matos, who was hitting .271 at Double-A Bowie when he
was promoted, into the lineup immediately. ''It doesn't do him a
whole lot of good to sit for seven or eight days and then play,''
Hargrove said. ''This is a good chance for him to play and for us
to see what he can do here.'' ... Right-handed reliever Mike
Trombley was not available for Monday's game because he was feeling
sick.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Left-handed reliever Mike Magnante, recovering from
hamstring and forearm injuries, pitched off a bullpen Monday night
for the first time in a week. He was placed on the 15-day disabled
list on May 27 with the hamstring injury, and strained his left
forearm while on a rehabilitation assignment. Trainer Larry Davis
said he expects Magnante to pitch in a simulated game Wednesday,
and that he could begin another rehab assignment as early as
Friday. ... The A's still have not decided who will start Wednesday
night's game against Baltimore in place of Omar Olivares, on the
disabled list with a strained right shoulder. The most likely
candidate is RHP Ariel Prieto, though LHP Barry Zito is also
possible. Both are pitching at Sacramento of the Pacific Coast
League.
Devil Rays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays opened a three-game series in Seattle
with the best ERA in the majors in June (2.98). They entered the
month with a 5.77 ERA, 29th out of 30th among major league teams.
The lowest ERA the Devil Rays have ever posted for a month was 4.06
in April 1998. Tampa Bay starters were 6-4 this month with a 3.02
ERA, while its bullpen was 4-2 with a 1.74 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Mark McLemore on Monday appealed his five-game
suspension before Paul Beeston for charging the mound against Tampa
Bay's Esteban Yan on May 20. ''I will hear about it tomorrow,'' the
Mariners' 2B said. ''I said what I needed to say.'' The Mariners
hope Beeston, the chief operating officer of the commissioner's
office, will reduce McLemore's suspension that was ordered by Frank
Robinson, baseball's new dean of discipline. The team expects
McLemore to be lost for some games. ''I think he'll start his
suspension tomorrow,'' said manager Lou Piniella, who attended
McLemore's hearing at Safeco Field. ''But that's an assumption.''
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Brewers-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers requested unconditional release papers on
Monday for INF Sean Berry. If not claimed, Berry will clear waivers
at 1:00 p.m. Wednesday. ... Monday's game at Florida kicks off a
10-game, 11-day, road trip, the longest of the season, for
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: In sweeping a weekend series in Pittsburgh, three
Florida pitchers recorded saves. When Braden Looper saved the
opening contest, it marked the first time since Aug. 17, 1999, that
any Marlin other than Antonio Alfonseca saved a game. After Joe
Strong saved the series second game, Alfonseca picked up his major
league best 20th save in Sunday's finale. ... Mike Lowell, who
drove in the winning run with a pinch-hit single in the ninth
inning of Sunday's 5-4 win over the Pirates, apparently enjoys the
daylight. He is hitting .404 in day games, as compared to .200 at
night. He has four home runs and 17 RBIs in 57 daytime at-bats,
just slightly less than his totals in 145 at-bats under the lights
(five homers and 19 RBIs).
Braves-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Atlanta 3B Chipper Jones said he's beginning to feel
comfortable at shortstop. Jones started at shortstop last week for
the first time since 1996 and played there twice in the series
against the Phillies. ''I've started a few double plays, but
haven't had to come across the bag,'' he said. ... Andres Galarraga
and Brian Jordan returned to the lineup after sitting out Sunday's
game. ... Greg Maddux didn't allow a run in the first inning of
Monday's game, but Braves starters have allowed 60 first-inning
runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Mickey Morandini batted seventh Monday despite
entering the game with a .341 lifetime average against Greg Maddux.
Morandini has moved to the No. 2 spot against certain pitchers this
season. ... RHP David Coggin will make his major league debut in
place of the injured Robert Person on Friday, but Phillies general
manager Ed Wade said Coggin will go back to Triple-A Scranton
Wilkes-Barre after the start, barring any other injuries. ... Paul
Byrd makes his first start Tuesday since being sent down to
Scranton after going 1-5 with a 7.86 ERA.
Padres-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres began a 10-game road trip -- their longest
this season -- with the game Monday night. ... By Wednesday night,
San Diego will have played the Diamondbacks 13 times in their first
70 games. The Padres have yet to face another NL West club. ...
Bret Boone got his 500th RBI in eight-plus big league seasons with
a second-inning double on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Erubiel Durazo, on the DL after ligament surgery on
his right wrist, took early batting practice and might play Tuesday
night with Triple-A Tucson, then take two days of extended spring
training. He could rejoin the parent club as soon as Friday. ...
Manager Buck Showalter said Matt Mantei, who shares the closer's
role with Byung-Hyun Kim, has no physical problems despite failing
to retire any of the six batters he faced Sunday during a 19-2 loss
to Colorado. ''He's like a lot of our guys right now -- we just need
to have some good things happen and get the guys feeling good about
themselves,'' Showalter said. ... Mantei has not had a save
opportunity since June 5, when he blew a 3-1 lead. ... The pitching
staff's ERA rose from 3.81 to 4.20 because of 33 runs and 40 hits
allowed during two weekend losses in Denver.
Pirates-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates recalled Aramis Ramirez from Triple-A
Nashville and started him at third base after Emil Brown was put on
the 15-day DL. Brown is scheduled to undergo urological surgery.
... Jose Silva's last win came against Montreal on May 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos began their second of three 12-game
homestands this season. Montreal is 23-11 at Olympic Stadium but
just 12-20 on the road. ... The Expos have a league-leading 142
doubles, three more than Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 22, Red Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Now these looked more like the real New York
Yankees -- from the days of Murderers' Row, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling two-time World Series champions handed the Boston
Red Sox their most lopsided home loss ever, breaking loose for five
home runs Monday night in a 22-1 romp.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't figure this game,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ''You never want to beat somebody up like that, but you can't
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer hit a three-run shot in a nine-run eighth inning
and Scott Brosius added a three-run drive in a seven-run ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was embarrassing. It doesn't matter if it's the hometown
Little League,'' Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. ''It's
embarrassing for every one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was New York's highest-scoring game since Aug. 12, 1953, when
it beat Washington by the same 22-1 margin. Only the Yankees' 25-2
win over Philadelphia on May 24, 1936, was by a bigger score in
team history.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Felix Jose also homered as the
Yankees bounced back in a big way from a humiliating four-game
sweep at home by the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not going to see us get 22 runs very often, just like
you probably won't see Boston give up 22 runs again,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest-scoring game against the Red Sox since
Chicago beat them 22-13 on May 31, 1970. Boston's worst loss was
27-3 at Cleveland on July 7, 1923.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not a lot to say,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ''You
can't put this game under a microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza restored a sense of calm to the Yankees by
pitching seven sharp innings. A day earlier, the White Sox scored
nine times in the opening inning on their way to a 17-4 rout, part
of a weekend in which they outscored New York 42-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trying to do my job,'' he said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees began a season-long 13-game road trip by moving a
half-game ahead of Boston in the AL East. More than the standings,
however, Torre hoped for a neatly played game.
</P>
<P>
   Owner George Steinbrenner wanted to see one, too. He met with
his high-level executives during the day at the team's
spring-training complex in Tampa, Fla., and was expected in Boston
later in this four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza (6-3) shut down the Red Sox until the seventh, allowing
six hits and walking none. It was his first start since May 30,
having been scratched once because of a stiff right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped his biggest jam in the sixth after Boston, down 6-0,
loaded the bases with one out for Nomar Garciaparra. He hit a soft
liner and Jeter rushed in from shortstop to catch it, then made a
dive to tag out Jeff Frye for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of the game was Mendoza. He shut them out,'' Jeter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was on the mound the last time the Yankees visited
Fenway Park. He got a save in the clinching Game 5 of the AL
championship last October.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer added a triple and double. Needing a single for the
cycle, Spencer hit a sacrifice fly in the ninth for his fourth RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter doubled in the fourth and scored on a two-out single by
Tino Martinez. Posada followed with a drive into the center-field
bleachers off Brian Rose (3-4) for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter hit a two-run homer into the screen in the fifth, and
Brosius singled home a run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, the Yankees took batting practice against Rob
Stanifer, recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket earlier in the day. Clay
Bellinger had a two-run double as New York batted around with seven
hits, and the Red Sox contributed with two errors and another
mishandled ball.
</P>
<P>
   Stanifer was sent back to the minors after the game. Eight of
the nine runs against him were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're obviously disappointed,'' he said from in front of a
makeshift locker. ''It's not what you're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees RHP Orlando Hernandez, diagnosed a day earlier with
a sprained right elbow, will visit prominent orthopedic surgeon Dr.
James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on Wednesday for a second
opinion. ... Pedro Martinez will start for Boston on Tuesday night
against Andy Pettitte. ... Jose's last big league homer came with
Kansas City in 1994. ... The nine-run eighth marked New York's
biggest inning since a nine-run burst on Aug. 4, 1998, against
Oakland.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Envoy's Kin Kidnapped  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped the brother of a top
government peace negotiator on Monday after a 10-minute shootout in
which a bodyguard and one of the assailants died, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Valencia, a state congressman and brother of envoy
Fabio Valencia, was forced into a car and spirited away following
the gunfight outside an upscale shopping mall in Medellin, the
country's second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers cut off the lawmaker's car and forced it to a
stop, even though it was escorted by two motorcycles, said Medellin
police spokesman Haten Dasuki. Valencia's two other bodyguards were
wounded and hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had no immediate suspects. However, suspicion was
likely to fall on rightist paramilitary groups who oppose
government peace talks with leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Envoy Fabio Valencia received a threatening letter last week
from the rightists, who complained of comments he made in Spain
during a recent peace forum.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with a senior commander of the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, Valencia said the two had a
''common enemy'' -- an apparent reference to the outlaw paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Ciro Ramirez, the president of the Conservative Party to which
both Valencia brothers are members, called the kidnapping ''a blow
to peace.''

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Hold Nuclear Arms Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Top U.S. and Russian administration
officials discussed nuclear arms cuts and stability in closed-door
meetings that started Monday in the Norwegian capital of Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and his Russian
counterpart, Georgy Mamedov, held low-key talks Monday and Tuesday
on a broad range of topics, the U.S. Embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had not been announced in advance.
</P>
<P>
   A top topic for Talbott and Mamedov was expected to be America's
proposed anti-missile shield. The Clinton administration says the
shield would be intended to protect the United States from attacks
by what it calls ''rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia adamantly opposes the system, saying it would undermine
the foundation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that the United
States, NATO and Russia develop a joint missile defense system as
an alternative, but he has yet to offer technical details.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is indeed plenty of room for additional
cooperation on the question of missile defense,'' said Talbott, who
met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland.

<HEADLINE> Wobbling Yanks Bounce Back in Boston  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- So much for all those worries about the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an embarrassing weekend that put them on edge, the
wobbling Yankees bounced back with a vengeance Monday night,
routing Boston 22-1 in their highest-scoring game in 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just shaking my head,'' manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a lot of Yankees were doing the same thing -- for
a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   In a humiliating loss that also cost them pitcher Orlando
Hernandez, the Yankees were smacked 17-4 by the Chicago White Sox.
The two-time World Series champions were swept at home in a
four-game series and outscored 42-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're playing as badly as we can play,'' general
manager Brian Cashman said after that game. ''You're never as bad
as you look, and right now we're bad. We're stinking out the joint
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   New York wobbled into Fenway Park for a four-game set, the start
of a season-long 13-game road trip. There was word that owner
George Steinbrenner -- and his supposed trade interest in Sammy Sosa
-- might be in town Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner met with high-level Yankees executives Monday --
including special advisers Clyde King and Al Rosen, who were
scouting the team's Class-A Tampa affiliate -- at the team's spring
training complex in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't talked to him, but obviously it's a blow to the
organization, to the owner, to the general manager, to myself, the
way things are going,'' Torre said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, Torre's skill at keeping the clubhouse calm and
free of the Boss' bluster was bound to be severely tested in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that might have changed a bit with the romp over the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't figure this game,'' Torre said. ''You never
want to beat somebody up like that, but you can't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was New York's highest-scoring game since Aug. 12, 1953, when
it beat Washington by the same 22-1 margin. Only the Yankees' 25-2
win over Philadelphia on May 24, 1936, was by a bigger score in
team history.
</P>
<P>
   It was the highest-scoring game against the Red Sox since
Chicago beat them 22-13 on May 31, 1970. Boston's worst loss was
27-3 at Cleveland on July 7, 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, there were no signs of panic in the Yankees'
cramped clubhouse at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada and several other
players hooted as they watched a tape of extreme fighting bouts on
a big-screen TV. A few others calmly worked on a crossword puzzle.
Coach Willie Randolph pedaled away on an exercise bike.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had about five do-or-die series in a row,'' third
baseman Scott Brosius said. ''We just need to get on track and play
the way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' three-run homer capped a seven-run ninth inning. That
was one of five Yankees home runs.
</P>
<P>
   At 35-29, the Yankees moved a half-game ahead of Boston for the
AL East lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there have been concerns in the Bronx. As in:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pitching. Roger Clemens is on the disabled list, David Cone
has won only once in 13 starts and Hernandez sprained his right
elbow in Sunday's loss. Rivera is no longer unhittable, either.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hitting. The Yankees were next-to-last in the AL in runs
scored before facing Boston, with middle-of-the-order boppers Paul
O'Neill and Tino Martinez having quiet seasons, and little
production from the DH spot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fielding. Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems, of course. His
latest wild toss hit the mother of FoxSports anchor Keith
Olbermann. The Yankees already are trying to get Minnesota backup
second baseman Todd Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez will visit prominent orthopedic surgeon Dr. James
Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on Wednesday. Hernandez has asked for
a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're not thinking disabled list,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that other, bigger trade talk is bound to heat up well
before the July 31 dealing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean intensified efforts to acquire a slugger, such
as Sosa or Juan Gonzalez. Or perhaps a top starter, such as Brad
Radke or Mike Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   There also are whispers the Yankees might try to satisfy both
needs on a lesser scale. A rumor beginning to make the rounds:
Ricky Ledee and young Ed Yarnall to the San Francisco Giants for
Ellis Burks and Shawn Estes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The season isn't young anymore,'' Jeter said. ''We're not
playing well, and we haven't been playing well from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Posada: ''We're not having any fun out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the little things, which always seemed to go the Yankees'
way as they won three of the last four championships, are going
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' diamond-studded World Series ring, for example, had the
wrong number inscribed. Rather than his No. 22, it had No. 33 -- the
uniform worn by David Wells before he was traded to Toronto for
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were thinking of me when they made that ring,'' Wells
joked Sunday in Boston. ''They loved me there. Tell the fans I miss
them.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants Palestinian Summit  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- President Clinton should convene a summit with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders soon to complete a peace accord, a
top aide to Israel's prime minister said Monday, but Palestinians
expressed reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in expectations from the summit appeared to explain
the latest disagreement. Palestinians assumed the summit would be
the last stage of negotiating an accord, while an Israeli official
said the results could be more modest.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Economics and Planning Minister Nabil Shaath took
some of the pressure off by indicating that the Palestinians would
not react harshly to Israel's missing a Friday deadline of turning
over some more of the West Bank, part of an interim accord signed
last September.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that successful negotiations would mean evacuation of
some Jewish settlements in the West Bank, settlers bused thousands
of their children to Jerusalem for a noisy demonstration outside
Barak's office. They waved signs reading, ''Barak is losing the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides concluded another round of negotiations in
Washington last week, working on a framework for a peace treaty.
The head of the Israeli negotiating team, Internal Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, said the next two weeks would be critical.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, Barak's chief policy adviser, said ''the situation
is ripe for a summit.'' After seven years of talks, he said, each
side knows the other's positions, and now decisions must be made by
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said the summit must take place in the next few weeks to
avoid conflicting with the American political calendar, with party
conventions set for the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaath said the Palestinians do not want a summit unless it
is properly prepared, meaning that an accord is all but finalized.
There were no signs that the two sides were close to agreement on
any of the main issues. A Palestinian official said the negotiators
have not put anything down on paper yet.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said the Palestinians made their concession when they
recognized Israel. Now, he said, Israel must withdraw from all of
the West Bank and Gaza. Barak has indicated he would give up most
of the territory, but insists on keeping areas where most settlers
live.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians suspect that Israel is stalling. They complain
that while the negotiations drag on, Israel expands its
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   American mediator Dennis Ross is due here on Thursday, followed
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to determine if a summit
should be convened.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, Palestinian activists and Israeli soldiers exchanged
gunfire. This came during a two week period of riots in the West
Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers 84-79 After 3  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 10 points in the third
quarter as the Indiana Pacers tenaciously held on to an 84-79 lead
over the Los Angeles Lakers heading into the fourth quarter of Game
6 of the NBA Finals on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, trying to win their first NBA title since
''Showtime'' in 1988, held a 3-2 edge in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which trailed since late in the opening quarter,
pulled within 80-79 on a three-point play by Shaquille O'Neal with
45 seconds left in the third. O'Neal made his second free throw in
five attempts to trim the deficit to one point.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller made two free throws and Jalen Rose, who scored 19
points in the first three periods, added a 20-foot jumper to put
Indiana up by five with 12 minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 28 points and eight rebounds through three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who trailed by as many as 12 points in the second
quarter, narrowed it to 53-56 by halftime, but Indiana opened it up
to 71-63 in the third before the Lakers closed again.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers last led 24-23 on Kobe Bryant's running jumper with
38 seconds left in the first quarter, before Mark Jackson's
over-the-shoulder heave at the buzzer put Indiana back in front,
26-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers inbounded the ball at midcourt with 0.6 seconds
remaining in the quarter. Sam Perkins passed to Jackson, who was in
front of Bryant, about four feet inside midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   In a single motion, Jackson caught the ball, turned and launched
the shot, the ball hitting nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal kept Los Angeles close with 21 first-half points, 15 in
the second quarter, and six rebounds. Bryant had 12 points despite
4-for-12 shooting in the opening half.

<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - The brother of Bergen County Sheriff
Joseph Ciccone and six other men pleaded not guilty Monday to
charges they set fire to a house to cover up a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's brother, Michael Ciccone, a Cliffside Park police
sergeant, a volunteer firefighter, a construction official, a fire
official and three other men are charged with the plot.
</P>
<P>
   They eight were indicted in March on charges they stole
furniture, a car, a furnace and other items from a Cliffside Park
home three months after the owner died in May 1998. The men staged
a phony ''emergency cleanup'' at the house claiming they found
hazardous waste, prosecutors said.

<P>
   The men are charged with official misconduct, theft, fencing
stolen goods, arson, bribery, and conspiracy. Their attorneys said
they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men was not in court Monday because he is in jail on
other charges.

<HEADLINE> Former Michigan man relives storm rescue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) - Nine years ago, Coast Guard Chief Petty
Officer Scott J. Vriesman was in the midst of the Halloween sea
storm depicted in an upcoming film.
</P>
<P>
   Vriesman, 35, plans to line up to see ''The Perfect Storm'' when
it opens June 30. The former west Michigan man was part of a U.S.
Coast Guard helicopter crew that rescued three sailors and three
Coast Guardsmen caught in the fury of the storm south of Long
Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can remember at the time thinking this was a pretty bad
storm but not all that bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sort of had put it out of my mind, but all of the excitement
of the movie has brought it back,'' he told The Muskegon Chronicle.
''It really did not seem to be that big a deal at the time. We were
just doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called perfect storm was created on Oct. 31, 1991, by a
collision of two huge weather fronts with Hurricane Grace, a
powerful southern storm that roared north up the Atlantic coast.
When the three air masses collided, it produced one of the most
powerful storms ever recorded in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Vriesman was stationed at the time in Cape Cod, Mass., as a
Coast Guard aviation machinist and was part of a five-member
helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
   Vriesman's crew was dispatched about 80 miles south of Long
Island to rescue two women and a man caught in the storm aboard the
sailboat Satori. Battling high seas and fierce winds, the crew was
able to rescue the sailors and Coast Guardsmen who went by boat to
rescue them. The Satori was later found beached in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Vriesman and the rest of his crew received commendations from
the Coast Guard. He recently was reassigned to Cape Cod, where he
lives with his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Vriesman was invited to Gloucester, Mass., to meet
the stars and producers of ''The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Sebastian Junger chronicled the unleashing of 120-mph
winds and 100-foot waves. He centered his book ''The Perfect
Storm'' on the Andrea Gail's six-man crew, all of whom died racing
home with a boat full of fish caught on the outskirts of the Grand
Banks, which is off the coast of Newfoundland. The movie, starring
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, centers on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Vriesman is listed in the book among those who risked their
lives to rescue sailors in jeopardy.

Taiwan Offers Summit With China
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Chen Shui-bian offered on Tuesday to hold
Taiwan's first-ever summit with China, saying he believed the two leaders could
''create history'' like their Korean counterparts. At his first news conference
since taking office one month ago, Chen said he hopes to shake hands with
President Jiang Zemin of China and to seek reconciliation during a summit held
in any location and any format that Jiang chooses. China has long considered
Taiwan a renegade state and demanded that it be rejoined to the Chinese
mainland. The two rivals have never held a summit meeting, only talks between
lower-ranking officials.

House Votes To Bar Tobacco Suit Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Monday to bar the Justice Department from
accepting funds from another agency to help pay for the federal lawsuit against
the tobacco industry, even as Attorney General Janet Reno warned that such steps
would force her to drop the multibillion-dollar litigation. By a 207-197 vote,
the House stood behind language in a spending bill that would force the
Department of Veterans Affairs to abandon its plans to give the Justice
Department $4 million to help it pay for the huge lawsuit. The legal action
seeks to recover billions spent by Medicare and other federal programs to treat
illnesses caused by smoking.

Accusations Fly Over Fuel Costs

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Few left a congressional panel with much hope for a
resolution as to why drivers are paying more than $2 a gallon for gas in cities
such as Chicago and Milwaukee. Oil and ethanol industry executives blamed one
another for rising prices, with one oil industry spokesman blaming higher local
taxes, noting that Chicagoans are paying more than 50 cents in total taxes per
gallon.

Gore Questions Oil Company Profits

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toughening his stand on high gas prices, Vice President Al
Gore voiced suspicion Monday over oil companies' huge profits and called for an
investigation into collusion, antitrust violations and price gouging. Gore said
he just learned that the ''big oil companies'' saw a steep increase in profits
for the first quarter of the year. ''Now you put two and two together and look
at the huge price increases that they say they can't explain and look at the 500
percent increase in profits and look at the way they've been getting bigger,''
Gore told CNN.

Molecule May Help Alzheimer's Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dye-like compound that moves into the brain and
pinpoints areas affected by Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated in
laboratory animal experiments, researchers say. In a study appearing tomorrow in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say they have made a molecule
called BSB that in mice will link specifically with brain tissue affected by
Alzheimer's disease. When injected in the bloodstream, the molecule travels to
the brain and attaches itself to the diseased tissue. If the technique can be
developed for human use, it would enable clinicians, for the first time, to see
the extent of brain tissue affected by Alzheimer's disease.
