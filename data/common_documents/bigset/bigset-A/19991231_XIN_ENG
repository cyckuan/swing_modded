<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
assured the public that major Y2K disruptions are unlikely in
Singapore and it will remain vigilant despite the country is well
prepared for Y2K glitches.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released Thursday by the Inforcomm Development
Authority (IDA) of Singapore, came when countries make their final
round of preparations to deal with the Y2K problem in the days
close to the millennium crossover and public interest in the
millennium bug issue is expected to heighten.
</P>
<P>
IDA reaffirmed that Singapore key government systems and
critical infrastructure service providers in finance, utility,
telecommunications, transportation and healthcare have been ready
since the middle of 1999, ahead of the December 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's National Y2K Spokesman Alan Chan, who is permanent
secretary of the Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology, was quoted as saying that "although we are confident
that major disruptions are unlikely, key government agencies have
nonetheless prepared plans to detect glitches quickly and to take
prompt action to fix them quickly should they occur."
</P>
<P>
"The public can be assured that the Singapore government is
ready in any case," Chan was quoted as stressing.
</P>
<P>
IDA said it has set up a National Y2K Coordination Center Y2KCC)
to monitor the Singapore Y2K situation during the millennium
crossover and will be picking early warning signals from the
International Y2K Cooperation Center's website.
</P>
<P>
Besides monitoring the local and international developments,
the National Y2KCC will keep the public informed on Singapore's
Y2K situation as and when necessary through the mass media as well
as via the National Y2K website, IDA added,
</P>
<P>
IDA also gave out some of the essential services' hotline
numbers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Seeks Bigger Role in Sea, Air Services (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is taking active
measures to strengthen its position as a leading international
shipping and aviation center in the new century, a senior
government official said.
</P>
<P>
As a leading international air and sea cargo hub, Hong Kong has
good reasons for international cargo businesses to choose it as
their base of operation, said Secretary for Economic Services
Stephen Ip.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's open markets, pro-business culture, excellent
communication networks and world-class financial facilities make
it an ideal base in which to do business," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's imminent entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
means more trade going through Hong Kong into and out of China,
which will boost Hong Kong's shipping and air services industry,
Ip said.
</P>
<P>
To secure Hong Kong's position as an international air and sea
cargo hub and gateway to the Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government is planning
measures to increase Hong Kong's competitive edge, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the sixth largest maritime center in the world,
after Greece, Japan, Norway, the United States and the Chinese
Mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong shipowners control over six percent of world tonnage
amounting to over 34 million gross tons. There are some 1000
shipping related companies operating in Hong Kong which provide
ship management, brokerage, finance, insurance, arbitration, legal,
naval architecture and ship surveying services.
</P>
<P>
To make the Hong Kong shipping sector more competitive, a
package of measures have been introduced recently to make
registration under the Hong Kong Shipping Register more attractive,
competitive and user friendly, according to Ip.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong has reduced ship registration fees by an average of
50 percent and introduced a simplified survey cycle that will
again reduce costs. The two measures have provided significant
savings to shipowners in the first year of registration under the
Hong Kong flag.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, owners of Hong Kong ships are not required to pay any
tax on profits made overseas, and they are also exempted from
paying any tax on profits made on cargo uplifted from Hong Kong,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ip pledged to conclude double taxation relief arrangements with
Hong Kong's trading partners to exempt owners of Hong Kong ships
from paying any freight tax levied on cargo uplifted from overseas.
</P>
<P>
The container ports of Hong Kong are among the busiest in the
world, handling an estimated 15.6 million TEUs with 460 liner
services per week to 170 destinations in the world.
</P>
<P>
Figures released recently by the Census and Statistics
Department showed that in the third quarter of 1999, the port
cargo throughput in Hong Kong increased by six percent over a year
earlier to 43.4 million tons, with outward port cargo showing a
significant growth of 19 percent to 17 million tons.
</P>
<P>
To further raise the cargo handling capacities of the Hong Kong
ports, Ip said that construction work for Container Terminal 9
will commence early next year to provide an additional 2.6 million
TEU capacity by 2004.
</P>
<P>
In addition to terminals, Hong Kong provides the option for
small and medium-sized ships to load and upload containers more
economically in mid-stream. The River Trade Terminal at Tuen Mun
provides a custom-built facility to meet the needs of the growing
river trade.

<P>
Apart from operating the world's busiest container ports, Hong
Kong is also operating the world's busiest air cargo hub, handling
nearly 2 million tons of air cargo in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA)
handled a total of 201,000 tons of cargo, a 27.6 percent increase
over the same period last year. The number of passengers also
increased by 13.2 percent to a total of 2.577 million, largely
thanks to the recovery of the Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
To further boost competitiveness of HKIA, the Hong Kong Airport
Authority (AA) proposed last September a 15 percent reduction in
landing and parking charges for all aircraft at HKIA, which will
come into effect from January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of user friendly measures were announced,
including the provision of trolleys in the airside area, the
introduction of duty free shopping for arrival passengers, the
offer of half-hour free parking, and the launch of a discount for
passengers who park their car at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The AA is also inviting interested parties to set up logistics
centers and a maritime cargo transfer center in the airport zone,
in a bid to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international
air cargo hub.
</P>
<P>
The AA will work closely with its business partners and the
government to further improve the airport services and facilities,
Ip said, adding that Hong Kong will continue to expand its links
by negotiating new air services agreement in addition to the 37
agreements Hong Kong has already signed.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Employment Rise in All Service Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong witnessed a big
rise in employment in all service sectors in the third quarter of
this year over a year earlier, according to the figures released
Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year comparison, the growth in employment in
September 1999 was the most significant in the wholesale, retail
and import and export trades, restaurants and hotels sector, with
a total 997,5000 people engaged, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
However, employment of manual workers at construction sites and
in the manufacturing sector continued on a declining trend, but
smaller than in the earlier periods.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the department, a rebound in the
total number of vacancies was registered in transport, storage and
communications sector, and the wholesale, retail and hotels sector
in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
For all the sectors surveyed taken together, there were around
27,800 vacancies in September, of which 24,800 were in the private
sector and the other 3,000 in the civil service, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report showed that the average payroll per
person engaged for all the major sectors surveyed taken together
decreased by 1.1 percent in nominal terms in the third quarter
1999 over a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Arabs, Israelis Forge Ahead Toward Comprehensive Peace by Tan Xinmu, Qi Deliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- With the revival of peace
talks on both Palestinian and Syrian tracks in 1999, the Middle
East peace process is gaining momentum toward an overall settlement
between Israel and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Ending a three-year deadlock, peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians on interim affairs resumed in July, two months after
Labor party leader Ehud Barak defeated then hardline Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
In early September, Israel and the Palestinians signed Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum on implementation of what Tel Aviv had committed
to in the Wye agreement a year before.
</P>
<P>
The most significant of the latest deal was an exact timetable
for the two sides to reach a permanent peace accord. They are to
produce a framework deal next February and complete a detailed
peace treaty next September.
</P>
<P>
The process of negotiating the Sharm el Sheikh memo also helped
restore the shattered mutual confidence between the two sides - the
Palestinians went to the negotiating table with reluctance and
suspicion, but eventually got a better deal than the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
So far, the memo has been carried out in earnest by and large,
although not without hindrances and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has handed over 7 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians in the first stage of redeployments, released 350
Palestinian political prisoners, and opened a safe passage route
linking the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Their final-status talks on resolving the thorniest issues such
as Palestinian statehood, fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and
Palestinian refugees, kicked off on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Although there were only 100 days left to finish a framework
deal on ending the decade-old conflicts, the two sides expressed
confidence that they can meet the target date.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, however, came somewhat
as a surprise. After Barak took office, the two sides exchanged
words of peace; but the lack of confidence and a clear formula
prevented the negotiations from being reopened at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that there were at least three factors leading
to the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The first was that Syrian President Hafez al-Assad reached
better understanding of Barak's intention to achieve peace. After
several months of careful observation, Assad believed that Barak
was sincere in his pursuit of a comprehensive peace, and that the
current favorable opportunity should not be missed again as in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The second was that U.S. President Bill Clinton was eager to
secure a major diplomatic achievement before his second term ends
in early 2001. It was revealed that Washington had conducted
intensive quiet diplomacy between the two sides in the last several
months and Clinton had been personally involved by talking to Barak
and Assad on the phone frequently.
</P>
<P>
The third factor was that Barak pledged to withdraw Israeli
troops out of south Lebanon by July next year, even without
security arrangements with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A potential unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon would
undoubtedly strip Damascus of an important card it wants to
leverage Israel for more concessions on the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been upbeat about the renewed negotiations,
saying a peace deal could be within reach in week or in months, for
about 80 percent of their disputes have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, where Syria has been a major power-broker, would join
in negotiations soon with Israel on Israeli troop withdrawal from
its south. Israel carved out a border strip there in 1985 as a
declared aim of protecting its north from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The progress on all the tracks of Middle East peace-making is an
immediate result of Barak's new policies.
</P>
<P>
Barak has claimed that no one understands better than he the
vital importance of security for Israel. Unlike Netanyahu, who used
security as an excuse for his hardline policies, Barak realizes
that the best way to achieve security is through peace.
</P>
<P>
He has reiterated his promise to end the decade-old conflict
between the Jewish people and its Arab neighbors. He also expressed
readiness to make "painful concessions" in order to achieve this
goal.
</P>
<P>
Judging from a broader perspective, the Middle East peace
process has moved forward due to persistent Arab struggle and
international efforts. The Israelis, on the other hand, have been
tired of living in tension, clashes and international isolation.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East has never been so close to a comprehensive
peace, whose realization, however, is not a done deal. There are
still at least three main challenges to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the pressure of time. The time frame for agreements on
all the tracks is tight, but the issues are the most difficult ones
- on the Palestinian track, wide gaps remain on almost every final-
status issue with no quick solutions in sight.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Israel has proposed a two-step mechanism for
realizing permanent peace - resolving less difficult issues first
and then the most tough ones, such as the fate of Jerusalem and
Palestinian refugees,
</P>
<P>
Barak said a few months ago that if the two sides failed to
agree on an outline by February, they might have to forgo a final
accord and instead negotiate long-term interim agreements on most
issues.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian track, the two sides restarted the talks "from the
point where they left off," but the question of what the point was
is still open to different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that talks resume from what it says was a verbal
promise by the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to hand
back all the Golan in exchange for peace and security measures. But
Israel has denied the existence of such a promise.
</P>
<P>
In their two days of talks held in Washington on December 15 and
December 16, Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
only agreed on how the negotiations should proceed. Substantial
discussions have not yet started.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Barak faces a tremendous task of selling any of his
agreements to the Israeli public, for he has promised to subject
any deal to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
This idea not only restricts his flexibility in negotiations,
but also imposes on him a lot of persuasion work to garner a
majority of public support.
</P>
<P>
Although most Israelis support the peace process, they differ on
how peace can be achieved. It might be easier for them to accept a
demilitarized Palestinian state than a partitioned city of
Jerusalem. a larger troop withdrawal from the West Bank for the
Palestinians than a return of the Golan to Syria.
</P>
<P>
To ensure wide support for his peace policies, Barak formed a
coalition government that has the widest parliamentary majority in
decades. But rift set in over the resumption of talks with Syrian.
</P>
<P>
Barak went to Washington for talks with Sharaa backed with only
a narrow parliamentary majority, as some coalition partners voted
against or abstained.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, terrorism poses as serious a threat to the peace
process as before.
</P>
<P>
Extremists opposed to peace-making between Israel and the Arabs
will keep attempting to derail the peace process. Since the signing
of the Sharm el Sheikh deal, there have been several terror attacks
inside Israel, and increased terrorist activities are predicted as
the peace process proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Like his mentor Rabin, Barak has kept the peace process running
in face of terror attacks in order not to play into the hands of
terrorists. But there is still risk of the peace process being
derailed if terror attacks inflict serious fatalities. The Israeli-
Syrian talks came to a halt in early 1996 mainly because of a
string of suicide bombings inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with a shared desire and determination to avert
further conflicts and wars, the Israelis and the Arabs are believed
to overcome all the difficulties to usher the Middle East into a
new millenium of comprehensive and lasting peace.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Annihilation of Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei again called for the annihilation of
Israel on the occasion of the international Qods (Jerusalem) day
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one solution to the Middle East problem, namely
the annihilation and destruction of the Zionist (Israeli) state,"
Khamenei said at the Friday prayers on the campus of Tehran
University.
</P>
<P>
"From Islamic, humanitarian, economic, security and political
points of view, today the presence of Israel is a very big threat
against the regional nations and states," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini announced the last Friday of the Islamic holy fasting
month of Ramadan as the International Qods Day, calling for
international support for the Palestinians to "liberate" Jerusalem
from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of fasting Iranians from various walks of life
on Friday poured into streets to voice their support for the
Palestinian struggles and condemning any compromise with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the large gathering, Khamenei said that "Israel is
now in possession of nuclear arsenal and continues to produce
weapons, it has not heeded the warnings of the United Nations
either, mainly because of the U.S. support."
</P>
<P>
From economic point of view, Khamenei said, the Zionists want to
create a so-called "new Middle East" with Israel dominating the
region economically.
</P>
<P>
"They aim to gradually dominate the Arab countries in the region
economically and then the oil-rich states in the Persian Gulf," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
After breaking ties with Tel Aviv after the 1979 Islamic
revolution, Tehran has always refused to recognize the Jewish
state, labelling it "the usurper of Islamic lands."
</P>
<P>
Tehran has also opposed the Middle East peace process and any
compromise with Israel, calling for military struggle to root out
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian government has adopted milder policies
towards the peace process by declaring it would not take any action
to undermine the peace process, though Tehran is against it.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also lashed out at the U.S., certain western countries
and international human rights organizations for turning a blind
eye to "the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinians not to vest any hope in peace talks
with Israel, saying that "peace is only a ploy by the Zionists to
prepare for their future aggressions."
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Palestinian issue is the main problem of
the Islamic world, noting that the Palestinian refugees must return
to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Muslims throughout the world had every duty to defend the
Palestinians in whatever possible manner, he said, "part of the
Islamic land is under the occupation of the enemy and we Muslims
are all duty bound to defend the land and return it to its main
owners."

<HEADLINE> Clerides Wishes Way Open up for Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Friday evening expressed the wish "the way will open up in
the year 2000 for a just, viable and workable solution" to the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message, the president also wished "the
unhindered continuation of Cyprus' accession course to the European
Union (EU)."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974. Efforts
have been made to reunite the island through a bizonal, bicommunal
federation formula, so far produced no tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession talks with the EU in
November 1998 and hopes to be admitted by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the strategy followed on both these issues "has
set in motion various forces which can make a decisive contribution
to a solution."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that "in order to attain our goals we need to
achieve the greatest possible unity in our internal front, as well
as to continue our excellent cooperation with the Greek
government."
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed "we have the required capabilities and for
this reason we have to devote all our energy to turn into reality
in the first years of the new millennium our common vision for a
new Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said "tonight not only pleasant but also unpleasant memories
come to our mind more vividly. One of these, which continues to be
a painful reality, is the continuing occupation of about one third
of our homeland by Turkey, with all its repercussions which still
affect us."
</P>
<P>
"I am certain however, that this painful memory strengthens our
endurance and determination to struggle and keep our optimism and
hope alive and that, finally, justice will be restored in our long-
suffering country to the benefits of all Cypriots," Clerides added.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls for Iraqi Steps to Heal Arab Rifts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Friday urged Iraq to take creative
steps in a bid to help heal the rifts in the Arab world in the
coming new era.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued hours before the advent of the third
millennium, Abdel-Meguid spoke of the major events that occurred in
the Arab world this century and the 22-nation pan-Arab forum's
expectations and hopes.
</P>
<P>
He singled out one momentous event in the last decade: Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, which, he regretted, had a
clear negative impact on Arab solidarity and incised a deep wound
in inter-Arab relations still felt till now.
</P>
<P>
Such rifts should be remedied through creative overtures and
well-calculated concessions by Iraq, the AL chief said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid called on Iraq to honor the relevant United Nations
Security Council resolutions, a move which he said would greatly
contribute to restoring Arab unity and clearing Arab atmospheres.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait prompted the U.N. Security Council to
imposed crippling economic sanctions on it. The sanctions will not
be lifted until Iraq complies with the resolutions demanding, among
other things, elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait and some other Gulf Arab countries have not
forgiven Baghdad due to its failure to officially apologize for the
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Asserting the importance of intensifying cooperation between the
Arab League and the other regional and international organizations,
Abdel-Meguid expressed keenness on developing the values of dialog
and understanding among world societies and renunciation of
violence and extremism.
</P>
<P>
On the threshold of the third millennium, the AL cherishes the
hope for stronger international cooperation and efforts in securing
world peace and stability, and achieving sustained development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Arab countries to promote inter-Arab trade and
economic cooperation, and make joint efforts to set up the aspired
Arab common market for the benefit of the Arab nation.

consolidating democracy, economic reforms and international
collaboration," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I unite with these sentiments the best wishes for peace and
prosperity for our friend the Russian people, and personal well-
being for yourself and your family," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Deputy President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma said Friday that his country will give
priority to achieving unity in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zuma, however, admitted that the achievement of unity poses a
main challenge to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Of highest priority is... driving the consistent
transformation of South Africa into a non-racial, non-sexist
society -- in short, the molding of a united nation," he told
revelers gathering at the Union Building in Pretoria to celebrate
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He said the creation of a single nation depended on bridging
the gulf between rich and poor, white and black.
</P>
<P>
This would require a renewed focus on ending poverty, hunger,
insecurity and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
This transformative process requires great efforts to create an
ever expanding floor of opportunities for all South Africans, Zuma
said.
</P>
<P>
South Africans should recognize that their fellow citizens
were at root simple, uncomplicated human beings -- a realization
which should help to bind the nation as it strides into the new
millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zuma was the main speaker at Pretoria's official 6 million rand
(1 million U.S. dollar) millennium bash, expected to be attended
by up to 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
He said putting the government's reconstruction and development
program into effect would demand the same degree of dedication,
skill and courage as the struggle for democracy.
</P>
<P>
Zuma said South Africa was standing at the threshold of a new
epoch and that the country had the potential of becoming the
economic engine room of the entire continent.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the future of the continent, he said political
stability and peace were indispensable ingredients for Africa's
revival.
</P>
<P>
It would also require the creation of a shared sense of purpose
among Africans, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The continent must recapture the numerous opportunities it has
lost because of misguided policies," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
"As we mark the festive season, let the message of peace and
goodwill towards our fellow human beings ring out throughout the
land," Zuma said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said Friday that greater efforts should
be made to deal with the world's current woes in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
In his millennium message broadcast by the South African
Broadcasting Corporation, Mandela reminded the public that despite
advances made in the 20th century, many among the world's
population still live in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The world closed the century with most people still languishing
in poverty, subjected to hunger, preventable disease, illiteracy
and insufficient shelter, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been fortunate to live through most of the century. It
brought such great hope and at other times such disappointment,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"In some ways we outstreaked the achievements of our ancestors
over all the preceding centuries," he said. "In other ways we fell
short of what we hoped for and what was indeed possible."
</P>
<P>
"We lived through two world wars and many more localized
conflicts and we also witnessed the establishment of the U.N. and
other multilateral bodies for the peaceful resolution of conflicts,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Humanity should take advantage of the advances in science and
technology, industry and learning to address the needs of the
world's population, he said.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: 1999, Year of Rekindled Hope for Nigeria (by Song Li) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 is a year of
rekindled hope for Nigerians. After a decade and half of military
misrule, which made Nigeria plummet from a middle-income country
to one of the world's poorest, Nigerian people chose Olusegun
Obasanjo and his civilian government to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo took over on May 29 from the military's hand a country
on the edge of collapse. When he pledged political stability, good
governance and economic recovery in his inauguration address, some
foreign journalists simply thought "he stopped short of promising
miracles."
</P>
<P>
Miracles can't come in a short period of seven months. Yet,
remarkable signs of improvement do appear on Obasanjo's cause of
"making Nigeria great again."
</P>
<P>
In the past seven months, the top priority for Obasanjo is to
make the civilian government to root in Nigeria, a country ruled
by the military in 28 years out of its 39-year history after
independence.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo started his work by purging the military. In half a
month following his inauguration, more than 100 generals lost
their jobs and retired on a voluntary or compulsory basis.
</P>
<P>
Through staffing the high-ranking positions of the armed forces
by younger generations of officers, Obasanjo, who is also a
retired general, took full control of the county's restive
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
To achieve political stability, Obasanjo paid special attention
to keep a balance in appointing government officials. His cabinet
posts were evenly distributed among the country's nearly 40
states, and three big ethnic groups, the Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo.
</P>
<P>
To win the people's support, he put anti-corruption at the
center of his policy.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is a hallmark character of Nigeria on the world
stage. If the country remained to be in this image, no foreign
investment would start to flow into this country, said Obasanjo
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
Corruption also fueled the country's political instability,
for it was placing a high premium on the control of state office.
Some estimated about 40 billion U.S. dollars of public treasure
has been looted out and stacked in foreign banks by corrupt
officials under the past military regimes.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, hundreds of millions of these ill-gotten
assets have been taken back. Under the request of the Nigerian
government, Swiss froze in November bank accounts worth billions
of dollars under the name of former military dictator Sani Abacha
and his associates.
</P>
<P>
The new government also ordered to freeze and re-examine
contracts signed by former military regimes, including his own. In
a quite unusual stance, the first bill Obasanjo sent to the
National Assembly, the country's top legislature, is an anti-
corruption act, which may sentence corrupt officials for as long
as seven years in jail if it were passed into law. Long neglected
utility industries such as petroleum, electricity and water
supplies resumed normal functioning within months of Obasanjo's
coming into power. The quickly devaluating naira stabilized at a
level of 100 naira to one U.S. dollar. These have won acclamation
from the average Nigerians. Privatization and diversity of its
economy are two main thrusts of his economic policy. The long
delayed multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas plant started
supplying gas to Europe in November. The West African natural gas
pipeline project is also underway. Obasanjo pays particular
attention to the development of agriculture by providing favorite
loans to the farmers. He also encourages the growth of small and
medium-sized enterprises in a bid to boost the employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Stressing its ties with the West and leadership in Africa are
the two pillars of Obasanjo's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
With the dawning of democracy in this country, Western
countries resumed full ties with Nigeria. Western dignities
including French President Jacques Chirac, Canadian President Jean
Chretien and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited
Nigeria. In a quite unusual stance, Obasanjo paid three visits to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria hopes to count on the West's help in the areas of debt
alleviation, privatization, and investment. It also hopes the
United States and other Western countries can stand out to
intervene in case there were a coup in the future.
</P>
<P>
For Nigeria in 1999, there was a mixed picture of withdrawal
form certain regional commitments for economic considerations and
demonstrated desires to exert shared leadership with South Africa
in the South Sahara African continent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria successfully helped to ink the Lome peace accord this
July ending the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone, and the
latter shifted its commitment to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also helped to pacify the hostility between Liberia and
Guinea, and set up a mediation and security mechanism within the
frame work the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS)
at the 22nd ECOWAS summit held in November in Togo's capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, which may justifiably bring Nigerians
optimism at the threshold of a new millennium. Daunting challenges
still remain for Obasanjo to finish the rest of his four year term.
</P>
<P>
Debt alleviation and ethnic conflicts, among others, are among
the most urgent and grim ones.
</P>
<P>
With an external debt of about 29 billion dollars, Nigeria is
Africa's largest debtor nation. To fully service debt obligations,
Nigeria has to pay 4 billion dollars, almost 80 percent of the
federal budget in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Debt alleviation was often the dominating topic in Nigerian
leaders' trips to the U.S. and European countries or their talks
with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts, the main Western countries only agreed to
a re-scheduling instead of a straight cancellation of the country'
s debts. In the years to come, the debt problem is sure to be the
key to Nigeria's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's history since its independence is dominated by
competition for power and resources between the three main ethnic
groups -- the Hausa-Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the
southwest and Igbo in the southeast. Obasanjo has been ruling on a
delicate balance of power between the three, though with
unavoidable consequences of inner fighting and low administrative
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly, who are divided more by
geographical definition than political differences, actually have
done nothing except quarreling with each other since their
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic conflicts in the oil producing Niger delta region are
also growing more and more violent. Several hundred people were
killed in an ethnic clash triggered only a day after Obasanjo's
stepping into power. A dozen of federal policemen were recently
murdered by militant Ijaw youths in Beyalsa on the delta. In the
north, Zamfara State in December announced its adoption of the
Islamic Sharia as a state law, which triggered protests from the
Christian south.
</P>
<P>
All this, if improperly handled, could still endanger the
hardly earned stability in Africa's most populous country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Talk on Phone After Yeltsin's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two leaders spoke for about 20 minutes. Clinton saluted
Russia's movement to democracy under Yeltsin and pledged to work
with the Russian people, Acting President Vladimir Putin, the
winner of next year's presidential election, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Yeltsin) said that Russians will remain committed to their
constitution, democracy, arms control, (and) market economics. He
made a strong case for President Putin as a strong, intelligent
and capable man," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told Yeltsin historians will regard him as "someone who
guided Russia to the point of democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States had no advance notice of Yeltsin's
resignation, announced earlier Friday, Lockhart said. Another
White House spokesman said earlier that the resignation was
dramatic, but not a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart added that the alert status of the U.S. military had
not changed. Top military officers from both countries currently
were working closely together in Colorado, monitoring any
potential computer problems related to the changeover to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Clinton said in a statement that he would work
with the Russian leader "together to advance common interests"
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have had our differences, such as on Chechnya, but
President Yeltsin and my starting point has always been how Russia
and the United States could work together to advance common
interests," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated, however, that the U.S.-Russian relationship had
achieved "genuine progress." About 5,000 long-range strategic
nuclear weapons had been dismantled in the U.S. and Russia, and
the two country worked together to keep peace on the Balkans,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"In this spirit, I look forward to working with Acting
President Putin as the Russian people begin this process of making
the transition from one democratically elected president to the
other," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: War Dominates S.Lanka's Elections By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- For Sri Lankans, the passing
1999 is a politically important year dominated by provincial
elections and the presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the central issue in all the elections is war and
peace.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by the seemingly unending ethnic
conflicts since 1983 between government troops and the separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who demand a
separate state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
For President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the success or failure in
her political career hinges on the resolution of the bloody ethnic
war.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga was voted to power in November 1994 with a
landslide 62 percent majority, partly because of her pledge to
bring peace back to the war-torn island country.
</P>
<P>
But a few months after her victory, peace talks between the
government and the LTTE broke down and hostilities resumed.
</P>
<P>
Since then Kumaratunga followed a war-for-peace solution to the
ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
By October 1999, government troops have succeeded in reducing
the amount of rebel territory from 9,100 square kms in 1994 to 3,
200 square kms.
</P>
<P>
The biggest military victory was the recapture of the northern
Jaffna peninsula in 1996 where the LTTE had established their de
facto state for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, Kumaratunga initiated a devolution
package to give more power to local administrations, including one
dominated by ethnic Tamils.
</P>
<P>
However, both measures have failed to produce decisive effects
so far to end the ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
A string of military defeats in the northern Wanni region early
last month stripped the government of a vast area that had taken
the army more than two years to capture. Meanwhile, the devolution
package has yet to gain the necessary two-thirds majority in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
With only one year left of the current term, hope is slim for
Mrs.Kumaratunga to break the stalemate on the ethnic problem from
both military and political aspects.
</P>
<P>
People's disappointment with the government is much obvious as
the president has failed to fulfill her promise to bring back
peace in her last election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The staggering war expenditure has slowed down the country's
economic development as well.
</P>
<P>
According to Sri Lanka's Central Bank, its Gross Domestic
Product (GDP growth rate has dropped from 6.3 percent in 1997 to 4.
7 percent in 1998, and is expected to drop further this year to
four percent.
</P>
<P>
With her political career in jeopardy, Chandrika Kumaratunga on
October 20 called the presidential elections nearly a year ahead
of the scheduled date of next November.
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to catch the opposition United National
Party (UNP) in surprise. Meanwhile, it can take advantage of the
ruling People's Alliance (PA)'s victory in the seven provincial
councils elections held in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kumaratunga launched a massive election campaign
for the country's fourth presidential election on December 21,
fully utilizing the powerful state propaganda machinery.
</P>
<P>
But people will choose the one who gives them the best hope of
ending this protracted ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's main rival, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe tried
to woo voters by his pledge to solve the ethnic problem with
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He said once elected, he would open talks with the LTTE and
establish an interim council in the Tamil-dominated northeast.
</P>
<P>
He also planned to create a conducive atmosphere by sending
food and medicine to regions held by the LTTE, lift military
restrictions on fishing and farming and stop the harassment of
Tamil civilians.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe's promise seemed not only comply with people's
war-weariness, but also got the favor of the LTTE rebels, who
would rather cooperate with a mild peace advocator than an
aggressive war supporter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a neck and neck race between Kumaratunga
and Wickremesinghe until December 18 when twin bombings occurred
in and near Colombo at the last election rallies of the PA and UNP.
</P>
<P>
The bombings, which was blamed on the LTTE, had killed 35
people and injured 129 others including the president herself and
three cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kumaratunga, who probably lost her right eye in the
assassination attempt, was believed to have obtained more sympathy
votes from the majority Sinhalese voters.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga was reelected in the end with a narrow majority of
51.12 percent, while Wickremesinghe obtained 42.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
The next crucial step for the president to take is call for
early parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
The mood of utmost confidence among government leaders and
within the ruling alliance after the election, plus the trend of
defection of UNP parliament members to the ruling party would
undoubtedly enable Mrs. Kumaratunga to get the two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
But for ordinary people, whoever ends the war, who scores the
last victory.

<HEADLINE> Putin Reaffirms to Continue Russian Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin reaffirmed late Friday that he will continue
Russian foreign policy implemented by ex-President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not change its foreign course and will continue to

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Yeltsin Resignation Prompts Mix Reaction in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin's
announcement Friday to step down and name Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin as acting president prompted mixed reactions across the
Russian political arena.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, a former senior aide to Yeltsin, said the move
was a "stroke of genius."
</P>
<P>
"It was the perfect decision, courageous and profound," he said,
adding that many politicians would come to realize Yeltsin's
importance in the wake of the resignation.
</P>
<P>
However, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist
Party, said Yeltsin's stepping down six months before the
expiration of his term was a result of a 10-year struggle with
Russia's patriots and Communists, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin's party of power has fallen... the people's
impeachment of Yeltsin has taken place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation was widely seen as a move that would
further boost Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's chances of winning
the next presidential elections, now moved to March.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov called on all healthy forces to be mobilized "to ward
off the coming to power of another version of an anti-popular
regime."
</P>
<P>
Boris Berezovsky, a prominent business tycoon widely known for
his political connections, praised Yeltsin's move as a right
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin once again proved to everybody that he is the right
choice for Russia, a powerful, great and unpredictable country for
everyone but us, those who were born, live and will die here,"
Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boris Nemtsov, a former Yeltsin aide who now heads the Union of
Right-Wing Forces, said Yeltsin's resignation gave Putin a real
chance to become the future Russian president.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin has left as impressively as he came. This was done not
only impressively but also with fine timing: after the
parliamentary elections and before the New Year," Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin expressed the belief
that Putin would be victorious in the upcoming presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"There are three months until the elections and I do not see
any serious opponents to Putin," Stepashin said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Yeltsin's move was taken in
the interests of the Russian state to ensure that the new
generation of Russian politicians who have won a good reputation
might continue working for the benefit of Russia with redoubled
strength."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Sergeyev described Yeltsin's resignation as "
an event of enormous importance," adding that he understood "the
emotions which filled Yeltsin."
</P>
<P>
He praised Yeltsin's intellect behind the resignation. "Many
will soon understand the important role of Boris Yeltsin in
Russian history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said Yeltsin's presidency
had marked a whole epoch in the history of the Russian state.

<HEADLINE> Japan Announces Ready For Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- As the year 2000 is approaching,
Japan Friday declared itself ready for the Y2K bug, launching a
task force headed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to gather
information about problems related to the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
The task force, launched at the prime minister's official
residence at 6 p.m. (local time), will obtain information about
computer problems in New Zealand through the Japanese embassy
there as New Zealand is the first industrialized nation to greet
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is expected to announce details of problems arising from
the millennium bug at 0:50 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that we gather information as quickly as
possible to ensure that the people are informed," Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said when announcing the launch of
the Y2K task force.
</P>
<P>
"Should anything happen, we must take steps to ensure that
people's lives are not affected," the top government spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than two million people in the country's public
and private sectors went on alert to prepare for the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
They include 806,000 fire fighters, 106,000 police officers, 96,
000 members of the Self-Defense Forces and 2,000 civil servants
from government ministries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
Some 270,000 workers in the banking, brokerage and insurance
industries will also be on duty during the New Year season to
prepare for any computer breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
With jitters over possible blackouts from the millennium bug,
Japan's electric power companies had some 16,000 workers on
standby, while railway companies plan to halt all train services
for about five minutes around midday Friday to check for problems
in signals and other equipment.

JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Friday delivered a new millennium message, urging all
Africans to take a stand against war, poverty and corruption and
make the next century an era of good hope.
</P>
<P>
In a new year message to be broadcast on television and radio

of colonialism on their continent.
</P>

However, he said they had not "taken advantage of the fact of
our liberation to address the fundamental interests of our peoples
" due to too many military coups and too many wars within and
between countries on the African continent.

<P>
Mbeki pointed out that the approaching century "will and must
be a century of hope". He called on all African people, including
South Africans, to do everything they could to boost
reconciliation among people, wipe out the legacy of racism, sexism
and discrimination against disabled people, and fight against
crime and poverty.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Publishes New Year Message (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China will hold high the great
banner of Marxism and Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping Theory, rally round the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, work hard with one heart and one
mind, deepen reform and promote development so as to create a
still more splendid future in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In its New Year's message titled "Greeting the Dawn of the New
Century," the People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, says this
practice in the past year and in the past decade as well has
eloquently proven that the basic line and principles of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) have been shown correct at a time
when the country is confronted with complicated domestic and
international situations.
</P>
<P>
The 20th century is approaching its end, the message says. The
achievements of civilization created by mankind in the past 2,000
years and the dear price paid for them inspired the Chinese people
to firmly explore into the future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation, which has one fifth of the world's
population, created a brilliant ancient civilization and is now
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, shoulders the
heavy responsibility of creating new developments in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
From the middle of the last century to the middle of this one,
the Chinese people finally achieved national independence and
people's liberation after 100 years of bloody struggles, the
message says. And from the middle of this century to the middle of
next century, the Chinese nation will basically achieve socialist
modernization and will stand proud among the family of nations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the message recalls that the Chinese people have,
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
undergone untold sufferings and severe tests in the past centuries.
</P>
<P>
As bells chime in celebration of the coming new millennium, the
Chinese people are overjoyed with the advancement of mankind
during the past 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people also are proud of their glorious
achievements made in the past, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that 1999 is an important year for the Chinese
people in terms of its battles against various difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Under complex internal and international conditions, China hit
goals in the process of reform and opening and the economic
development.

<P>
In the past year, the Chinese people celebrated the 50th
founding anniversary of new China, and the smooth return of Macao
to the motherland, the message recalls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese people, united as one, in the past year
denounced the U.S.-led NATO bloc for its bombing of the Chinese
embassy in the Federation of Yugoslavia, the message notes, and
repudiated the "two-states" theory peddled by Lee Teng-hui of
Taiwan and the Falun Gong evil cult organization.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, remarkable achievements were attained in
China's reform, opening and economic development in spite of the
fairly complicated domestic and international environment. The
state revenue was on the rise, the livelihood of the Chinese
people continued to improve, stability was maintained in China's
political situation, all ethnic groups were harmonious, and China'
s international standing was upgraded further, the message says.
</P>
<P>
And the coming year of 2000, the last year of the current
century, which serves as a vital link between the past and the
future, is still faced with the arduous task of carrying out
reform and development and stability.
</P>
<P>
The message urges the entire Chinese people to keep in high
spirits, be full of vitality for further enhancing the nation's
economic strength, defense capabilities and national cohesion, so
as to comprehensively advance the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Developing the economy and improving national strength calls
for a united, stable domestic environment as well as a sound
international environment favorable to China's stability and
development, the message adds.
</P>
<P>
Noting that stability is an overall, overwhelming issue, the
message stresses that nothing can be done without the attainment
of stability, and people should value all the more this good
situation and seize the opportunity to do China's things well.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the message notes, peace and development
remain the themes of our time, and the world's polarization
continues to develop, and major progress has been made in China's
foreign affairs work.
</P>
<P>
Mankind has scored amazing successes in the past two millennia.
The Chinese nation, with one-fifth of the world's population, will
shoulder still greater responsibilities for creating a bright
future for the world, the message says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a leading Chinese ideological journal, "Seeking
Truth", has also published a New Year's editorial titled "Striding
Proudly Ahead into the New Century."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nation to Realize Rejuvenation: Jiang Zemin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that the Chinese nation will be rejuvenated in the
new century due to the motherland's complete reunification and the
establishment of a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally
advanced and modern socialist country.
</P>
<P>
During a mid-night gala marking the coming new century and
millennium, Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, said that the Chinese people will unshakably
proceed along the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics; China's socialist system will be consolidated and
perfected through continuous reforms; and its development will
lead to national prosperity through the common advancement in all
regions.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the past millennium, the world acknowledged
glorious Chinese civilization developed several thousand years ago,
and China maintained its prominent position in the world until the
15th century.
</P>
<P>
Due to the slow growth of productive forces and social and
political decadence, China gradually fell behind other nations,
and as a result it fell into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal
society up to the modern times, suffering the bullying and
humiliation of world powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Chinese people did not yield but waged an
arduous struggle for generations. The CPC, represented by Comrade
Mao Zedong and combining the basic Marxist principles with the
real conditions in China, led the Chinese people in a great
revolution and established new China in the middle of this century.
China has since entered a new epoch of socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the Chinese people are making giant leaps toward
modernization along the road of reform and opening-up pioneered by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indian Prime Minister Defends Release of Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Friday night defended the release of three
militants in exchange for 155 passengers, hold as hostages aboard
a hijacked Indian plane.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message broadcast over the official Doordarshan
television, Vajpayee said his government was able to "
substantially scale down" the demand" of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
"The hijackers had demanded the release of 36 terrorists. We
were able to substantially scale down their demand," Vajpayee said,
adding that India's first resolution for the new century would be
to join hands across the country to rid the world of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the hijackers, the prime minister said, the
government was guided by two concerns: the safety of the
passengers and the crew, and the long-term, overall interests of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the hijacking, "diabolic and evil as it is", is
but the latest manifestation of terrorism, Vajpayee said "India
shall not spare any effort to thwart the phenomenon of terrorism
itself."
</P>
<P>
Describing terrorism as "crime against humanity", he said time
had come for the world to "confront this evil, to act in concert
and crush it."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee described the solution of the hijack crisis as an
occasion for cheer and joy and "doubly so because the ordeal of
our sisters and brothers, of the little children, held hostage by
the hijackers is nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
155 Passengers of the hijacked Indian jet have left for home
Friday evening from Kandhar aboard a special Indian plane.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day ordeal of the 155 passengers and crew of the
hijacked Indian plane came to a dramatic end minutes after the
External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh landed at Kandahar airport
in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Along with terrorism, the Indian leader told the nation, the
twin of poverty and illiteracy has to be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
He appealed the country to "seize the opportunities of the
coming era to emerge as a mighty nation whose strength shall lie
in her achievements."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australians Greet New Millennium in  Spectacular Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Australians greeted 2000 in
spectacular style with nearly a million people cramming Sydney's
harbor-side for the biggest new year's bash in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
On the stroke of the new millennium in Sydney, the crowd looked
skyward as a breathtaking pyrotechnic mass burst high into the
night along the city's iconic harbor bridge.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks exploded up to 1,000 meters and cascaded from the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
Multi-coloured star-bursts, showers of fire and waterfalls of
light accompanied a soundtrack from the last thousand years as
Sydney said goodbye at once to an old year, decade, century and
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Innumerable camera flashes answered back from an estimated 900,
000 revellers who staked out prime positions up to 48 hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Partying at the harbor, British tourist Danny Anderson, 26,
spoke for many.
</P>
<P>
"It's been absolutely fantastic," he said. "I can't deny that
Sydney is the best place on earth to be tonight."
</P>
<P>
Billed as the largest such display ever seen in Australia, the
6-million-Australian dollar (3.96 million U.S. dollars)
spectacular burned through 20 tonnes of fireworks in just under 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
At its close, the single word "Eternity" lit up on the eastern
side of the harbor bridge.
</P>
<P>
The harbor itself was packed with an estimated 6,000 spectator
craft ranging from luxury yachts and cruisers to dingies and
canoes.
</P>
<P>
A procession of giant illuminated lanterns in the shape of sea
creatures moved up and down the waterway before gathering in front
of the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
The weather, though blustery, remained dry for the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the fireworks, the bells of St Marys and St
Andrew's cathedrals tolled for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services reported no major incidents to midnight:
police said there had been no arrests and the ambulance service
reported 350 minor incidents.
</P>
<P>
In Canberra, the celebrations at the bank of the Lake Burley
Griffin were highlighted by fireworks show mid-night when
revellers waved and sang songs.
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne, thousands of revellers gathered to watch an array
of entertainers ahead of the midnight crackers.
</P>
<P>
However, the river parade did not quite live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that people are having a go. It may not be
the best procession ever but people are having a go and enjoying
themselves. It's fantastic," Steve Bracks, premier of the Victoria
state, said.
</P>
<P>
Bracks put the numbers of party-goers on the river precinct at
500,000 although Victoria police were not quite as enthusiastic,
saying there were about 30,000 at 10 p.m. and growing.
</P>
<P>
In Brisbane, police and ambulance officers were amazed at how
quiet the evening had been, with no incidents reported state-wide.
</P>
<P>
Brisbane police were even asking whether new year's eve had
been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Crowds in the city were described as not much bigger than a
normal Friday night.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50,000 people flocked to Brisbane's South Bank.
</P>
<P>
In Perth, new year's celebrations were muted after a severe
bush fire ravished homes in the Hills district of the city.
</P>
<P>
Several houses were destroyed and 60 residents evacuated before
the flames were brought under control.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Resignation Seen As Move to Boost Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and
many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, announced by Yeltsin over the national
television, also sent the Russian stock market soaring and the
ruble, the national currency, stumbled against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made up his mind to step down Thursday night and
skipped the state dinner in the Kremlin to consider the move, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
His resignation is expected to further boost the approval rate
of Putin, who has seen his popularity skyrocketing over the past
few months amid a federal military campaign against rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has already transferred the so-called nuclear button
briefcase to Putin, government spokesman Mikhail Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
The transfer is a constitutional procedure, as following
resignation Yeltsin ceased to be the commander-in-chief of the
Russian armed forces. These functions will now be performed by
Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin, Yeltsin's appointed successor, has announced that he
would participate in the next presidential race, now moved to
March with Yeltsin's succession.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, a new presidential election
must be held within 90 days following the early resignation of a
sitting president.
</P>
<P>
"Having resigned, Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) gives Putin an
absolutely real chance to become the future Russian president,"
said Boris Nemsov, leader of the pro-Kremlin Union of Right-Wing
Forces.
</P>
<P>
"Yeltsin has left as impressively as he came. This was done
not only impressively but also with fine timing: after the
parliamentary elections and before the New Year," Nemtsov said.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government election blocs made a strong showing in the
contest for the 450 seats in the State Duma (lower house of
parliament) on December 19, a result also seen as a plus to
Putin's bid to run for president.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, also expressed the
belief that Yeltsin's resignation will pave the way for Putin's
race into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"There are three months until the elections and I do not see
any serious opponents to Putin," Interfax quoted Stepashin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin left the Kremlin at 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT) and
went for his country residence in Gorky-9 near Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Wins High Praise From Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair praised departing Russian President Boris Yeltsin for his
reinforced reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Blair hailed Yeltsin as a leader who had reinforced reform in
Russia and also expressed his wish to working with Vladimir Putin
who is now Russia's acting president.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe Yeltsin's resignation
appeared timed to capitalize on the success of pro-Kremlin,
centrist parties in recent parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"Parties backing Putin scored unexpectedly well, adding to the
drive to put him into the Kremlin as Yeltsin's successor," one of
the observers said.

<HEADLINE> Text of Yeltsin's Resignation Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced his resignation Friday in a televised address to the
nation. He handed his powers to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who
is serving as the acting president.
</P>
<P>
The following is the abridged text of Yeltsin's address:
</P>
<P>
Dear friends,
</P>
<P>
I address my New Year greeting to you for the last time today.
I address you for the last time as the Russian President today.
</P>
<P>
I have made a decision.
</P>
<P>
I have been long and hard thinking about this decision. Today,
on the last day of the outgoing year, I resign.
</P>
<P>
I am leaving before my term in office is over. I realize that I
must do this. Russia should enter the new millennium with new
politicians, new people -- clever, energetic and strong, while we,
who have been in power for many years, should rather go.
</P>
<P>
When I saw how much hope and faith was pinned on a new
generation of politicians in the elections to the State Duma, I
realized that I have fulfilled the main task of my life. Russia
will never go back to the past. Russia will always move forward
now.
</P>
<P>
I should not be in the way of the natural course of history.
What's the point of holding on to power when the country has a
strong man worthy to be president and on whom practically every
citizen of Russia pins his hopes for the future now. Why should I
be in his way? Why should I wait for another six months? It is not
for me. It is not my character.
</P>
<P>
Today, which is a very important day for me, I want to
apologize.
</P>
<P>
I apologize because our dreams have not come true; I apologize
because I have not lived up to the expectations of those who
believed that by a single push, by a single leap....
</P>
<P>
However, things have not worked by a single push. I seemed to
be naive while problems proved to be much more difficult. We had
been going forward through mistakes and failures. Many people have
experienced shock during this time.
</P>
<P>
I have never said this before, but I want to say now that the
pain experienced by each of you turned into pain in my own heart.
I spent sleepless nights tortured by thoughts of what should be
done to help people live better.
</P>
<P>
I am leaving. I have done all I could. I am leaving not for
health reasons, but because of the knot of problems. A new
generation is coming to replace me. The generation of those who
can do much more and do it better.
</P>
<P>
Saying good-bye, I want to wish happiness to everyone.
</P>
<P>
Happy New Year and welcome to the next century.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China's tax revenue hit an all-
time record high of 1,031.1 billion yuan (124.7 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999, the State Administration of Taxation announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the country's tax bureaus showed that the tax
revenue increased 121.9 billion yuan, or 13.4 percent, over that
of last year, well exceeding the 100 billion yuan target set by
the State Council for the year.
</P>
<P>
This is the seventh year that China's tax revenue has witnessed
rapid growth, with an average yearly increase of 100 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the year's revenue, the domestic consumption tax and value
added tax reached 484.6 billion yuan, up 29 billion yuan or 6.4
percent over that of last year, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tax rebates for exports of enterprises increased
42.4 percent to 62.2 billion yuan this year, which played a big
role in the pick-up of the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the administration attributed the increase of
the tax revenue to the leadership of the central government, the
support of governments at all levels and the healthy development
of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Tax bureaus across the country also contributed to the
achievement, the officials noted.

<HEADLINE> ARATS President Reiterates Reunification Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, the president of
the Association for Relations Across Taiwan Straits (ARATS), on
the eve of the new century reiterated his hope for final
reunification of Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
In an article carried in the January issue of the monthly "
Cross-Straits Relations," Wang expressed his wish as well as New
Year's greetings to the Taiwan people, who suffered a devastating
earthquake last September.
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the past century, the article said the Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have endured a wide
range of hardships to achieve the nation's independence and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
But despite the remarkable prosperity and great progress
achieved by the Chinese people, Wang said the painful reality of
the separation is "a regret of the century."
</P>
<P>
The article urged the people on both sides to seriously
consider, at the dawn of the new century, making a choice between
separation and reunification, saying it is critical to the
fundamental interests of the whole Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The effort to discuss the matter of peaceful reunification and
"one country, two systems" with Taiwan was cut short by the "two
states" remark made by Lee Teng-hui last July, even though Wang
was prepared for the visit to Taiwan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Still, I hope my wish to visit Taiwan will be fulfilled at
early time after the barriers are cleared away," Wang said, adding
that the foundation of the reunification has been laid as a result
of well-developed non-governmental exchanges and increasing
economic cooperation and cultural understanding.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believes that the Taiwan compatriots can
contribute to pushing forward the relations across the Straits for
the sake of the Chinese nation, even though difficulties still
exist.
</P>
<P>
"Ten days ago, Macao, which has been separated from the
motherland for some 400 years, returned. Now the Chinese people
all over the world are looking forward to the early peaceful
reunification of the two sides of Taiwan Straits," the article
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The China Coal Import and
Export Group Corporation is reported to have exported 31 million
tons of coal through December 30, a record of 1.75 million tons
more than last year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the international coal price has steadily
dropped, discouraging most export coal manufacturers. Playing a
major role in China's coal export, the Import and Export Group
Corporation has taken measures to cut commission fees to 1.5 per
cent and tried to improve general service, thus helping the
producers getting an extra 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 93 percent of the coal exports are
produced in State-owned enterprises (SOE). Exporting has proved
effective in lifting coal SOEs out of difficulty.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Hijacking Drama Closes as Hijackers  Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The eight-day-long hijacking
drama involving an Indian airliner drew to a close Friday
afternoon as the hijackers released the hostages and surrendered
to the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking ended after an agreement was reached between the
Indian government and the hijackers on the release of the hostages
in exchange for three jailed Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
The five hijackers were seen to have left the plane, which had
been stranded at the Kandahar airport in Afghanistan over the past
week with more than 150 passengers and crew on board, sources from
Kandahar said.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Coordinator for Afghanistan Eric de Mul, who has
been involved in the negotiations, confirmed that under the
agreement ending the hijacking all three prisoners released by
India and the five hijackers had been handed to the Taliban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The three militants had arrived in Kandahar earlier Friday
along with Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
The eight were initially driven from the Kandahar airport. Mul
said that further moves were now in the hands of the Taliban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hostages were seen beginning to alight from the
plane which had been their prison since it was hijacked last
Friday during a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials said the hostages will be flown to New Delhi
from Kandahar "very shortly."
</P>
<P>
The somewhat peaceful solution to the crisis was a result of
protracted negotiations between an Indian team, the Taliban, the
United Nations and the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The Indian negotiating team arrived in Kandahar on Monday, the
third day after the plane landed there, when the hijackers
demanded the handover of the remains of a slain Muslim leader, the
release of 36 Muslim militants plus a 200 million U.S. dollar
ransom.
</P>
<P>
After five days of haggling, the hijackers agreed to exchange
the hostages for the release of three militants.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane had earlier landed at the Lahore Airport,
Pakistan, and a military base in Dubai. The hijackers shot dead
one passenger on board and had released 27 hostages at Dubai and
two at Kandahar.

<HEADLINE> New Peace Symbol Unveiled in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A new symbol of peace: a
more than 3-ton gun with a knot in the barrel was unveiled Friday
in the park near the Cambodian-Japanese Friendship Bridge.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, deputy prime minister and minister of interior, and
the city Governor Chea Sophara presided over the ceremony. Also at
present were some diplomats and the officials from non-government
organizations. More than 2,000 people also took part in the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This event is of great historical significance of the capital
of Phnom Penh, the political, economic and cultural seat of the
kingdom of Cambodia, and it can mark the end of the armed violence
and the end of the old year 1999, of the old century, the 20th,
and of the old millennium as well," Sar Kheng said.
</P>
<P>
"The twisted barrel gun will serve as a token of the Royal
government's new thinking and Cambodians' aspiration: we no longer
need weapons and make war. We need peace and safety only," added
Sar Kheng.
</P>
<P>
The "twisted barrel gun" was made of metal pieces of more than
4,000 confiscated weapons destroyed on May 5, 1999, the day
marking the destruction of weapons at the national stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We are stepping into the new millennium with proud. We have
enough time to develop our municipality and our country to catch
up with other developing countries," said Chea Sophara.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, some 2,000 people held a parade from the
bridge to Wat Phnom with holding a 2,000 metre-long "Karama" which
marks the new century and new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony is a part of the cerebration held in Phnom Penh to
usher the new millennium which will also feature fireworks, light
and sound show and dancing until dawn.

<HEADLINE> Japan Ships Back Wastes From Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Friday
completed the removal of the entire wastes from the Philippines by
shipping them back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The shipment was conducted much earlier than the deadline of
January 11, 2000, set by the governments of Japan and the
Philippines, the Japan Information and Cultural Center said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, more than 2,000 tons of municipal and household
garbage, including syringes, adult diapers and sanitary napkins,
arrived in Manila from Japan in about 100 containers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has been making public its readiness to
cooperate with the Philippines on the waste issue and to fulfill
its obligation under the Basel Convention on the Transboundary
Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Its Disposal.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, Japan sent a fact-finding mission to Manila,
which also conducted on-site surveys and investigations at the
port of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The two governments later decided to accelerate the procedure
for the waste removal in keeping with the Basel Convention.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to establish a bilateral working group to
prevent a recurrence of such incidents through various efforts,
including the review of the export/import procedures of the two
countries under the Convention.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian King's 2000 New Year Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Yang di-
Pertuan Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Friday called on the people
to resolve to cooperate with the government and help it implement
all its policies and plans to ensure that Malaysia enters the new
millennium with resounding success.
</P>
<P>
The supreme head of state also urged all civil servants to work
harder to ensure success in developing the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the new strategies to modernize the civil service
can be implemented so that it can achieve world standing in the
new millennium," he said in his 2000 New Year message released by
Istana Negara (State Palace) here.
</P>
<P>
The King said all Malaysians must be able to mould their
country's future according to their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia must chart its own destiny and implement policies and
strategies that could put its economy on track for success for the
wealth of the nation and its people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The advent of the year 2000 brings with it challenges to the
country's development and the first day itself already poses a
challenge with the Y2K problem, he said, however he was confident
that with wisdom, effort and preparation, the country could
overcome the Y2K problem without affecting the people and the
administration of the country.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 would spur further economic development until
2020 to realize the country's vision to achieve developed nation
status, he said, adding the country's wealth depended very much on
political and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability will serve as a catalyst and draw new
investments from both within and outside the country. These
investments will be able to help raise Malaysia's economic
performance in the long run," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the reverse would happen if the people did not
think of the consequences to the economy if they always fought
over politics.
</P>
<P>
The King wished all Malaysians a Happy New Year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Reminds People of Challenges of New  Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Friday night that the people could rejoice
in welcoming the new century and millennium but they must beware
of the dangers of globalization that come with it.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear is that we are unprepared for the challenges of
the new millennium. We, especially the Malays, have the same old
habits and culture that caused us to be colonized for four-and-a-
half centuries," Mahathir said in his 2000 New Year message over
Radio Television Malaysia (RTM).
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to learn from the lessons of history
which require them to close ranks and be disciplined to face
attempts to recolonize the nation in the new millennium through
the globalization system of the west.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had been colonized before because its people
were indiscplined, because of a jostle for places and power, and
now it would appear that the people had forgotten the lessons of
history.
</P>
<P>
"But the former colonial masters have plans to recolonize us.
This time a different method will be used to conquer our country.
This method is introduced as globalizations and a borderless world,
" Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said they would control the economies of weak nations, own
banks and businesses and support free capital flow with the excuse
that poverty could be eradicated this way.
</P>
<P>
"What's strange is that while the free flow of capital
transcends borders, humans cannot. The poor will be imprisoned
without their own borders so as not to tarnish the rich nations.
</P>
<P>
"This is a borderless world, this is globalization. The rich
will become richer and the poor will work to enrich the wealthy.
Of course the poor nations are also free to penetrate the rich
markets but what do they have to sell in the rich markets that
have yet to be taken over by the giant investors from the wealthy
nations?" Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir held that the economic crisis in Malaysia and other
East Asian countries in July 1997 was a result of globalization
and was something real and not a forecast or fiction of the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
"They tried and nearly succeed but we were able to foil the
attempt this time and we were able to revive our country's economy.
But we are not safe yet. Attempts are still being made. If not for
the demonstrations against the WTO (World Trade Organization) in
Seattle (recently), maybe another part of our border will have
collapsed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians of various races had decided that the
country would continue to have a credible government that could
face the challenges of the new millennium but the seeds of
disunity had been sown among the people and were spreading.
</P>
<P>
"When the government is concentrating on defending the nation
from external attacks, that's the best time to stab it in the back,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must be careful, close our ranks and set aside difference
that could split us as well as face the coming challenges with
fortitude and resilience," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said history had shown that careful planning, a responsible
leadership, discipline, and training are needed for a struggle to
succeed and these could be inculcated in the local culture.

<HEADLINE> Australia Enters New Millennium in Good Shape: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia is entering the new
millennium with a strong economy and with great cause for hope and
optimism, Prime Minister John Howard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his message for the new millennium, Howard described
Australia as a peaceful, stable and cohesive society.
</P>
<P>
"Australia goes into the new century with an economy stronger
than it has been for decades. Unemployment is falling, growth is
very robust, inflation and interest rates are at their lowest for
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economy would be made even stronger by the introduction of
the new tax system on July 1 and this will deliver a 12-billion-
Australian dollar (7.92 billion U.S. dollars) tax cut to
Australians, the biggest ever, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the whole world will catch a glimpse of the
friendly Australian way when the country hosts the Olympic Games
next year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Australians should remember those who were
not doing as well, including Aboriginal people and those in rural
and regional Australia who had been hurt by the process of
economic change.
</P>
<P>
"As we reflect on the opportunities which the future holds for
Australia, we should remember those Australians and those parts of
Australia which are not doing as well as the rest," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Strong though Australia's economy may be, by far the greatest
asset we take into the new century is our spirit as a people," he
said in his message.
</P>
<P>
"It is from that spirit that we derive the sense of mateship
displayed to each other in times of crisis and natural disaster.
It is that spirit which has moulded our practical 'can do'
approach to the problems and challenges we encounter as a nation,"
Howard added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe Vows to Revive Economy in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is determined to
revive its economy in the new year after it has gone through the
most difficult year since its independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Due to negative impacts by both internal and external factors,
the past year witnessed an all-round economic downturn in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product (GDP) for 1999 is predicted to fall
0.2 percent compared with that of the previous year while the
average inflation rate in the first 10 months of the year moved up
to 58 percent, which is double the figure for the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is around 7.5 percent of GDP for 1999 as
against the figure of 6.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the interest rates climbing up over 60 percent,
Zimbabweans can hardly get loans from banks to invest in their
industrial and commercial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the adverse conditions in the world economy has also
constrained the potential growth of its economy. Depressed
international prices for most of its export commodities had an
adverse impact on balance of payment.
</P>
<P>
As a result of economic downturn, about 62 percent of the
population is considered poor and 45 percent is defined as very
poor. The unemployment rate has raised to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite hardships and economic difficulties, the Zimbabwean
government has time and again showed its strong determination to
reverse the economy which is believed not to collapse as some
foreigners' predictions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament a week ago, President Robert Mugabe
stressed that agriculture still retained its position as the major
contributor to economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
At the just closed third National Congress of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, the president
reaffirmed his government's land policy.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the government has pledged to provide more
funds for the land reform and resettlement program in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Now it is moving into top gear in the implementation of the
program to redistribute land, which has been set as one of the two
major tasks of the country next year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has also set indigenization of the
economy as another main task due to the country's poor performance
in its exports despite the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar
by about 50 percent since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to boost production, improve exports and
stimulate its own industries by raising purchasing power of the
nationals.
</P>
<P>
The government has established the National Investment Trust of
Zimbabwe whose principal aim is to warehouse shares that can then
be purchased by the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
In order to enable its economy to meet the required targets so
as to attract more foreign investment, the government has decided
to quicken its pace in the privatization of state enterprises,
which also offers fresh opportunities for the participation of the
indigenous people in the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government continues to urge large local and
foreign corporations to go into partnership wited the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe, central bank of the country, to reduce the current
punitive high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
As Mugabe has mentioned that the current economic downturn, job
creation, poverty alleviation and the HIV/AIDS pandemic constitute
 major challenges facing Zimbabwe in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) war also aggregated its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Zimbabwe sent 11,000 troops to the Congo
and treasury was spending in excess of three million dollars a
month since August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has pledged to withdraw his troops from the DRC once the
 timetable for the pullout of foreign troops is set.
</P>
<P>
With his full confidence in future, Mugabe has assured the
nation that the economy would revive next year so long as the
Zimbabwean people unite closely and work hard for social and
economic development.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Friday
called the resignation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin dramatic
but not a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
Before dawn, President Bill Clinton was notified about
Yeltsin's resignation by Sandy Berger, his assistant for national
security affairs.
</P>
<P>
After Yeltsin's resignation was confirmed in contacts with
Russian officials, White House spokesman James Fallin said "we
consider this a dramatic step." "While there is an element of
surprise it was not a complete one," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fallin cited numerous speculative reports in the Russian press
for several months about the 68-year-old Yeltsin's health problems.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who will act as acting president
before the elections, is known to U.S. officials as a businesslike
professional.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Yelstin, Hopes to Work With Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
responding to the dramatic resignation of Boris Yeltsin, Friday
praised the Russian leader for working "together to advance common
interests" with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a statement that his succession by Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin is evidence of Yeltsin's constitutional
achievements.
</P>
<P>
"We have had our differences, such as on Chechnya, but the
starting point of President Yeltsin and I has always been how
Russia and the United States could work together to advance common
interests," Clinton said, while extending his and Hillary Rodham
Clinton's warmest wishes to Yeltsin and his family.
</P>
<P>
He cited as "genuine progress" the dismantling of thousands of
U.S. and Russian long-range nuclear weapons and Russian
peacekeeping troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"In this spirit, I look forward to working with Acting
President Putin as the Russian people begin this process of making
the transition from one democratically elected president to the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House called Yeltsin's resignation as
dramatic, but not a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, all questions on the impact of Yeltsin's
resignation were being referred to the White House and the State
Department. Spokeswoman Susan Hansen said U.S.-Russian military
cooperation was not expected to be affected, citing the latest
example as the U.S. and Russian teams of nuclear experts sitting
side by side in Colorado Springs Friday to ensure that the year
doesn't end with an accidental nuclear launch because of the Y2K
bug.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Party Leader Meets with Chinese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Le Kha Phieu, general secretary
of the Communist Party of Vietnam, met with Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tang conveyed the warm regards from General
Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin to the
Vietnamese party leader.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China and Vietnam had just experienced an important
moment in the history of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Land Border between China and Vietnam was finally
officially signed in Hanoi on Thursday after more than 20 years of
negotiations, he said, stressing that it was a delightful event in
the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the land border issues is, first and foremost,
attributed to the vision of and effective guidance given by the
leaders of the two countries, particularly the general secretaries
of the two parties, who had pointed out the orientation and given
the motive force for the negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the treaty, the two countries will bring
peace, friendship and stability along their land border into the
21st century, which will not only benefit the two countries'
people and their coming generations, but will also be important
for promoting the relations between the two parties and two
countries and comprehensive bilateral cooperation in various
fields, as well as for peace and stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The hard-won successes in the land border negotiations will
serve as a model for the two countries to resolve their remaining
issues left over from history.
</P>
<P>
Facts, he said, have once again shown to the world that China
and Vietnam are fully capable of properly resolving issues left
over from history through friendly consultations.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vietnamese Party leader Phieu described the
signing of the Vietnam-China Land Border Treaty as of great
significance in the friendly cooperative ties between the two
countries that have been built on the basis of mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
He added that the signing of the treaty was made possible
thanks to the great efforts made by both sides and it represented
another firm step forward in promoting good-neighborliness and
friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It will make positive impacts on regional peace and stability
as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted the very fine development of the relations between
the two parties and countries.
</P>
<P>
Regular contacts between the two countries' leaders have
enhanced mutual trust and strengthened the solidarity between
China and Vietnam, giving important guidance to the further
development of the relations between the two parties and countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As mankind will usher in a new millennium in a few hours, "we
cherish all the more dearly the hard-won peaceful environment and
the traditional friendship between the two parties, two countries
and two peoples," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his strong belief in the still better relations
between China and Vietnam in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Party leader Phieu said the most important thing in
the Vietnam-China relations is that the two countries' top leaders
have agreed on complete closure of the past and building of a
future of friendship and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Vietnam's policy of developing the good-
neighborliness and friendly cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of cooperation between Vietnam and China shown by
both sides in the land border negotiations would vigorously help
boost the development of the bilateral ties in various fields, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on the experience in the negotiations, Vietnam and
China should resolve the remaining bilateral issues left over by
history at an early date, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Phieu and Tang also exchanged views on regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Phieu asked the Chinese foreign minister to convey his best
wishes to General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other Chinese party
and state leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Tang also met with Vietnamese State
President Tran Duc Luong.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, delivered his Millennium Address to the Hong Kong people on
Friday, wishing Hong Kong continuing success and his country a
prosperous and bright future.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the threshold of a new century and a new millennium.
A deeper insight of the past will enable us to be better equipped
to take on the future and to challenge what lies ahead," said Tung.
</P>
<P>
He said: "On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong returned to China and
commenced implementation of the novel and unique concept of 'one
country, two systems.' The progress we have made in the last two
and a half years is a testimony to the ability of Hong Kong people
to withstand unprecedented difficulties and challenges. We have
maintained social stability, the rule of law and Hong Kong's
lifestyle. We have turned the concept of 'one country, two systems
' into reality."
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the Asian financial turmoil, they were
pleased to see that Hong Kong was recovering, the market was
picking up and job opportunities were increasing.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the situation will continue to improve, "
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
A new era with remarkable and dynamic technological development
was unfolding, he noted. Technological advances would change
fundamentally the manner in which the world competes. For any
country, region or individual, the only way to maintain
competitive edge in the long run was to acquire knowledge.

<P>
To maintain Hong Kong's position as a leading cosmopolitan city
in the new millennium, he said, the SAR Government would continue
to make substantial investments in education, innovation and
technology, as well as infrastructural developments, so as to make
Hong Kong more competitive and to achieve its vision.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said: "In the last 1,000 years, the human race has
undergone remarkable changes. But some fundamental values, like
filial piety, mutual respect and the quest for knowledge will
endure and will last. It is my earnest hope that all of us will
continue to cherish these values to build a more united, coherent
and harmonious community, so that Hong Kong can scale new heights.
"
</P>
<P>
"As we look forward, we must keep in our vision the development
of the whole country. At the 50th Anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China, our motherland displayed her
remarkable achievements in industry, agriculture, education and
national defense. A few weeks ago, the "Shenzhou" spacecraft was
launched successfully into outer space. China is likely to join
the World Trade Organization soon. All these developments
demonstrate that our country is thriving and that the Chinese
people are making steady progress on all fronts," Tung added.
</P>
<P>
Tung went on say that "following Hong Kong's return to China,
we are forging ever closer ties with the mainland. Hong Kong will
benefit immensely from this unparalleled relationship with the
mainland and its vigorous development. This will help Hong Kong
create more wealth and achieve even greater success."
</P>
<P>
He said: "While we are awaiting the dawning of the new
millennium, let us admire the glittering lights of our remarkable
city. I deeply appreciate that it is my responsibility to lead the
Special Administrative Regional Government to improve our service
to the community and to express our care and concern for every
citizen and every family of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, I hope that children will express their
gratitude for the care, upbringing and the many sacrifices which
parents have made," Tung said. At this moment, I know that parents
would wish the very best for their children that they may have
unlimited opportunities in the new millennium."

international support for the Palestinians to "liberate" Jerusalem
from the Israeli occupation.

CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of the
New Year's Eve revelers packed every vantage point along Sydney
Harbor for Australia's biggest millennium party Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations in Sydney began on schedule at 9 p.m. with a 10-
minute fireworks displaying in cool and blustery conditions.
</P>
<P>
Barges east and west of the harbor bridge gave revelers a taste
of the massive display scheduled for the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
Several areas along northern and southern shores of the harbor
were closed earlier in the evening due to overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 6,000 boats carrying party goers crowded the
harbor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore will Speed Up Building-Up 3rd Generation Leadership: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Friday stated his government will speed up building up
third generation leadership which is essential to turn Singapore
into a first-world economy and world-class home.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the statement in his new year message titled "Into The
Millennium With Confidence" where he reviewed major challenges
Singapore has experienced since its independence, briefed up the
current economic recovery in Singapore as well as the region,
offered a brighter prospect for year 2000 and highlighted what is
essential to achieving Singapore 21 vision.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore's vision to become a first-world economy
and world-class home is a great challenge in the new millennium,
noting competing with developed economies in knowledge sectors is
different ball game altogether just as medals will be much harder
to win in the Olympics than in Southeast Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Billing leadership as a vital factor to sustain Singapore's
success, the prime minister said Singapore is fortunate to have
had good leadership in its first years of independence and a
second generation of leaders in guiding the country through the
recent regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We now have to identify new talent and build up the third
generation leadership," he said, adding "we already have the
beginning of this generation team."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that an honest and capable team at the helm is the
best guarantee that Singapore will continue to thrive in the new
millennium, the prime minister laid emphasis on the need "to
assemble, test out and train a full team as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
He also called Singaporeans to strengthen their roots and hold
together as a nation, saying "we cannot afford to become
deculturalized Our cultures and heritages are an important part of
our Singapore identity."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore needs to be a cohesive society and not just so many
individuals who can feel at home anywhere in the world," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Resigns, Hands Power to Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
stepped down Friday and handed his power to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin in a move that is expected to boost the premier's
chance in winning the race for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation has been rumored many times earlier this
year, but the timing of the move came as a surprise to many
Russians preparing to enter a new year.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Yeltsin, whose second term as the head of state
expires next June, told the nation in a televised address that he
would not "be clinging to power for another six months."
</P>
<P>
"Following a long and painful consideration I have taken a
decision. Today, on the last day of the outgoing century, I am
resigning," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard it said many times that Yeltsin will do
everything possible to remain in power and that he will never
surrender power to anyone," Yeltsin said. "All this is a lie."
</P>
<P>
He apologized to the Russians for failing to justify their
hopes.
</P>
<P>
The next presidential elections, originally scheduled for June,
will be held on March 27 instead, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian constitution, presidential elections should be
held within three months after the resignation of a sitting
president.
</P>
<P>
The offensive was launched in September following armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of apartment
building explosions that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, born in Sverdlovsky (now Yekaterinburg) in 1931,
became the first popularly elected president of Russia in 1991. He
was reelected in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
His early resignation is believed to be further boosting
Putin's chance of entering the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin took office as premier last August, when Yeltsin
described him as his preferred successor.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has canceled his trip to St. Petersburg,
where he had planned to spend the New Year's eve, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin is by far the most popular politician in post-Soviet
Russia. His rate of popularity has skyrocketed amid a federal
military campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya
</P>
<P>
The news of Yeltsin's early step-down sent share prices soaring
in the Russian stock market, and the RTS-Interfax has shot up
seven percent to 176.9 during the last 10 minutes of trading,
Interfax reported.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
stepped down Friday and handed his powers to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, his preferred successor who enjoys enormous
popularity among the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The resignation, although rumored for quite some time earlier
this year, came as a surprise as the world's largest country
prepares to enter the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation, announced in a televised address to the
nation, is expected to further boost Putin's chance of winning the
race into the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Born on February 1, 1931, in Sverdlovsk in central-western
Russia, Yeltsin received his college education at the Urals M.
Kirov Polytechnic Institute.
</P>

Writer Ke Ling, who was 91 years old this year, said he has
witnessed too many chaotic periods caused by repeated wars and
turmoils during his life time, so he can well appreciate and
understand how hard it was for China to have developed into today'
s prosperity and political stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is exciting to see China now full of auspicious signs and
with a stable political life, coupled with an economic takeoff and
social progress, and resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong in 1997 and over Macao ten days ago," said Ke, who
still writes essays.

<P>
Ninety-year-old Tan Jiazhen, a world-famous geneticist who just

has a quick mind.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the events of the past century, what impresses me most
are the earth-shaking changes that have occurred in the motherland
over the past two decades," said Tan, "the strategy of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the reform and opening-
up drive initiated by late leader Deng Xiaoping has made it
possible for China to attain economic development in a real sense.
"
</P>
<P>
Though now advanced in age, Tan said he would like to build a
still brighter future together with the younger generations.

arrival of the new century, and used to say he would be very happy
to enter the new century with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Su has used his personal savings to start a special math prize
for encouraging the development of promising younger, outstanding

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to form a
network of air flight routes covering the entire country by 2018,
an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
By then, China expects to have 1,618 aircraft, including 1,219
large-and medium-sized planes and 399 smaller craft.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the CAAC will schedule more
domestic flights in the next two decades for coastal, open areas,
western regions, and some central tourist destination cities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, flight networks will continue to expand with Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and other major cities at the core, and an
increasing number of flights among provincial capitals and major
tourist cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, regional flights will also be further improved in
the southeastern coastal, economically-developed areas as well as
central and western regions, where transport and traffic
conditions presently are not so satisfactory.

Externally, exports of goods staged a significant upturn,
driven by the sharp rebound in exports of China's mainland, a
general pick-up in demand in the East Asian economies and a broad
strengthening in import absorption in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Exports of services likewise accelerated in growth, along with
the regional economic recovery, and the combined visible and
invisible trade balance should have yielded a considerably larger
surplus in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending picked up further, in tandem with the
recovery in overall economic activity and with the stable
employment situation.
</P>
<P>
On investment spending, the decline in expenditure on machinery
and equipment tended to taper, while public sector building and
construction output bounced back to positive growth, thereby
providing a partial offset to the continued slack in private
sector building activity.
</P>
<P>
The labor market has generally held stable, and the seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate in the third quarter of 1999 stood at 6.
1 percent while the underemployment rate was 3.1 percent,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The stock market also consolidated in the third quarter, but
regained strength in the latter part of October upon improved
market sentiment, and rallied to new post-crisis highs in December
upon China's accord with the United States on its accession to the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should continue to benefit
from the revival of demand in East Asia, better economic
conditions in Europe, and sustained import absorption in the
United States.
</P>

The Asian financial crisis served as a wake-up call for the

Most Hong Kong company executives are anticipating better
earnings this year. A recent executive survey of business
confidence by Dresdner RCM Global Investors showed 74 percent of

upward, with most of those banking on a rise of about 5 percent
this year.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- With a prudent forecast of
GDP growth in 1999, Hong Kong has for the first time positioned
itself for a post-recession economic lift-off since the Asian
financial crisis, economists said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report on the economic forecast of Hong Kong in
2000, Sung Yun-wing, chairman of the Economic Department of the
Chinese University of Hong Kong, told a press conference that Hong
Kong's GDP growth rate in 1999 as a whole will be between 1.3
percent to 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department has maintained its econometric forecasting
program since 1979, and the forecasting model it created has since
1986 become a constituent model of the United Nations' on-going
large-scale research project linking together elaborate models on
a worldwide basis.
</P>
<P>
A brighter future for Hong Kong's economy in 2000 was predicted
by a group of senior economists of the department, with a GDP
growth rate of 5.4 percent for next year in a higher perspective
and 3.6 percent in a lower perspective.
</P>
<P>
Figures released in a recent report by the Census and
Statistics Department showed that Hong Kong's third-quarter real
GDP expanded by 4.5 percent year-on-year, surpassing market
expectations and forecast of 3 percent by domestic and overseas
economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
The recovery process of the Hong Kong economy has gathered
further momentum in the third quarter of 1999, and a crude initial
assessment suggests that the GDP should have attained a growth of
around 4.5 percent in real terms in the third quarter over a year
earlier, according to the government's third quarter economic
report.
</P>
<P>
Looking back upon Hong Kong's economic development as a whole,
Frank Leung, a local securities analyst, believed that the real
economic growth suggests that it is a genuine and sustainable
recovery rather than a bounce in year-on-year numbers solely as a
result of a low base in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The 1999 performance appears to be the beginning of a cyclical
upswing as prospects for 2000 also appear strong supported by a
higher rate of growth of world GDP and trade," said M.J. Quibria,
assistant chief economist of the Asian Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Raises Wages for Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil servants will
be awarded salary increases of between 69 and 90 percent next
month on a sliding scale, while 20,000 posts will be abolished to
make way for lean and efficient government service.
</P>
<P>
Acting Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister John
Nkomo said on Thursday that the government would save three
billion Zimbabwean dollars (78.9 million U.S. dollars) in salaries
and wages when holders of the 20,000 identified posts are retired
in a four-month exercise beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
Defending the hefty increases, he said it was an attempt to
cushion the civil servants from the harsh economic environment
being experienced in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The increases approved by the government have taken into
consideration the current rate of inflation, it is hoped the
increases will significantly improve the conditions of service in
the Zimbabwe Public Service as a whole, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The pay rise for civil servants comes just days after the
central bank warned that it would fuel inflation presently peaked
at 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Nkomo said the increases would not push up the rate of
 inflation if matched by raised productivity.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Closer Cooperation Between Egypt, World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has stressed the importance of enhancing Egypt's cooperation with
the other countries in the coming century when no single nation
would be able to develop on its own.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with the world countries is strong and it will
get stronger in the future," Mubarak said on Thursday in his end-
of-the-millennium statements to the editor-in-chief of Egypt's Al-
Gomhuria daily, Samir Ragab.
</P>
<P>
"The continued development of the relations is our main concern
(as) it is impossible for any country to work alone in the future,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak affirmed that Egypt's growing ties with the
world will not overshadow its traditional and historical relations
with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the domestic front, the Egyptian leader underlined
the importance of adapting more to sciences and technology to help
the country face the expected fierce competition in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The government is giving more attention to promote investments
in technology, science and information technology, "otherwise we
will lag far behind," Mubarak said, asserting that science and
technology hold the key to Egypt's progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have made so strenuous and great efforts over the past years
that we stand on solid ground and established our economy on strong
basis. It improves day after day and year after year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He voiced optimism about the future of the development in Egypt,
which he said "will be a country we all want it to be - a developed
nation" with people's living standard at high level.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Ankara Governor Yahya Gur has
declared that necessary precautions are being taken to ensure that
new year celebrations pass peacefully in the capital of Turkey,
Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Gur said measures, which will be
in force until January 3, 2000, have been taken on inter-city roads
and at airports, adding that police offices have been briefed on
how
to perform their duties by causing minimal disturbance to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The statement also contains a list of emergency telephone
numbers, covering security and police services, car accidents as
well as security-related problems in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara governor demanded that emergency departments at
hospitals will be working with extra staff.
</P>
<P>
Measures are also being taken at bus terminals in the capital.
Intra-city buses will be subjected to strict control and
unregistered
buses will not be allowed to use the roads.

but warned against New Year's Eve overload.
</P>
<P>
The company said Y2K is no longer a problem for it, adding
"emergency plans have been developed in case problems occur. During
the first three days of the new year, crisis centers will be in
charge to solve any problem."
</P>
<P>
But it said that it will not be responsible for overload due to
excessive demands for telecommunication during the period.

<HEADLINE> IVO Urges Prevention of Rabies in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chamber of Istanbul
Veterinarians (IVO) has appealed for the establishment of urgent
rehabilitation units to prevent rabies incidents, reported Turkish
Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
IVO Chairman Tahsin Yesildere revealed that the disease caused
the deaths of three people in the country's largest city of
Istanbul in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
He added that they have found rabies microbes in 75 percent of
the 280 dogs examined at the Pendik Veterinary Medicine Control
Research Center's Rabies Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of rabies cases in dogs was previously
50-55 percent and that the 25-30 percent increase this year merits
serious public attention.
</P>
<P>
Yesildere said that every year, in 80 countries worldwide, more
than 40,000 people die of rabies and four million people are
treated for rabies. In Turkey, every year 90,000 people apply to
clinics on suspicion of rabies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that that in England, Ireland and other EU states,
there is no rabies anywhere at all, adding that World Health
Organization (WHO) has not been informed of any death by European
countries for over 30-40 years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the dreadful disease has recently spread
to Izmir, the third largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
An Anatolia News Agency report quoted officials from the Health
Ministry as saying that wolves, foxes, bears and donkeys are all
potential sources of the deadly disease although dogs are by far
the most common carriers.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the spread of the disease in the
western Turkey has any connection with the earthquakes that hit the
same region in the last few months.

<HEADLINE> IDF in Lebanon Braces for More Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in
south Lebanon is bracing for possible more Hezbollah attacks over
the weekend, following Thursday's suicide bombing there, Israeli
security sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing in a residential quarter of Klea village, less than
two kilometers from Metulla, was the first suicide attack by
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in recent years, despite recent
hummanitarian gestures by Israel to the organization.
</P>
<P>
The bombing lightly wounded an IDF solider and hurt 12 Lebanese
civilians, including children, two of them serioursly, Israel Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
The attack was aimed at disrupting the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks due to resume Monday in the United States, and the IDF has
been bracing for such attacks due to the recent setbacks the
Hebollah suffered, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the IDF is satisfied that the suicide
bombing did not succeed in dealing a serious blow to the IDF.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing followed a series of recent positive
developments, including the 72-hour ceasefire last week in the
security zone that enabled the Hezbollah to recover five bodies of
the Hezbollah gunmen from the field, the return of two bodies of
Hezbollah killed inside the security zone earlier this month, and
the release of five Lebanese held in administrative detentions by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Thursday night called for an urgent meeting of the Grapes
of Wrath monitoring group in Lebanon over the wounding of innocent
civilians in the bombing.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Expects Better Economy in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla, who is
director general of the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA), said the Philippines remains on track in its
target to achieve a four percent growth in its Grss Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth was recorded at 2.6 percent as of the
first nine months of 1999, while the growth of the Gross National
Product (GNP) reached 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GNP includes the country's earnings from overseas sources,
such as the remittances of overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic growth will be sustained. Our forecast is that we
can achieve a GDP growth of four percent next year," Medalla said
in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Philippine President Joseph Estrada, Medalla
said the agriculture sector, which grew by 6.3 percent this year,
accounted primarily for the improvement of the economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Medalla noted that the lowest inflation rate was recorded in
November 1999 at 3.9 percent due to the improved agricultural
supply situation.
</P>

He said that over one million new jobs were created this year
with the agriculture sector generating some 691,000 of these jobs.
</P>
<P>
The NEDAchief also mentioned some other positive factors in the

finance, government services, health care, and manufacturing.

MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose second term as president expires next June, said
he would not "be clinging to power for another six months" and

Meanwhile, he also announced that the presidential elections

</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, presidential elections should
be held within three months after the resignation.

Yeltsin's early resignation is believed to be further boosting
Putin's chance of entering the Kremlin. Putin took office as
premier last August, when Yeltsin described him as his preferred
successor.

<P>
Putin has seen his popularity soaring amid a military campaign
against Chechen rebels.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Steps Down, Names Putin as Acting President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
announced his resignation Friday and named Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin as acting president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, whose second term as president expires next June, said
he would not "be clinging to power for another six months" and
that he would like to apologize to the Russian citizens for his
failure to justify their hopes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also announced that the presidential elections
would be held on March 27, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, presidential elections should
be held within three months after the resignation.
</P>
<P>
I will not "be clinging to power for another six months,"
Yeltsin told the nation in a televised New Year address.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said: " I am going. I am going earlier than my
established time." He added that Russia needs new political
leaders to lead it into the new century.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Yeltsin has signed presidential decrees on
his resignation, the nomination of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
as acting president, and the decision to hold presidential
elections on March 27.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's early resignation is believed to be further boosting
Putin's chance of entering the Kremlin. Putin took office as
premier last August, when Yeltsin described him as his preferred
successor.
</P>
<P>
Putin has seen his popularity soaring amid a military campaign
against Chechen rebels.

<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers:
</P>
<P>
AL-GOMHURIA:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that science and
technology will be Egypt's language in the new century, underlining
the necessity of making good use of them so as not to lag behind.
</P>
<P>
"We have made great efforts over the past years to stand on
solid ground," Mubarak said, adding "we have established our
economy on strong pillars. It is improving from day to day and from
year to year."
</P>
<P>
AL-AHRAM:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mahmoud Moussa received a
message from his Qatari counterpart Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin
Jabir al-Thani on Arab issues of mutual concern and the promotion
of the bilateral relationship in the various aspects.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Ambassador to Egypt and its Permanent Representative to
the Arab League forwarded the message to Deputy Assistant Foreign
Minister Ambassador Mohamed el Orabi at a meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
AL-AKHBAR:
</P>
<P>
-- The recovery operation of the wreckage of the ill-fated
EgyptAir plane, which crashed near U.S. east coast last October,

<HEADLINE> Ocalan's Retrial Appeal Rebuffed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- An appeal made by the imprisoned
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah
Ocalan, for retrial of his death sentence, was rejected Thursday by
Vural Savas, Chief Prosecutor of Appeals Court.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was condemned to death in June for treason and for
leading a 15-year anti-government guerrilla war, which resulted in
the deaths of 30,000 PKK members, soldiers and civilians, reported
the Anatolia News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Savas dismissed Thursday Ocalan's last-ditch appeal for a "
correction" of his sentence on the ground that there were no "legal
short falls or mistakes" warranting a "correction" of the death
sentence in the State Security Court (DGM) verdict.
</P>
<P>
"No deficiencies or omissions affecting the main ruling were
determined in the local court's verdict," he added.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was the last legal action prior to the death sentence
goes to Parliament and later to President Suleiman Demirel for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan's lawyer Ercan Kanar lodged the appeal last week, months
after an appeals court upheld Ocalan's death sentence for
treason. "We will not prepare our case for the European Court
of Human Rights," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers of the European Court have taken the case to the
court based in Strasbourg, France, asking Turkey not to execute
Ocalan until the court has reviewed the case, which could take up
two years.
</P>
<P>
However, Savas insisted that the government is not obliged to
abide by the European Court's ruling and can proceed with legal
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the issue has changed from a legal procedure to a
political problem under the background of Turkey's bid for a
candidacy status of the 15-member European Union, which strongly
stands against the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
It is widely held that the Turkish authorities will have to
comply in the end, now that Turkey was accepted by EU as a
candidate at its Helsinki summit earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Strengthen Employment Programs in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
strengthen its employment programs in the year 2000 and onwards,
Bienvenido Laguesma, secretary of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE), said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said in a report that important strides were made by
DOLE in 1999, especially in facilitating and enhancing employment,
which are crucial to economic recovery and progress.
</P>
<P>
He added an effort to firm up these gains and strengthen the
linkages with key sectors will be made next year in the fight
against poverty and joblessness, and also to enhance the country's
attractiveness to investments and jobs.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said assistance to some 53,038 workers displaced by
the Asian financial crisis were extended by appropriate DOLE
offices in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among those extended assistance, he said, were industrial
workers, workers of small and medium enterprises, rural workers
and laborers.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Bourse Makes Good Performance in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange (JSX) ended the year of 1999 with a 70 percent
gain, leaving the bourse as one of best in performing markets in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Based on data issued by the Capital Supervisory Board (BAPEPAM),
the JSX ranked the third among the world's best performing markets
in 1999 after South Korea's Seoul and Singapore Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The composite index on the bourse increased 70.06 percent
during 1999 and closed at 676.91 points on Thursday, the last
trading day in the year.
</P>
<P>
"The year of 1999 is the recovery year for the Indonesian
capital market," the Jakarta Post daily quoted the Bapepam
research bureau as saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The JSX composite index jumped to its highest point at 716.46
in mid-June and dipped to the lowest level at 327.31 in mid-March.
The composite index closed last year trading at 398.03 points,"
the daily quoted a report issued by the bureau as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also said that trade and service companies performed the
best on the JSX, booking a 241.82 percent gain during 1999.
</P>
<P>
But agriculture sector companies were reportedly sluggish,
booking a loss of 23.71 percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the value of daily trading on the
bourse stood at average of 594.2 billion rupiah (84.8 million U.S.
dollars) for the year, compared to 403.6 billion rupiah (57.5
million U.S. dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Market capitalization jumped to 443.3 trillion rupiah (63.3
billion dollars) in the year from 175.7 trillion rupiah in 1998 (
25 billion dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the bourse performance, Chairman of Bapepam Jusuf
Anwar said,"this (the best performance) shows that confidence in (
the country's) capital market had been recover." "But there will
be a tough challenge in the future. We have to keep working hard,"
Anwar was quoted by the Bisnis Indonesia as saying.
</P>
<P>
The trading activities on the bourse will be closed on Friday
and Monday and resume on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia's Economy Back to Growth Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The optimistic prediction was based on the number of rise of
consumption goods imported for the country's middle class
community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, value of Indonesia's export has risen in October
1999 to 4.587 million U.S. dollars or 2.13 percent higher than
September, while import value in the same time was 2.028 millions
dollars or lower than September which reached to 2.127 millions
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rising of share prices with a 70 percent gain
on the JSX (Jakarta Stock Exchange), and the stabilization of the
rupiah at level of Rp 7.000 per dollar and the falling of
benchmark interest rates to 12 percent per annum have become
evidence that Indonesia's macroeconomic conditions have been
improving.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government predicted that the country's economy
in 2000 will grow by 2 to 3.5 percent, with an inflation rate
between 4 and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's gross domestic product contracted by 13.6 percent
in 1998 and posted an inflation of as high as 75 percent, bringing
the country's per capita income to about 400 U.S. dollars from a
pre-crisis level of over 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A noted economist of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) Hadi Susatro even said that Indonesia could expect
an economic growth of over 4 percent in 2000, or higher than the
government's assessment.
</P>
<P>
"The national production capacity which is currently idle, will
have to resume in 2000 on the grounds that international
confidence in Indonesia has been restored," Susastro said recently.
</P>
<P>
He added that prospect for economic growth in the East Asia
region in 2000 looked good and it would also favorably affect the
Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
An economic journal also wrote that "the economic growth during
this year appears to show an indication towards a better
improvement."
</P>
<P>
The domestic political stability since the new government
established in October has been a main factor prompting trade
activities on the JSX. Superior shares such as Astra International
(a car maker company) increased sharply in October from 900 rupiah
to 3,375 rupiah (increased by 36 points)," the Escom journal wrote
in its December edition.
</P>
<P>
With the support from other countries as well as the IMF (
International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank, the government
could be optimistic that its economic target would be met this
year.
</P>
<P>
The National Investment Board (BKPM) also predicted that
investment in Indonesia in 2000 would recover thanks to the
improvement of the political situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that investment in the country will recover
in 2000. Investment in Indonesia, both domestic and foreign, will
keep rising next year," Deputy Chairman of BKPM Andung
Nitimihardjo said.
</P>
<P>
But even with the economic improvement, the country is
currently still troubled by serious problems resulting from not
only the economic crisis and social gap, but also religious,
racial, regional and other constraints.
</P>
<P>
The banking recapitalization problem seems to be the most
urgent task that should be done by the government. Apart from
economic issues, the country also has to deal with serious matters
such as disintegration threats, corruption and ethnic jealousy.
</P>
<P>
The continuing ethnic bloodshed in Ambon, capital of Maluku
province, could also be an obstacle for the economic recovery. It
seems to be a new challenge for the country in the third
millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Deputy Prime Minister
Trairong Suwannakhiri, who is in charge of overseeing the national
Y2K problem, affirmed on Friday that Thailand is well-prepared to
welcome the new millennium, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan suggested the public not to panic or over-fear of the so-
called millennium bug, saying Thailand could learn about any
problem in advance from countries which enter the new year hours
before Thailand, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Electronic and Computer Technology
Center (NECTEC) has confirmed that all the agencies in Thailand,
which seriously need Y2K compliance, are now 100 percent ready.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry assured that it had been well-prepared to
prevent any Y2K problem related to armed weapon and thus the
millennium bug would not have any impact on national security.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry also assured that hospitals had been
well-equipped with medical, energy and other necessary facilities
to provide normal services to patients.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Airways International, Thailand's national carrier,
announced that it had successfully overcome the Y2K computer
glitch, though it canceled and rescheduled some international
flights based on its pre-cautious policy.
</P>
<P>
The airline also established a Y2K command center to monitor
the situation at the turn of the century.

BERLIN -- Germany is expected to record a 2.5 to 3 percent
economic growth in the year 2000, with a yearly jobless total of
less than four million, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said here
Thursday in a interview with the newspaper Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
"It means a big step towards maturity," said Schroeder,
pointing out that since 1996, unemployment has always hovered
above that figure. "But it does not mean that we have passed the
crisis," he added, saying that the government will keep working
for a distinct and consecutive reduction in unemployment. The tax
reform will continue so that enterprises will be less burdened and
stronger in global competition, he added. (Germany-Economy)

"A total of 12,720 Burundian refugees had arrived in Kigoma by
December 29 compared to 5,365 last month," said Marion Roche, head
of a sub-office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Kigoma. "The high number this month is probably a reflection of
the worsening stability in Burundi," said Roche. She said most
refugees paint a gloomy picture of the situation in Burundi,
accusing rebels of burning houses along the border and the army of
harassing people. (Tanzania-Burndi-Refugees)

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Friday that the world must work together so as
to make the new Millennium a time of hope and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the eve of the New Year and the new millennium,
Annan said, "A new century brings new hope, but also brings new
dangers -- or old ones in a new and alarming form." He cited fear
of economic change, bigotry, violence, disease and damage to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
"No one knows for sure how serious each of those dangers would
be. But one thing they have in common: they do not respect state
frontiers. Even the strongest state, acting alone, may be unable
to protect its citizens against them," said the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"More than ever before in human history, we share a common
destiny. We can master it only if we face it together," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the United Nations, we are working together to
preserve peace; to outlaw weapons that kill people
indiscriminately; to bring mass murderers and war criminals to
justice," Annan continued.
</P>
<P>
"Through the United Nations, we are working together to defeat
AIDS and other epidemics, to control climate change, to make clear
air and water available to everyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the United Nations, we are working together to ensure
that the global market benefits all of us, allowing the poor to
lift themselves out of poverty," the U.N. chief added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: On the Eve of New Millennium in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- If there is any celebration of
the new millennium in Bangladesh at all, that will be at the non-
governmental level, as the government has announced no official
programs so far to greet the dawn of the new century and the new
millennium, which is less than one day away.
</P>
<P>
For the government, the priority at the moment is how to foil
the opposition's oust-government movement which has gained
momentum recently, marked by the first summit of the four-party
opposition alliance at end-November.
</P>
<P>
And for the ordinary people, January 1, 2000 only means another
day, which will not be much different from any other day they have
lived.
</P>
<P>
Three calendars are practiced in Bangladesh, the Gregorian
calendar which will enter the third millennium on Saturday, the
Hegira calendar, now in the year 1420 and commonly practiced by
the Muslim community, and the Bengali calendar which is now in the
year 1406.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, euphoria has gripped the young people, especially
university students, who are making preparations for the
celebration of the zero hours before entering into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Traders and retailers in the capital city of Dhaka have
expanded their business activities taking the advantage of the
occasion and of the month of Ramadan, which is followed by Eid-ul-
Fitr, the most important festival for Muslims all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams have become a common scene in Dhaka, as the
government has shortened the office time from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to
9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. during Ramadan and many people have gone out
on a shopping spree, taking advantage of the special offers by
traders.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said the main places of attraction in
Bangladesh for the young generation are the sea-beach resorts in
Khuakata, in southern Patuakhali district and in southeastern Cox'
s Bazar, from where they can witness the last setting of the sun
in the 20th century and the first sunrise of the 21st century and
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
But the euphoria seems to have been confined among the middle-
and high-income groups only. The advent of the millennium could
generate little interest among the poor, who still account for
nearly half of the country's population of over 120 million at the
end of this millennium.
</P>
<P>
"What's there in the coming of a millennium or going of the
other? All I have to think of is earning my bread working day-long.
There is no scope for me at least to waste a bread-earning day by
celebrating a mere sunset or a sunrise," rickshaw-puller Shamsu
Mia said.

<HEADLINE> Export of Tea Down, of Frozen Food up in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tea export fell
drastically while the export of frozen food rose slightly during
July-September period, the first three months of the current 1999-
2000 fiscal year, The Economic Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 189 million taka (about 3.7 million U.S.
dollars) by exporting 2.28 million kilograms of tea during the
three-month period, 62.2 percent down from that of the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Experts blamed the fall of both demand and price of Bangladeshi
tea in the international market for the export fall.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Tea Board has fixed a target of 2 billion taka (
about 39.2 million dollars) from tea export during the current
fiscal year. The country produces 55 million kilograms of tea
annually, and slightly more than half of the amount is consumed
domestically.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of the current fiscal year, the
country earned 122.8 million dollars from frozen food export, 0.25
percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exporters said the prices of frozen food in the international
markets remained fair due to good demand in the three-month period.
The government has aimed to export 296 million dollars' worth of
frozen food this fiscal year.

SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua)-- Singapore's South Pole team
members reached the South Pole on Friday to become the first four
Singaporeans to set foot on the southernmost point of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
It took the four members, led by expedition leader Khoo Swee

reaching the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
On hearing the news, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

the expedition will inspire other Singaporeans to dare and achieve.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporeans must have the guts, the spirit and the
capability to face their own challenges in life, he said.
</P>
<P>
For a while, the trekkers met with a series of setbacks and no
one was sure if they could make it.
</P>
<P>
These included being delayed in Punta Arenas, Chile, because of
bad weather, being slowed down considerably by huge ice-ridges,
and even being snowed in by blizzards on Antarctica.

<HEADLINE> Curfew Clamped on Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to create peace
and order in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, a
curfew has been imposed on the city, according to national
newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Maluku Military Region Brig. Gen. Max Tamaella
Thursday issued a rule forbidding Ambon residents to leave their
homes between 10:00 p.m. and 06:00 a.m. local time the next day.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the Muslim fasting month, residents may
leave their homes only for emergency reasons, without having to
cross their neighborhood borders," Tamaella said.
</P>
<P>
He said the security authorities also prohibited any gathering
of people which involved more than 10, without acceptable purposes.
Gatherings as part of religious practices were exempted.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that violence in Ambon subsided on Thursday,
but clashes continued in other parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still going on and at least 265 persons have been
killed in clashes between Christians and Muslims on Halmahera
island in North Maluku over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties brought the death toll in sporadic
communal clashes across the spice islands of Maluku to nearly 340
since the new wave of violence broke out on Sunday, just after a
peaceful Christmas.
</P>
<P>
In its press release, the Indonesian Military information
service said about 360 buildings, including mosques, churches,
were burned down, while nearly 12,000 people sought refuge at the
nearest military installations following the violence that rocked
the district of Tobelo in Halmahera island.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post, the riots in Tobelo ceased when
dozens of military troops arrived to restore order there. But
tension remained high, with security personnel standing on alert
across the town.
</P>
<P>
The violence followed similar clashes in Ambon where at least
63 people were killed and more than 100 were injured this week.
</P>
<P>
Unrest was also reported on Haruku island, east of Ambon, where
eight people have been killed in the violence since Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since the
beginning of the year, and nearly 1,000 people have died. Hundreds
of shops, offices, homes and other buildings, including many
churches and mosques, have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri visited Ambon on December 12, pleading for an end to
the bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Tie Knot in Thailand for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 couples attended a
Year 2000 mass wedding ceremony Friday morning on the outskirts of
Bangkok, which will last until the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began at 09:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) with the unveiling
of a 2.5-meter-high golden Sculpture of Love 2000, with the names
of the couples engraved on it.
</P>
<P>
The event will be followed by a traditional Thai engagement
ceremony, offering food to Buddhist monks, a traditional nuptial
water ceremony, the wedding itself and a New-Year countdown.
</P>
<P>
The wedding, a millennium tourism promotion called Thailand
Amazing Love 2000, has been one of Thailand's most publicized
celebrations on the New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
The wedding mainly involves Thais after a large number of
foreigners decided against taking flights here because of Y2K
jitters.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the 2,000 couples are supposed to be consisted of
1,700 from Thailand and 300 from the United Stated, Cambodia,
China, France, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden,
Ukraine and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But the organizer said they have prepared a long reserve list
of Thai couples to replace the withdrawn foreign couples, so they
are sure there are 2,000 couples present.
</P>
<P>
A 72-tier, 9.9-meter-high wedding cake has been prepared for
the couples, who will be given an opportunity to pose with it.
</P>
<P>
Many couples said they were keen to take part in such a large
event.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Offers Permanent Seat for World Anti-Doping Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Sports Minister
Ulrica Messing suggested Thursday that her country provide a
permanent home for the newly inaugurated World Anti-Doping Agency
(WADA) in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"Sweden has the knowledge and the competence, and this nation's
credibility in fighting drugs and doping are factors that might
work to the advantage of Sweden," the sports minister told The
Associated Press (AP).
</P>
<P>
Ever since its establishment last month in Lausanne, the WADA
has been criticized by many as being too close to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) and it should be moved. A
number of European cities have expressed interest and the IOC
plans a bidding process for a permanent seat.
</P>
<P>
Messing said she believed the WADA headquarters would be moved
after 2001 and Sweden would submit an application after the IOC
specified its criteria.
</P>
<P>
She said WADA should be moved from its present location for
propriety's sake.
</P>
<P>
"For one it is good to show an independent stance in relations
with IOC," Messing said. "But I also think it is improper to have
such an agency in a country like Switzerland, which has such
liberal views on drugs. This is a matter of credibility."
</P>
<P>
The Swedish government recently almost doubled the annual
financial allocations to its anti-doping efforts from kronor 6.6
million (767,000 U.S. dollars) to 11 million kronor (1.28 million
U.S. dollars), the AP report said.

BUCHAREST, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union decided

A total of nine related memorandums were signed by EU
representative Fokion Fotiadis and Romanian Foreign Minister Petre
Roman, the Romanian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fotiadis said the EU will tremendously increase its financial

<P>
COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has planned two
major road development projects for next year in suburban Colombo
and in the south to help attract more investors through speedy
transport, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the RDA said the two projects are the 29 km
Colombo-Katunayake Expressway and the 128 km Southern Express
Highway.
</P>
<P>
The two projects, which will get off the ground in April and
October next year, respectively, will generate 15,000 jobs,
representing the largest ever road development projects in the
country, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet appointed tender board has recommended a 125 million
U.S.dollars offer forwarded by a joint Belgian-Chinese party for
the construction of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway.
</P>
<P>
Preliminaries on the expressway, including the environment
impact assessment and land acquisition have been completed.
Designs, tenders and funding proposals are under evaluation.
</P>
<P>
For the Southern Express Highway project, the environment
impact assessment and land acquisition have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a concessional loan of 89.4 million dollars from the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been obtained for the project
which will cost 296.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government, Swedish International Development
Agency and the Nordic Development Fund will co-finance 128 million
dollars while the balance 78.8 million dollars will be met by the
Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years the development and maintenance of
the national road network has been considerably stepped up as lack
of speedy transport is the major impediment to the development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 700 kilometers of road have been rehabilitated and
construction work is in progress on 61 bridges with the assistance
of the World Bank, ADB, Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF)
of Japan and Kuwait Fund.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, 86 road sections and 79 bridges have already been
developed with local funds.
</P>
<P>
Budget allocations have also been made available for the
improvement of estates roads and the development of provincial and
rural roads.

<HEADLINE> More Burundian Refugees Flee to Tanzania: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- More Burundian refugees
are fleeing into Tanzania's west Kigoma Region as the security
situation worsens in their homeland, the top official of the U.N.
refugee agency in the region said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 12,720 Burundian refugees had arrived in Kigoma by
December 29 compared to 5,365 last month," said Marion Roche, head
of a sub-office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Kigoma.
</P>
<P>
"The high number this month is probably a reflection of the
worsening stability in Burundi," said Roche.
</P>
<P>
She said most refugees paint a gloomy picture of the situation
in Burundi, accusing rebels of burning houses along the border and
the army of harassing people.
</P>
<P>
According to Roche, her office has not been overwhelmed with
problems in the wake of the influx because contingency plans had
been made in collaboration with the Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, media sources said fierce fighting in several
Burundian provinces was causing people to flee and some refugees
were also crossing into Tanzania to avoid forced resettlement by
the Tutsi-dominated army.
</P>
<P>
Rebel attacks in and around Burundi's capital Bujumbura have
increased sharply since the beginning of this year, prompting the
minority Tutsi government to force tens of thousands of people,
mostly majority Hutus, to move into camps to allow the army to "
cleanse" the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China Centenary Bell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The giant bronze China
Centenary Bell, the largest in the nation, will be rung at the
China Centenary Altar in Beijing to greet the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 50-ton bell is 6.8 meters high and 3.38 meters in diameter,
bigger than the famous 579-year-old Yongle Bell in the Big Bell
Temple in northwestern Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The China Centenary Bell is installed at the China Centenary
Altar in western Beijing -- the only symbolic structure in China
to welcome the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The idea for the bell originated with some Chinese scholars,
including Fei Xiaotong, Qian Weichang, and Ding Shisun, and the
bell was designed by Xiao Hong, who won the top prize in the
design contest for flags and emblems for the Hong Kong and Macao
Special Administrative Regions. Fei Xiaotong named the giant bell.
</P>
<P>
The bell is inscribed with the national anthem, the patterns of
the Great Wall, 56 peony flowers symbolizing the unity of China's
56 ethnic groups, and two dragons representing China's long
history of civilization.
</P>
<P>
"Major Historical Events of the 20th Century" is inscribed on
the bell. Historians from Beijing University wrote 4,474 words
describing the history of the Chinese people in their struggles
for independence, democracy, and prosperity since 1900.
</P>
<P>
The China Centenary Bell is a product of joint efforts by
several plants and research institutes. Its casting was completed
on December 17 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally in China, bells are used to record historic
events, eulogize people's merits and virtues, and give advice, and
they are rung during major festivals and grand ceremonies.

<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The China Centenary Altar, a
structure symbolizing China's 5,000-year-old civilization and its
people's wishes for the new millennium, now stands serenely in
western Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The altar is located between the Military Museum of the Chinese
People's Revolution and China Central Television, with Yuyuantan
Park up the north and the Beijing West Railway Station down the
south.
</P>
<P>
Construction of it began on October 10, 1998. Composed of the
main building, a bronze-paved path, a Sacred Flame Square and
several other structures, the altar complex covers a total area of
4.5 hectares.
</P>
<P>
A 34.6-ton white marble stele, nine meters long and 1.05 meters
high, stands at the southern entrance of the altar, inscribed with
an epigraph written by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
At the back of the stele is a round square, 35 meters in
diameter and one-meter deep below the ground. The Sacred Flame, a
symbol of the origin and eternal nature of Chinese civilization,
will be lit at midnight on a platform in the middle of the square.
Two streams of water, each flowing at the west and east of the
square, represent the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, known as the
mother rivers of China.
</P>
<P>
The 270-meter-long and 15-meter-wide path connects the square
and the main building of the altar. 5,000 pieces of bronze relief,
each representing one year since the beginning of Chinese history
in about 3,000 B.C., are laid in the middle of the path.
</P>
<P>
The main altar structure, 27 meters high and 85 meters in
diameter, is a five-storey building with two floors below the
ground. It is made up of a revolving altar weighing more than 3,
200 tons and a long cloister surrounding it, which symbolize
heaven and earth. The altar is the largest and heaviest of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
A 27.6-meter-high symbolic probe that is nailed to the oblique
plane of the rotary altar is pointing to the sky, indicating the
Chinese people's spirit of exploration.
</P>
<P>
The China Centenary Altar is an artistic combination of Chinese
architecture, gardens, frescos and carvings, and will serve as a
window to help people of other countries understand the 5,000-year-
old splendid art and culture of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Professionals in the offices
of the China Y2K Problem Contingency Office who have been hustling
and bustling these days began Thursday a five-day monitoring of
possible problems related to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"Though confident of solving the computer millennium bug
problem, we are preparing for the worst," said Zhang Qi, director
of the emergency headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Today is the last day of the millennium, and the Chinese
government, in order to facilitate the solution, has made the day
a holiday, with banks and stock markets closed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that 20 crucial industries including banking,
securities, and electricity grids have all worked out
corresponding contingency plans and implementation schemes.
</P>
<P>
The millennium, or Y2K, problem affects older computers which
only recognize the last two digits of the year, possibly
triggering failures when the date rolls over to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has
organized three nationwide out-of-service tests for the banking
industry in cooperation with securities, insurance, and other
financial agencies.
</P>
<P>
A central bank official said that the country's banking system
is now basically ready for the transition, and no cash runs have
occurred so far.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth transition, the bank has also formulated
contingency measures such as preparing adequate cash for customers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jianfeng, director of the General Administration of Civil
Aviation of China, said he will take a cross-millennium flight
aboard a Chinese airliner. "I am confident in China's civil
aviation," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang didn't rule out the possibility that something will
happen somewhere, and added that her office will try every
possible way to keep any losses to a minimum.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Honduras expects a further
hardening of the laws next year to efficiently combat drug
trafficking, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Landaverde, general secretary of the Anti-Drug National
Commission, said a new law bill will seek -- in the war against
money laundering -- the cancellation of bank secrecy when the
courts request it.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the laws of the country only permit the seizure of
aircraft and other transportation equipment related to drug
trafficking, but say nothing about assets.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Roberto Flores announced earlier that Honduras
and the United States will sign an agreement in 2000 to combat
drug trafficking in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Convicted Honduran drug trafficker Ramon Matta, imprisoned in
the United States, has increased his assets in Honduran commercial
sectors, according to police.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said that some
drug traffickers have businesses in Honduras because of the lack
of teeth in the laws against drug trafficking.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The last U.S. national
flag in the Panama Canal zone was hauled down at 17:00 local time
Thursday afternoon, 19 hours earlier than expected. No public
explanation was made.
</P>
<P>
The local RPC radio said the U.S. government requested the
early pulling down of the flag, which had originally been
scheduled for midday Friday, December 31, when the Panamanian flag
was to be raised by President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter treaties signed between the two
countries in 1977, December 31 was the day when the U.S.
government formally returns the interoceanic waterway to the
Panamanian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the small hauling ceremony in front of the Canal
Administration building was strictly limited, with the U.S. side
represented by Ambassador Simon Ferro and Canal Commission
managing board chairman Louis Caldera, who is also U.S. Army
general secretary. The Panamanian side was led by President
Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Panamanian government nor the U.S. embassy in this
country has made any statement on the matter, sparking media
speculation that Washington was shy of lowering it flag in the
eyes of the general public.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Optimistic About German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Germany is expected to record a
2.5 to 3 percent economic growth in the year 2000, with a yearly
jobless total of less than four million, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said here Thursday in a interview with the newspaper
Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
"It means a big step towards maturity," said Schroeder,
pointing out that since 1996, unemployment has always hovered
above that figure.
</P>
<P>
"But it does not mean that we have passed the crisis," he added,
saying that the government will keep working for a distinct and
consecutive reduction in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform will continue so that enterprises will be less
burdened and stronger in global competition, he added.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said his coalition government will not break the
policy of continuity, and a zero deficit increase will be its
medium-term objective.
</P>
<P>
As to the controversial pension reform plan, Schroeder stressed
that it is of great importance in liberating enterprises and
creating new jobs.
</P>
<P>
His government has proposed keeping the pension increase rate
lower than the inflation rate in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The government will come up with a concrete pension reform plan,
following consultation among all parties, by the coming summer and
have it implemented by the end of 2000, Schroeder said.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Again Suspend Guard Isaiah Rider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- NBA Atlanta Hawks guard
Isaiah Rider was suspended by the team today for the second time
this season, one day after a profanity-laced tirade.
</P>
<P>
Rider failed to join the Hawks for Wednesday's flight to
Detroit and
finally caught up with the team this morning.
</P>
<P>
Rider said he missed the Wednesday 6 p.m. flight by five
minutes and normally the plane does not leave until 15 or 20
minutes after its scheduled departure time.
</P>
<P>
"I felt I was left as a punishment," Rider said. "I got here
today, I was expecting to play. I didn't think I would start. I
thought I would be fined but I didn't expect this."
</P>
<P>
Rider spoke to the media after taking part in a players-only
meeting. Afterward, he left the facility as per team rules.
</P>
<P>
Hawks spokesman Arthur Triche said Rider has been suspended
indefinitely. ESPN is reporting he will sit for a minimum of two
games. Jimmy Jackson took Rider's place in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
The Hawks' suspension of their leading scorer comes about 24
hours after Rider questioned his teammates' commitment following a
116-89 home loss to Indiana, Atlanta's eighth setback in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
Rider remained on the court for 10 minutes after the final horn,
slumped against the scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
Today, Rider said teammates were laughing on the bench during
the game and he had a hard time with that reaction.
</P>
<P>
Rider's first season with the Hawks has been an eventful one.
He is 10th in the NBA in scoring at 23.0 points per game but
already has been suspended and benched before reclaiming his spots
as starting shooting guard and top offensive option.
</P>
<P>
Rider was suspended by the team for a November 16 game against
Charlotte after missing a practice. He was late for training camp
after refusing to board a smaller plane to Chattanooga, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Acquired this summer from Portland in a deal for All-Star Steve
Smith, Rider has been suspended by the NBA and his team several
times during his seven-year career and has had more than one run-
in with the law. He was charged with possession of marijuana and
unlawful possession of cellular telephones in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rider, 28, entered the season with a career scoring average of
18 points per game for Minnesota and Portland. He was chosen fifth
overall by the Timberwolves in 1993.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Chief Says Marathon an Athletic Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Rome Millennium Marathon, to
be held on the first day of the New Year, represents an "athletic
pilgrimage" closely connected to the Holy Year celebrations, neo-
president of the International Amateur Athletics Federation Lamine
Diack said THursday.
</P>
<P>
In his first official speech as IAAF chief, Diack said that "
the marathon is a symbol of the exhausting physical and spiritual
progress which the athlete makes in seeking the finishing line.
This is why the Pope has agreed to the twinning of the great
Jubilee religious event with our sporting event."
</P>
<P>
Here in Rome to officially present the Marathon, Diack also
said that the year 2000 should be dedicated to encouraging
athletics in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Athletics cannot be a purely European event. It touches and
involves all the countries in the world. IAAF will work hard
across the globe, especially in Asia and Africa, where the human
potential is enormous and so far little exploited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diack is the successor of Primo Nebiolo, who died of a heart
attack at the age of 76 on November 6.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,500 athletes are expected to take part in the 42-km Rome
Millennium Marathon.
</P>
<P>
The race will start in St. Peter's Square, where participants
will receive the blessing of Pope John Paul II and the necessary "
spiritual encouragement", as Diack said.

CAIRO -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has stressed the
importance of enhancing Egypt's cooperation with the other
countries in the coming century when no single nation would be able
to develop on its own.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with the world countries is strong and it will
get stronger in the future," Mubarak said on Thursday in his end-
of-the-millennium statements to the editor-in-chief of Egypt's Al-
Gomhuria daily, Samir Ragab.
</P>
<P>
"The continued development of the relations is our main concern
(as) it is impossible for any country to work alone in the future,"
the president said. (Egypt-World)

CAIRO -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
on Friday urged Iraq to take creative steps in a bid to help heal
the rifts in the Arab world in the coming new era.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued hours before the advent of the third
millennium, Abdel-Meguid spoke of the major events that occurred in
the Arab world this century and the 22-nation pan-Arab forum's
expectations and hopes.
</P>
<P>
He singled out one momentous event in the last decade: Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, which, he regretted, had a
clear negative impact on Arab solidarity and incised a deep wound
in inter-Arab relations still felt till now.
</P>
<P>
Such rifts should be remedied through creative overtures and
well-calculated concessions by Iraq, the AL chief said. (Arab

<HEADLINE> Turkish Leaders Express New Hopes for New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- As the new year is round the
corner, Turkish leaders pledged reforms, democracy and well-being
for the nation in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, President Suleiman Demirel said, "
Turkey, which has proven that republic, democracy, secularism and
Islam are concepts in harmony with each other, is determined to
continue along the same path."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Turkey must keep pace with the world, the president
said, "in this light we must complete as soon as possible the
economic, political, judicial and administrative reforms that we
have begun."
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the parliament, Yildirim Akbulut, said in his new
year message that Turkey's target in the new millenium was to
become one of the world's most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should make wide-spread reforms in every field, including
local administration, the judicial system, education and social
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker added: "We should revitalize relations between the
state and the people. We should enlarge our democracy and permit
the contributions of non-governmental organizations."
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that
Turkey was entering the year 2000 with great hopes. Noting that the
1999 killer quakes in Turkey, which claimed the lives of tens of
thousands of people, had caused great sorrow in the country, Ecevit
promised to meet the needs of the quake victims.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the year that is passing by, the premier
underscored that it had been a successful year for Turkey in many
aspects, including reforms in the constitution and solving economic
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also highly evaluated the fact that Turkey had taken a
big step on the way toward membership in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Panama Becomes Absolute Owner of the Interoceanic Waterway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama recovered Friday
here at midday the sovereignty over the interoceanic waterway,
after 85 years of U.S. military occupation.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, in an emotion-charged ceremony, in which
tears of happiness of a big crowd of Panamanians of all the social
strata who gathered before the Panama Canal administration
building were shed, the Panamanian flag was hoisted.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 helium-inflated toy balloons with the colors
of the Panamanian flag crossed the sky and the booming of 21 canon
salvos that announced the full independence of Panama were heard,
a few hours short of the start of the new millennium, in the
moments in which the Panamanian flag flapped in the wind.
</P>
<P>
Panama recovered full sovereignty over the Canal Zone in
compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 by the
Panama and United States governments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro delivered on behalf of the his
government, the official document that represents the reversion of
the interoceanic canal and of the other canal assets, to
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said in her speech delivered during the historical
ceremony the work of General Omar Torrijos, who negotiated with
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter the signing of the canal
treaties.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso demanded the United States to start in the new
millennium a new kind of relations based in mutual and decided
cooperation and reciprocal respect.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit and the usufruct the Panama canal has given to the
United States geopolitics and economy make mandatory for this
nation to practice the sentiment of brotherhood that its leaders
have touted for decades," said Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said that the United States must start
in this new period an era of trade relations with Panama that will
permit this nation to begin a process of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso also said that in this historical day, with the full
recovery of their sovereignty over their national territory,
Panamanians reach adulthood as a nation.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said that from now on there will not
be more fences nor warning posters forbidding Panamanians to enter
the canal zone, where the United States established for 85 years
an exclusive zone with U.S. laws, judges, and policemen.
</P>
<P>
"This territory has become ours again. The shout of total
sovereignty that so many generations have claimed is now a reality
and the canal is ours," she said.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said on behalf
of the Armed Forces and the government of President Bill Clinton
that from now on the two nations will advance in the new
millennium as partners.
</P>
<P>
"Let us never forget that progress requires hard work, nor the
challenges President Kennedy asked us to face building new
opportunities that this Canal has permitted," said Caldera.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Lights Flame of Hope for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela, who has come to symbolize South Africa's
victory over racism and oppression, on Friday lit a symbolic flame
of hope for the new millennium in his former prison cell on Robben
Island.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony watched by only a handful of people, he handed
the flame to President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The handover, which will be televised at midnight, was one of
the highlights of a multi-million and millennium celebration for
some 500 VIP guests on the island.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who helicoptered in with Mbeki just before 9.30 p.m.,
was earlier greeted with a standing ovation when he entered the
specially-erected marquee next to the island's airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming them, Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe
described Mandela as one of Africa's greatest sons.
</P>
<P>
Radebe, the Cabinet minister tasked with overseeing the
official millennium celebrations, said that as the light on
leadership was carried on into a new era, Mbeki symbolized the
rise of the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Year At Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks celebrated
the year-end session with a full slate of records Friday in
confidence that the world financial markets would be free from the
Y2K problem when Year 2000 is rolling in.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 44.26 at 11,497.12,
surpassing the record closing high of 11,484.66 points set
Wednesday. The session ended at 1 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 4.78 at a new high of 1,469.25 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 32.44 at 4.069.31,
topping the record high of 4.041.46 points set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The great performance put the Dow's year-end rally at 25.2
percent and the S&AMP;P index gained 19.5 percent in the year. The
Nasdaq index emerged as the biggest winner with the gain of 85.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied today as Japan, South Korea and Australia
reported no major troubles with their computers when the new year
rolled in. The positive indications convinced investors that
financial markets in the United States and Europe will enter the
new millennium unscathed by computer malfunctions because the
United States and Europe have spent far more money to deal with
the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected resignation by Russian president Boris Yeltsin
had little impact on the Wall Street stocks.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.09 at 650.30 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 10.85 at 876.97. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 8.16 at 504.75.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin, with
2,172 up, 937 down and 419 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 372.60 million shears at the close of half-
day trading, down from 533.10 million in the previous full session.

UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday wrote a letter to Boris Yeltsin who announced
today to step down as president of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Annan pledged to work closely with Acting
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's resignation after eight years and a half as

<HEADLINE> CIS, Baltic States React to Yeltsin Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Boris Yeltsin's move Friday to
resign as president of Russia and handing his powers to Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, the acting president, received positive
reactions from other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Noting Yeltsin's visit to Estonia in 1991, when the Russian
president advocated Estonia's independence, President Lennart Meri
of the Baltic state said Yeltsin has won a place for himself in
history.
</P>
<P>
"That (the resignation) was a courageous step, and the
Estonians will keep good impressions of it," Meri said.
</P>
<P>
He said Putin "will carry this load... as acting president, and
the future will show how easy or difficult that path is."
</P>
<P>
Belarus received Yeltsin's resignation with understanding,
President Alexander Lukashenko said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, "under whose leadership Russia has passed through the
hard way of transformation, made a courageous act which will be
worthily assessed by the current and future generations, as well
as the entire international community," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Putin, "who has done a lot for
Belarussian-Russian unification, will be consistently pursuing the
policy aimed at implementing Belarussian- Russian agreements."
</P>
<P>
In Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Yerlan
Idrisov said Yeltsin's resignation "has opened the way to renewal
and democracy."
</P>
<P>
The move was a "very well-considered step by a major politician,
who has made a sober-minded assessment of the situation in Russia,
and has opened the way for renewal and democracy," Interfax quoted
Idrisov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Boris Nikolayevich's step is worth of praise. It is a step of
a mature statesman," he said, describing the step as " the basis
for stability" in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the next presidential election in spring
2000 would "set out a general strategy" for Russia, a way to"
prosperity, to further democratization."
</P>
<P>
A democratic path in Russia "would do nothing but good to
Kazakh-Russian relations," Idrisov said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Decrees Security Guarantees for Yeltsin, Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a decree providing security
guarantees for Boris Yeltsin, who stepped down earlier in the day
as the Russian head of state.
</P>
<P>
The decree makes immediate provisions for "legal, social
security and other guarantees" for one who has left office as
president "due to the expiry of his term... or who has resigned
before such a date or who has displayed a steady inability for
health reasons to exercise his powers" and for "members of his
family."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one of the key conditions for Yeltsin's
early resignation is the provision of security guarantees for
himself and his family after he leaves the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's decree means that Yeltsin and his family members will
be exempted from criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-dominated State Duma once put forward a motion in
the lower house of parliament to impeach Yeltsin for the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and his order to open fire on
the White House, former seat of the Russian parliament, in 1991.
The impeachment motion was later defeated.
</P>
<P>
There have also been media reports over the years about alleged
involvement in money-laundering and other economic scandals by
Yeltsin and his family members.
</P>
<P>
Under the Putin decree, regardless of his age, a former
president will receive a life pension equivalent to 75 percent of
the presidential salary, the Interfax news agency quoted the
Kremlin press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
If he is elected for another official position, his pension
would be suspended for the period he holds the post.
</P>
<P>
He would be provided with bodyguards both at his permanent
place of residence and during his visits, with special
telecommunications services and with means of transport.
</P>
<P>
Bodyguards would also be provided for members of his family who
live with him or accompany him.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president and members of his family who live with him
would be entitled to the same kind of medical services he had
received when still in office.
</P>
<P>
His life and his health condition would be subject to
compulsory state insurance for a sum equivalent to the annual
presidential salary.
</P>
<P>
He would be immune against prosecution, arrest, bodily search
and interrogation. His right of immunity would extend to his place
of residence, his office if he works, his vehicles, communications
means, baggage and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
After his death, every member of his family would receive a
monthly allowance equivalent to sixfold the minimum old age
pension as of his death date.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Kremlin announced that Alexander Voloshin,
a long-time Yeltsin aide, would continue to serve as head of the
presidential administration. Observers believe the retention of
Voloshin inside the Kremlin means that Yeltsin will continue to
exert certain influences on Russian politics in the future.

JOHANNESBURG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- As South Africans were
celebrating the new millennium, early indications were that the
country has escaped the menace of the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"We are communicating - so it means that everything is still OK!
"the South African telephone company, Telkom, announced in an e-
mail early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Banking Council's e-mail, while not as animated, was
equally as heartening, saying: "ATMs and credit-card point-of-sale
devices are reported to be functioning smoothly and there is no
shortage of cash."
</P>
<P>
"Saswitch -- which allows bank customers to withdraw money from
the ATMs of other banks -- is also operating normally," it said
</P>
<P>
"The Year 2000 Banking Response Center is confident that branch
services will also operate as usual."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the National Y2K Disaster Management Center said:"
Computer-aided systems and services showed no signs of succumbing
to the Millennium Bug, to the huge relief and delight of officials
overseeing the roll-over."
</P>
<P>
The five greater Johannesburg councils said although there had
been a few minor glitches during Friday evening - none were Y2K
related.
</P>
<P>
A statement said lightning struck a Kibler Park power station
temporarily disrupting the civil defense telephone system and
causing a number of power failures.

<P>
BERLIN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 2 million Germans gathered

The massive party, stretching from the middle of west Berlin

 Loud disco music echoed over the 4.5 kilometer long festival
street, where people cheered, sang and danced under sub-freezing

The gigantic festival, costing more than 40 million marks,
included 10 stages, 60 bands, five huge video screens and two
massive ferris wheels.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Waiting for Annexes to Iraqi Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said on Friday that the United Nations is waiting for
annexes to Iraqi distribution plan and the distribution plan has
yet to be submitted in full.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to questions in recent days about
when the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would endorse the
distribution plan for phase seven of the oil-for-food programme.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the U.N. chief on Thursday of delaying approval
of a foodstuff distribution plan for the current phase of Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the world body.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the United Nations has received the executive
summary and the proposed allocations by sector, but the Government
of Iraq has yet to submit the annexes to the distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
The annexes list all the items that Iraq intends to procure
under relevant U.N. resolution and they have to be reviewed by the
U.N. Secretariat before the Secretary-General can approve the plan,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, 1999, the United Nations Security Council
unanimously approved a six-month extension of the humanitarian
programme after weeks of haggling about future policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The programme, which began to be implemented in late 1996, is
aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by the
stringent U.N. sanctions which have been in place since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted after
Iraq was clarified that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Yeltsin Leaves Kremlin a More Satisfied Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- For months, the question on
Yeltsin's resignation as Russian president has been when rather
than why.
</P>
<P>
He took that step Friday, concluding the Yeltsin era with yet
another political surprise, although rumors about his step-down
had been flying around for some time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Yeltsin had sent shock waves, firing
top aides and prime minister after prime minister in political
maneuvers aimed at strengthening his faltering position.
</P>
<P>
The idea of vacating the Kremlin for a preferred successor
surfaced in Russian press even before Yeltsin picked Vladimir
Putin to replace Yevgeny Primakov, the fourth prime minister to be
sacked in a little over one year, in August.
</P>
<P>
However, political developments later, such as the widely
reported scandal implicating Yeltsin, his family members and close
aides, made it hard for him to take such a move.
</P>
<P>
But this time around, as the world moves to the year 2000, the
going becomes much easier to Yeltsin: his favored political forces
have made a strong showing in the parliamentary elections on
December 19; Putin, his anointed successor, is by far the most
popular politician in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, right after the resignation announcement, Putin
signed a decree providing for "legal, social security and other
guarantees" for Yeltsin and his family members.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one of the key conditions for Yeltsin's
early resignation is the provision of security guarantees for
himself and his family after he leaves the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-dominated State Duma once put forward a motion in
the lower house of parliament to impeach Yeltsin for the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and his order to open fire on
the White House, former seat of the Russian parliament, in 1991.
The impeachment motion was later defeated.
</P>
<P>
There have also been media reports over the years about alleged
involvement in money laundering and other economic scandals by
Yeltsin, his family members and close aides.
</P>
<P>
Putin's decree means that Yeltsin and his family members will
be exempted from criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the emergence of a more pro-government State
Duma and the mounting popularity of Putin enabled Yeltsin to leave
the Kremlin contently.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw how much hope and faith was pinned on a new
generation of politicians at the elections to the State Duma, I
realized that I have fulfilled the main task of my life. Russia
will never go back to the past. Russia will always move forward
now," Yeltsin told the nation in a televised address.
</P>
<P>
"I should not be in the way of the natural course of history.
What's the point of holding on to power when the country has a
strong man worthy to be president and on whom practically every
citizen of Russia pins his hopes for the future now," he said,
referring to Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's approval rating skyrocketed amid a popular military
campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
By and large, Putin will be the biggest gainer of Yeltsin's
resignation. As acting president, he now enjoys media coverage
unrivaled by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
With the next presidential elections moved up by three months
March, the other contestants for the Kremlin now have even less
time to prepare for the race.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 and during the past
few years, he had been dogged by health problems such as
respiratory and heart ailments.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin denied health as the reason that led to his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
"I am leaving not for health reasons, but because of the knot
of problems," he said. "A new generation is coming to replace me.
The generation of those who can do much more and do it better."

CAIRO -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has stressed the

"Our relations with the world countries is strong and it will
get stronger in the future," Mubarak said on Thursday in his end-
of-the-millennium statements to the editor-in-chief of Egypt's Al-
Gomhuria daily, Samir Ragab.

expectations and hopes.
</P>
<P>
He singled out one momentous event in the last decade: Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, which, he regretted, had a
clear negative impact on Arab solidarity and incised a deep wound
in inter-Arab relations still felt till now.
</P>
<P>
Such rifts should be remedied through creative overtures and
well-calculated concessions by Iraq, the AL chief said. (Arab

<HEADLINE> Turkish Leaders Express New Hopes for New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- As the new year is round the
corner, Turkish leaders pledged reforms, democracy and well-being
for the nation in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, President Suleiman Demirel said, "
Turkey, which has proven that republic, democracy, secularism and
Islam are concepts in harmony with each other, is determined to
continue along the same path."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Turkey must keep pace with the world, the president
said, "in this light we must complete as soon as possible the
economic, political, judicial and administrative reforms that we
have begun."
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the parliament, Yildirim Akbulut, said in his new
year message that Turkey's target in the new millenium was to
become one of the world's most developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should make wide-spread reforms in every field, including
local administration, the judicial system, education and social
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker added: "We should revitalize relations between the
state and the people. We should enlarge our democracy and permit
the contributions of non-governmental organizations."
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that
Turkey was entering the year 2000 with great hopes. Noting that the
1999 killer quakes in Turkey, which claimed the lives of tens of
thousands of people, had caused great sorrow in the country, Ecevit
promised to meet the needs of the quake victims.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the year that is passing by, the premier
underscored that it had been a successful year for Turkey in many
aspects, including reforms in the constitution and solving economic
shortcomings.

<HEADLINE> Panama Becomes Absolute Owner of the Interoceanic Waterway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama recovered Friday
here at midday the sovereignty over the interoceanic waterway,
after 85 years of U.S. military occupation.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, in an emotion-charged ceremony, in which
tears of happiness of a big crowd of Panamanians of all the social
strata who gathered before the Panama Canal administration
building were shed, the Panamanian flag was hoisted.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 helium-inflated toy balloons with the colors
of the Panamanian flag crossed the sky and the booming of 21 canon
salvos that announced the full independence of Panama were heard,
a few hours short of the start of the new millennium, in the
moments in which the Panamanian flag flapped in the wind.
</P>
<P>
Panama recovered full sovereignty over the Canal Zone in
compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 by the
Panama and United States governments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro delivered on behalf of the his
government, the official document that represents the reversion of
the interoceanic canal and of the other canal assets, to
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso said in her speech delivered during the historical
ceremony the work of General Omar Torrijos, who negotiated with
former U.S. president Jimmy Carter the signing of the canal
treaties.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso demanded the United States to start in the new
millennium a new kind of relations based in mutual and decided
cooperation and reciprocal respect.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit and the usufruct the Panama canal has given to the
United States geopolitics and economy make mandatory for this
nation to practice the sentiment of brotherhood that its leaders
have touted for decades," said Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said that the United States must start
in this new period an era of trade relations with Panama that will
permit this nation to begin a process of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso also said that in this historical day, with the full
recovery of their sovereignty over their national territory,
Panamanians reach adulthood as a nation.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian president said that from now on there will not
be more fences nor warning posters forbidding Panamanians to enter
the canal zone, where the United States established for 85 years
an exclusive zone with U.S. laws, judges, and policemen.
</P>
<P>
"This territory has become ours again. The shout of total
sovereignty that so many generations have claimed is now a reality
and the canal is ours," she said.
</P>
<P>
In his turn, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said on behalf
of the Armed Forces and the government of President Bill Clinton
that from now on the two nations will advance in the new
millennium as partners.
</P>
<P>
"Let us never forget that progress requires hard work, nor the
challenges President Kennedy asked us to face building new
opportunities that this Canal has permitted," said Caldera.

JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela, who has come to symbolize South Africa's
victory over racism and oppression, on Friday lit a symbolic flame
of hope for the new millennium in his former prison cell on Robben
Island.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony watched by only a handful of people, he handed
the flame to President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The handover, which will be televised at midnight, was one of
the highlights of a multi-million and millennium celebration for
some 500 VIP guests on the island.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who helicoptered in with Mbeki just before 9.30 p.m.,
was earlier greeted with a standing ovation when he entered the
specially-erected marquee next to the island's airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming them, Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe
described Mandela as one of Africa's greatest sons.
</P>
<P>
Radebe, the Cabinet minister tasked with overseeing the
official millennium celebrations, said that as the light on
leadership was carried on into a new era, Mbeki symbolized the
rise of the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Year At Record Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks celebrated
the year-end session with a full slate of records Friday in
confidence that the world financial markets would be free from the
Y2K problem when Year 2000 is rolling in.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 44.26 at 11,497.12,
surpassing the record closing high of 11,484.66 points set
Wednesday. The session ended at 1 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 4.78 at a new high of 1,469.25 and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 32.44 at 4.069.31,
topping the record high of 4.041.46 points set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The great performance put the Dow's year-end rally at 25.2
percent and the S&AMP;P index gained 19.5 percent in the year. The
Nasdaq index emerged as the biggest winner with the gain of 85.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied today as Japan, South Korea and Australia
reported no major troubles with their computers when the new year
rolled in. The positive indications convinced investors that
financial markets in the United States and Europe will enter the
new millennium unscathed by computer malfunctions because the
United States and Europe have spent far more money to deal with
the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected resignation by Russian president Boris Yeltsin
had little impact on the Wall Street stocks.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.09 at 650.30 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 10.85 at 876.97. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 8.16 at 504.75.

<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin, with
2,172 up, 937 down and 419 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.

NYSE volume totaled 372.60 million shears at the close of half-
day trading, down from 533.10 million in the previous full session.

<HEADLINE> CIS, Baltic States React to Yeltsin Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Boris Yeltsin's move Friday to
resign as president of Russia and handing his powers to Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, the acting president, received positive
reactions from other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Noting Yeltsin's visit to Estonia in 1991, when the Russian
president advocated Estonia's independence, President Lennart Meri
of the Baltic state said Yeltsin has won a place for himself in
history.
</P>
<P>
"That (the resignation) was a courageous step, and the
Estonians will keep good impressions of it," Meri said.
</P>
<P>
He said Putin "will carry this load... as acting president, and
the future will show how easy or difficult that path is."
</P>
<P>
Belarus received Yeltsin's resignation with understanding,
President Alexander Lukashenko said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, "under whose leadership Russia has passed through the
hard way of transformation, made a courageous act which will be
worthily assessed by the current and future generations, as well
as the entire international community," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Putin, "who has done a lot for
Belarussian-Russian unification, will be consistently pursuing the
policy aimed at implementing Belarussian- Russian agreements."
</P>
<P>
In Astana, capital of Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Yerlan
Idrisov said Yeltsin's resignation "has opened the way to renewal
and democracy."
</P>
<P>
The move was a "very well-considered step by a major politician,
who has made a sober-minded assessment of the situation in Russia,
and has opened the way for renewal and democracy," Interfax quoted
Idrisov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Boris Nikolayevich's step is worth of praise. It is a step of
a mature statesman," he said, describing the step as " the basis
for stability" in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the next presidential election in spring
2000 would "set out a general strategy" for Russia, a way to"
prosperity, to further democratization."
</P>
<P>
A democratic path in Russia "would do nothing but good to
Kazakh-Russian relations," Idrisov said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Decrees Security Guarantees for Yeltsin, Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a decree providing security
guarantees for Boris Yeltsin, who stepped down earlier in the day
as the Russian head of state.
</P>
<P>
The decree makes immediate provisions for "legal, social
security and other guarantees" for one who has left office as
president "due to the expiry of his term... or who has resigned
before such a date or who has displayed a steady inability for
health reasons to exercise his powers" and for "members of his
family."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one of the key conditions for Yeltsin's
early resignation is the provision of security guarantees for
himself and his family after he leaves the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's decree means that Yeltsin and his family members will
be exempted from criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-dominated State Duma once put forward a motion in
the lower house of parliament to impeach Yeltsin for the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and his order to open fire on
the White House, former seat of the Russian parliament, in 1991.
The impeachment motion was later defeated.
</P>
<P>
There have also been media reports over the years about alleged
involvement in money-laundering and other economic scandals by
Yeltsin and his family members.
</P>
<P>
Under the Putin decree, regardless of his age, a former
president will receive a life pension equivalent to 75 percent of
the presidential salary, the Interfax news agency quoted the
Kremlin press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
If he is elected for another official position, his pension
would be suspended for the period he holds the post.
</P>
<P>
He would be provided with bodyguards both at his permanent
place of residence and during his visits, with special
telecommunications services and with means of transport.
</P>
<P>
Bodyguards would also be provided for members of his family who
live with him or accompany him.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president and members of his family who live with him
would be entitled to the same kind of medical services he had
received when still in office.
</P>
<P>
His life and his health condition would be subject to
compulsory state insurance for a sum equivalent to the annual
presidential salary.
</P>
<P>
He would be immune against prosecution, arrest, bodily search
and interrogation. His right of immunity would extend to his place
of residence, his office if he works, his vehicles, communications
means, baggage and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
After his death, every member of his family would receive a
monthly allowance equivalent to sixfold the minimum old age
pension as of his death date.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Kremlin announced that Alexander Voloshin,
a long-time Yeltsin aide, would continue to serve as head of the
presidential administration. Observers believe the retention of
Voloshin inside the Kremlin means that Yeltsin will continue to
exert certain influences on Russian politics in the future.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief hails Peaceful End to Hijacking of Indian Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan was greatly relieved that the hijacking of an Indian
plane ended peacefully without further loss of life, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is particularly pleased that the
passengers and the crew of the hijacked plane are back in freedom,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reiterates his condemnation of all acts
of terrorism, from whatever quarter," said Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
The 154 passengers and crew were freed at Kandahar airport, in
Afghanistan, after a week-long ordeal. They were released after
India freed three jailed kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
The hijackers freed 28 other passengers last weekend when the
plane landed in the United Arab Emirates. They also handed over
the body of a passenger they stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, a U.N. humanitarian official, Eric
de Maul, tried to ease the discomfort of the passengers while they
were being held hostage by supplying washing materials and flying
in meals from Islamabad, Pakistan, when supplies in kandahar ran
low.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- As South Africans were
celebrating the new millennium, early indications were that the
country has escaped the menace of the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"We are communicating - so it means that everything is still OK!
"the South African telephone company, Telkom, announced in an e-
mail early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Banking Council's e-mail, while not as animated, was
equally as heartening, saying: "ATMs and credit-card point-of-sale
devices are reported to be functioning smoothly and there is no
shortage of cash."
</P>
<P>
"Saswitch -- which allows bank customers to withdraw money from
the ATMs of other banks -- is also operating normally," it said
</P>
<P>
"The Year 2000 Banking Response Center is confident that branch
services will also operate as usual."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the National Y2K Disaster Management Center said:"
Computer-aided systems and services showed no signs of succumbing
to the Millennium Bug, to the huge relief and delight of officials
overseeing the roll-over."
</P>
<P>
The five greater Johannesburg councils said although there had
been a few minor glitches during Friday evening - none were Y2K
related.
</P>
<P>
A statement said lightning struck a Kibler Park power station
temporarily disrupting the civil defense telephone system and

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- There will be no "vacuum of
power" in Russia "for a minute or even a second" after ex-
president Boris Yeltsin's resignation, said Russian Acting
President Vladimir Putin in his New Year address to the nation on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to overstep the federal Constitution will be cut
short resolutely" and the Russians will be able to exercise all
their rights, Putin said in the televised address.
</P>
<P>
Boris Yeltsin's decision to resign as Russian President "
completely conformed to the Constitution" and "It will be possible
only after a while to give a proper assessment of what he has done
for Russia in the last few years," Putin said.

The military, border guard and other security services would

<HEADLINE> U.N. Waiting for Annexes to Iraqi Distribution Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said on Friday that the United Nations is waiting for
annexes to Iraqi distribution plan and the distribution plan has
yet to be submitted in full.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to questions in recent days about
when the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would endorse the
distribution plan for phase seven of the oil-for-food programme.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused the U.N. chief on Thursday of delaying approval
of a foodstuff distribution plan for the current phase of Iraq's
oil-for-food deal with the world body.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the United Nations has received the executive
summary and the proposed allocations by sector, but the Government
of Iraq has yet to submit the annexes to the distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
The annexes list all the items that Iraq intends to procure
under relevant U.N. resolution and they have to be reviewed by the
U.N. Secretariat before the Secretary-General can approve the plan,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, 1999, the United Nations Security Council
unanimously approved a six-month extension of the humanitarian
programme after weeks of haggling about future policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The programme, which began to be implemented in late 1996, is
aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused by the
stringent U.N. sanctions which have been in place since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted after
Iraq was clarified that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Yeltsin Leaves Kremlin a More Satisfied Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 31 (Xinhua) -- For months, the question on
Yeltsin's resignation as Russian president has been when rather
than why.
</P>
<P>
He took that step Friday, concluding the Yeltsin era with yet
another political surprise, although rumors about his step-down
had been flying around for some time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Yeltsin had sent shock waves, firing
top aides and prime minister after prime minister in political
maneuvers aimed at strengthening his faltering position.
</P>
<P>
The idea of vacating the Kremlin for a preferred successor
surfaced in Russian press even before Yeltsin picked Vladimir
Putin to replace Yevgeny Primakov, the fourth prime minister to be
sacked in a little over one year, in August.
</P>
<P>
However, political developments later, such as the widely
reported scandal implicating Yeltsin, his family members and close
aides, made it hard for him to take such a move.
</P>
<P>
But this time around, as the world moves to the year 2000, the
going becomes much easier to Yeltsin: his favored political forces
have made a strong showing in the parliamentary elections on
December 19; Putin, his anointed successor, is by far the most
popular politician in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, right after the resignation announcement, Putin
signed a decree providing for "legal, social security and other
guarantees" for Yeltsin and his family members.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that one of the key conditions for Yeltsin's
early resignation is the provision of security guarantees for
himself and his family after he leaves the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-dominated State Duma once put forward a motion in
the lower house of parliament to impeach Yeltsin for the
disintegration of the Soviet Union and his order to open fire on
the White House, former seat of the Russian parliament, in 1991.
The impeachment motion was later defeated.
</P>
<P>
There have also been media reports over the years about alleged
involvement in money laundering and other economic scandals by
Yeltsin, his family members and close aides.
</P>
<P>
Putin's decree means that Yeltsin and his family members will
be exempted from criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the emergence of a more pro-government State
Duma and the mounting popularity of Putin enabled Yeltsin to leave
the Kremlin contently.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw how much hope and faith was pinned on a new
generation of politicians at the elections to the State Duma, I
realized that I have fulfilled the main task of my life. Russia
will never go back to the past. Russia will always move forward
now," Yeltsin told the nation in a televised address.
</P>
<P>
"I should not be in the way of the natural course of history.
What's the point of holding on to power when the country has a
strong man worthy to be president and on whom practically every
citizen of Russia pins his hopes for the future now," he said,
referring to Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin's approval rating skyrocketed amid a popular military
campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
By and large, Putin will be the biggest gainer of Yeltsin's
resignation. As acting president, he now enjoys media coverage
unrivaled by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
With the next presidential elections moved up by three months
March, the other contestants for the Kremlin now have even less
time to prepare for the race.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 and during the past
few years, he had been dogged by health problems such as
respiratory and heart ailments.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin denied health as the reason that led to his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
"I am leaving not for health reasons, but because of the knot
of problems," he said. "A new generation is coming to replace me.
The generation of those who can do much more and do it better."
