   THE DEMOCRATS:
</P>
<P>
   GAY SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay lobbying group in the
country, has endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president.
Officials of the group will appear with Gore Friday in Los Angeles.
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley have strongly supported gay
issues, from civil rights to combating AIDS, and both have
assiduously courted the gay vote, which makes up a prominent part
of the electorate in both New York and California. But Elizabeth
Birch, executive director of the group, said in an interview that
Gore had a longer record of support that matched deeds to words.
</P>
<P>
   AGREE TO TALK
</P>
<P>
   The Gore and Bradley campaigns have agreed to only two debates
before the March 7 Democratic primaries. The first is scheduled for
Feb. 21 at the Apollo Theater in New York, the second for March 1
in Los Angeles. Bradley has sought at least three others, including
one on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' on March 5, but
advisers to Gore said Thursday that they would not participate
until Bradley agreed to Gore's proposal to discontinue all radio
and television commercials and have two debates a week. Spokesmen
for Bradley accused Gore of not wanting to risk his front-runner
status by stepping into an open forum with Bradley, even though
Gore had said in September, when the polls showed him flagging,
that he would debate Bradley anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW PROSPECTS
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll in South Carolina shows Gov. George W. Bush
ahead of Sen. John McCain, 46 percent to 39 percent. The survey of
likely voters, by the American Research Group, was taken on Monday
through Wednesday. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus four points. In Arizona, an American Research Group poll
conducted from Sunday to Tuesday found 51 percent of likely
Republican voters supported McCain and 33 percent Bush. In
Colorado, a poll conducted between Jan. 27 and last Sunday by
Talmey-Drake Research found Bush had the support of 49 percent of
registered Republicans and McCain 20 percent. On the Democratic
side, Gore led Bradley, 59 percent to 27 percent. In Illinois, a
survey of likely voters by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research found
47 percent of Republicans favored Bush and 29 percent McCain. Among
Democrats, Gore was ahead of Bradley, 57 percent to 35 percent.

DRUG-TESTING POLICY RAISES QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ The only real surprise to come out of the Santa Anita
stewards' hearing Wednesday on Pat Valenzuela's latest drug relapse
was the jockey's statement that the urine test he failed four days
earlier was the first he had been asked to take since he was
relicensed in September.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stewards appeared surprised by that news.
</P>
<P>
   A California Horse Racing Board investigator confirmed
Valenzuela's statement Thursday as the stewards prepared to issue a
ruling this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fink said the CHRB investigators' policy is to order
jockeys and other licensees to submit samples only when they have
cause to suspect drug or alcohol abuse. And since Valenzuela hadn't
shown any physical or behavioral signs, the ``random'' testing
called for by his conditional licensing agreement amounted to
(begin ital)no(end ital) testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt anytime he was not living up to his duties ... we
would pull him in,'' Fink said. ``But nobody approached us (with a
complaint), and every time we saw him he seemed to be behaving
(normally). We hadn't heard anything about him until this
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   After Valenzuela's unexcused absence from last Friday's Santa
Anita races, investigator Mike Harlow phoned to order him to appear
in the CHRB office the following morning. When he walked in
Saturday, Valenzuela admitted taking speed Thursday night, and then
tested positive for the amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the last straw for Valenzuela, 37, who has spent
much of his career serving suspensions for drug-related violations
since riding Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Sunday Silence in
1989. The unique license that brought Valenzuela back from a nearly
two-year suspension was to be revoked if he screwed up again.
</P>
<P>
   And although Valenzuela's attorney, and supporters who included
trainer Bob Baffert, made a moving case Wednesday that the jockey
had been doing everything right in the latest round of his battle
with addiction, it seems likely the stewards will sock him with the
heaviest penalty available to them.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean a suspension through the end of the one-year
license that took effect Sept. 29, 1999. Valenzuela would be
eligible to reapply then. There are no lifetime bans in California
racing.
</P>
<P>
   More than in other sports, racing demands sober athletes because
of the risks somebody literally riding high would pose to other
jockeys and horses. So why not test (begin ital)before(end ital)
there's suspicion of drug use, just to be safe?
</P>
<P>
   Former CHRB chairman Ralph Scurfield thought that would be a
good idea a decade ago, and a committee was set up to study the
logistics of making random drug and alcohol testing a requirement
for applicants for all kinds of racetrack licenses. But the
proposal was shot down by California's unusually restrictive
privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The laws do permit private employers to test job applicants. The
CHRB offers to test barn workers for free. But board spokesman Mike
Marten said few trainers take advantage of the program.
</P>
<P>
   A jockey, even one with a history of addiction, is likely to be
tested only if he signs an agreement for regular tests, like the
thrice-weekly tests Valenzuela took and passed during one of his
earlier comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fink, a former Alcoholic Beverage Control agent who is a 14-year
veteran of the racetrack law-enforcement crew, said he can't
remember a jockey being tested because of erratic riding. Almost
invariably it's a jockey failing to show up for work that signals a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   This means either that drug and alcohol abusers are evading
detection or that the state policy is working when it comes to
keeping the racetrack safe from jockeys under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the greater danger comes from jockeys who are weak or
woozy from the effects of shedding weight. But that's another
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: D. Wayne Lukas hopes Surfside will follow in the
not-so-dainty hoofprints of fillies Winning Colors, Serena's Song
and Althea, using Saturday's Las Virgenes Stakes as a steppingstone
to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The three previous Lukas super fillies went into the Derby as
contenders, Winning Colors capturing the race in 1988. But he
didn't plan Derby bids for them until after they'd won the Santa
Anita Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking Derby all the way,'' Lukas said of his big
plans for Surfside, the daughter of Seattle Slew and Flanders who
will go for her sixth win in eight starts when she and Pat Day
break from post 1 against three overmatched opponents Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' Triple Crown hopefuls include High Yield, Exchange Rate,
Commendable and a maiden named Generations. He describes the
overall 3-year-old picture as ``gray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really taken shape,'' Lukas said. ``We have some
sharp little horses running around the country. But until we start
stretching them out (to run longer distances), we won't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Could be a good year for a filly. &QL;

   A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Corey
Nakatani, 37 wins; Kent Desormeaux, 27; David Flores and Alex
Solis, 23; Laffit Pincay, 20. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 18; Bobby
Frankel, 17; Vladimir Cerin, Ron Ellis, Richard Mandella and Ron
McAnally, 8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pincay watch: The world's winningest jockey, on another streak,
has ridden at least one winner at Santa Anita for eight consecutive
days, including Wine With Pride in Thursday's second race. Pincay's
total is up to 8,865. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $200,000 Las
Virgenes Stakes, 3-year-old fillies, 1 mile; Sunday, $200,000 Santa
Maria Handicap, fillies and mares 4 and up, 1 1/16 miles. At Bay
Meadows: Saturday, $100,000 Golden State Mile, 3-year-olds, 1 mile
on turf. At Gulfstream Park: Saturday, $200,000 Gulfstream Park
Breeders' Cup Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 miles on turf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mileposts: Trainer J.E. ``Cotton'' Tinsley, 72, announced his
retirement Wednesday at Santa Anita, having saddled the last of his
312 career winners, Joya de Saros, Aug. 14 at Del Mar. Tinsley's
most historic winner might have been Teacher's Art, whose Aug. 1,
1966 victory at Arlington was Laffit Pincay's first in the United
States.... Russell Baze continued to monopolize the National Turf
Writers Association's Isaac Murphy Award, presented annually to the
American jockey with the highest winning percentage. Baze, who
rides mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area, led for the fifth
straight year, winning 373 races and 28.1 percent. Jerry Bailey was
second at 24.8.... Churchill Downs Inc. unveiled new logos for
Hollywood Park and its four other racetrack properties. Each
features the track name under Churchill's trademark Twin Spires.
The ``branding program'' is a step toward company initiatives such
as the planned Churchill Downs Simulcast Network.... Hollywood
Futurity winner Captain Steve suffered his first setback of the
Kentucky Derby prep season when he came out of a third-place finish
in the Santa Catalina Stakes with a bruised foot. Bob Baffert said
the injury cost the 3-year-old three days of training and will
delay his next start until the March 12 Louisiana Derby.... The 387
nominees for the May 6 Derby, May 20 Preakness and June 10 Belmont
Stakes include 21 horses trained by D. Wayne Lukas and a record 24
from Europe and the Middle East.... Early probables for the March 4
Santa Anita Handicap: Bagshot, Budroyale, Cat Thief, Chester House,
General Challenge and Six Below. Strub Stakes runner-up Luftikus is
unlikely to run.... Stephen Got Even, nominated to the Big 'Cap
before his victory in the NTRA series-opening Donn Handicap last
Saturday, isn't expected to run here, as trainer Nick Zito hopes to
spread the 4-year-old's races. &QL;

   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ Billy Mayfair and Fred Couples stood on the
10th tee on the North Course at Torrey Pines Golf Course Thursday,
sporting pretty much the same amazed look Pavel Bure and Teemu
Selanne had worn when they stumbled, sleepy-eyed, onto the ice for
a practice session a day before Sunday's All-Star Game in Toronto
and realized the Air Canada Centre was packed to the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Morning skates and opening rounds of non-majors on the PGA Tour
typically are the ``Sports Night'' of sporting events; no matter
how accomplished the players, no matter how compelling the drama,
they just don't attract the masses.
</P>
<P>
   It was different in Toronto because they worship hockey there
and different at Torrey Pines because they worship Tiger Woods
here.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans stood three and four deep for almost the
entire length of the 416-yard opening hole to ogle Woods, the
playing partner of Mayfair and Couples, turning the tee box into a
veritable altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people out there,'' Couples confirmed
after performing an act some might say came dangerously close to
sacrilege. He outplayed Woods, carding a 4-under-par 68 to Woods's
71. Mayfair, who spent much of the afternoon addressing putts
against a backdrop of a herd thundering to the next tee, shot a 75.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were too big for the volunteer marshals to control.
But enough about all the reporters and cameramen who walked the
course with Woods, the better to record his every stroke and sigh.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' galleries usually are as lively as a revival meeting,
their cries piercing golf's natural reserve. When Woods strode into
view on this day, though, the reception he received was more
respectful than raucous. In the muted greeting you could hear
homage being paid to the golfer's celestial string of six
consecutive tournament wins.
</P>
<P>
   Only Byron Nelson has won more weeks in a row and since his
streak of 11 victories came more than 50 years ago, Woods stands as
the most identifiable icon for more generations than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Immortality can be more of a drag to wear than a forced smile,
as Woods would discover anew on this day. Under skies thick with
clouds and expectations, the 24-year-old labored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those days where I didn't have it,'' said
Woods, who didn't hit a fairway with a tee shot until his fifth
hole and was putting with such little feel he considered himself
blessed to make the turn at 1-over par.
</P>
<P>
   One putt over par is perfectly acceptable on a day as blustery
as this. Unless, of course, you're swinging from a pedestal that
extends to the heavens. Then a first-nine score of 37 engenders
adjectives such as ``awful'' and ``horrible'' from spectators
speaking in tones so hushed you'd think they were talking about a
man on the prowl for his seventh wife, not his seventh straight
win.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a three-time U.S. Amateur champion who, despite his youth
has had plenty of time to get used to the expectations he carries
around like weights in his pockets, was philosophical about being
six shots behind leader Davis Love III with 54 holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I've been playing, you think I would have felt more
comfortable than I did,'' Woods said. ``But that's just the way
golf is sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering how he came back from nearly missing the cut here
last year to win, Woods said, ``There are a lot of holes to play. I
proved that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighter jets on routine training missions in and out of Miramar
Naval Air Base flew over the course all afternoon but we're pretty
sure the rumble that we heard after Woods uttered that comment was
the sound of 155 golfers' hearts dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Woods doesn't require much ground to make his
patented charges. He erased seven strokes in seven holes in his
ambush of 63-hole leader Matt Gogel in Pebble Beach on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That victory _ Woods' 17th in 72 starts as a professional _ left
a lot of people wondering if Tiger's father Earl was more prophetic
than preposterous a couple of years back with all his ``my son the
Messiah'' talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to get a better understanding of my
ability to play this game,'' Woods said. ``My dad has always
believed in me. I think that's what you heard and that's what you
saw, a father who is proud of his son.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the son has commanded quite a following. One of the
people Woods has converted to golf was getting quite a few
double-takes from other gallery members Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Khoi Ross, a 27-year-old from El Cajon, looks like he could be
Woods' twin and not just because he was dressed from head to toe on
this day in red and black _ Tiger's power colors.
</P>
<P>
   Ross started playing golf six months ago after watching Woods'
success from afar. On Thursday he got his first up-close look at
his inspiration and admitted it was sort of like looking in a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go golfing a lot and a lot of people do mistake me for
Tiger,'' Ross said. ``Then when they see me swing, they say, `Nope.
He's definitely not Tiger.'''
</P>
<P>
   No shame there. Right now, no one comes close.

ALASKA AIRLINES REPORT BRINGS FAA ORDER ON TAIL SECTION

   WASHINGTON _ Alaska Airlines said Thursday that a check of the
mechanism that moves the horizontal stabilizer on jetliners of the
MD-80 series had turned up metal shavings on two of the carrier's
planes, and the Federal Aviation Administration promptly ordered
all domestic airlines to complete inspections of similar planes for
signs of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The order, to inspect a variety of components in the
stabilizer's assembly, including the jackscrew that moves it,
follows the crash last week of an Alaska Airlines MD-83 whose crew
had reported a stabilizer problem. The crash, some 40 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered damage to the jackscrew was found on one
Alaska Airlines plane in Portland, Ore., and another in Seattle.
The airline is keeping those two planes on the ground, awaiting the
arrival of federal investigators, but said it had found no problems
with 29 other jetliners of the MD-80 series in its fleet; its
remaining three MD-80s are out of service for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's order to all domestic carriers does not call for any
planes to be grounded, but the inspections must be completed within
three days.
</P>
<P>
   The order applies to 1,100 planes of the MD-80 series or similar
design, including MD-90s, DC-9s and Boeing 717s. Problems must be
reported to the FAA promptly, said Paul Takemoto, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the order does not apply to 800 other such planes used
around the world, foreign airlines often follow the agency's
directives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what effect the order, issued late
Thursday, would have on airline schedules. Bob Baker, vice chairman
of American Airlines, said, ``We will have to read the directive
before we can determine what impact it might have.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it could not calculate the effect on schedules and
was putting the emphasis on safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that it's far more important that we get these
aircraft inspected,'' said Thomas E. McSweeny, the FAA's associate
administrator for regulation and certification. ``I think the
average member of the traveling public will understand the delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The order followed by a day a recommendation from Boeing that
carriers inspect the jackscrews. By Thursday, airlines had already
begun the checks, and, except for the two Alaska Airlines planes,
there were no immediate reports of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board
and Boeing were on their way to Portland and Seattle to examine
those two planes' jackscrews, which control the position of the
horizontal stabilizer, a movable surface on the tail that helps
keep the plane level.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer on the jetliner that crashed last week had begun
shifting gradually to a nose-down position and then went abruptly
to a position that caused the jet to dive more than a mile,
investigators have concluded. The pilots briefly regained control
and were able to execute some maneuvers. But they lost control
again, and the plane went into a final dive.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy recovered the jackscrew from that plane Tuesday, and
metal shavings, like those discovered on the two planes in Portland
and Seattle, were found curled around the two-foot-long
part. &UR;  &LR; Investigators have not yet determined whether the part was
damaged before the plane developed problems and corkscrewed into
the Pacific, or whether the crash itself caused the damage. But
such shavings typically indicate wear on a nut that travels along
the screw.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday the Navy recovered that nut from the Pacific
wreckage, and it will be sent to Washington for analysis, as was
the jackscrew earlier.

VACANT SEATS FOR REGENTS DRAW A CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The neurologist from Great Neck wanted the schools to
pay more attention to disabled students. The malpractice lawyer
from Katonah proposed setting up fact-finding committees on
hot-button issues like school vouchers. The former civil rights
lawyer said he had been inspired to fight for better public schools
by his fourth-grade teacher in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they sat in a witness chair Thursday at a state
legislative hearing and made impassioned pleas to go from obscurity
to a seat on the state Board of Regents, which has in recent years
emerged from having a relatively passive role in education to
becoming one of the most assertive school policy making bodies in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 16 seats on the board are vacant this year, and to
avoid the appearance that the seats were being filled through
back-room deals, the Legislature is conducting an open casting call
to anyone who sent in a resume. Eighty people applied _ a record
according to some legislative leaders _ even though the job pays
nothing but expenses and requires three trips a month to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates were players in state politics and education.
Others, like Thomas S. Schultz, the neurologist from Long Island,
had read about the opening in the classified section of their local
newspaper. Like Smith, Frank Capra's naive but idealistic freshman
senator, they wanted to go to a political capital to make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The seven vacancies have occurred as the Board of Regents has
become increasingly prominent and controversial. In the last five
years, it has set tough new standards for high school graduation,
threatened to shut down substandard teachers' colleges, and banned
remedial programs from the City University of New York's four-year
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The high number of vacancies stems partly from the ripple
effects of changes in the term of the regents to five years from
seven. Insiders said many of the posts will go to the five
incumbents seeking reappointment. One of the vacancies, though, was
created when Harold O. Levy, a New York City regent, was appointed
interim chancellor of the New York City school system. The novel
notion that being a regent might now be a career path to the leader
of the nation's biggest school system made the job even more
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's candidates were also mindful that the ranks of august
former regents include the likes of Alexander Hamilton; John Jay;
Kenneth Clark, the sociologist and civil rights leader; Whitelaw
Reid, the owner of The New York Tribune; and Owen D. Young,
ambassador to France and president of the Union Pacific Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. George Pataki has his way, the new crop of regents could
be appointed only to find their jobs legislated out of existence.
Pataki argues that the regents are too political, and wants to
abolish the positions. He wants direct control of the state
education commissioner, now appointed by the regents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates thought this was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see education becoming a political football, and
it certainly is in New York City,'' said Judith A. Aydelott, the
malpractice lawyer from Katonah, adding that she thought control by
the governor would surely make it even more so.

<P>
   Gus Johnson, a drummer for some of the great jazz bands from the
1930s to the '50s, including those led by Count Basie and Benny
Goodman, died on Sunday at Clear Creek Care Center in Westminster,
Colo. He was 86 and lived in North Glen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was one of the most highly rated swing drummers of his
day. Born in Tyler, Tex., he moved to Kansas City, Mo., after high
school, worked in a vocal quartet and then became an itinerant
musician. He worked with Jo Jones in Omaha and the pianist Ernest
``Speck'' Redd in Iowa, then returned to Kansas City in 1938 to
join Jay McShann's group during the period when Charlie Parker was
its star alto player, staying until 1943. After two years of Army
service, he played with Eddie ``Cleanhead'' Vinson in Chicago and
with the last edition of Earl Hines' big band in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The trombonist and singer Clyde E.B. Bernhardt, who appeared
with Johnson and the McShann band at the Savoy Ballroom in New
York, recalled in his memoirs that Johnson ``was exciting to see''
and ``had a way of soaking his slick hair with a wet towel before
one of his wild solos'' so that the water would ``come spraying off
like sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Johnson joined the Basie organization, replacing Jo
Jones, one of the original builders of the band's signature
rhythmic drive. Basie was Johnson's steady employer until Johnson
was stricken with appendicitis in December 1954, at which point he
was replaced by Sonny Payne.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Johnson became a freelancer, keeping a few extended
jobs with singers like Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne. He recorded
with Woody Herman, Charlie Byrd and Gerry Mulligan, among others.
In the early 70s he played with the World's Greatest Jazz Band, a
classic-jazz repertory group founded by Yank Lawson and Bob
Haggart. In the '60s and '70s, when he wasn't playing, he served as
an auxiliary police officer in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 Johnson moved to Colorado, where he performed in many of
the Colorado Jazz Parties organized by the producer Dick Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mildred E. Johnson of North Glen;
three daughters, Michelle Braxton of Aurora, Colo., Amelia von
Hauer of Los Angeles and Marcia E. Johnson of North Glen; a son,
Gus Johnson III, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.

CLAUDE RAYMOND, 70, DUVALIER ERA GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Gen. Claude Raymond, a feared chief of staff of the
Haitian army and minister of the interior and defense during the
successive dictatorships of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his
son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' died in the Haitian capital,
Port-au-Prince, either Sunday or Wednesday, according to reports
from Haiti. His age was given as 70.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond had been imprisoned without trial by the current Haitian
authorities since July 1996, although courts had called three times
for his release, citing lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Constantin Mayard-Paul, described him as a political
prisoner. The International Civilian Mission, whose task is to
watch over the respect of human rights in Haiti, protested against
his continued detention.
</P>
<P>
   He died from a kidney ailment, Agence France-Presse reported. He
was transferred to St. Francois de Sales Hospital in Port-au-Prince
from the national penitentiary four days before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, trained in Mexico, was appointed chief of the Haitian
army late in the elder Duvalier's life, when he was seeking to
reinforce the transfer of power to his son.
</P>
<P>
   The general became defense and interior minister under the
younger Duvalier, when he came to power in 1971 after the death of
his father, who had ruled Haiti for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond held his posts only briefly. Jean-Claude Duvalier
was forced into exile in France after a popular uprising in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The general tried to run for president in 1987, 1988 and 1990.
But each time he was barred by Haiti's electoral authorities. They
declared, in disqualifying him in 1987, that he had been a key
figure in Jean-Claude Duvalier's tyrannical government. Haiti's
1987 Constitution bars criminal supporters of past dictators from
running for office until 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Raymond, who still enjoyed some prestige among the
ranks, was arrested while attending a voodoo festival in Haiti's
Central Plateau area. He was accused of committing ``terrorist acts
in the framework of a process to destabilize public authority and
order.''
</P>
<P>
   His imprisonment ensued. Many Haitians suspected that he had
overseen the fatal shooting and hacking of a number of voters by
what has been called a death squad at Argentine Bellegarde High
School in Port-au-Prince at election time in 1987. He denied the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The general's son, Claude Raymond Jr., contended on the radio at
the time that his father's arrest was ``a vast joke,'' and declared
that his father was ``retired from political life.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point Raymond was considered one of the main
``neo-Duvalierist'' political figures. But in an interview in 1990
he described himself as just one of several democratically inclined
candidates who were pinning their hopes for an end to chaos in
Haiti on the elections in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview the general seemed to take umbrage at
questions about his involvement in political violence, including
the 1987 high school killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want arms at all in my camp,'' he said, speaking in
Port-au-Prince at a former hotel, where he lived. While two dozen
rough-hewn, bored-looking men sat in the lobby area outside, he
said, ``I have been attacked too many times to tolerate the
presence of arms in my entourage.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about survivors was not immediately available.  &QL;

 McCAIN FINDS SUPPORT FROM ODD CORNER: LOBBYISTS  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain appeared by satellite Thursday
night before a roomful of Washington lawyers and lobbyists who paid
$1,000 each to hear him denounce Washington's ``iron triangle'' of
money, lobbyists and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has made reforming what he calls the corruption of money
in politics a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. But his
rival for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
has criticized him for accepting campaign donations from
representatives of special interests and those who have business
before the Senate Commerce Committee, which McCain heads.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lobbyists who attended Thursday night's event in
Washington wore buttons reading, ``McCain voted against my bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was a part of a money-raising trifecta that McCain
executed Thursday night. He appeared in person at a fund-raiser in
South Carolina, by satellite hook-up at 17 sites around the nation,
and in cyberspace in the first political fund-raising chat on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a ballroom of the Willard Hotel in Washington, about 200
contributors, many of them lawyers and lobbyists, heard McCain give
a version of his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the special interests out of Washington,'' he
told the representatives of many of these special interests.
``Until the last breath I draw, I will fight to stop soft money and
to give this government back to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded politely.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, McCain said, ``There are good and honorable
people watching tonight in Washington, and they are tired of being
dunned'' for huge political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Furman, a lobbyist for utilities, said he supported McCain
even though the senator had opposed an airport expansion project of
one of Furman's clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love John McCain,'' Furman said. ``He's a genuine American
hero. I've never been more honored or proud to support anyone for
president in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the satellite feed ended, McCain spent an hour
taking questions over the Internet from supporters who paid $100
each to participate in an online question-and-answer session with a
tiny video image of McCain in the corner of their Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife, Cindy, read the questions, which addressed topics
that included the Naval Academy's honor code, Internet taxation and
the investigation into the fund-raising methods used by the
Clinton-Gore campaign of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The chat began a few minutes late because of technical glitches,
and had a few rocky moments, but it served as a milepost in fund
raising in the digital age. McCain's message online was consistent
with what he has been saying in scores of flesh-and-blood campaign
appearances. It was the medium, in this instance, that was the
novelty.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet event raised $50,000 from the 500 people who signed
up.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is drawing on technology to try to speed donations to his
surging challenge against Bush. He is trying to collect $7 million
in the next few weeks to mount a credible campaign in the two dozen
Republican primaries that occur before the midde of March.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has raised $2.5 million on through his Internet site
alone since his unexpected thrashing of Bush in the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The first question in Thursday's online session came from a
young man named Jeffrey who said he was entering the Naval Academy
this summer and wanted the senator's thoughts on honor and
integrity in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the
academy and was in constant disciplinary trouble there, said the
``major mission'' of the president was to inspire young Americans
to commit themselves to a cause greater than their own
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who knows whereof he spoke, told his cyber correspondent
not to let the hazing and academic rigor of the academy shake his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year will end, Jeffrey,'' McCain said. ``Sometimes
you won't believe that, but the first year will end.

SYD CASSYD, WHO ENVISIONED TV ACADEMY, DIES AT 91  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Syd Cassyd, whose idea it was to found the Academy of Television
Arts and Sciences, which gives the Emmy Awards, died on Friday at
his home in Los Angeles. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Cassyd was working for a trade publication when he had the idea,
and in 1946 he organized a meeting of influential figures in the
new world of television.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that television, then in its infancy, had the
potential for enormous growth, so the purpose of the 1946 gathering
was to talk about creating an organization like the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had been giving the Academy
Awards, known as Oscars, since 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The television academy's first president was the ventriloquist
Edgar Bergen, and it grew quickly, as Cassyd recalled in a 1996
interview. Cassyd was president of the academy in 1950 and held
other posts there over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The first Emmy statuettes were awarded in 1949. The name was
loosely adapted from Immy, the nickname for a piece of television
equipment then in use, the image orthicon camera.
</P>
<P>
   Cassyd was born in Teaneck, N.J. He served as a film editor in
the Army Signal Corps in World War II and moved to Los Angeles
after his discharge. His early television activities included
working for an experimental television station in Los Angeles and
producing children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Miriam, and a daughter, Donna. &QL;

WILFRED C. SMITH, 83, SCHOLAR OF RELIGIOUS PLURALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilfred Cantwell Smith, a scholar of Islam and comparative
religions who took an early lead in urging intellectual
understanding of religious pluralism and dialogue among faiths,
died on Monday in a hospital in Toronto. He was 83 and lived in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, Brian
Cantwell Smith, of Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toronto who twice held professorships at Harvard
University, Smith had a career that crossed cultural and religious
boundaries in a life that reflected the encounter of different
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   While teaching at a Christian college in British-ruled India in
the 1940s, he researched his first book, a study of Islam in that
region and was ordained a Presbyterian minister. He supported the
cause of Indian independence, but hoped that the future nation
would embrace both Hindu and Muslim populations, rather than be
partitioned as India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfred Cantwell Smith was born July 21, 1916, a son of Victor
Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell Smith. He developed an
interest in Islam while traveling through Europe and the Middle
East at 17, with his mother, a professor of classics. In Cairo, he
began learning Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Canada, he enrolled in the University of
Toronto, where he met his future wife, Muriel MacKenzie Struthers.
After graduation, the couple moved to Cambridge, England, where he
continued his studies, then to Lahore, in what is now Pakistan,
where he taught and his wife completed a medical degree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, after receiving a doctorate in Islamic studies from
Princeton University, he was hired by McGill University in
Montreal, where he established its Institute of Islamic Studies,
recruiting a faculty of Muslim and non-Muslim scholars, an unusual
endeavor at that time.
</P>
<P>
   His sensitivity to religious and cultural currents in the Middle
East was reflected in his second book, ``Islam in Modern History''
(Princeton, 1957), in which he said Muslims would regain a sense of
regional self-confidence when they felt there was a revival of
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1979, The New York Times invited Smith to join other
scholars for a discussion on the Iranian revolution. He said that
there was a belief among Muslims in the Middle East that an era of
backwardness was ending and that they felt the change must entail a
rejection of Western influence.
</P>
<P>
   He said Americans, upset by the takeover of their embassy in
Tehran, should understand that young Iranians had felt victimized
by Western support for the government of Iran's shah, who was
overthrown by the revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that we have done amiss in the past few months, 15
years, three centuries, that gives rise to this explosion?'' he
asked. ``Partly, Western imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Smith began moving into comparative religious
studies, a transition marked by publication of ``The Meaning and
End of Religion'' (Macmillan, 1963).
</P>
<P>
   John L. Esposito, a theologian who is the director of the Center
for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University, said
Smith argued in the book that the Western belief that religion is a
private matter is a recent concept, a product of the Enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wrote that two centuries ago the word ``religion'' _
meaning Christianity, Judaism, Islam or another faith _ ``broadly
meant a way of life,'' Esposito said. ``It's still a pioneering
concept when you look at debates over fundamentalism and the role
of religion and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Smith moved to Harvard as director of the Center for
the Study of World Religions. Although he returned to Canada in
1973 to set up a department of comparative religion at Dalhousie
University in Nova Scotia, he came back to Harvard five years later
to head a new program in religious studies in the university's
faculty of arts and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1984, he was appointed a senior research
associate on the faculty of divinity at Trinity College at the
University of Toronto. Last month, he was made an officer in the
Order of Canada, the country's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Carman, a professor of divinity and comparative religion
at the Harvard Divinity School, said Smith ``felt you had to create
institutions and you had to have real live people passing through
those institutions and their lives would be shaped by doctoral
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   While on his second tour at Harvard, Smith completed a book on
religious pluralism, ``Towards a World Theology'' (Westminster,
1981), in which he argued it was possible to discern historical and
metaphysical connections among the major religious faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``That becomes a real basis for dialogue'' among scholars of
different faiths, said William A. Graham, professor of the history
of religion and Islamic studies at Harvard and chairman of its
department of Near Eastern languages and civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was much more concerned with trying to forge intellectual
corridors of interchange, whereby very serious people in their own
communities could understand very serious people in other
communities,'' said Graham, who studied under Smith in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Carman said that despite Smith's interest in developing ``a
theology of the human race'' he was rooted in his Canadian
Protestantism. ``There was a kind of old-fashioned conservatism
about his style,'' Carman said. ``In a very basic sense, saying
your prayers was important.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, Smith is survived by four other
children in Canada, Arnold Smith of Ottawa, Julian Smith of
Appleton, Heather Branch of Toronto and Rosemary Mountain of
Montreal, and 10 grandchildren.

MAE FAGGS STARR, CHAMPION   AND TRACK MENTOR, DIES AT 67  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Tenn., Ala., Ariz., Pa., N.J., Ind., Britain, Finland,
Italy, Australia)  By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mae Faggs Starr, an Olympic champion sprinter and the first
renowned athlete of the Tigerbelle women's track teams at Tennessee
State University, died Jan. 27 at her home in Woodlawn, Ohio. She
was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Eddie Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, when women's track and field began its emergence,
the Tigerbelles became a national force. Tennessee State's most
heralded sprinter would be Wilma Rudolph, who at the 1960 Games in
Rome became the first American woman to capture three gold medals
in a single Olympics. Faggs, known as ``the mother of the
Tigerbelles,'' was the first American woman to compete in three
Olympics and was a mentor to Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, she ran the first leg
on the 400 relay that captured a gold medal in a world-record 45.9
seconds, teaming with Barbara Jones, who would go on to Tennessee
State; Catherine Hardy; and Janet Moreau.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, Faggs ran on an
all-Tennessee State 400 relay squad _ with Rudolph, Margaret
Matthews and Isabelle Daniels _ that won a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Faggs won 11 national Amateur Athletic Union titles and was
inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in
Indianapolis in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Aeriwentha Mae Faggs was born in Mays Landing, N.J., but grew up
in New York City. She was a student at Bayside High School in
Queens when, at age 16, she competed in the 1948 Olympics in
London, failing to qualify for the 200-meter finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1952, she left for Tennessee State, a
historically black school in Nashville. She had never been in the
South and was warned by her father about the segregation she would
face. But she thrived at Tennessee State, having been the first
athlete recruited by Ed Temple, who would build a national
reputation as the Tennessee State women's track coach and an
Olympic coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a lot of determination, a lot of drive,'' Temple
recalled Tuesday from his home in Nashville. ``She didn't back off
from anybody, and she was a good student.''
</P>
<P>
   Faggs was tested early on by her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already a national outdoor champion, I was national
indoor champion, I had been to the Olympics,'' she recalled in an
interview with Runner's World magazine in 1993. ``My teammates, all
they cared about in practice was running past Mae Faggs. You
couldn't let your guard down at all because if one ran past you ...
hey. They turned around and gave you one of those looks that said,
`Uh-huh, I got you now.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the Melbourne Games coming up, Faggs was trying for her
third Olympic berth while Rudolph was a teen-ager hoping for her
first. At the U.S. trials, Faggs set out to steady Rudolph's nerves
with the finals of the 200 meters in sight even though they would
compete against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Wilma was nervous because she was only 16, and I knew
how nervous I was at 16 trying to make the Olympic team,'' Faggs
remembered. ``So I told her: `You do everything I do.' And she
says, `OK'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 200, Wilma was on the inside lane, I was in the second
lane, and I couldn't see her coming out of the corner of my eye. So
I turned my head and said, `Come on.' And she said, `I'm coming.'
And she was coming. I mean, she was blowing down that straightaway.
I had to reach back and get some of those horses I didn't think I
had to beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Tennessee State, Faggs received a master's
degree from the University of Cincinnati and then taught physical
education at high schools in the Cincinnati area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eddie
Starr II, of Phoenix, and a daughter, Evelyn Starr, of Pittsburgh;
two brothers, Melvin Faggs, of New York City, and Steve Murray, of
Huntsville, Ala.; and two grandchildren.

   Pablo Elvira, a Puerto Rican-born baritone who became a regular
member of the New York City Opera in the 1970s and '80s and sang
frequently with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Saturday at his
home in Bozeman, Mont. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   A coroner's report said that he died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 24, 1937, in San Juan, Elvira was the son of a
dance orchestra leader and began his musical life playing trumpet
in his father's group. Later he formed his own jazz band.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with the Puerto Rican cellist and conductor Pablo
Casals led to his pursuing a career as an opera singer. In 1960
Casals finished work on a biblical oratorio, ``El Pessebre,'' one
of the cellist's small body of compositions. Needing five soloists
for a recording and tour of the work, Casals heard Elvira audition
and asked him to sing the baritone part.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elvira's most memorable performances of ``El Pessebre''
came in 1969, when Casals, by then 92, conducted it in Jerusalem
before an audience of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, while participating in the Metropolitan Opera Auditions
in New York, Elvira was heard by the dean of the Indiana University
School of Music in Bloomington, who asked the young baritone to
join the voice faculty. Elvira remained there for eight years
teaching and performing. In 1972 he sang the title role in the
world premiere of John Eaton's opera ``Heracles,'' which
inaugurated the university's 1,460-seat Musical Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   He left Bloomington in 1974, toured and performed in Europe and
then moved to New York, where he made his debut that year with City
Opera as Germont in Verdi's ``Traviata.'' He performed often with
the company, notably as Enrico in Donizetti's ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' in a production that starred Beverly Sills. He won
praise for his robust though not large voice, focused tone, solid
technique and generally lively acting.
</P>
<P>
   His Met debut came in 1979 as Tonio. There he was heard as
Lescaut in Puccini's ``Manon Lescaut'' with Renata Scotto and
Placido Domingo in 1980 and as Rossini's Figaro opposite Marilyn
Horne in 1982, among other roles. His final Met performance was as
Figaro in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His last appearance at City Opera was in 1989 as the title
character in Verdi's ``Rigoletto.'' Elvira is survived by his wife,
Signe; a son, Pablo; and two brothers.

ION GHEORGHE MAURER, ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER FROM 1961-74, DIES AT
97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ion Gheorghe Maurer, who was prime minister, foreign minister
and titular head of state of independent-minded Communist Romania
from the 1950s to the 1970s, died Tuesday in Bucharest, the
Romanian capital, where he lived. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, whose name is pronounced yon gay-OR-gay MAO-rer, came
from a middle-class background, was trained as a lawyer, and became
a longtime Communist and a member of the Romanian Politburo.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer, who had joined the then-illegal Communist Party in 1936,
was elected prime minister in 1961 by Romania's Grand National
Assembly and held the post until 1974. As prime minister he was the
country's second-ranking Communist, after the party leader, Nicolae
Ceausescu.Both men sought the greatest possible freedom of action
inside the Soviet bloc. That sometimes led to disagreements with
the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, and earlier, Maurer was closely involved in
forming his country's foreign policy. He also repeatedly sought to
play a conciliatory role in the ideological rift between the Soviet
Union and China, which grew more and more acerbic beginning in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the official Romanian press agency, Agerpres, reported
that he asked to be released from the premiership for reasons of
age _ he was 71 _ and health. He had been badly hurt when his jeep
flipped during a hunting trip in 1970. When he was 75, he withdrew
from politics without saying why.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer had a brief stint as his country's appointed foreign
minister in 1957 and 1958. Then, early in 1958, he was elected
chairman of the presidium of the Grand National Assembly. He held
that post, and was ex officio head of state, until 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He was a teacher's son, a native of Bucharest and partly of
German descent. After receiving his law degree from the University
of Bucharest, he did legal work for years for Ceausescu and other
Communists and also for banks. He spent time in jail because of his
Communist views, but after Romania acquired a Communist-led
coalition government in 1945 and was proclaimed a Communist
people's republic in 1947, he rose to hold various party and
government posts before becoming foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   An early marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former
Elena Stanescu, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Jan, and a daughter.

GENE THERAPY MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED 20 CHILDREN TO LETHAL VIRUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn., Pa.) (lh) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As many as 20 children with brain cancer may have
been accidentally exposed to the viruses that cause AIDS and
hepatitis C during a gene therapy experiment at hospitals in
Houston and Memphis, a Clinton administration official said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration was notified last Friday about
the possible problem by researchers at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, which had been running the experiment for the
past two and a half to three years with scientists at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. The FDA is investigating, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The children were given a gene therapy ``vector''_ a corrective
gene, encased in a weakened cold virus _ that may have been
tainted. But whether they were exposed to the AIDS or hepatitis
viruses remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has a sample of the material, is testing it, and it
may be a few days before we have any preliminary findings,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier tests suggesting that the vector may have been
contaminated could turn out to be false, the official said.
Nonetheless, he added, ``This is a serious concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the FDA had taken ``immediate action'' but declined to
be specific. Typically, the agency suspends experiments when safety
problems emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unclear whether patients and their families were
immediately informed. A report in Friday's issue of The Washington
Post quoted researchers involved in the experiment as saying that
they had learned of the possible problem in December, but did not
begin informing patients and their families until after federal
regulators were notified. In an interview Thursday night, the
administration official said the institutions involved ``had been
working to inform the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The therapy was to test a treatment for children with
neuroblastoma, a form of brain cancer, and involved the use of a
corrective gene encased in a weakened cold virus, adenovirus. That
same virus was used in a gene therapy experiment that killed an
18-year-old patient, Jesse Gelsinger, at the University of
Pennsylvania last September.
</P>
<P>
   The death has prompted increased scrutiny of the gene therapy, a
10-year-old field in which scientists are trying to prevent, or
treat, a wide range of diseases by giving patients healthy genes to
make up for deficient ones. Last month the FDA shut down all gene
therapy research at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Also since the death, federal officials have learned that gene
therapy researchers were routinely failing to follow government
rules requiring them report patients' side effects to the National
Institutes of Health. When the institutes' officials surveyed
scientists using the adenovirus, they found that of more than 600
``adverse events'' that should have been reported immediately, only
39 were reported.

TESSERACT SCHOOLS SAY THEY'LL STAY OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY LAURA TRUJILLO AND HAL MATTERN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The elite Tesseract school chain will assure parents that its
schools will remain open, despite a financial tailspin so severe
that the Nasdaq dropped Tesseract's stock listing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This comes one week after Tesseract's interim chief executive
officer and financial officer resigned and months after the company
closed three schools outside Arizona and laid off one-fourth of its
central office staff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The company oversees 5,000 Phoenix area students in three
private schools, 13 charter schools and 22 Sunrise preschools. It
also owns one school in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The chain once operated schools across the country, with as many
as 9,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Its stock dropped from its peak of $48.50 in 1993 to 56 cents a
share at the end of trading Thursday, prompting the Nasdaq
Composite Index to dump it.
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract is a national pioneer in the growing business of
for-profit companies running publicly funded charter schools.
Experts say its problems shouldn't slow the pace of such
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The chain prides itself on rigorous courses described as
``Harvard for children'' and attracts the sons and daughters of
major sports stars from the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some parents are worried about the future of a company
considered so strong that some moms and dads camped in line just to
secure their children spots in its charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents have called the private Tesseract school in
Paradise Valley, said Jill Kessler, the school's executive
director. Parents pay up to $8,000 a year in tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said the corporate offices will send a letter home
assuring families of the future of the 275-student school. And the
CEO will hold meetings next week with parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully committed to being here,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Gary Lillyquist, Tesseract's vice president of school
operations, said the letter will be distributed to parents
chainwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret Tesseract had some difficult times here,'' he
said. ``Our schools will stay open.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced Thursday that John Golle, Tesseract's
founder and chairman of the board, was returning as CEO, a post he
left last November.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Martha Taylor Thomas, who resigned Feb. 1 over what
the company described as ``differences with the board of directors
concerning the direction of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract, which cut 10 corporate jobs in December, has moved
out of its north Scottsdale headquarters and into a small office in
Ahwatukee.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has hired the investment banking firm of First
Security Van Kasper ``to explore strategic alternatives,'' which
has caused speculation that Tesseract could be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Lillyquist said he can't comment on whether there will be cuts
made at the schools, which offer a 2-24 teacher-student ratio in
private schools and a 1-25 ratio in charters.
</P>
<P>
   All students learn Spanish beginning in preschool. There is no
rigid or textbook-only instruction. Children are paired with
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Little, whose 3-year-old son attends a private Tesseract
preschool in Scottsdale, is concerned about the school's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the school. It's an excellent program,'' she said,
adding that her son has a different teacher for art, music and
Spanish. ``But I'm worried. They're in debt.''
</P>
<P>
   But said she plans to pay the $250 deposit next week to secure
her son a spot next year.
</P>
<P>
   Across town in Peoria, parents called one of Tesseract's
charters, Fletcher Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Sherry Jones said she initially didn't know what to
tell parents. But because the school is a charter, not private, no
tuition is charged and its money comes from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, whatever happens at the corporate office happens,'' she
said. ``But we are assured of funding by the state, and we will
continue to be a school.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesseract's charter schools are sponsored by the Snowflake
Unified School District. &QL;

FAA ORDERS U.S. AIRLINES TO INSPECT AIRCRAFT TAIL MECHANISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration late Thursday
night ordered all U.S. airlines to inspect 1,100 planes similar to
the Alaska Airlines MD-83 that crashed off the California coast
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency order came after Alaska found damaged control
mechanisms in the tails of a jet in Portland, Ore., and another in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The air carriers have two or three days to complete the
inspections, and some warned of possible disruptions in flight
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and other carriers started doing voluntary inspections
Thursday. As of late Thursday, more than 400 airplanes had been
checked and only the two Alaska planes were found to have damaged
parts.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska jets, which were grounded for further examination,
are MD-83s _ the same kind of plane that crashed Jan. 31, killing
88 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, the pilots reported a malfunction of the
horizontal stabilizer, the wing-like structure on top of the tail
that helps keep the plane stable in flight. A key control
mechanism, called a jackscrew, has become the focus of
investigators' attention.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-inch-long threaded rod that passes through a ``gimbal'' nut
anchored to the vertical tail, the jackscrew operates much like a
garage door opener. When turned by one of two electric motors, the
jackscrew moves the stabilizer up or down, depending on the
direction it is turning.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261's jackscrew was found, damaged, on Wednesday. Late
Thursday, the Navy recovered the gimbal nut in a section of the
tail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine if the damage to the
jackscrew and nut occurred before the crash or as a result of the
impact. Thursday night, the Post-Intelligencer learned that some
experts who have examined the jackscrew believe at least some of
the damage came before the crash, though that has yet to be been
verified by metallurgical tests.
</P>
<P>
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator who examined
the nut reported the threads are heavily damaged, said NTSB
Chairman Jim Hall. Earlier, he said shreds of metal consistent with
the nut were found on the jackscrew.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said metal filings or shavings were also found on and
around the horizontal stabilizer jackscrews on the Alaska planes
grounded in Portland and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The nut is made of aluminum bronze, and bronze metal shavings
were found in the jackscrew grease in the stabilizer of one of the
grounded Alaska planes, said FAA Associate Administrator Tom
McSweeny.
</P>
<P>
   Metal shavings were found beneath the jackscrew and on the
threads of the jackscrew of the other grounded Alaska plane, he
said. A small, curly piece of metal also was found wrapped around
the jackscrew, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know what caused what we saw,'' McSweeny said.
``That will come out eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the nut and jackscrew from Flight 261, as well as the
horizontal stabilizer assemblies from the two other Alaska Airlines
aircraft, will be immediately sent to the NTSB laboratories here
for examination.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say it is puzzling that the problems have so far
been found only on Alaska planes. They plan to find out if any of
the parts were replaced after the planes were delivered to the
airline, and to examine Alaska's maintenance procedures and the
conditions in which the planes were flown.
</P>
<P>
   All three planes in question undergo heavy maintenance at the
same Alaska Airlines facility in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The work performed there has been called into question for more
than a year. Maintenance performed on MD-80 series planes _ not the
one that crashed or the two on which metal shavings were discovered
_ has prompted a proposed fine, a recommendation that the licenses
of three maintenance supervisors be revoked and a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board investigators were in Portland and Seattle on
Thursday to examine the planes, along with representatives from
Boeing and the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Both planes are fairly new, having joined the Alaska's fleet of
MD-80s in April and May 1997, said John Thom, a Boeing spokesman in
Long Beach, Calif., where the planes were manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell Douglas MD-83 jets rolled down the assembly line
about the same time. One was line No. 2178, and the other was 2183,
Thom said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska MD-83 that crashed was much older, delivered in May
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska said it has completed inspections of 31 of its 34 MD-80
series planes. The three remaining planes are out of service for
heavy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. airlines already were inspecting their planes before
the FAA issued its late-night order.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had inspected 100 of its 136 MD-88s and MD-90s by Thursday
night, while Northwest checked all of its 172 DC-9s.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest went a step further with its own inspections,
announcing plans to make complete checks of it DC-9s' horizontal
stabilizer systems over the next week, airline spokesman Dennis
Mollura said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said it would take a week to look at its 284
MD-80s and 90s. American inspects the jackscrew and related parts
about every 100 days, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines was set to start inspecting its 103 MD-80s
and 29 DC-9s Thursday night, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways started checking its fleet of 31 MD-80s and 34 DC-9s
late Wednesday and was expected to finish by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the two Alaska planes discovered to have problems
Thursday, none of the nation's major airlines reported any
jackscrew discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary inspections were in response to a Boeing letter
sent Wednesday that recommended all operators of the MD-80 series
planes, as well as MD-90s, DC-9s and 717s, inspect the jackscrew
and other stabilizer control mechanism parts.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's emergency airworthiness directive covers the same
planes _ some 1,100 in U.S. fleets and about 2,000 in service
worldwide. While not required to do so, foreign air carriers
usually follow FAA directives.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeny told reporters during a teleconference from his office
here that the agency wants to know what the airlines find. He said
he was not aware of any problems so far other than on the two
Alaska planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard of any other significant finding ...,'' he
said, but added that it was ``premature to decide if that tells us
anything or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the airlines are required to immediately report any
``significant findings'' to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeny did not know how much the inspections will cost
airlines, or how long they will take. But he noted that Alaska
inspected 31 planes in a little more than a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be an excruciating long time,'' McSweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not an easy task, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it done right, we want it done thorough,'' he said.
``That's part of the reason for the two- or three-day compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is on the top of the tail of the planes and
mechanics will need to use either a stand or a ``cherry picker'' to
reach an access panel on top of the stabilizer, McSweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know to what extent, if any, air travel will
be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average traveling public will understand the delay (is) to
make sure planes don't have any condition that could lead to an
accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McSweeny said there is little maintenance history of problems
with the stabilizer control mechanism used on the McDonnell Douglas
jets.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know the service history of the two grounded Alaska
planes. Alaska would not release that information.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the stabilizer control mechanism, including the
gimbal nut and jackscrew, would not be inspected for about three
years, he said. The inspection would probably be done every other
``C check'' _ a major overhaul _ he said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that crashed had its last C check in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 had been troubleshooting a problem with
the stabilizer for more than 30 minutes before the plane crashed.
The problem grew progressively worse until the stabilizer jammed in
its full up position, which sent the MD-83 jetliner into a steep
dive from 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes after they regained some control of the plane, the
pilots extended the airplane's wing flaps and slats in preparation
for landing. Seconds later, the jet dove steeply, rolling over and
hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Radar data shows what could be pieces of the aircraft falling as
it dove. There has been speculation that pieces of the stabilizer
may have come off the plane, and the Navy is searching an area
where the falling pieces may have landed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura County Medical Examiner on Thursday said 22
passengers have been identified based on fingerprints, dental
records, tattoos and personal effects. Three infants have been
identified by age and gender. The names of only six victims have
been releaed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the office released the names of three victims whose
remains were identified. They were Rachel Janosik, 20, of Enumclaw,
Wash.; Paul ''Clarke'' Pulanco, 40, of Seattle; and Rodrigo Laigo,
53, of Fairfield, Calif. On Tuesday, the medical examiner
identified Harry Stasinos, 54, of Brier, Wash.; Meghann Hall, 19,
of Enumclaw; and Joseph Knight, 54, of Snohomish, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner has received no new remains since Monday,
but the process of informing the families and getting written
permission to release the information is lengthy, said spokeswoman
Julie Frey.

BRADLEY TRIES TO LINK GORE TO THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 14th grafs with Gore's views) 
 (See also BRADLEY-JORDAN)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley sharply questioned Vice
President Al Gore's commitment to gun control Thursday, saying Gore
had a voting record in Congress that could make him a ``poster
child'' for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   In emotional events at a synagogue and at a middle school in
East Los Angeles, where parents told of losing children to gun
violence, Bradley said the vice president was a recent convert to
gun control who, while in Congress, had repeatedly voted against
firearms restrictions, including a 1990 ban on certain assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real choice on this issue,'' Bradley told more than
100 students at El Sereno Middle School in East Los Angeles, a
community ravaged by gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an issue that I came to after seeing television
pictures of Columbine,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that I believed as a matter of fundamental
principle throughout my public life. Al Gore has not always done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign released documents showing that Gore, his
lone rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, received
high grades from the NRA in the early 1980s when he was a House
member from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The documents showed that Gore voted against a federal
registration system for gun owners, against a 14-day waiting period
for buying new handguns, for allowing the sale of guns across state
lines and for cutting the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, which regulates gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since being elected to Congress in 1976, Al Gore has been
there each and every time sportsmen and gun owners have needed a
friend,'' an NRA scorecard from 1984 said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said the vice president's ``view
on gun control has changed'' since he represented a conservative
rural district in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane ascribed this change to rising gun violence across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun issue itself changed,'' Lehane said. ``Times change
and solutions change.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Gore in Los Angeles said he voted against a 1990
amendment to ban 12 types of assault weapons because the measure
might have killed an underlying bill to ban nine types of assault
weapons, a bill that Gore supported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned the characteristic odor of losing campaigns,''
Attorney General William Lockyer of California, a supporter of
Gore, said of Bradley's attack. ``I'm sorry to see his campaign
fortunes have got him into a sour mood and into attack mode.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1986 interview with Washington Monthly, Gore said gun
control laws ``haven't been an effective solution to the underlying
problem of violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several similarities in the two men's gun control
proposals. Both would ban the cheap handguns known as ``Saturday
Night Specials,'' require trigger locks, limit handgun purchases to
one a month and make background checks mandatory for gun buyers at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would require that all handguns be registered and that
all handgun owners take a safety course and get a license. But Gore
does not call for registering guns and would require photo licenses
only for new buyers of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposes banning gun dealers from operating in
residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gore goes beyond Bradley in proposing tougher penalties for
people who use guns in crimes and for dealers who sell guns
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Gore well ahead of Bradley among traditional
Democrats, Bradley has been trying to draw sharper contrasts with
the vice president by attacking him on a variety of issues of
importance to Democratic voters, including abortion rights,
education and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate two weeks ago Bradley said that National Right to
Life, an anti-abortion group, had given Gore an 84 percent positive
rating in his early years in Congress when he opposed Medicaid
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Bradley ridiculed Gore as asserting that registering
all handguns and licensing all gun owners would be impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to you, What if that attitude was held by Franklin
Roosevelt in the 1930s when he looked out at the country and saw
the elderly destitute, in need of some pension?'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the essence of leadership is to take on that which is
considered too hard to do, and make it happen. That's what leaders
do, as opposed to politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's events Thursday were intended to evoke powerful
feelings of grief. At El Sereno Middle School, parents gripped
large pictures of children killed by gunfire while describing their
personal trauma.
</P>
<P>
   One mother held a miniature coffin, snapping the lid shut to
punctuate her point.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is clearly aware that gun control has been particularly
popular among California's Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   He unveiled his gun control agenda in Los Angeles last summer.
And Thursday, he repeatedly noted that gun violence was a leading
cause of death in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people killed in California by gun violence
than by automobile accidents,'' he said. ``And that's not just
because the freeways are great.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed a Republican-sponsored bill
Thursday that would cut taxes for married couples by $182 billion
over the next decade, brushing aside the Clinton administration's
position that any such tax cut should be far smaller and be enacted
only after more pressing issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 268-158, with 48 Democrats voting in favor and no
Republicans voting against.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was presented by its Republican sponsors as a
reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that
pushes some two-income married couples into higher tax brackets or
limits their deductions, making them pay more taxes than they would
if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But its benefits would go to all married couples, including
those who are not affected by the penalty and those whose tax bill
is lower because they are married. It would provide no tax cut to
single people. A compet- ing plan proposed by President Clin- ton
would help only those people hurt by the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal-leaning
research group, found that when fully phased in, the House bill
would give an average tax cut of $193 a year to couples with
incomes of $20,000 to $30,000. For couples with incomes of $75,000
to $100,000, the reduction would be $1,003, and for couples with
incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 it would be $1,016, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tax cut would not take effect until the second half
of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal budget surplus rising, taxes are sure to remain
an issue of heated debate between Republicans and Democrats this
year, both in Washington and in the presidential race. Although
White House officials attacked the bill passed Thursday, members of
both parties held out some hope for a compromise on marriage
penalty relief this year.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that Thursday's vote was as much about election
year politics as about advancing toward a deal, with Republicans
eager to put Democrats on record as voting against a politically
popular measure.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first in a series of narrowly targeted tax cuts that
Republicans plan to bring up this year in an effort to portray
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democrats in Congress
as unwilling to return the government's excess revenues to
taxpayers. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion Republican tax cut last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said eliminating the marriage penalty was a matter
of simple fairness. They said there was no excuse for waiting,
given the projections of a large and growing surplus. They called
the tax-reduction bill an early Valentine's Day gift to couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more immoral than taxing people just because they fall
in love?'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House and administration officials said they
support the goal of reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty.
But they said that the Republican approach was too expensive, and
that the issue should be put on hold until Congress and the White
House settle on an overall budget plan that would provide for
eliminating the national debt and assuring the long-term solvency
of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving the Republican bill Thursday, the House
rejected a Democratic alternative. The bill would have reduced
taxes on some married couples by $95 billion over 10 years, but
only on the condition of a bipartisan agreement to deal with debt
repayment, Social Security and Medicare. The vote to reject it was
233-192, largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Enacting a big tax cut before the nation has dealt with its
long-term fiscal problems, said Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic leader in the House, ``threatens our prosperity and
risks our future.''
</P>
<P>
   While they stopped just short of an outright veto threat,
administration officials made clear that Clinton would not sign a
bill like the one passed by the House. The White House has offered
its own plan, valued at $45 billion over 10 years, that would be
restricted mostly to couples with moderate incomes who claim the
standard deduction on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we should genuinely ease the marriage penalty for both
middle- and lower-middle-income groups,'' Clinton said in a meeting
Thursday with Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the Senate plan to bring up their own
marriage penalty legislation this year, although they have not
settled on details.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty stems in part from efforts dating back to
1948 to smooth out other inequities in the tax code, including a
once-widespread problem that led a single-earner household to have
a higher tax bill than a two-earner household with the same income.
It has become more of a political issue as more women have entered
the work force and continued working after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   No one in either party Thursday defended the elements of the tax
code that created the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the marriage penalty only hits two-income couples, mainly
those in which the two partners make roughly similar amounts of
money. Many other couples, especially those with a single income,
actually receive a marriage bonus _ a lower tax bill than they
would have if they were single and filing separately.
</P>
<P>
   A study last year by analysts at the Treasury Department
concluded that of 51.4 million joint returns filed in 1999, 24.8
million, or 48 percent, had a marriage penalty, averaging $1,141.
</P>
<P>
   Another 21 million couples, or 41 percent, had a marriage bonus,
averaging $1,274. The remainder have neither a penalty nor a bonus.

MARINERS TRADE GRIFFEY TO REDS FOR FOUR PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Griffey Jr. has done just about everything that
can be done in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he added to his list of accomplishments by completing
his sojourn as a general manager, orchestrating a trade that saw
him go to the Cincinnati Reds for four players.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will get back a starting center fielder in Mike Cameron,
a starting pitcher in Brett Tomko, and two minor league prospects,
pitchers Jake Meyer and infielder Antonio Perez. Griffey will get a
nine-year contract extension from the Reds worth $112.5 million,
plus a $16 million option for a 10th year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a landmark day in Seattle baseball history, although not
one the Mariners particularly wanted to see. No player has done
more or played at a higher level than has Griffey. He was as much a
part of the Seattle landscape as the Space Needle, with
accomplishments that towered over the landscape with the same level
of majesty and grace.
</P>
<P>
   But this landmark did not want to be part of the Mariners after
11 years, and he exercised his right to move on to Cincinnati,
where he grew up while his father was playing for the Big Red
Machine.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trade the Mariners did not particularly want to make.
But Griffey told the club in November that he wanted a trade. And,
as a 10-and-5 player (10 years in the majors, the past five with
the same club), Griffey had the right to approve any trade. He
originally said he'd accept a trade to any of four to seven clubs,
but he quickly moved into a posture where only Cincinnati was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken wanted this done, and we were able to accommodate him,''
Seattle general manager Pat Gillick said of the the curious voyage
of the Good Ship Griffey. ``If this wasn't limited to dealing with
one team, it's safe to say we would have gotten a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we would not have made the trade if we didn't think it was
a good trade for the Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a doubt, it's a good trade for Griffey, who got just what
he wanted _ the chance to play for the Reds, for whom his father is
a coach.
</P>
<P>
   During a packed press conference in Cinergy Field, conversation
drifted to the possibility of Griffey playing for his dad, who has
been rumored as a manager of the Reds down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by his absence at the press conference was current
Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon, who led the Reds to a 96-66 season
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though Griffey smiled through the news conference, there was a
room for the tiniest bit of regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a little tough at first,'' Griffey said.
``I met my wife (Melissa) in Seattle, and my two kids were born in
Seattle. Mariner fans were awesome. After the 1995 season, they
believed in us, no matter what. So it will be difficult, but I can
work it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (playing for the Reds) was my dream as a kid. The first
thing I would check when I was playing with the Mariners was to see
how the Reds did.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll have to check to see how his best buddies on the
Mariners, Jay Buhner, Edgar Martinez, Alex Rodriguez and Dan
Wilson, are doing.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, the Mariners are not as good a team as they were 24
hours ago. But you could hardly expect otherwise when the best
player in the game is gone from the middle of your lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that the Mariners got what they could. Tomko
is in position to win a job as a starter in spring training, which
begins in a week in Peoria, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is the man in the middle, the center fielder who will
take over the turf once roamed by Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Perez will wind up in the high minor leagues this
year, with a chance to catch on in the majors next season at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   All that being said, the Mariners head into spring training
having slightly deeper pitching with the addition of Tomko (5-7 in
1999 with a 4.92 ERA in 33 games, 26 of them starts) and an
adequate outfielder in Cameron, who hit .256 with 21 homers and 38
steals as the Cincinnati leadoff hitter in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the newcomers to Seattle is in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to think,'' Tomko said. ``I'm shocked by
the magnitude of it, of being traded for Ken Griffey Jr., one of
the greatest players of all time. It's like being traded for
(Michael) Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko goes into what is now a six-man competition for a five-man
starting rotation. Aaron Sele, Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia are
locks for the rotation, with Tomko, Gil Meche and John Halama
having to battle it out this spring for the two remaining jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very competitive situation in the rotation,''
Gillick said. ``We've got depth and backups, and we'll see who
steps forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cameron was a leadoff hitter with proven base-running
ability, he's not likely to lead off for the Mariners. For one
thing, he strikes out too much (145 times in 542 at-bats) and even
though he walked 80 times, his on-base percentage (.357) was too
low in an era when .390 is considered minimum for a man charged
with setting the table for the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is arbitration eligible, and though the M's will attempt
to avoid arbitration _ the player has requested $2.5 million and
the Reds offer, now assumed by the Mariners, is for $1.9 million _
``We won't cave in just to avoid arbitration,'' Gillick said.
</P>
<P>
   Not unexpectedly, the focus Thursday wasn't on the players who
were coming. It was all about the player who left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special case,'' Gillick said. ``I'd never been
through one quite like this before. It was a 10-and-5 situation,
which is something you get only with a (Cal) Ripken, a (Kirby)
Puckett, a (Tony) Gwynn. It usually only happens when you have a
player of superstar ability, like Ken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times I thought he'd come back. And there were
times when I didn't think we'd get a deal done. In the end, we had
the feeling that we'd done all that we could.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about those 11 years in which Griffey defined Seattle?
Griffey brought a lot to Seattle, true, but Seattle gave Griffey a
stage. Was there any bitterness or sense of betrayal in the
Mariners family? Mariners' club president Chuck Armstrong said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel betrayed at all,'' Armstrong said. ``Sure, there
have been nights we've stared at the ceiling wondering, `Could we
have done more?' In the end, I don't think so. We got a chance to
watch maybe the best player ever play for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken said he didn't make up the collective bargaining
agreement. But he wanted to go to Cincinnati, and he apologized to
us that Seattle drew the short straw.''

RODRIGUEZ'S AGENT REITERATES: WE'LL TALK AFTER SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With Ken Griffey Jr. gone, the Mariners are suddenly
and completely Alex Rodriguez's team.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the Mariners announced the completion of the deal
that sent Griffey to Cincinnati for four players, than they
reiterated their interest in signing their lone remaining
superstar, Rodriguez, to a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   But if you listen to Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, the
Mariners are dreaming. Boras said Rodriguez has decided he wants to
wait until the end of the season to see if he wants to stay with
Seattle for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is one of the few players in the game whose star
shines as brightly as Griffey's. With Griffey gone, there is an
evident need to lock in Rodriguez as Seattle's centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners have not contacted me,'' Rodriguez's agent, Scott
Boras, said. ``If they did, they'd find that the answer is still
the same as it was when we talked in November. Alex wants to wait
until the end of the year to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an economic thing. He wants to see this (front
office) group work, see what it does. He does not know Howard
Lincoln. He doesn't know Pat Gillick. He wants to get a chance to
know them and see what they do with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Boras can expect a call from club president Chuck
Armstrong or general manager Gillick as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex has made it absolutely clear that he wants to be back for
2000,'' Armstrong said, heading off suggestions that with his
center fielder traded, maybe it was time to trade his shortstop,
too. ``So, sure we'll talk, but we won't do it in the press where
you can see it. We'd like to sit and talk with Alex, see what we
can work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras made it clear that his player wasn't trying to force a
trade, although if by midseason management gets the idea that
Rodriguez will not be back under any circumstances, a trade might
become a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex wants to win as a Mariner,'' Boras said. ``He just wants
time to observe and evaluate and make a decision. The Mariners can
do what they feel they need to do, of course. But if they did trade
him with the team in contention, that would be against everyone's
best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not forcing anyone's hand. Alex wants to play this
season in Seattle, then see what happens. We can sit and talk about
the future of the club. Alex's issue is with the club not winning
the last two years. Before he makes a commitment, he wants to see
the club going in a different direction.''

KINGS' PALFFY BACK ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks ago, Ziggy Palffy could barely get out
of bed.
</P>
<P>
   Now his back is better and he has resumed his place among the
top scorers in the NHL. Needless to say, a healthy Palffy gives the
Kings the best chance this season of ending their 22-game winless
streak against tonight's opponent - the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy has four goals in the Kings' last three games, including
two in Wednesday's come-from-behind 5-2 victory over the Phoenix
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The victory knocked the Coyotes out of a first-place tie with
Dallas in the Pacific Division. It also was the Kings' third win in
four games, giving them 58 points and the seventh spot in the
eight-team playoff race. During those victories, the Kings scored
16 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of Palffy, Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel had
all but two of them. That will be critical facing the Stars, who
have shut down the Kings' top unit in four victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need your first line to step up and win some games down
the stretch,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``To say Ziggy has stepped
way up would be an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, who missed five games earlier this year due to back
trouble, has 21 goals and leads the Kings with 53 points. The surge
began with three assists Jan. 31 in a victory against the New York
Islanders, his former team.
</P>
<P>
   When he followed with two goals and an assist two days later in
a 5-2 win over the mighty Detroit Red Wings, Palffy looked a lot
like the player who scored 40 or more goals in three consecutive
seasons with the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always happy if I can help in these games,'' Palffy said.
``I need to play more. If I'm playing more and more, I'm more
comfortable and more confident than any player.''
</P>
<P>
   During his years in New York, Palffy received some criticism for
his lack of conditioning, even though he missed just three games in
four years. But Kings trainer Pete Demers said Palffy has been
diligent about strengthening his midsection to take pressure off
the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked very hard and knows this is something he has to
stay on top of,'' Demers said.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's trunk stabilization program includes stretching his
lower back muscles, strengthening his abdominal region and adding
flexibility to his hamstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Demers said Palffy gradually began to recover quicker after
games. The Kings did not practice Thursday after playing
back-to-back games against the Mighty Ducks and Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see over time a decrease in soreness when he would
come in the next day,'' Demers said. ``He's had ups and downs, like
anybody. But he is doing quite well right now and it doesn't hurt
that he is scoring some goals and making a major contribution. That
never hurts the rehab process.''

   KINGS vs. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 6:30 p.m. at Staples Center
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net, KRLA-AM (1110)
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The defending Stanley Cup champion Stars are in the
midst of an amazing run. They have 42 consecutive victories when
they score at least three goals. Their 22-game unbeaten streak
against the Kings dates back to April 6, 1995. They already have
four victories this season against the Kings. After spending the
first month of the season in last place in the Pacific Division,
the Stars moved on top Wednesday night with 5-3 victory against the
Mighty Ducks. They had been tied with Phoenix with 65 points, but
the Coyotes lost to the Kings 5-2. In the Stars victory, Jamie
Langenbrunner returned after missing 11 games with rib and neck
injuries, and scored two goals. Brett Hull broke his nose against
the Ducks but is expected to play.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The McCain organization?'' chuckled Thomas J.
Kirwan, a New York state assemblyman. ``In my district, that's me
and three fellows I've never met.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, armed with a modest amount of money
and no organization to speak of, remains the underdog against Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, who has plenty of both. On March 7,
McCain's limited resources will be stretched thin by having to
compete in Republican contests in 16 states, including New York and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many supporters of Bush, the overwhelming choice of the
party's leaders, are worried. And some prominent New York
Republican elected and party officials, who did not want their
names used, are concerned that they jumped on the Bush bandwagon
too soon, failing to anticipate McCain's challenge and Bush's
weaknesses _ though all insist they have no plans to change
allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is some of that going on, but I think it's
ill-advised,'' said Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County
Republican Party chairman, who is running to be a Bush delegate.
``I still think Bush is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mondello and many Bush supporters have been sensing a
buzz for McCain in the weeks before the rarest of events in recent
Republican history in New York state. There has not been a
genuinely contested presidential primary since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk with my club members, my committeemen and people
in general, there's a lot of talk about McCain,'' Mondello said.
``Right now, John McCain is hot. My feelings are that in this
state, this is a pretty close thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter T. King, a Bush backer, learned this week to his
surprise that even his wife plans to vote for McCain. ``New York's
definitely in play,'' King said. ``Every time I walk across the
street from my office in Massapequa Park to go to the deli, people
stop me to talk about McCain. Everywhere I go, people spontaneously
bring up his name. That's not something I've seen since Reagan.
This may not last through March 7, but the Bush people should
definitely be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An upstate Republican county chairman put it more bluntly. ``All
I'm hearing is McCain, McCain, McCain,'' he said, a chant that was
fed by the party's ill-fated efforts to keep the senator off the
New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will be campaigning in New York on Friday for the first
time since winning a place on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp insists that it has no fears about New York, or
about what amounts to a national primary March 7. McCain ``may rue
the day that he got on the ballot,'' said Zenia Mucha,
communications director for Gov. George E. Pataki, Bush's leading
booster in New York, ``because now he's going to have to decide
which state he's going to compete in, New York or California, and
he certainly doesn't have the money, the organization or the time
to compete effectively in both.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, McCain's immediate disadvantage in New York is
that he cannot count on independents, who provided most of his
margin of victory in New Hampshire, and are expected to contribute
strongly to his showing in the next primary state, South Carolina.
Only registered Republicans can vote in New York's Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the enormous gulf between the candidates'
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people carrying petitions for us who had never done it
before, no idea what they were doing,'' said Seth N. Arluck, a
retail lumber dealer who is a McCain volunteer in Orange County.
``But all 400 party committeemen in Orange County got Bush
petitions to carry. They've got vote phone banks, and we're
scraping by to find people with multiple phone lines who'll let us
use one.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither camp has begun handing out literature and posting signs,
but when they do, Arluck said, ``we don't even know yet if the
campaign will be able to buy the stuff we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every prominent Republican, at the state or local level,
supports Bush. Of the 93 people running to be Bush delegates in New
York, three in each congressional district, more than 50 are
elected officials, including members of Congress, state legislators
and county executives. Most of the rest are party officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has the support of only three elected officials _ Kirwan,
of Newburgh, his state campaign chairman, Borough President Guy
Molinari of Staten Island, and state Sen. John Marchi. Not one
party official is backing him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said it was ``very, very hard'' even to find people to
run as delegates. ``We had to reach out to a lot of people with no
experience in politics, people who e-mailed messages of support to
McCain's headquarters. We had to confirm that they were registered
Republicans, that they lived in the right districts, give them
instructions on how to fill out their petitions.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's institutional support translates into an army of foot
soldiers. The elected and party officials have staffs, political
clubs and corps of volunteers from previous campaigns that they can
tap to find people to work for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is money. At last report, McCain had $7.7 million in
hand, though his campaign says it expects to raise $5 million or
more between New Hampshire and New York, plus nearly that much in
federal matching funds. Bush, who is forgoing matching funds, has
$31 million in hand, and is raising more.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At times, the broader the playing field, the more important
money becomes, because the battle is fought mostly over the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain did, what, 105, 110 town meetings in New Hampshire,
which has a population smaller than the Bronx,'' said state Sen.
Guy Velella, the Bronx Republican chairman who is running as a Bush
delegate. ``If he did 105 town meetings in the Bronx, he'd probably
win there, too, but there isn't time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he added, ``we've got to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the built-in disadvantages of a lack of money,
troops and time would doom McCain, but this is no ordinary contest.
New York has almost no experience with contested, statewide
Republican primaries, because the party bosses have seen to it by
pressuring candidates to drop out, or keeping them off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Republican voters could choose among Bob Dole, Steve
Forbes and Patrick Buchanan, but it was a foregone conclusion that
Dole would win the primary and the nomination, and turnout was just
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 and 1988, the eventual presidential nominees, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush respectively, were running unopposed by the
time of the New York primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The last real contest in a New York Republican presidential
primary was in 1976, when Reagan unsuccessfully challenged
President Gerald Ford. New York has not had a contested Republican
primary for a statewide office since Alfonse D'Amato defeated Sen.
Jacob Javits in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual factor is the extremely high interest in this
contest, with its compelling subplots like McCain's experience as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam, his ballot access fight in New York,
his strong victory in New Hampshire, and the contrasts between his
lean operation and freewheeling style, and the cautious Bush
juggernaut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In a primary, the main effect an organization has is alerting
voters and getting them out, because most people don't vote in a
primary,'' King said. In this case, he and others argued, turnout
is likely to be relatively high, perhaps 30 to 40 percent,
diminishing the importance of organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, I would have said it was Bush all the
way in New York,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist
College Institute of Public Opinion. ``But I think right now all
bets are off.''

AN AFRICAN PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 11: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as British courts ponder whether the former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet should be excused from trial in Spain on
human rights charges because he is medically unfit, the enduring
legacy of his case has been demonstrated on another continent. Last
week a Senegalese court indicted the exiled former dictator of
Chad, Hissene Habre, on torture charges. It was the first time that
a former African head of state had been charged with human rights
violations by a court in another country, and it opens a welcome
new chapter in the evolution of international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Habre grew out of a criminal complaint filed by
international human rights groups and Chadian survivors of torture.
It represents the first application of the most important legal
precedents established in the Pinochet case, namely that former
heads of state no longer enjoy impunity for crimes against
humanity, and that they can be brought to trial in any country on
the basis of ``universal jurisdiction'' for such crimes. The court
placed Habre under house arrest in the Senegalese capital, Dakar,
where he has lived since he was ousted from power in 1990. A trial
could begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
   During Habre's eight-year rule in Chad, his notorious secret
police killed thousands of opponents _ the exact number is still
unknown _ and tortured many more. The United States helped install
Habre in power and supported him through much of his rule as a
buffer against the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. Habre was
finally removed from office by the current president of Chad,
Idriss Deby.
</P>
<P>
   Habre is but one of several exiled tyrants who, under the
Pinochet precedent, could one day face justice. Idi Amin of Uganda
is in Saudi Arabia. His less notorious but no less wanton
successor, Milton Obote, is in Zambia. Paraguay's Alfredo
Stroessner is in Brazil. Haiti's Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier
is in France. The former Ethiopian tyrant Mengistu Haile Mariam is
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly welcome that an African dictator will be
tried in Africa. No continent has paid more dearly than Africa for
the absence of legitimate institutions of law and accountability
and a resulting culture of impunity. Ideally, Habre would be tried
in Chad itself, but the government of Deby, replete with former
allies of Habre and with a record of its own abuses, has made no
effort to bring its former dictator to trial. Senegal is one of the
few countries in Africa that has a credible independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   This case will be another test of the ability of the world to
fashion an effective system of accountability for mass atrocities.
Considerable progress has been made over the last decade with the
establishment of international criminal tribunals for Rwanda and
the former Yugoslavia, an agreement to establish a permanent
International Criminal Court and the indictments of General
Pinochet and Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. But bringing people
to trial is harder than indicting them. That is why the trial of
Habre will be so important. &QL;

GRIFFEY MOVES ON FROM SEATTLE, BUT WITH A BLOT ON HIS LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Because the object of baseball is for a batter to get
back to home, Ken Griffey Jr., hit the dinger of the sporting ages.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking baseball's economics while he rolled the Seattle
Mariners, baseball's best player took what amounted to a $26
million pay cut to play out his career in hometown Cincinnati,
where he learned how a baseball glove smelled and saw how his
father looked in red.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's childhood longings were just as costly for the
Mariners, who after losing their lone profound connection to
baseball history, have little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffey era, which not only preserved the major league game
in the Northwest but caused it to flourish, ended in crushing
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years in the Seattle organization, longer than all but
a handful of players and front-office personnel, a sports legend
has moved on, but in a way that that leaves a blot on his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of his probable Seattle return, for the All-Star
Game in July 2001, some baseball fans will have forgotten the
acrimony of this winter. But bygones would have come a lot more
readily if the Mariners had obtained in return second baseman Pokey
Reese, first baseman Sean Casey, pitcher Scott Williamson, or any
star-quality major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only didn't they get the Reds' best hitter, starter or
reliever, they didn't even get their top minor-league prospect,
20-year-old shortstop Travis Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   What they received were, in the words of longtime Mariners
president Chuck Armstrong Thursday, ``four guys I wouldn't know if
they walked into this room.''
</P>
<P>
   In center fielder Mike Cameron, 27, and pitcher Brett Tomko, 26,
they have two average-to-mediocre major leaguers, and in pitcher
Jake Meyer, 25, and infielder Antonio Perez, 18, they have two
minor leaguers of little-known potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken used the analogy himself,'' Armstrong said. ``Somebody had
to draw the short straw in this, and it was Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Short straw? The Mariners were hosed.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with 10 years in the majors and five with the same
team, Griffey had by baseball rule the right to dictate to whom he
was traded. He wielded this rare power like a cudgel.
</P>
<P>
   When in December he cut his list of four teams to just the Reds,
the Mariners' ability to create a bidding battle for Griffey was
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the Mariners put in ``hundreds of man hours''
trying to scare up a decent deal for a player whose market value
they had set earlier last year with a baseball-record contract
offer worth $138 million over eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they had nearly nothing _ almost losing even the
Reds, who play in one of baseball's smallest markets and last
weekend all but decided they couldn't afford Griffey, regardless of
the cost in players.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Griffey ended the stalemate by agreeing to play for
far less money than the Mariners offered _ $112.5 million over nine
years, with payments spread out until 2025, when Griffey will be
55.
</P>
<P>
   The move was a delightful shocker for a sport whose salary
spiral has known nothing but escalation for 25 years, creating a
disparity between haves and have-nots that has retarded the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The back-loading of the contract means not only that the Reds
can easily afford Griffey for the three seasons until their new
stadium is ready, they also could drop the demand that the Mariners
pick up a substantial portion of Griffey's scheduled $8.5 million
salary for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing compelling the Reds to offer the Mariners
more than token players.
</P>
<P>
   Sports history is scattered with deals involving superstars that
almost never work out for the surrendering team. But thanks to
Griffey, this deal doesn't need the usual two years before
rendering a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition,'' said general manager Pat Gillick, ``would have
given us a little leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the trade was, it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey could have showed up to Mariners spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mariners execs maintained publicly that they would have
welcomed the chance to play with Griffey this season, privately
they dreaded his arrival in Peoria, Ariz. They knew his unresolved
future would be a major distraction for the team as well as for a
player already notorious for his unpredictability and petulance.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners fans had a rare window on the mercurial behavior this
winter. Griffey and his agent, Brian Goldberg, in November made the
trade request and signed a statement bidding farewell to Seattle
fans. A few weeks later, after initial bidders were few, Griffey
told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that he never asked for a
trade, only that he didn't want to sign an extension.
</P>
<P>
   After promising cooperation in a trade, Griffey's abrupt refusal
to accept no team but Cincinnati left the Mariners privately
furious.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday how significant were Griffey's reversals in the
Mariners' eagerness to move him, CEO Howard Lincoln said, ``They
were a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the club is not without responsibility in the loss of its
greatest player. Though it might be argued that Griffey's desire to
play in his old hometown and to be closer to his new hometown of
Orlando, Fla., took precedence, the franchise could have made his
decision much tougher by putting a quality team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back losing seasons, a product primarily of ownership's
unwillingness to invest in player personnel, made a poor argument
for staying. Although this winter's aggressive, successful pursuit
under Gillick of expensive free agents has heartened many Mariners
fans, it was too late to influence Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners figure to be much improved this season, even in
spite of the meager help from the Griffey trade.
</P>
<P>
   But they have lost the irreplaceable. They have lost the local
icon and the national symbol for Mariners baseball, the player who
would have brought a slice of Cooperstown and baseball immortality
to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And he lost the chance to leave with a legacy as bright as that
1995 smile at the bottom of the homeplate pile.

WITH LIMITED OPTIONS, M'S MADE LOGICAL CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The question is not did the Mariners lose out on the
Ken Griffey Jr. deal, with Griffey being traded to Cincinnati
Thursday for four players, none of them established stars.
</P>
<P>
   When a player of Griffey's status _ a player who at 30 should be
at the absolute peak of his athletic skills _ is traded, there is
no realistic chance of getting comparable value.
</P>
<P>
   A club simply doesn't trade a Wayne Gretzky, a Michael Jordan or
a Jerry Rice and come out preening.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, could the Mariners have gotten more than
pitcher Brett Tomko, center fielder Mike Cameron and minor leaguers
Jake Meyer, a pitcher, and Antonio Perez, an infielder?
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The M's front office had a couple of choices. It could have
acceded to the Reds' request for up to $6 million to defray the
cost of importing Griffey, and then Seattle might have landed
Rookie of the Year reliever Scott Williamson or No. 1 Reds infield
prospect Travis Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   But would either, or even both, of those players be worth $6
million? Not a hope.
</P>
<P>
   The other option was to give the Reds no cash and to take decent
players, but players who aren't going to make jaws drop in Internet
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle went for option No. 2. In the end, the Mariners had no
other logical choice. Griffey held the hammer _ as a player with 10
years in the majors and the past five on the same team, he had the
right to approve any trade. And after originally giving the
Mariners a list of four to seven teams he'd approve in a trade, he
would only accept Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Griffey boxed the Mariners into a corner. The only
way out was to accept what the Reds offered. It wasn't much. It
wasn't enough _ Seattle is getting two unspectacular major leaguers
and two prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cincinnati offer was it. In the end, the Mariners could
make the trade and start fresh, or they could hold on to Griffey
and look forward to a season of ``How long will Junior be here?''
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't hold all the cards,'' Seattle general manager Pat
Gillick said. ``We didn't have to trade him. And we wouldn't have
if the deal wasn't good for the organization. But we definitely
could have come up with a stronger package if we'd had more than
one team bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners wanted to avoid a situation similar to that under
which Randy Johnson left the club in the middle of the 1998 season.
The sheer inevitability of the trade was an albatross that dogged
the club most of the season until Johnson was dealt to Houston for
three players who now are big parts of the Mariners' plans _
pitchers Freddy Garcia and John Halama and infielder Carlos
Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the inadequacy of the Mariners' return for
Griffey was Gillick's statement Thursday that he hopes to swing a
deal or two more before the start of spring training. The Mariners'
payroll sits at about $65 million, and Gillick suggested it could
climb to $68 or even $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that we will make a deal or two more before spring
training,'' Gillick said. ``We could use a left-hander in the
bullpen, another outfielder and an infielder.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, Gillick acknowledged, is Angels center fielder
Jim Edmonds. Although the Mariners and Angels have talked in
general ways about Edmonds, a deal to bring him to Seattle was
never part of the Griffey deal, as had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no Edmonds or other proven major leaguer
heading Seattle's way when Griffey's departure was announced,
around the American League, the Mariners got generally positive
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly you'd like a big name in return when you have to
trade the best player in the game,'' Oakland assistant general
manager Paul DePodesta said. ``But I can tell you that we like all
four of the guys that Seattle got. There is real quality there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to look at what happened when the Mariners traded
Randy Johnson. Nobody had heard of the guys Seattle got for
Johnson. But Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Carlos Guillen are all
good young players, and that deal looks pretty good now. You need
to wait to judge the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners president Chuck Armstrong said as much, suggesting that
the Griffey trade couldn't be judged for at least a couple of
years. Mariners officials did their best Thursday to convey a sense
of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Lou (manager Lou Piniella) before the press
conference,'' Gillick said. ``I told Lou about the trade, and he
said he likes it. He's very happy with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are players who are going to help us now and in the next
few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Griffey Jr. they are not.

400 CLERGY TO PROTEST STATE INITIATIVE BANNING GAY MARRIAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Opponents of a ballot measure to ban gay
marriage that has the backing of Catholic and Mormon leaders and
much of the religious right declared Thursday that 400 clergy will
take part in a weekend ``prayer and protest'' against the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Proposition 22 ``an offense to most thoughtful people of
faith throughout the state of California,'' the Rev. Doug Donley of
Dolores Street Baptist Church in San Francisco declared
``Solidarity Sabbath,'' beginning in synagogues Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there are Californians who oppose same-sex marriage,
they need to look at themselves very seriously, and they need to
affirm love of all human beings for one another and say no to
Proposition 22 because it is discriminatory,'' said Rabbi Sydney
Mintz of Temple Emanu-El in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest and biggest financial supporters of the
initiative on the March 7 ballot were the Mormon and Catholic
churches. The Catholic Church contributed $310,000 to the
Protection of Marriage Campaign, and Mormon elders strongly
encouraged church members in California and elsewhere to send money
and work hard for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 campaign spokesman Robert Glazier said Thursday
that the Solidarity Sabbath group cannot begin to match the
``hundreds and thousands of congregations across the state'' in
favor of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faith community is overwhelmingly supporting this,''
Glazier said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has remained steady in the polls. A Field Poll
released Tuesday showed 52 percent of likely voters in favor, 39
percent against and 9 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have their mind made up on this,`` Glazier said.
``I think it's because people understand that gays and lesbians
have a right to have the protections they have and live the
lifestyle of their choice, but they don't have the right to
redefine marriage for anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the initiative say Proposition 22 is not as benign as
Glazier maintains. During her introduction of Mintz and Donley at a
press conference Thursday, San Francisco Supervisor Leslie Katz
pointed to a prayer breakfast held at the state Republican Party
convention last weekend, in which an evangelist said the United
States would be on a par with Nazi Germany if it ``expelled God''
and sanctioned gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Lesbians and gays were among those exterminated by the Nazis,
Katz noted. ``So to try and make that analogy is particularly
offensive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and other opponents of the initiative say that if it
passes, it will put California on the road to undoing domestic
partner benefits and adoptions by lesbian or gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   Glazier says that's not so. ``Proposition 22 is about keeping a
marriage between a man and a woman. We're not out to discriminate
against anybody's right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Katz and many of the clergy against Proposition 22 will be
celebrating the third annual National Freedom to Marry Day
Saturday, when gays and lesbians from Memphis, Tenn., to Sitka,
Alaska, will gather for symbolic weddings and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the Protection of Marriage Committee announced
the formation of Gays for 22, which was supported by five lesbian
and gay people at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The No on Knight campaign responded with a Straights Against
Proposition 22, a list of ``famous heterosexuals'' that includes
Gov. Gray Davis and Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and
Bill Bradley.

GRIFFEYS REUNITED AFTER NINE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ken Griffey Jr. stood on a podium in a crowded room in
Cincinnati Thursday when he was asked to explain his defection from
the Mariners. He turned to his right and pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italic) Him (end italic) was Ken Griffey Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Junior and Senior were together again in a baseball setting. Of
course, this wasn't the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the Griffeys pulled on blue and white uniforms
and played side by side, in center and left, manning two-thirds of
the Mariners outfield.
</P>
<P>
   They were Mariners teammates for parts of two seasons, on the
field for 51 games in 1990 and '91 _ the only father-son
combination to pull off this feat in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a sentimental journey, others feverishly have tried
to duplicate it. So far, without success.
</P>
<P>
   A well-worn Tim Raines will attempt to catch on with another
big-league club this spring solely for the purpose of playing at
the same as his son, Tim Jr., a prospect in the Baltimore
organization. It matters little that the older Raines has struggled
mightily with lupus, a blood disorder.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 31, 1990, at the Kingdome, the Griffeys played together
for the first time. One was 40, the other 20. A Friday-night crowd
of 27,166, a large gathering for an otherwise bleak time frame in
franchise history, showed up to see this unique family
get-together.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many Griffeys for Kansas City to handle as the
Mariners took a 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were out in the back yard playing catch,''
Griffey Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Said his father, ``I was so nervous it was like being a rookie
again.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a scrapbook moment from the start. In the bottom of the
first inning, both Griffeys singled, dad driving his second pitch
up the middle off Storm Davis, Junior singling to right. Father and
son both went 1-for-4 against Royals pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to cry,'' Junior said. ``It was his day.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier, Griffey Sr. had retired after Cincinnati had
tried to put him on the disabled list. At the time, he was healthy
but unproductive. The Reds tried to spare him the embarrassment of
an abrupt end to his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners gave everyone an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a gate attraction to spur interest in yet another
dismal season. The Griffeys were more than willing to be the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, this familial pairing would get even better.
The Griffeys homered in consecutive at-bats against Anaheim. In the
first inning, Senior hit a two-run homer, Junior a solo shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something we talked about doing and it finally
happened,'' the younger Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   However, on this night there were way too many Dave Winfields.
He homered twice in the Angels' 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, Griffey Sr. seemed to thrive while lining up
next to his son. He had a four-hit game, just the second of his
much-decorated career. He was named A.L. player of the week, the
only time he won this honor in either league. He hit a robust .377
for the month, his fastest start ever with a team.
</P>
<P>
   The Griffeys' tag-team effort was a brief one. During the next
season, they spent just one more month as active teammates before a
back injury from a car accident sent Griffey Sr. to the disabled
list and eventually into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they mugged and teased each other in front of
reporters and club officials. One is Cincinnati's new center
fielder, the other a coach if not the manager-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. commiserated about running around in a Reds' uniform
as an 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we still get to play together in the father-son game?''
Junior asked impishly.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving Seattle, Griffey Jr. said he wanted to spend more
time with his family. People assumed he was talking only about his
son.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Griffey Thursday, they know better.

CRAWFORD, HENTHORN FACE EXPANDED INVESTIGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS   and TED MILLER
 &HT;     c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An investigator for the NCAA is in Seattle looking
into new details about the relationship between University of
Michigan basketball player Jamal Crawford and Seattle businessman
Barry Henthorn, sources told the Post-Intelligencer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, university officials said they are reopening
their review of the Crawford-Henthorn relationship based on stories
this week in the P-I. The review has put on hold the university's
attempts to appeal Crawford's six-game NCAA suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned of the information being reported in the
Seattle newspaper. Any time we receive new information, we look
into it and will do so in this case,'' said Julie Peterson, a
spokeswoman for Michigan. ``The university appeal planned on Jamal
Crawford's behalf has been delayed while we investigate this new
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn has acknowledged that he provided Crawford with several
cars, money, food and lodging while Crawford was at Seattle's
Rainier Beach High School, but has maintained that he was acting as
a friend and de facto guardian for the basketball player. The cars
included a 1988 Mercedes, a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Chevy
Blazer.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, however, ruled last week that the relationship was a
violation of a bylaw concerning preferential treatment while in
high school, and ordered the suspension after Michigan had asked
for a ruling upon holding Crawford out of a Feb. 1 game as a
precautionary move. In addition, the NCAA ruled Crawford must pay
back $15,000 in cash, gifts and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under NCAA rules, student-athletes are barred from receiving
gifts based on their athletic ability or their potential to repay
the benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NCAA hasn't commented publicly about the new
developments, sources connected with the investigation confirmed
that the agency is now conducting its own inquiry separate to that
being done by the university.
</P>
<P>
   William Spurr, attorney for Henthorn's former administrative
assistant, said he was contacted on behalf of his client and was
making arrangements to talk with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pretty well into this,'' Spurr said of the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The client, Darcienne LeRoue, sued Henthorn last November
claiming she was coerced into cosigning on loans for the Blazer and
gold jewelry for Crawford in 1998. Henthorn is president of the
privately held Innovative Communications Technologies, and LeRoue
worked directly for him.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations in the lawsuit, LeRoue also said Henthorn
coerced her into taking out another emergency loan from Northwest
Financial, but was not aware of where the money went.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to contending that the loans were not fully paid
off, LeRoue claims that Henthorn purported to be a sports agent. In
court documents she said she felt compelled to leave her job and
has suffered damages and health problems when she found out ``she
unwittingly participated in transactions that were potentially
violative of NCAA rules and Washington state law.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA investigators also were said to be looking into a
foundation that Henthorn purportedly set up to help young athletes,
called the Academic Assistance Foundation. The foundation has
provided unspecified benefits to Crawford, but a number of people
and businesses listed on a brochure have said they had no knowledge
of the foundation or of Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Renfro, public information officer for the NCAA, would not
comment about the NCAA investigation or what the investigator was
looking into in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an eligibility case issue with Crawford and the
school has made a decision,'' Renfro said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said Crawford has been attending games with the team
and can participate in practices but cannot play until the matter
is settled. His original suspension ends Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   While she was not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the
case, Peterson said she could confirm that the new investigation is
under way, and that officials were coming to Seattle to conduct
additional interviews. The university, she added, is coordinating
its investigation with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, they don't wish to release any details of about
exactly what our investigation involves,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Crawford investigation, Michigan athletic
director Tom Goss resigned on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn has not returned phone calls to the P-I since he first
spoke to reporters on Tuesday. But in a Detroit Free Press story
Thursday, Henthorn denied he acted on Michigan's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn told the Free Press that he met with Michigan coach
Brian Ellerbe in Seattle when Ellerbe was recruiting Crawford
during his senior season at Rainier Beach. Other schools that were
recruiting the 1998 state player of the year included UCLA and
Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henthorn said he was impressed by Ellerbe's sincerity but
maintained that he didn't try to influence Crawford to attend UM or
any other school,'' according to the Free Press story.
</P>
<P>
   Henthorn also said the Mercedes, which he bought for Crawford to
use at Michigan, was never actually in Crawford's possession and
that it was being returned to Henthorn, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his suspension, Crawford was Michigan's leading
scorer, averaging 16.6 points per game as a freshman. The
investigation by the university reportedly began when Crawford
tried to register the Mercedes on campus. The car is registered in
both Henthorn's and Crawford's names in the state of Washington,
but Crawford never drove the vehicle at Michigan, university
officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement last week released by the university, Crawford
said he had no intent of violating NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that I don't feel that I did anything wrong,''
Crawford said. ``I understand that there are rules, but never did I
feel that I broke any of those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the relationship with Henthorn was a ``decision my
mother made for me three years ago'' when she asked Henthorn to act
as a guardian for her son.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown when the latest phase of the investigation would
be completed.

ALMANAC FIRST COLLECTION OF SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - Fascinating factoids, a few ``no kiddings'' and
some surprises comprise the first San Fernando Valley Almanac
released by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley as
part of the most comprehensive study to date on the sprawling
region.
</P>
<P>
   Among the surprises, the Valley remains a major player in the
aerospace sector despite being ravaged by recession in the early
1990s. And the region is home to a quickly shifting ethnic
population. Less surprising is the fact that the Valley is the true
home of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Released Thursday, the almanac, compiled at a cost of $150,000,
was culled from a myriad of sources, including information
collected by the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at
Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, the Los Angeles Police
Department and the California Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   It covers virtually everything in the Greater San Fernando
Valley, a region bordered by Glendale on the east and Calabasas to
the west. It focuses on jobs, climate, housing trends, colleges,
ethnic makeup and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the almanac unique is that, until now, no one had
been able to quantify the Valley in this detail. Because the Valley
is not its own municipality, few government entities record
Valley-specific facts or have the Valley information they do have
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive databases compiled for the almanac will be updated
by the alliance and the information will be available at its Web
site, www.valleyofthestars.org, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can acquire and get the rights to that's on a
Valley level, we'll put up on the site. ... We feel our job is to
set the table; we present the information and try to make it
credible,'' said Bob Scott, a founder and executive vice chairman
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The almanac could also be part of the cornerstone of a campaign
to have the Valley secede from the city of Los Angeles. But Scott,
whose suburban Woodland Hills-based firm Civic Center also produced
the almanac, says the overall mission of the information is simply
``to inform the public debate. ... There are a lot of organizations
and activists out there that are acting in large part in a vacuum,
without information. It doesn't have to work to the benefit of
business or anybody in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the almanac:
</P>
<P>
   -San Fernando Valley households spend an average of $44,001 per
year on retail goods and services, about the same as the average
for all of Los Angeles County. Among areas where Valley residents
spend more than average are on restaurants, jewelry, cars and car
repair.
</P>
<P>
   -Based on a comparison of 1990 Census data and 1999 estimates,
the populations of virtually all ethnic groups increased in the
Valley, while the percentage of whites declined. Latinos had the
largest increase, to 39 percent, followed by Asian/Pacific
Islanders, with a 31.5 percent jump. The estimated white population
declined by 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Latinos include both whites and
nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   -From 1990 to 1999, median housing values for the Valley overall
remained fairly flat. Only Calabasas, which has the largest
percentage of home ownership in the Valley, saw a dramatic jump in
value. The median home value there for 1999 was $472,841, up more
than 10 percent during the decade.
</P>
<P>
   -If it were a city, the Valley would rank first in number of
aerospace firms, third in number of entertainment firms (behind New
York and Los Angeles) and sixth in total number of firms (behind
New York, Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Dallas).
</P>
<P>
   -One survey found that more than 50 percent of Valley
respondents have a cellular phone and Internet access. More than
two-thirds say they never ride the bus.

BRADLEY, GORE SKIRMISH IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL, CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and
Bill Bradley crisscrossed California Thursday, seeking support by
attacking each other.
<P>
   Pounding a theme he has underscored in recent weeks, Bradley
accused Gore of being too timid on gun control and touted his own
plan for registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gore) said what I have proposed is impractical, that it is
too hard,'' the former New Jersey senator told a somber gathering
of middle school students at El Sereno school in East Los Angeles.
``What if that had been the attitude of other leaders, like FDR I
think the essence of leadership is to take on what is considered
hard to do and make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at a campaign stop at the Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center, the vice president sharply criticized Bradley's
health plan and argued that the nation needs to move cautiously
toward universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move in the direction of universal health care,
step by step, with children first,'' Gore told a crowd of about 400
doctors, nurses, health care workers and volunteers in an
auditorium at the giant public hospital. ``We need to keep our
economic strength and build the political will of the country to
reach our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore both will address nearly 3,000 delegates at the
California Democratic Party convention in San Jose this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day gathering, which begins Friday, is a prime
political opportunity for both candidates, the largest gathering of
Democrats in the state before the primary. and  &LR; It will be stocked
with party loyalists and hundreds of elected Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrives in San Jose Friday with some key advantages. He
holds a 54 percent to 13 percent lead over Bradley among likely
Democratic voters in the latest Field Institute poll, and he has
rounded up endorsements from party leaders including Gov. Gray
Davis and U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, who all
will speak at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-day state visit, Gore will meet with employees of
COVAD, a local high-tech communications firm; attend a private
fund-raiser; address Democratic women at the San Jose Convention
Center; and be the guest of honor at a reception hosted by Davis
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, like Gore, will address the convention Saturday
morning. The former New York Knicks basketball star will then head
to Oakland to appear with some former All-Stars before the NBA's
All-Star game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday as they prepared for the convention, both candidates
ramped up their political attacks on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has questioned Gore's truthfulness, pushed his own
gun control program, which includes registration of all handguns,
mandatory trigger locks and a ban on junk handguns, the so-called
Saturday Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says we should register all _ new _ handguns,'' Bradley
told a crowd at the University Synagogue. ``You have to listen
carefully to all the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said registering new handguns would mean that only 2
million would be registered during Gore's first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to say that is not good enough,'' Bradley told an
enthusiastic crowd of about 300 supporters. ``We can do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's accusations drew a scathing response from California
Attorney General Bill Lockyer, a strong proponent of gun control
and a Gore supporter who argued there are ``no significant
differences'' between the two candidates on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been active in politics for almost 50 years, and I've
learned to recognize the odor of a campaign that's about to
implode,'' Lockyer said. ``That, unfortunately for Mr. Bradley, is
what's happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic campaigns also continued bickering about the
schedule for debates over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley had called for Gore to debate him twice a week
leading up to California's March 7 primary, the vice president's
campaign argued both sides should ban 30-second television spots _
a critical tool in California's numerous television markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley now has abandoned his ``all debates, all the time'' plan
and has accepted invitations for five head-to-head appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has agreed to meet Bradley for two televised debates, one
on February 21 at the Apollo Theatre in New York City and the other
on March 1 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley picked up noteworthy endorsements
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore touted the support of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley scored a coup that would make Madison Avenue green
with envy _ the first ever political endorsement from basketball
legend Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said Jordan has filmed a
television commercial that will start running Friday in some of the
key March 7 primary states. That will probably include California,
although no one with the staff would confirm which states.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not mention the Jordan endorsement _ expected to be
announced formally Friday _ but he did hint, ``I need to get my
message out in the next month, and I'm going to have some help from
some unusual sources.''
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of real-life emergency room drama, melding the key
campaign issues of the day, Gore's motorcade was held up outside
the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center for half an hour Thursday
as three victims of a drive-by shooting were rushed in for
emergency care. The bloodied victims, taken in on gurneys, were
worked on feverishly by doctors and nurses within view of Gore's
motorcade.

 FDA ORDERS CHECK OF 1,100 JETS  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that it will
require all U.S. airlines to inspect the horizontal stabilizer
mechanism on four models of airplanes after Alaska Airlines
grounded two jets that had metal shavings on a crucial part of the
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to that crucial part, a 6-foot-long shaft known as a
jackscrew, is being looked at as a possible contributing factor in
last week's crash of an Alaska Airlines MD-80 bound from Mexico for
San Francisco and Seattle. All 88 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it would issue its inspection order by early
Friday, covering some 1,100 aircraft. The order makes mandatory a
service bulletin issued by Boeing Co. for its MD-80s and extends it
to other members of that family of aircraft. The group includes
Boeing 717s, originally introduced in October 1995 as MD-95s,
MD-90s and DC-9s.
</P>
<P>
   The fleets will not be grounded during the two to three days the
inspections will take, said FAA spokesman Mitch Barker, because
``this was not felt to be an immediate safety concern. We want them
to do it fast, but they don't have to be grounded while they're
waiting to do this. But it would certainly be prudent to ground any
aircraft that has problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker said the airlines will be required to report to the FAA
any problems found with the stabilizer mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA order does not apply to 800 similar planes that belong
to foreign air carriers. ``But we will be notifying the
international (air regulatory) authorities,'' Barker said, ``and
they usually follow what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines started inspecting the tail sections of its 34
MD-80 jets Wednesday, particularly the jackscrew, a metal shaft
that adjusts the planes' horizontal stabilizers up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said it had grounded the two jets ``after
discrepancies with the jackscrews were discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the January 31 accident of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261, said in a fuller statement that ``the airline found
metal filings or shavings in or around the horizontal stabilizer
jackscrews of two aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline said one of the problem planes was in Seattle, the
other in Portland. The two planes were manufactured within a month
of each other in 1997, records show. The jet that crashed was built
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Flight 261 left Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the
pilots reported to their maintenance base in Seattle and then to
air traffic controllers in Los Angeles that they were having
problems with the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned from the recovered flight data recorder
showed that the plane was wildly out of control during its final
few minutes. When Navy teams later found the stabilizer's jackscrew
on the ocean bottom some 10 miles off the Ventura County coast, it
was found to be damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew is a metal shaft that operates much like the screw
shaft on some electric garage door openers. The shaft turns in its
own length while a nut travels back and forth along the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Flight 261's stabilizer, Hall said an NTSB
metallurgist examining the jackscrew found that ``shreds of metal
seen attached to that jackscrew are of the same material as the
threads of the gimbal nut that would normally be attached to that
jackscrew.''
</P>
<P>
   In photographs released by federal investigators, pieces of
metal can be seen wrapped around the jackscrew.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said it has not yet found the gimbal nut from Flight
261.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Alaska Airlines said it is nearly through inspecting
all 34 of its MD-80s. Twenty-six of them are back in service
``after inspections of their jackscrews revealed no problems.'' Six
planes are still being inspected and undergoing regularly scheduled
maintenance. The last two are the ones with jackscrew problems.

 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DIOCESE SCANDALS PUSH BELIEVERS TO LIMIT  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENDOCINO _ His morning duties completed, the Rev. John Martin
stood in the makeshift sanctuary at St. Anthony's parish, folding
his vestments and thinking about the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lied to, manipulated and deceived,'' said Martin,
summing up his congregation's feelings about the scandal-ridden
Diocese of Santa Rosa. ``There is zero trust.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, the embattled diocese seemed finally to be getting
over a series of revelations involving pedophile priests and
alleged church coverups. Then the admission of a sexual affair
between a Costan Rican priest and Santa Rosa Bishop G. Patrick
Ziemann toppled the once-popular prelate.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemann's departure led to the resignation of the longtime
finance director of the diocese and revelations that millions of
dollars in parish funds have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, a fire gutted St. Anthony's picturesque
wooden church in November, forcing the Mendocino congregation to
celebrate Mass in a cramped parish hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about the gates of hell,'' said Martin. ``It has been
quite a year.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how much money has been lost by North Coast
parishes, or where it all went. Depending on how the calculations
are made and how much real estate the diocese sells off in the next
few months, the church is somewhere between $13 million and $30
million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Millions raised by local parishioners for parochial school
improvements, special charities and other worthy projects had been
deposited into a ``consolidated account'' controlled by Ziemann and
Monsignor Thomas Keyes, the former vicar general and chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   That money is gone. Those left to clean up the mess blame
overspending, risky investments in shady pyramid schemes and
millions in payoffs to sex abuse victims, as well as a bishop's
``discretionary fund'' that ballooned under Ziemann's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors are still going through $2 million in checks written by
Ziemann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who many of these people are,'' said James
Dillon, a member of a new diocesan finance council.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon told an angry crowd of hundreds of Catholics gathered
last week in Santa Rosa that Ziemann was primarily guilty of
``overspending'' on church projects and having ``no concern
whatsoever for financial responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find any Cadillacs or vacation homes,'' Dillon added.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemann resigned in July after admitting a ``consensual'' sexual
affair with the Rev. Jorge Hume Salas. His resignation came after
Salas filed a lawsuit charging that the bishop demanded sexual
favors in exchange for keeping quiet about money Salas stole from
St. Mary of the Angels parish in Ukiah.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders say Ziemann has been receiving treatment at a
special Roman Catholic retreat center.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor John Brenkle, another member of the finance council,
tried to keep the peace last Friday night as dozens of Catholics
approached the microphone at a ``venting session'' at St. Eugene's
Cathedral in Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioner Yvette Fallandy did not wait for her turn at the
microphone. She popped out of her chair, pointed her finger at
Brenkle and screamed, ``Where is Keyes? Why is he not here
tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Since his resignation, Keyes has been keeping a low profile at
the Catholic parish in Oakmont, a prosperous retirement community
south of Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ochoa of Santa Rosa approached the microphone with a sign
asking, ``When Will the Church Pay for Its Sins?'' He urged the
crowd to stop sending money to the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need accountability,'' he said. ``Don't bail them out.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the congregations hardest hit by the collapse of the
consolidated account is St. Rose parish in Santa Rosa, which lost
about $1.9 million. That total includes $600,000 in parish savings
and $1.3 million in money raised to build a new multipurpose
building for the parochial school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the money was from schoolkids who'd saved up their
allowance,'' said the Rev. Dennis O'Sullivan, the pastor of St.
Rose. ``We'd been working on that project for 12 years, and had
just signed a contract to start building.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop William Levada of San Francisco, assigned by the pope
to run the North Coast diocese temporarily, has borrowed $6 million
from other California bishops to keep the diocese afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the widespread mistrust of the Santa Rosa Diocese,
church leaders say the parishes now control their own savings
accounts. About 13 percent of parish collections, however, still
goes to support the diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Priest and lay leaders in the 140,000-member diocese, which
stretches from Petaluma to the Oregon border, say most Catholics
have remained loyal to their parishes despite their anger at
regional church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the sex and money scandal has given rise to
demands for fundamental church reforms, such as allowing priests to
marry and letting clergy and laity select the next bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Diocesan officials still face several lawsuits against priests
accused of child molestation, sexual harassment and other moral
lapses. And the North Coast is rife with rumors about the sex lives
of other Catholic clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Many parishioners say they are tired of Pope John Paul II
appointing bishops from Southern California to lead the North Coast
church. Ziemann was an auxiliary bishop under Cardinal Roger Mahony
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Brenkle said the diocese should expect a new bishop ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be another protegee of Cardinal Mahony
from Los Angeles,'' he said. ``Frankly, I don't know who'd want to
come here. The guy would have to be a real masochist.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the Mendocino pastor, hopes the new bishop will be
``someone who will work collegially with the priests and laity of
this diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone with allegiance to the people he is called to
serve, not to Rome,'' the priest said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziemann is not a popular bishop in Mendocino. He visited St.
Anthony's parish in March, only four months before he resigned and
admitted the sexual affair with Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Salas had already been accused of sexual impropriety at a Napa
parish (which he denies) and stealing church money at a Ukiah
parish (which he admits). But at the time of Ziemann's visit to
Mendocino in March, no one knew about the sexual relationship
between Salas and the bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziemann sat right in front of me and said he would not put up
with any sexual misconduct among his priests,'' said parishioner
John Ruprecht. ``I was totally taken in by the guy. He was a total
hypocrite, and a very good liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruprecht knows Christians are supposed to forgive, but he said
he is not quite ready to take that step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness only comes after contrition,'' Ruprecht said.
``Ziemann hasn't had the courage to come forward and take
responsibility for what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at St. Mary of the Angels parish in Ukiah, where the
Ziemann/Salas scandal began, the current pastor left this month on
a six-month sabbatical, citing ``the stresses of the last several
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Levada put a married woman in charge of the
parish. Mary Leittem-Thomas, a mother of four and member of the
parish for 24 years, had served for the past seven years as
``pastoral associate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was logical but extraordinary and bold for him to appoint a
lay woman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several priests will be available to administer the sacraments,
but Leittem-Thomas runs the parish, where more than 1,000 Catholics
attend services on an average weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, she said, the church was full, and a decrease in
collection plate offerings appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they are being heard in a way they weren't in the
past,'' she said. ``We have to get past the anger.''

MAVERICK MCCAIN'S RECORD SHOWS HE'S A TRUE CONSERVATIVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wowed by his valor in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, his tough stance against special interests and his straight
talk, many independents and even a good number of Democrats have
been drawn toward John McCain's surging quest for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with the Arizona senator's life story and his
willingness to defy party leaders has deflected attention from his
conservative political background and has left many voters unaware
of _ or unconcerned with _ his record.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over his core philosophy was captured on the cover of
the left-leaning New Republican &LR;  magazine, which headlined a recent
McCain profile, ``This man is NOT a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Since becoming a member of the House of
Representatives in 1983 and a member of the Senate four years
later, McCain has compiled a solid conservative voting record that
has been consistently pro-business, pro-gun, pro-military,
anti-abortion, anti-spending and anti-tax.
</P>
<P>
   He supported President Clinton's impeachment and every item in
the GOP's ``Contract With America.'' He voted to confirm
conservative Supreme Court nominees Clarence Thomas and Robert
Bork. He voted against the Brady gun-control bill and California
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ban on assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has earned near perfect marks from the Christian
Coalition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Taxpayer's
Union. Last year, he introduced legislation to prohibit even the
discussion of abortion at federally funded family planning clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is a Ronald Reagan Republican,'' said Sen. Chuck
Hagel, R-Nebraska, a McCain supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the issue is _ tax cuts, less spending,
strong national defense, right to life _ he is in the mainstream of
Republican conservative philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion about McCain's political leanings come
from his break with Republican Party leaders on two high-profile
issues _ campaign finance reform and tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   His bill to restrict the size of contributions to political
parties has enraged party officials, who say it would
disproportionately hurt Republicans, and many well-financed
advocacy groups, whose influence would be limited.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
McCain helped craft legislation that would have imposed new taxes
and regulations on cigarettes, a move that earned him scorn from
fellow Republicans and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion also has been fanned by attempts of his GOP rivals
_ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Ambassador Alan Keyes _ to
portray themselves as the true conservatives in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain said he favors using the nation's budget surplus to
pay down the federal debt, Bush questioned his conservative
credentials. And when McCain told The Chronicle last summer that an
immediate ban on abortion might force some women into dangerous
illegal procedures, Keyes and other social conservatives said he
was unfit for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is conservative,'' said Dan Schnur, his
communications director. ``But he doesn't see the world in black
and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the title of bedrock conservative is a badge of honor
to some voters and a matter of shame for others. In South Carolina,
Bush and McCain are fighting for the mantle, while in the Bay Area,
Democrats use the label as an epithet
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush and John McCain are two of a kind,'' said Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., in a comment intended to reflect
positively on neither.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who has served with McCain for half of his Senate career,
is preparing a scathing attack on the senator for tomorrow's state
Democratic convention in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is one of the most anti-gun control, anti-choice,
anti-environment, anti-public education senators we have in the
Senate,'' said Boxer. ``Does he have a tremendous story? Yes. Do I
respect him? Yes. Do I want his finger on the button? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuances of McCain's positions on some issues leave him open
to attack by opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, for example, his support for amending the
Republican Party platform to allow for abortion in cases of incest,
rape or to save the life of the mother _ and his refusal to use the
issue as a litmus test for a vice president _ has led to harsh
condemnation by many social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pro-choice advocates say a McCain presidency would
endanger a women's right to an abortion. Of the 86 abortion and
family planning votes McCain has cast during his 17 years in
Congress, 82 have been contrary to reproductive rights, according
to the National Abortion Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked his entire career in the Senate to make it
difficult for women to have an abortion,'' said the group's
president, Kate Michelman.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, McCain voted just 13 percent of the time to
support environmental legislation, according to ratings released
Thursday by the League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain supports a ban on offshore oil drilling and has
a strong record of support for the Grand Canyon, ``overall John
McCain's record on environmental protection is weak,'' said Betty
Loyless, the league's political director.
</P>
<P>
   In typical McCain fashion, he has also earned the wrath of
property rights advocates for his insistence that Republicans
temper their anti-environment rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 opinion piece for the New York Times, McCain wrote,
``We Republicans are responsible for much of the negative
perception of our environmental record.''
</P>
<P>
   The blunt words angered some Republicans, who felt it gave their
critics ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always his own self-promotion over the larger interest,''
said Mike Hardiman of the American Land Rights Association.
</P>
<P>
   McCain frequently makes a point of saying that he does not feel
bound by his party's dogma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a proud Republican, but my pride obligates me to speak in
opposition to ideas that are at variance with our principles,
whether those ideas are proposed by Democrats or Republicans,'' he
said in a speech to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is language like that that makes McCain a maverick to some
and a traitor to others.
</P>
<P>
   His opposition to Bush's tax cut plan is what led the New
Republic to question his Republican credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began as an isolated heresy on campaign finance is
metastasizing into a full-scale assault on the principles that
define what it means to be a Republican,'' journalist Jonathan
Chait writes in his McCain cover piece in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Boxer and supporters like Hagel agree that
McCain should be judged not by his speeches, position papers or
comments made on his campaign bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,''
but rather on the votes he has cast during his long Washington
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the test,'' said Hagel. ``It's not how many speeches
you make. What matters is when you're on the line with a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain's voting record leaves no doubt that he's a
Republican.

 CANDIDATES GO BACK IN TIME ON ECONOMY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With wallets flush from nine years of economic
expansion, surplus revenue overflowing the treasury and optimism
and contentment across the land, the candidates in this
presidential contest are struggling to shape an economic agenda for
a time of unsurpassed prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference from eight years ago, when ``It's the economy,
stupid'' steered then-Gov. Clinton's campaign for the White House,
just as the nation began pulling out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the zenith of an unprecedented economic boom, the
candidates are turning to the political ghosts of a parallel era _
the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more striking than in the insurgent candidacy of
Arizona Sen. John McCain, who has all but turned away from the GOP
lodestar, tax cuts, in what some call a return to Eisenhower
Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain so clobbered George W. Bush, the Texas
governor whose across-the-board tax cut draws from supply-side
Reaganism, that GOP strategist Bill Kristol sadly declared
conservatism ``finished.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the differences are more subtle but the challenge
is no less significant.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
both embrace a resurgent government activism reminiscent of Lyndon
Johnson's Great Society: an end to child poverty, health care for
all and the underlying conviction that government should do more,
not less.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences in economic philosophy boil down to approach.
Bradley argues that government ``should do a few big things well,''
while Gore says, ``there's no limit to what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates, projected federal budget surpluses provide
a once-in-a-generation chance for government to rectify lingering
social ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Bradley seems to believe America can address only one
thing at a time, that health care is the only challenge we can
handle,'' Gore said in a major speech outlining his economic
agenda. ``In the midst of this powerful economic recovery, America
can master all our challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's economic speeches are loaded with proposals on everything
from a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare to more farm aid
to a bigger Head Start program to tuition subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to choose,'' Gore said. ``I will balance the
budget every year and run surpluses every year. ... I will move
heaven and earth to help the family farmers. ... I will fight to
expand and then universalize health care coverage. ... I will fight
to save and revolutionize public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley likewise sets out an ambitious, albeit more focused,
economic agenda. His centerpiece is ``to eliminate child poverty as
we know it'' and expand federal health insurance to many of the 45
million Americans now uninsured, at a cost he estimates at $65
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Casting himself as a bold liberal for a new century, Bradley
dismisses what he calls ``nickel and diming'' and ``nibbling around
the edges'' of social issues, a veiled reference to Clintonian
incrementalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the task of government, and thus of public leaders, to
ensure that all should have a chance, with their own effort and
abilities, to find a decent level of comfort and fulfillment for
themselves and their families,'' Bradley said in a major poverty
speech.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley and Gore both insist that they would maintain
federal surpluses, an independent tally by the Washington Post last
fall pegged their spending plans at well above $1 trillion each
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   That figure falls within the most optimistic surplus
projections, but it oversteps the more realistic mid-range
estimates of an $838 billion accumulated surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore and Bradley are pretty close to each other, although
they're making it appear as if they're on two sides of the Atlantic
Ocean,'' said Allen Schick, a Brookings Institution budget expert.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the differences are sharper.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main plank is a $483 billion, five-year tax cut,
dedicated chiefly to cutting tax rates across the board. Half the
cut would go to the lower brackets, a third to the middle brackets
and a sixth to what he calls the ``entrepreneurs and creators of
wealth'' in the top brackets.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's charge that his tax cut is ``reckless,''
Bush said he is ``always amazed when I hear politicians say
government cannot `afford' a tax cut. May I remind them that
government does not `pay' for anything? The people pay for
government. The question is not how much government can afford to
give to taxpayers. The question is how much the taxpayers can
afford to give to government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's economic advisers argue that his proposed cut was made as
large as possible to still remain within surplus projections.
Critics charge that over 10 years, rather than the five used by
Bush, the tax cut would rise to $1.3 trillion and overtake the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Bush says he favors private accounts, but
for now would continue the current policy of setting aside all
Social Security revenue to pay down the national debt, which would
make it easier to maintain the program's solvency in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, McCain emphasizes reducing the national debt
through an economic policy he calls ``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has offered a tax cut, too, but at $237 billion over five
years, it has no rate cuts and is derided as ``Clinton Lite'' by
conservatives. Like Bradley, McCain would close roughly $100
billion in ``loopholes'' in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he is ``guided by the legacy of Ronald Reagan _ that
empowering free markets is the path to prosperity.'' But he also
urges ``the lesson of the 1990s, that balancing the budget
unleashes the full potential of private initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls his economic plan ``a new fiscal conservatism for the
new century.'' Instead of tax cuts, he emphasizes debt reduction.
Following President Clinton's proposal from last year, McCain would
spend a large portion of projected surpluses on Social Security,
but he also calls for allowing people to put as much as 20 percent
of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would squander the surplus on building an ever-bigger
government,'' McCain said in announcing his economic agenda.
``Others suggest that we should use every penny for tax cuts,
forgetting we have promises to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Moore, a budget analyst for the libertarian Cato
Institute, calls McCain ``a 1950s Eisenhower Republican'' focused
on fiscal restraint and debt retirement who is ``almost running as
an anti-supply sider.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax cut is ``a surprisingly small one for a
Republican,'' Schick agreed. ``McCain is going to clean up
government, but he's not going to really trim government.''
McCain's voting record shows attacks on pork barrel projects, but
less effort to cut overall spending. ``He's a pork-buster, rather
than a government-buster,'' Schick said.
</P>
<P>
   Schick said Bush's economic agenda, on the other hand, is that
of a ``populist Republican'' who wants to cut taxes and spend more
on things like education, ``so he needs the economy to help him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual in campaigns, there's an adding-up problem with all
of them,'' said Rudolph Penner, a former congressional budget
director. All the candidates insist they will avoid deficits, he
said, ``but all of them seem to be understating the kind of growth
in discretionary spending we're going to have in the next few
years'' that is likely to erase much of the projected surplus.

<P>
   The most tumultuous free-agency period in NFL history caused
many teams to dump high-priced veterans as they struggled to get
under the $62.17 million salary cap by Thursday's midnight
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Teams found out in December that free agency would be moved up
from March 1 to Feb. 11 because the NFL Players Association and NFL
Management Council were unable to resolve a dispute over the
franchise player designation.
</P>
<P>
   Because teams got a late start and the cap increased by only $5
million per team, there has been frenzied activity to restructure
contracts and waive veterans to free up cap room. The NFL was
stunned by a series of moves Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo released three of the best players in NFL history _
defensive end Bruce Smith, running back Thurman Thomas and receiver
Andre Reed. Smith, Thomas and Reed helped the Bills reach four
consecutive Super Bowls in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day, a very sad day,'' said Smith, who is one of
the best pass rushers in history. ``I thought I would have finished
my career in Buffalo and had an opportunity to go back and win a
championship in Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami quarterback Dan Marino voided his contract and went to
Orlando to talk with Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy. Marino doesn't
want to leave Florida, because he wants to be close to his family
in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued into the night as teams tried to get
their players re-signed before they were able to test the market.
</P>
<P>
   There is free-agent talent at almost every position. Teams that
manage the cap the best and do their homework the most thoroughly
are the ones that usually do the best job in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback, receiver, offensive line and defensive line are
four of the deepest areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many players, including Raiders receiver Tim Brown, Patriots
safety Lawyer Milloy and Colts tight end Ken Dilger, elected to
sign new deals rather than test the free-agent market. The Patriots
waived tight end Ben Coates and offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong
to make Milloy the highest-paid safety in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle receiver Joey Galloway, who missed the first part of the
season in a contract holdout, won his bid to become an unrestricted
free agent when arbitrator Nick Pumas ruled in Washington, D.C.,
that he played enough games to fulfill the fifth year of his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Denver waived defensive ends Neil Smith and Alfred Williams, who
both helped the Broncos win back-to-back Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   49ers quarterback Steve Young restructured his contract to free
up $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the 49ers were in more trouble than any team
because they were $20 million over the cap. The league was so
concerned about their situation that the NFL Management Council
sent a representative to San Francisco to help the 49ers get under
the cap.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday's deadline, they had done enough slicing and dicing
of such veterans as safety Tim McDonald, linebacker Lee Woodall and
defensive end Charles Haley to be about $3.5 million under the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of hard work, planning and researching,''
49ers general manager Bill Walsh said. ``We'll miss the players who
are gone and appreciate that many others have stepped forward and
were willing to restructure their contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted free agents _ those with at least four years of
experience _ have from today until July 15 to sign with other
teams. Restricted free agents _ three-year veterans _ have until
April 14 to sign with other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the notable restricted free agents is Cowboys linebacker
Dexter Coakley. Dallas released offensive lineman Everett McIver on
Thursday and offered Coakley $1,027,000 for next season. If Coakley
receives another offer, Dallas has the choice of matching it or
receiving a first-round draft pick as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Players always hope to avoid the franchise tag, but some of the
better players in the league were unable to. Detroit defensive end
Robert Porcher, Jacksonville defensive end Tony Brackens,
Washington running back Stephen Davis, Arizona defensive end Simeon
Rice, San Diego defensive tackle Norman Hand and New York Jets
linebacker Mo Lewis, among others, were designated as franchise
players Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There are two levels of franchise players. An exclusive
franchise player isn't free to sign with another team and is
offered a minimum of the average salary of the five highest-paid
players at his position as of April 14, or 120 percent of the
player's previous year's salary, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   A non-exclusive franchise player can negotiate with other teams.
His old team can match a new team's offer or receive two
first-round draft choices if it decides not to match.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, teams slap the franchise tag on a player to
keep him from leaving and continue to negotiate a long-term
contract. Few franchise players actually play one season at the
average salary of the five highest-paid players at their position.

<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ There were F-16s whistling overhead,
intermingled with the occasional low-flying helicopter as traffic
at nearby Miramar Marine Corps Air Station was dominating the sky
above Torrey Pines Golf Course on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the ground, Davis Love III was the one making the
loudest sonic boom, while Tiger Woods was playing more like a
chopper.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't exactly beat it like a 15-handicapper at the North
Course at Torrey Pines, but he hacked it up a little, at least by
his standards. It took him five holes before he hit a green in
regulation. He missed two putts inside five feet, including one
that was a few inches inside three feet. Woods spent enough time in
the rough to mow it down a few inches.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, with all these problems, he ballooned to an
un-Tigeresque score _ all the way to 1-under-par 71, which left him
comfortably placed in a 24-way tie for 43rd place at the Buick
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Love, trying to win his first tournament in 22 months, shot
7-under 65 on the more difficult South Course and owns a one-shot
lead over Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, trying to win his seventh consecutive start on the PGA
Tour, offered no excuses for not taking advantage of what is a
fairly simple course by PGA Tour standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit the ball well, and I didn't putt well,'' he said.
``That's about as uncomfortable as I've felt on the course this
year. And I really don't know why. I'd like to say there's some
reason. But I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-popular ``that's golf'' excuse could hold some water.
But Woods said if anything could be the culprit, it was the delayed
Monday finish at Pebble Beach, which effectively eliminated a day
that Woods normally takes for rest between back-to-back
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he wasn't so spent that he isn't still in the hunt
to make it seven wins in a row as his relentless pursuit of Byron
Nelson's record of 11 consecutive victories continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of holes left to play,'' Woods said. ``I proved
that last year that you can make up a lot of ground on the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Woods shot 62-65 during the final two rounds here to
win. And considering he survived Thursday without posting a huge
number on the scoreboard, he's certainly in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But so are several other marquee players in a relatively weak
Buick field, led by Love and Mickelson, who combined for zero wins
in '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Tiger's play is forcing everybody to play at a
whole other level if we expect to compete with him,'' Mickelson
said. ``And with him winning the last six tournaments, nobody has
really done it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this week, I think guys like Fred Couples (4-under 68),
Davis Love and myself are really trying to play at a different
level and hopefully have a different winner out on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Love's start in the Buick was one for the books. He did not make
a par on the front nine, after which he was 3 under par. He had
five pars on the back nine. He said it's typical of the way he has
been playing as he tinkers with his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some physical problems in the last year that were
contributed to by not swinging well,'' he said. ``This round was
kind of like I've been playing a lot lately _ erratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Three bogeys, five pars and 10 birdies is not a bad way to have
an erratic round, though. Love bogeyed two of his first three holes
and three of the first seven yet was 1 under par at that point. He
then ran in a six-foot putt on the par-3 eighth after a nice 7-iron
and sank a 15-footer for birdie on the par-5 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He closed the round with three consecutive birdies. The par-5
18th featured a monstrous tee shot. Love said he had 155 yards to
the pin on his second shot, meaning his drive went 343 yards. He
routinely two-putted for the birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mickelson, though, Love was keeping his eyes peeled for
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the tournament starts, you're trying to win,'' Love said.
``But you can't avoid talking about it. It's just an incredible
streak. And it's amazing how things have fallen in place for him.
He's been an intimidating player to play with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Nicklaus won a lot of golf tournaments by having his name
up there, not by how he played coming down the stretch. Guys
sometimes believe more in other people's games than their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, Love isn't ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of last year, nobody was talking about Tiger,''
Love said. ``It was all about David Duval. Now, we all know that
Tiger is super-talented and he's the guy to beat right now. But I
don't think between him and David Duval and Ernie Els and a few
others that there is that big a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the only difference was that Woods was the one
struggling. He started on the 10th hole on the North Course, and he
had to make a 12-foot putt to save par after missing that green. He
bogeyed the 11th hole when his tee shot hooked into the ravine,
which prompted him to bury the head of his driver into the tee box.
He had to take an unplayable lie. He needed a six-foot putt after
blasting from the greenside bunker to avoid his first double bogey
of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He also bogeyed the par-3 12th but seemed to right his round
when he bombed in a 30-foot eagle putt on the 14th.
</P>
<P>
   But it just wasn't meant to be as he never got any momentum
going. By the time he played his final hole, the 548-yard ninth, he
snap-hooked his tee shot and had to negotiate a tree on his
backswing but still got his second shot within 120 yards of the
green. He left the approach 40 feet short, however, and had to can
a six-foot comebacker to save par.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Stan Albeck made his way over to Rudy Tomjanovich's table to offer
a familiar smile in hard times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How are things going?'' asked Albeck, an Atlanta Hawks
assistant coach with enough head coaching miles to think he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Tomjanovich said through bites of salad. ``It's going
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeck smiled broadly and placed a hand on Tomjanovich's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it is,'' he said, and left with something along the lines
of ``Hang in there,'' returning Tomjanovich to his romaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happens all the time,'' Tomjanovich said. ``They don't
understand. It really is going good.''
</P>
<P>
   The clues do tend to deceive. The Rockets head to the All-Star
break at 20-30. They are sixth in the Midwest Division, ahead of
only Vancouver, and 11th in the Western Conference. Only seven
teams in the NBA have worse records.
</P>
<P>
   The season has been filled not just with the calamitous injuries
to Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley but has included injury-list
visits by fellow frontcourt players Kelvin Cato, Carlos Rogers and
Tony Massenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich and the Rockets, however, insist the first half of
the season has been a valuable exercise and that the second half
can be rewarding this season and beyond. And there have been signs
of progress. They went 4-11 in November, 6-9 in December and 7-7 in
January. They have beaten the Trail Blazers, the Heat and the
Lakers, all championship contenders. At full strength, they were
3-11. Despite the injuries, they have been close to .500 since.
</P>
<P>
   There have been growing pains, the Rockets admit. But they
emphasize the growth rather than the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I am,'' Tomjanovich said. ``When
you look at how we've been the last few years, it was positive with
older, superstar players, but we knew that a transition was on the
horizon. I thought it would be a three-year plan to get where we
are now, to get a lottery-pick guy and to get some athletic young
big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to go down, get a Steve (Francis), go through
another season, get other lottery players, then maybe we could
start growing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm excited about, I can see the framework is in for the
future already. It's probably more than a framework. I thought we
would have to go through a bunch of hell to have a little spike to
start the foundation. Already we have Steve. Cuttino (Mobley) is
solid. Shandon (Anderson) is solid. We have young, athletic guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that might have been true as soon as offseason trades
went through. There is value in finding out on the court if the
deals had indeed brought the intended framework.
</P>
<P>
   But that value has been gained. The 32 games after the break
must be about something more than finding out again if Francis is
everything he seems, or to get more playing time for fellow rookie
Kenny Thomas or second-year guards Bryce Drew and Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   Francis has clear goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear we can be a good team,'' Francis said. ``Next year and
as soon as this year, we can finish strong. People say we're
lottery-bound. I still want to get in the playoffs, get in the
playoffs and make some noise. I'm serious. It's no joke to me. I
still think we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that is unlikely, the Rockets said there is
something to gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building for the future right now,'' forward Matt
Bullard said. ``We'd love to make the playoffs. But it's kind of a
far-fetched goal. We're just trying to compete with ourselves game
by game, trying to get better. And we're getting a jump-start on
next year and the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had Charles and Hakeem all season, next year we would
have started over. Next year, we will be leaps and bounds ahead of
where we would have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like rebuilding without having to start over.
Ending the season on a good, positive note definitely gives you
momentum, keeps you working hard through the summer knowing you're
coming back to a team that's doing something good.''
</P>
<P>
   It has worked for the Rockets before. When the Rockets took off
in the spring of 1993, it paid off with championships the next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a team that was struggling,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We
lost seven in a row. Everybody did a whole bunch of soul-searching.
This is a different situation. Those guys were established players.
But all of a sudden, it happened. We found out our identity. We
found out how to win. After that, we went 41-11 and 15-0 (to start
the next season). That was the process where we found out who we
were.''
</P>
<P>
   That team had Olajuwon reaching his prime. Next season's team
will have Olajuwon in his last swing through the NBA. Tomjanovich
will not presume to consider the remaining months of the season the
start of a run to multiple championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll reach a plateau somewhere down the line,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``It keeps growing. Getting to the next level is going to
take something special. Either great, great chemistry or getting
something out of a player that's over and above what we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the mid-'90s team, the bulk of this season's Rockets
will be next season's Rockets. If they are to write off the rest of
the season as a fight for lottery position, they would also be
admitting a similar fate next season as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you're going to see the next two years,''
Cato said. ``If we don't make the playoffs, we'll get a nice draft
pick, but I don't think there's a draft pick out there that's going
to change too much about this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going out just for the hell of it. We're trying to
go out and try to win. We've got a good team. But we're still
learning. We've got a rookie point guard, a second-year point
guard. We've got a second-year two guard. We've got a four-year two
guard who really didn't play a lot of minutes where he was. We've
got a third-year center starting in front of a 16-year center only
because Dream's been hurt. We've got a lot of young talent on this
team. And we're learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would like to glean from the season's unofficial
second half, Tomjanovich thought back to the stretch after the
All-Star Game in 1993 and said: ``Progress. I don't know if you can
measure it in numbers. Sometimes it's like a light bulb finally
going on. That's how it happened with the championship season.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tomjanovich's brief visit with Albeck, Anderson gets the
understanding assumptions. His answer brings sympathetic smiles and
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it to me all the time,'' he said. ```Do you wish
you were still in Utah?' No, I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said if we played together we could have a good team.
When I first got here, I knew we had a good team. But we were
losing a lot of games early. People always said, `Shandon, do you
think you made the right decision?' I never thought about it. I
never looked back. I knew. I knew in the situation we're in now we
had shooters, we had guys who could get inside, guys that create
their own shots. We had everything the NBA wants now here.''
</P>
<P>
   To that they can add 32 games to get it together.

   NETRICH-CHARITY (Seattle) _ The Internet has created a spate of
young millionaires, and many of them are turning their attention to
philanthropy in their own ways. They describe their activities as
``venture philanthropy,'' modeled on their business experiences,
and some promote the concept of e-philanthropy, which involves
finding ways to make charitable giving easier. Rather than giving
to traditional charities, they see themselves as investing in
programs that will bring about long-term change in fields like
education and the environment. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

every elected Republican official across New York. And there are

Senate race has been focused nearly entirely upstate in recent

money in television and radio advertisements to woo voters. Long
considered a Republican stronghold, upstate also seems susceptible

creature, pushing it beyond the banalities of network and cable

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE FIRST LADY'S VOYAGE OF SELF-DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton drew a good crowd when
she dropped by the Strong Memorial Hospital's new research wing
earlier this week. Some listened intently as she ticked off a
somber list of promises on health care. Others seemed to be using
their lunch hour to observe a historical phenomenon, the first
first lady running for public office.
</P>
<P>
   It was a policy speech, full of detailed proposals for lower
prescription costs and more funding for medical research. Clinton's
arguments were crisp, her delivery precise, and yet with each point
the crowd in the hospital atrium lost more people from around its
edges.
</P>
<P>
   For all her efforts, for all the campaign's careful matching of
site and subject, her audience did not seem to shift noticeably
into her corner. Her friends left feeling friendly; her foes were
not convinced. More important, some of those in the middle said
they were staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I feel about her,'' said Doria Waddell, a
65-year-old accountant who considers herself a Democrat but who
also admires Clinton's expected opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
``I really have mixed feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed feelings, at this stage, are definitely understandable.
Clinton is a bewilderingly new form of politician who is now in an
urgent race to define herself before Giuliani does it for her. This
competition has been especially intense in the last few days with
her official announcement and video that offer a composite of
lawyer, first lady, wife, mother and maker of mean tossed salads.
Giuliani, meanwhile, is spreading the word that she is an agent of
the left, an interloper parachuting in for the political season, a
woman with ``hostility toward America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticisms are expected in this campaign, and this new New
Yorker seems to do particularly well swatting at Giuliani's
bullying, as she did this week expressing ``outrage'' that her
religion would become a part of the campaign. But Clinton's
surprising difficulty has been figuring out how to present herself
to a crucial segment of white suburban women like Waddell.
</P>
<P>
   These women should naturally gravitate to her, her supporters
figure. Most work; they raise families. Many have left good jobs to
follow their husbands' fortunes _ a role the former Arkansas
attorney turned first lady would seem to understand at a very basic
level.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of these women, whose votes could be crucial in this
race, remain skeptical or at best puzzled about who she is and, in
some cases, why she is doing this to herself. The first lady's
friends have a number of favorite theories about the avalanche of
``Hillary pillories,'' as they call the scorching commentaries
aimed at her. Her status as the president's wife elevates every
campaign event into a grand entry so that many people come to see a
superstar, not just another New York politician. (How many people
turn out to get Chuck Schumer's autograph?) But if she tries to be
ordinary, Clinton risks being looked on as a diva pretending she
wants to do the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   When she went on a listening tour last year in New York state,
people wanted to know why she was so vague, why she had no answers.
Now that she has announced her proposals, like the ones in
Rochester this week to lower the costs of prescriptions to Canada's
prices, consider importing drugs and increase money for research,
critics are picking at details, asking whether Americans should
trust foreign pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, has suggested
that Clinton is suffering from the classic ``double bind'' peculiar
to women in power, including in politics. That bind criticizes the
woman who is too traditionally feminine as incompetent and the
woman who is too competent as unfeminine. A political woman,
especially one like Clinton, must succeed at both.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester speech, laying out her health proposals in a
rather austere way, offered a glimpse of Clinton as policy
advocate, a plus according to pollsters who believe women pay more
attention to issues than men. But Jamieson believes that the
story-telling or ``narrative style'' of speech delivers the serious
stuff in a more compelling way. Although Clinton can do both, she
has spent much of the last week reviving the policy wonk in her
personal repertoire. It might not be the most effective of
political strategies. As Jamieson muses: ``I've always thought law
school incapacitates a lot of women candidates.''

HACKER ATTACKS ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Feb. 11: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when Americans have begun to get accustomed to the
pervasive influence of the Internet, a wave of anonymous assaults
on Web sites has roiled the stability of the newly emerging
cyberworld. The latest hacker attacks, which have disrupted some of
the Web's most popular sites, are especially insidious because they
seem so nihilistic. None appear to have been motivated by blackmail
or other monetary purposes. They may even have been carried out as
a perverse warning, to prove the vulnerability of the Internet to
attack. Whatever the twisted motive, prosecutors are right to
investigate the causes and recommend safeguards, though it may well
be that no safeguard will work perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is nearly impossible to police, for the same reason
that it is so difficult to define. It is not owned or regulated by
the government. Nor is it ``owned'' by private businesses or
individuals. It consists of telephone lines and countless computer
sites linked together in a system through which anyone can navigate
anonymously. In this environment, freedom of expression, commercial
transactions, political activity and the simple pleasure of
gathering information and communicating have come to flourish in
ways few thought possible only a few years ago. These very
qualities are what make the Internet vulnerable to anonymous
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Using technology that is widely available on the Internet
itself, the attackers in the latest case are not seeking to raid
files or steal information like credit card numbers or even
introduce viruses into someone else's system, as has been the case
in recent incidents. Rather they have figured out a way to bombard
certain sites with a multitude of commands or requests, slowing
them down or rendering them incapable of meeting all the demands.
Even more insidiously, the hackers have apparently enlisted
unknowing allies in the attacks by invading vulnerable computer
systems and using those computers to help carry out the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation have announced new efforts to track down
the perpetrators. But they have also admitted that they have few
leads to do the job. They may well be able to get clues, but the
worrisome aspect of the case is that for every five hackers they
may capture, countless others are probably out there, capable of
carrying out the same assaults and perhaps even improving on their
predecessors' ability to cover their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The worst response to these attacks would be for government to
introduce requirements for the Internet that may destroy the
freedom of operation that makes it work so well. It would be
premature to consider regulations that might require users to
identify themselves in all their interactions as they surf the net.
</P>
<P>
   In coming up with ways to protect the system against these
attacks, the businesses that operate on the Internet will probably
have to take the lead over government. Businesses and individuals
must do more to upgrade their software to make it less vulnerable
to attacks. The General Accounting Office has found that many
government agencies do not have adequate software to protect
themselves, and the same is obviously true for many of the attacked
Web sites as well, even those that had recently installed
protective software. There are no perfect defenses against
malicious hackers, but experts within the industry are the ones
most likely to figure out ways to protect the system from future
assaults.

NBA POWER SHIFTS TO THE WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And at the break, the East rested.
</P>
<P>
   It needed to, of course. Bruises take time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA roared through the first half of the season, or at least
half of it did. That would be the half that resides near the left
coast.
</P>
<P>
   As the league pauses this weekend for its annual midseason
All-Star Game, the Western Conference has turned out to be just as
dominating as feared in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty dwell in the West these days, evident by the
standings, conference records, number of dominating players and
rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no easy teams out here,'' said Portland's Scottie
Pippen. ``We can't just mark up W's when we walk into arenas. We
have to come out and play well. We lost to Houston. We lost to
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Indiana and Miami regularly crack those weekly listings of
top-10 teams by most NBA followers. The three best _ Portland,
Lakers and San Antonio _ are all West teams.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the beast is out of the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious the first week of the season that the majority
of the power would be in the West just based on the talent that was
out here, the depth of the teams and the dominating players,'' said
Minnesota coach Flip Saunders. ``You have more dominating players
who can potentially carry a team in the West than in the East.''
The West is home to Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone, Gary
Payton, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd. The East has Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   The West has not been shy about flexing its superior muscles,
either. Entering the final week of the first half, the West held a
134-102 advantage against the East. And the Clippers are still in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is very good this year,'' said Lakers guard Ron
Harper. ``There are at least six, seven teams out here that are
high-caliber basketball teams now. It has come up from a long ways.
You just don't get a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for why there has been such a power shift are hard
to come by. Some would rather not even try.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ever find a reason why those things happen,'' said
Lakers forward A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the better weather in the West,'' offered Portland coach
Mike Dunleavy. ``A lot of teams' free agents have looked to come
this way. It's one of the advantages the Lakers have, Phoenix
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's an advantage West cities have always had, and 10 years
ago the East was the most respected conference. The Bulls may have
been ringing up six titles, but they went through a tough playoff
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East was really tough at one time,'' said Phil Jackson,
then the Bulls coach and now leading the Lakers. ``We had some
really good teams when Charlotte was in its fourth or fifth year.
There was Indiana, Orlando, Detroit was just starting to slide a
little bit. Atlanta was good. The East was a very tough conference
in the early '90s. It's turned around in the last three years.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be cyclical, or simply something of a chain reaction.
One team in the conference improves and the others are compelled to
answer or be left in the competitive dust. So if the Lakers add
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, H(

ANGELS SAY THERE'S NO DEAL _ FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It would not be accurate to say the Angels' Jim
Edmonds dodged a bullet, not when general manager Bill Stoneman
apparently never had his finger on the trigger of a trade that
would have sent the center fielder packing.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, rumored to be a part of a three-team trade that would
have included the Mariners and Reds, instead remains with the
Angels for now.
</P>
<P>
   There were widespread reports that Edmonds would be sent to the
Mariners to replace Ken Griffey Jr., who was traded to the Reds on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, Edmonds would have gone to Seattle in a
package that would have included pitcher Brett Tomko and a couple
of prospects. But the Angels insisted Thursday there was never a
deal in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people really jumped the gun on the rumors,'' said Angels
spokesman Tim Mead. ``I'm not going to say there weren't
discussions. Obviously, you can never say never. But I wouldn't sit
on the edge of your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman did not return telephone calls, instead deferring to
Mead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stoneman) told me there's nothing imminent,'' Mead said.
``Has Seattle called? Yes. Did we have talks with them? Yes. We
talked about a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels team president Tony Tavares was so upset about the radio
talk-show bashing that Stoneman and the Angels have received for
not making a deal that he called radio station XTRA to clear the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (other teams) think we're under duress to trade these
people, they're going to come in and not give us fair-market
value,'' Tavares said. ``We have been offered trades for our
players, but if we make a trade for these Single-A prospects, you
would skewer us for making the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not desperate to make a trade, not when we get second-
rate players in return. If we're going to make a deal, we're going
to make one that helps the Angels, not hurts the Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Edmonds has been all but shipped out
this offseason. During the winter meetings, Edmonds nearly was
traded to Oakland, but Stoneman and A's general manager Billy Beane
could not agree on a return package.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day Thursday, Edmonds' agent Paul Cohen said an
Edmonds trade to Seattle was ``analytically, a little bit
shocking,'' considering Edmonds has made it clear he will not
re-sign with the Mariners after the 2000 season, when he will
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said there was no disappointment from Edmonds when it
became apparent that the player was not going to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' Cohen said. ``Jimmy's saying the city and fans
(of Seattle) are two great situations. But what he's concerned
about is that he has seen what's happened with Randy Johnson and
Junior. He doesn't want to go there because he doesn't want to be
in a similar situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Johnson and Griffey were the most popular players in
the Mariners' history, yet both were traded and not re-signed in
their free agent year because the team either wouldn't or couldn't
pay them their top-dollar market value.
</P>
<P>
   By not making the deal, Stoneman set himself up for more
criticism because the team is lacking in starting pitching.
However, Tomko didn't exactly tear up the National League last
season, going 5-7 with a 4.92 ERA for a Reds team that won 98
games.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edmonds, he's still on the trading block and subject to
the uncertainty of where he'll be playing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of what he does, and part of what I do,'' Cohen
said. ``Last year Eddie Jones was in the same boat with the Lakers.
Every month he was going to be traded, and finally he was. This
year he's one of the top three or four guards in the country.
That's just part of being in L.A. But in seven months, Jim will be
one of the top two, three or four free agents out there. I've
talked to a lot of GMs and they've said he'll be hotly pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Right-hander Mark Petkovsek avoided arbitration by
agreeing to a $1,512,500, one-year contract with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek, 33, had a 10-4 record with a 3.47 ERA in 64 relief
appearances for the Angels last season. He was seeking a raise from
$850,000 to $1.95 million. The Angels countered with an offer of
$1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jason Dickson is the only Angels player still
scheduled for an arbitration hearing.

INJURY-RIDDLED CLIPPERS ARE ROUTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ According to nature buddies with no sense of the
NBA standings, there's a foolproof strategy for surviving a
Grizzlies encounter:
</P>
<P>
   A: Roll over.
</P>
<P>
   B: Play dead.
</P>
<P>
   To those tactics we add C: Rotate the tires on the Clipper
gurney.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips, now taking sore to new heights, had only eight
employees in uniform for Thursday night's 112-90 mauling by the
Vancouver Grizzlies before 9,895 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on the gurney were power forwards Maurice Taylor
(sprained right hand) and Brian Skinner (lingering soreness, left
ankle). Already out of uniform were point guard Eric Murdock (right
ankle) and small forward Tyrone Nesby (right big, bad toe).
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in the Clippers' recent incompetence, it figured the
Grizzlies (14-34) would show up and really go to town. They did,
but not until the home team hustled out to an 11-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Michael Dickerson, who scored 24 of his career-high
40 points in the first half, took over from there, and the Clips
lost for the sixth game in a row (20 of 22, but who's counting?).
Interim head coach Jim Todd piloted his fourth defeat since
inheriting the job from pal Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't muster the energy we had last night,'' said
Todd, whose team looked relatively sharp Wednesday before losing in
Portland. ``I guess we just ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the Clippers (11-38) had a rent-to-own deal
with the Grizzlies. But Thursday's victory was Vancouver's 10th in
the 20 meetings between these two flowerhouses, and third in this
season's four showdowns. Dickerson's effort was one point short of
the franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that,'' said Dickerson, who averages 17 points
per game, ``until I got to the bench.'' His informant was teammate
Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves, who just happens to hold that
scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   While getting smoked by Dickerson, Clipper Derek Anderson
answered by scoring an inconsequential 29 points. Center Michael
Olowokandi added 14 for the Clips, who received another silent
night (7 points, 7 assists, 7 rebounds) from Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who injured his hand on a failed dunk attempt at
Portland, did contribute sideline advice for Odom after the rookie
reacted to a fourth-quarter Grizzlies score by punching the ball
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him I know what's he's going through because I've
been through it,'' Taylor said of his pep talk with Odom. ``He's
just 20 years old. He's frustrated about losing, about defining his
role on the team. This (All-Star) break comes at a great time for
him.''

SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HAS LOW OPINION OF L.A. LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley residents give low marks to
the Los Angeles City Council and Los Angeles Unified School
District and more than half would vote to secede from Los Angeles,
according to a poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, commissioned by the Economic Alliance of the San
Fernando Valley, 84 percent were aware of cityhood efforts in the
Valley and 56 percent said they would vote for cityhood if the
election were held now.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 percent said they would vote against secession and 23
percent did not know.
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 percent of the 801 people polled by the Rose Institute
at Claremont McKenna College gave a favorable rating to the Los
Angeles City Council and only 23 percent approved of the job being
done by the LAUSD board.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are among the lowest ratings I've ever seen for a city
council,'' said researcher Alan Heslop, who conducted the public
opinion poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the glaring spots of discontent, Valley residents
overwhelmingly plan to remain here, said Heslop, a researcher at
the Rose Institute of State and Local Government.
</P>
<P>
   Among the respondents, 73 percent rated their quality of life as
``good'' or ``excellent.'' But respondents also expressed concern
over traffic and crime. Many said they would be willing to pay
higher taxes to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Michael Feuer, whose district includes the southeast
portion of the San Fernando Valley, said the survey results
demonstrate that people want more integrity in their government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to take every step we can to gain
confidence,'' said Feuer, one of a handful of candidates for city
attorney. ``All of us should aspire to have people think we're
doing an excellent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Valley's dissatisfaction with the City Council,
Feuer said secession isn't the way to address residents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of respondents said they think the Valley
could help its economy and have more clout if it were independent,
including 20 percent who said they strongly agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't heard how secession per se is going to do any
of those things _ get more trees trimmed, more sidewalks paved,
more firefighters and paramedics,'' Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar survey of business leaders in the Valley found
employers satisfied with the skilled work force but concerned about
a lack of space for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll probed business leaders' image of the region as well,
said Douglas Svensson, managing principal of Berkeley-based Applied
Development Economics, the firm that conducted the business survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``One respondent said that there were points of beauty and
interest, but as an overall character there is a sprawl and
sameness to the region,'' Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll does show residents are content with basic city
services but concerned about the environment and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent expressed concern about air quality, 62
percent were worried about water pollution and 60 percent were
concerned about trash and landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Congested traffic is one of the Valley's drawbacks, Heslop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems near unanimity that traffic delays in the Valley
are getting worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll also asked people to rank their favorite and
least favorite things about life in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned up a contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   The area's mild weather was second on the list of residents'
favorite qualities, with 11 percent ranking it as the thing they
liked best about life in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And third on the list of least favorite qualities, behind the
traffic and the crowding, was the Valley's weather.
</P>
<P>
   The 801 participants in the phone poll were picked at random by
a computer but were all residents of the Greater San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points at the
95 percent confidence level, meaning that 95 percent of the time,
survey results are within 3 percentage points in either direction
of the opinions of the greater population.

SAN FERNANDO VALLEY   LAUNCHES EFFORT TO DISTANCE SELF FROM L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON   SHEPPARD  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Armed with the first-ever comprehensive study of
the Greater San Fernando Valley's economy and population, business
and civic leaders launched an effort Thursday to economically
develop the five-city region independent of downtown Los Angeles'
control.
</P>
<P>
   At a six-hour ``Summit 2000'' conference in Universal City
attended by more than 200 people, several Valley leaders said the
region's economic base was strong, but business and employment
opportunities would grow faster if the business community seized
the initiative to promote the region.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley,
which includes Burbank, Glendale, San Fernando and Calabasas, the
group reviewed a $300,000 two-year study that detailed the economy
and population for the area for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance members plan to use the data to attract and retain
businesses here because they feel downtown officials fail to market
the Valley properly and have failed to provide economic data
specific to the Valley for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to blow our own horn,'' said Bob Scott,
executive vice chairman of the Economic Alliance and a city
planning commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create our own economic updraft here in the
Valley because no one else is doing it. I really think the Valley
has always been an afterthought for the city. If they're not going
to do it, we'll do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was not designed to fuel Valley secession, but leaders
of Valley VOTE, the group that successfully petitioned for a
cityhood study, seized on it and the alliance's plans, saying
business would be healthier if the Valley had greater power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the economic powerhouse that exists in the Valley and
I think it's reasonable to assume that the Valley could operate
very successfully as a separate city,'' said Richard Close,
chairman of pro-secession group Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, which was not involved in organizing the study.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan disputed that the city
had failed to promote the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a very good job of it, and we could always do more,''
said Jessica Copen, Riordan's senior press deputy. ``We continue to
do as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed to help the region bounce back from the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, the Economic Alliance has brought together the region's
business community to work together on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   The group intends to take the ``Summit 2000'' study and use it
to play a key leadership role in retaining existing businesses,
attracting new companies, coordinating with schools and colleges to
ensure workers have needed skills as well as pressuring
governmental agencies to deal with transportation and other key
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The study offered a rosy prognosis all around for the Valley's
current and future economy.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the rest of the country, unemployment is low and home
values are rising, as the population grows steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Jack Kyser of the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. forecast that employment would grow 2.3 percent
this year, following growth of 2.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the Valley does face some major obstacles: a lack of space
for new development; traffic congestion; and a school district that
falls far short of training future employees, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the study, called the Valley Almanac, said if the
entire Greater Valley region was one city, it would be the nation's
fifth largest, ahead of Philadelphia and just behind Houston. With
more than 1.6 million people, it would have a greater population
than 12 states. It would also have more aerospace firms than any
other city and rank third in the number of entertainment firms,
behind Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Another section, called Community Indicators, examined the
health and safety of communities in the Valley. It found that some
of the wealthier sections of the Valley actually had a
disproportionate number of health problems in some categories.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Calabasas, for example, had the highest rate of
deaths by heart disease (270.8 per 100,000) in the Valley and a
suicide rate of 50.8 per 100,000 deaths, almost triple the next
nearest city. While the study didn't explain the reason behind this
finding, some officials argued that people with higher-paying jobs
are subject to greater stress.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Fernando had the lowest rate of infant deaths
(2.6 per 1,000 births), the lowest rate of deaths by heart disease
(170.5 per 100,000) and the lowest number of deaths from suicide (3
per 100,000). But it also had the highest homicide rate, with 17.9
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion survey found growing dissatisfaction with Los
Angeles political institutions. The Los Angeles City Council
received an approval rating of only 33 percent, lower than the
ratings for every city department including police, trash
collection and road repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are around the lowest ratings I've ever seen for a city
council,'' said pollster Alan Heslop of the Rose Institute at
Claremont McKenna College, who has conducted similar polls across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical city council approval rating in California would
be around 45 percent to 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the ratings for the Los Angeles Unified School District
leadership was even lower, at 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, personally, fared better, receiving a 54 percent
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   An author of one section of the study argued that the Valley
should separate from Los Angeles, becoming not one large city, but
a collection of smaller ones the size of Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think creating another urban monster is not the way to go,''
argued Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine University
Institute for Public Policy and a Sherman Oaks resident.
</P>
<P>
   Communities in the Valley, he said, each have their own
identities and business districts; Granada Hills, for example, has
little in common with Pacoima and putting the two together doesn't
make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   Conference attendees said the study was welcome, and long
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Hardman, president of the Northridge Chamber of
Commerce, said his group frequently gets calls from businesses
interested in relocating in the area, but they are only able to
provide outdated information, much of it based on the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't realize it (the Valley economy) was as good as it
is,'' Hardman said. ``We're kind of on a roll.''

<P>
   Here it comes again: the day for exchanging chocolates, roses,
champagne and promises, all wrapped up in pink hearts and ersatz
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Feb. 14, St. Valentine's Day _ already a great day for
gift-card shops, jewelers and department stores _ might this year
be a great day for the stock market too.
</P>
<P>
   Shares are the popular new way of expressing love, according to
a survey of 900 Internet users, one-third of them women. Carried
out by Money Talks, an online investment magazine, the survey
claims that 47 percent of women and 38 percent of men are intending
to buy shares as a gift this year.
</P>
<P>
   Exchanging gifts on St. Valentine's Day is as old as the feast
itself, which was celebrated in the market-square economies of the
Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   But the festivity has more to do with the time of year than with
Saint Valentine, of whom there were at least three, two of whom
were beheaded in the third century. All are venerated on Feb. 14,
but none seems to have had anything to do with love.
</P>
<P>
   St. Valentine's Day is more appropriately associated with the
coupling of birds and the return of spring, thanks mainly to
Chaucer's ``Parliament of Fowls'' (1382), one of the first
Valentine poems in English.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to humans to imitate the birds and choose
themselves a mate on that day was a popular motif in France too.
Rather like Carnival, St. Valentine's Day provided a lusty break
near the abstemious austerity of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's ``Hamlet,'' Ophelia describes the occasion as
one on which a young man was liable to: ``Let in the maid that out
a maid Never departed more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, the overtly sexual connotations were
bowdlerized and the poet Coventry Patmore was able to reduce St.
Valentine's Day to a day of chaste wooing in ``vestal February,''
set against a background of virginal snowdrops.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists link the feast to more lusty end-of-winter
fertility rituals such as the Roman Lupercalia, when men clad in
goatskins went around flagellating all the women in sight in order
to make them fertile.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, the women flagellating back. In ``Valentine's
Day: Women Against Men,'' a collection of short stories edited by
Alice Thomas Ellis and due to be published in Britain on
Valentine's Day, the male ego takes an awesome beating.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eating Vic,'' a short story by the South African writer
Shelley Weiner, a wife sees the gifts of jewelry and clothes that
are showered on her as meager compensation for the ``pound of
flesh'' exacted by a libidinous husband.
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming of the day when she will be a rich widow, she tries,
but fails, to hasten his demise.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvia Petter's ``Widow's Peak,'' a wife wreaks a bizarre
revenge after she discovers that she shares her Valentine's heart
with another: ``At the end of February, the florist's bill arrived.
The flowers for Valentine's had been delightful, but two bunches?''
</P>
<P>
   Women who prefer wooing to being wooed _ and a browse through
this year's Internet Valentine's messages suggests that quite a few
of them do _ can take advantage of the fact that this year is a
leap year and wait for St. Oswald's Day, another medieval feast.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Feb. 29, once every four years women are enjoined
to make the first move. In non-leap years to come, impatient women
might want to join the Roman Catholic Church and celebrate St.
Oswald's Day on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking ahead for a day suitable for celebrating
post-feminist reconciliation between the sexes should look to St.
George's Day, April 23, which also happens to be the birthday of
Shakespeare and the day on which Cervantes died.
</P>
<P>
   St. George is England's patron saint and also Catalonia's, and
Catalans already celebrate the day as one of harmony between the
sexes by exchanging roses and books. Booksellers and florists
outside Catalonia are looking closely at the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Stockbrokers might be well advised to do so too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget geography, forget culture. The thing called ``Europe''
that a dozen or more ex-communist and other countries want to join
_ and with which they engage in formal talks next week _ is about
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's political and economic order is by no means
settled. It is shifting, and more rapidly than would have seemed
likely even five years ago. So pronounced is the recent change in
fact that one may even question how distinctively European this
Europe will seem in, say, another five years.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprising extent, especially when measured against what
politicians say, Western Europe's parties of the left, many of them
now in power, are moving away from their traditional statist
dogmatism towards a pragmatic, if reluctant, recognition of
unavoidable economic facts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the global market for capital is encroaching
on European boardrooms, which have traditionally run their
companies as though shareholders were of little account, valuing
order and stability (of managers' careers, especially) over return
on equity.
</P>
<P>
   If you were alarmed by these developments, you would say that
the tyranny of market forces is driving both changes, and that
Europe's social model _ esteemed by Europe's citizens, if not by
global financiers _ is in rapid retreat and must in the end be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, democracy loses and borderless capitalism wins.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect poses an enormous challenge to Europe's
governments, not least in thinking about what the new European
Idea, if any, should be.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit that for years has animated the European project _
the striving for ``ever-closer union'' _ draws in some quarters on
distaste for and distrust of American might in business, diplomacy
and arms.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot have escaped notice that, in economics and economic
policy, the European model which seems in retreat is giving way to
none other than the American kind, with leftist parties narrowing
the gap between themselves and America's New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And hitherto national markets for corporate control in Europe
are merging not merely into one EU pool but into a truly global
(that is, American-dominated) common market, forgive the
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: what is the point of ``Europe,'' if Europe is
turning out to be just another United States?
</P>
<P>
   In certain obvious ways, of course, that is a fate devoutly to
be wished. A stiff dose of American competition, innovation and
enterprise is not something that only global financiers should want
to see in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's citizens will also see the benefit, in lower
unemployment and a higher standard of living. It is precisely
because Europe's governments, and their voters, are at last coming
to see this connection that moves are afoot to liberalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   If the will of the people called for high double-digit
unemployment and economic backwardness, Europe's democratic
governments could carry on supplying both quite happily, global
market or no.
</P>
<P>
   So it is wrong to say that democracy is losing. People are
voting for lower taxes, less public spending, a lighter hand of
regulation: that is why hitherto leftist governments have made a
start on delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, of course, there are difficult choices to be made.
Labor and capital markets as ruthlessly efficient as America's
offer more wealth but, for many at least, less economic security.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe's leftist parties are correct, voters want to see the
trade-off shifted towards wealth, but maybe not by much. And there
is no reason why the degree of shifting should not vary from
country to country within Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ``European model'' may be bad as description (since the EU's
economies do vary a lot), but as prescription it is positively
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly competition among policy regimes _ in the context of
free movement of labor, goods, services and capital _ could prove
to be Europe's greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Competition makes for better government, just as it makes for
better business. That kind of rivalry, within a union of national
systems sharing a common currency, would indeed stand as something
both promising and distinctively European.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it might require an even bigger adjustment than
the one that is already under way. In Europe's governments,
consensus still tends to be valued above challenge, let alone
competition _ and among its politicians there is no consensus like
Euro-consensus. &QL;

   The desire to speak for Europe, even when there is no merit in
speaking for Europe, is illustrated by the remarkable response to
Joerg Haider's Freedom Party entering the Austrian government, a
row that shows no sign of subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the EU's 14 angry governments are having to ostracize
Austria bilaterally, not through their club, of which Austria is a
member in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Portugal's prime minister, speaking as club president, still
says Haider's party is ``not suitable'' to be in the EU. Belgium's
foreign minister says ``Europe can very well do without Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   His French counterpart says ``we can't have trustful relations
with a government which doesn't completely share the same
objectives of the European Union.'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that such statements are likely to gain Haider
further support.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Austria has broken no EU rules: there is
nothing here about which ``Europe'' should have a view, one way or
the other. &QL;

   So what is Europe? It is a union of democratic states, whose
members must meet agreed-upon standards of political decency as

</P>
<P>
   It is a cooperative venture, in which states accept a measure of
mutual interference in specific areas. And it is a work in

<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget geography, forget culture. The thing called ``Europe''
that a dozen or more ex-communist and other countries want to join
_ and with which they engage in formal talks next week _ is about
politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's political and economic order is by no means
settled. It is shifting, and more rapidly than would have seemed
likely even five years ago. So pronounced is the recent change in
fact that one may even question how distinctively European this
Europe will seem in, say, another five years.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprising extent, especially when measured against what
politicians say, Western Europe's parties of the left, many of them
now in power, are moving away from their traditional statist
dogmatism towards a pragmatic, if reluctant, recognition of
unavoidable economic facts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the global market for capital is encroaching
on European boardrooms, which have traditionally run their
companies as though shareholders were of little account, valuing
order and stability (of managers' careers, especially) over return
on equity.
</P>
<P>
   If you were alarmed by these developments, you would say that
the tyranny of market forces is driving both changes, and that
Europe's social model _ esteemed by Europe's citizens, if not by
global financiers _ is in rapid retreat and must in the end be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, democracy loses and borderless capitalism wins.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect poses an enormous challenge to Europe's
governments, not least in thinking about what the new European
Idea, if any, should be.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit that for years has animated the European project _
the striving for ``ever-closer union'' _ draws in some quarters on
distaste for and distrust of American might in business, diplomacy
and arms.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot have escaped notice that, in economics and economic
policy, the European model which seems in retreat is giving way to
none other than the American kind, with leftist parties narrowing
the gap between themselves and America's New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And hitherto national markets for corporate control in Europe
are merging not merely into one EU pool but into a truly global
(that is, American-dominated) common market, forgive the
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: what is the point of ``Europe,'' if Europe is
turning out to be just another United States?
</P>
<P>
   In certain obvious ways, of course, that is a fate devoutly to
be wished. A stiff dose of American competition, innovation and
enterprise is not something that only global financiers should want
to see in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's citizens will also see the benefit, in lower
unemployment and a higher standard of living. It is precisely
because Europe's governments, and their voters, are at last coming
to see this connection that moves are afoot to liberalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   If the will of the people called for high double-digit
unemployment and economic backwardness, Europe's democratic
governments could carry on supplying both quite happily, global
market or no.
</P>
<P>
   So it is wrong to say that democracy is losing. People are
voting for lower taxes, less public spending, a lighter hand of
regulation: that is why hitherto leftist governments have made a
start on delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, of course, there are difficult choices to be made.
Labor and capital markets as ruthlessly efficient as America's
offer more wealth but, for many at least, less economic security.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe's leftist parties are correct, voters want to see the
trade-off shifted towards wealth, but maybe not by much. And there
is no reason why the degree of shifting should not vary from
country to country within Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ``European model'' may be bad as description (since the EU's
economies do vary a lot), but as prescription it is positively
harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly competition among policy regimes _ in the context of
free movement of labor, goods, services and capital _ could prove
to be Europe's greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Competition makes for better government, just as it makes for
better business. That kind of rivalry, within a union of national
systems sharing a common currency, would indeed stand as something
both promising and distinctively European.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it might require an even bigger adjustment than
the one that is already under way. In Europe's governments,
consensus still tends to be valued above challenge, let alone
competition _ and among its politicians there is no consensus like
Euro-consensus. &QL;

<P>
   Remember the architect of compassionate conservatism? The great
unifier of his party's warring tribes? The political superstar who
was going to drive Al Gore back to the family farm?
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago George W. Bush could do no wrong. Now he can
hardly do anything right.
</P>
<P>
   His 26-point victory in tiny Delaware on Feb. 8 has done little
to obliterate the memory of New Hampshire, or to dispel the growing
smell of disaster that surrounds his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the dying days of the New Hampshire primary, he appeared on
stage with his two best assets, his father and mother, only to hear
the old man coo over ``this boy, this son of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   He burnished his conservative credentials in South Carolina with
a speech at Bob Jones University, only to face questions about why
a man with a Latina sister-in-law could have any dealings with an
institution that bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when it looked as if things could not get any worse,
Dan Quayle came along with his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 19-point defeat in New Hampshire was clearly a problem
for a candidate whose appeal was largely based on a sense of
inevitability. But an even greater problem has been his campaign's
reaction to the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   When he lost the New Hampshire primary in 1984, Walter Mondale
immediately and judiciously acknowledged his weaknesses, vowing to
fight the election state by state, and mocking Gary Hart with the
question ``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Bush campaign's response to New Hampshire has been a
mixture of arrogance and panic.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis meeting in Austin on Feb. 5-6 blamed Bush's failure on
New Hampshire's enthusiasm for giving the front-runner the finger,
and on McCain's success in putting character, rather than issues,
at the heart of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now hellbent on changing the subject back to the issues.
He will emphasize his manifold achievements as a governor, which
include reforming education, welfare, taxation, tort law and
practically everything else in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And he will point out that McCain's pet pieces of legislation,
against tobacco and in favor of campaign-finance reform, have come
to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reformer with results'' is his campaign's new slogan.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a rich kid who spent the Vietnam
War flying around Texas should not want to go toe-to-toe on the
character question with a man who got rather closer to the action.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that people are crying out for more
discussion of earned-income tax credits (or whatever). Prosperity
has dulled the appetite for policy briefings; and Bill Clinton's
personal failings have put character at the center of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much sign that Bush has even chosen the right
issues. So far the electorate seems more impressed with McCain's
fiscal prudence and debt-reduction than with the governor's
trillion-dollar tax cuts. Besides, Bush is not a natural issues
man, in the way Bill Clinton and Al Gore so obviously are. &QL;

   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his great strengths as a candidate is his
hail-fellow-well-met personality, and his only chance of beating
the vice president in November lies in giving the issues the widest
possible berth.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to rebrand the governor as a ``reformer with
results'' at least displays a willingness to change, as does the
decision to launch a series of negative ads about McCain's supposed
hypocrisy and flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush needs to go much further. His failure in New Hampshire
was not just the result of tactical errors that could have been put
right by visiting more Dunkin' Donuts and spending fewer weekends
in Austin (though that would have helped). It is the result of the
fact that McCain's insurgency has rendered his entire strategy
obsolete. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers can almost be forgiven for running his campaign
as a coronation, scripted to the very last detail.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy had served their man well in the governor's race in
1998 (when he was surrounded by the same advisers); and it seemed
to be merited by the cascade of money and endorsements that kept
landing on the dauphin's head.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always a downside to this approach. Keeping a
candidate away from the press only reinforces the suspicion that he
is an airhead. Telling a front-runner that all he has to do is to
stay ``on message'' tempts him to sit on his lead.
</P>
<P>
   And encouraging a challenger to act like an incumbent robs him
of his most powerful weapon, the shock of the new, particularly
when the real incumbent is Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Now the McCain insurgency is making even the merits of this way
of doing things look like defects.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the money to be running in all 50 states.
But when your opponent is putting his campaign together on the
hoof, it makes you look like a multinational corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to have the support of the elders in your party. But
when your opponent is a charming maverick it makes you look like a
boring conformist.
</P>
<P>
   It is great to be able to call on Poppy and Ba for help. But
when your opponent is a 63-year-old war hero, in the genuine sense
of that phrase, it makes you look like a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp is constantly trying to have the best of both
worlds _ claiming that their man is an outsider with one breath and
boasting that he has been endorsed by 38 senators with the other _
and then ending up with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So what can they do? The first thing is to thank God for John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican crown had fallen to Bush without a contest, as
once looked likely, Al Gore would have torn his lungs out in the
autumn; now he can survive only if he learns how to fight. Being
bloodied will be good for him.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing is to start campaigning like a challenger, as
he did in the 1994 governor's race, when he fought a popular
incumbent for every vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the most urgent change goes even deeper. He needs to tear up
the script and throw away the cue cards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is much brighter than his frat-boy act leads one to
suppose. He should mingle with the press. Bush is also a likeable
fellow. He should cut down on the pre-programmed dirges from the
platform and reach out to his audience.
</P>
<P>
   An old badge from the glory days of the 1980s reads ``Let Reagan
be Reagan.'' The Bush campaign's best chance of surviving lies in
letting W. be W. &QL;

   The Bush camp is constantly trying to have the best of both
worlds _ claiming that their man is an outsider with one breath and
boasting that he has been endorsed by 38 senators with the other _

   So what can they do? The first thing is to thank God for John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican crown had fallen to Bush without a contest, as

<P>
   Remember the architect of compassionate conservatism? The great
unifier of his party's warring tribes? The political superstar who
was going to drive Al Gore back to the family farm?
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago George W. Bush could do no wrong. Now he can
hardly do anything right.
</P>
<P>
   His 26-point victory in tiny Delaware on Feb. 8 has done little
to obliterate the memory of New Hampshire, or to dispel the growing
smell of disaster that surrounds his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the dying days of the New Hampshire primary, he appeared on
stage with his two best assets, his father and mother, only to hear
the old man coo over ``this boy, this son of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   He burnished his conservative credentials in South Carolina with
a speech at Bob Jones University, only to face questions about why
a man with a Latina sister-in-law could have any dealings with an
institution that bans interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when it looked as if things could not get any worse,
Dan Quayle came along with his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 19-point defeat in New Hampshire was clearly a problem
for a candidate whose appeal was largely based on a sense of
inevitability. But an even greater problem has been his campaign's
reaction to the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   When he lost the New Hampshire primary in 1984, Walter Mondale
immediately and judiciously acknowledged his weaknesses, vowing to
fight the election state by state, and mocking Gary Hart with the
question ``Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   So far the Bush campaign's response to New Hampshire has been a
mixture of arrogance and panic.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis meeting in Austin on Feb. 5-6 blamed Bush's failure on
New Hampshire's enthusiasm for giving the front-runner the finger,
and on McCain's success in putting character, rather than issues,
at the heart of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is now hellbent on changing the subject back to the issues.
He will emphasize his manifold achievements as a governor, which
include reforming education, welfare, taxation, tort law and
practically everything else in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And he will point out that McCain's pet pieces of legislation,
against tobacco and in favor of campaign-finance reform, have come
to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reformer with results'' is his campaign's new slogan.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that a rich kid who spent the Vietnam
War flying around Texas should not want to go toe-to-toe on the
character question with a man who got rather closer to the action.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that people are crying out for more
discussion of earned-income tax credits (or whatever). Prosperity
has dulled the appetite for policy briefings; and Bill Clinton's
personal failings have put character at the center of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much sign that Bush has even chosen the right
issues. So far the electorate seems more impressed with McCain's
fiscal prudence and debt-reduction than with the governor's
trillion-dollar tax cuts. Besides, Bush is not a natural issues
man, in the way Bill Clinton and Al Gore so obviously are. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his great strengths as a candidate is his
hail-fellow-well-met personality, and his only chance of beating
the vice president in November lies in giving the issues the widest
possible berth.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to rebrand the governor as a ``reformer with
results'' at least displays a willingness to change, as does the
decision to launch a series of negative ads about McCain's supposed
hypocrisy and flakiness.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush needs to go much further. His failure in New Hampshire
was not just the result of tactical errors that could have been put

<P>
   Something remarkable is stirring in American politics. In
California and Massachusetts, state offices are overwhelmed with
Democrats and Independents wanting to change their registration so
that they can vote for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, a Catholic priest, Joseph Gembala, interrupts a
meeting of McCain's supporters, saying, ``I have mass in 20
minutes,'' and asks the Arizona senator to sign a copy of his
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   As he hurries out, Father Gembala says that McCain is the first
Republican he has ever decided to vote for. ``I know a lot of
Democrats who are going to vote for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign headquarters is getting 1,000 e-mails a
day saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   American politics is littered with the remains of outsiders who
surprisingly won the New Hampshire primary in the winter but were
forgotten by the spring. In 1984, Gary Hart, a Democrat from
Colorado, won New Hampshire in February but then discovered that he
could not deny Walter Mondale the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a rank outsider, Pat Buchanan, won the Republican
primary, boasting that the peasants were storming the party with
pitchforks. The pitchforks punctured his own bubble in South
Carolina a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most powerful insurgent of them all, Ronald Reagan,
failed to topple the establishment candidate (Gerald Ford) in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That is the measure of John McCain's task as he sets out on his
famous bus, the Straight Talk Express, to wrest the Republican
nomination from the Republicans' favored son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first week after New Hampshire is a vital test of whether a
campaign can turn from electoral upset to wide appeal. Hart and
Buchanan failed. McCain has not.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign manager, Rick Davis, says, ``Campaigns are won
one day at a time, and we have won the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was the predictable victor in the Delaware primary
this week, McCain won what you might call the expectations contest,
attracting 25 percent of the vote without even setting foot in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who won Delaware in 1996, came third and dropped
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the opinion polls revealed a remarkable surge in
McCain's support. Two days after his New Hampshire victory, he drew
level with Bush in South Carolina, the next state to vote, having
been 20 points behind a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in Michigan, which votes three days after South Carolina,
showed the two in a dead heat. In January, Bush had been 34 points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the two biggest states which go to the polls on March 7,
McCain narrowed yawning gaps: in California, he halved Bush's lead
to 19 points and, in New York, cut it to a mild nine points.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers suggest one advantage that McCain has over
previous insurgents. Buchanan's support had been concentrated among
angry blue-collar workers worried about their jobs. McCain's
reaches out into a variety of different groups. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning an initial display of interest into real votes
requires organization. Here, McCain has an advantage over Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Having won New Hampshire in 1984, the Colorado senator was
flooded with offers of money and help. But, having been a virtual
unknown before the vote, he had no organization.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes with the checks in them piled up unopened at Hart
headquarters. He failed to capitalize on his early win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain too is being inundated with cash. He has raised over $2
million in a week. But this has come over the Internet. The money
can be banked electronically and used immediately. And he knows
what to do with the volunteers. An amazing 26,000 have signed up in
the past week alone. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hart, McCain was a national figure when the campaign
opened. He had raised $15 million by January, and already had the
rudiments of an organization to put those volunteers vigorously to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he will never be Bush's equal in sheer volume of
money and organization. So the essence of his strategy is to bring
new voters _ not necessarily all registered Republicans _ to swing
the primaries his way.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth and Coleridge said that they had to create the taste
by which their poetry was enjoyed. McCain is trying to create the
electorate by which his candidacy will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire showed how powerful this approach can be. Some 40
percent of those who voted were either independents or former
Democrats. McCain won their votes by three-to-one, or 40 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, dismissed these people as
``quirky, maverick, liberal independents.'' His problem is that the
past week has shown how many of them there are, all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By good luck, several of the next primaries, including South
Carolina's and Michigan's, are ``open'': anyone may vote in the
Republican poll. In other big states, including California and
Massachusetts, former Democrats may vote if they switch their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts secretary of state, William Galvin, says he is
swamped by calls from Democrats asking to drop their party
affiliation so that they can vote for McCain in the Republican
primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Independents and those who cross party lines have a lot of
clout. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, explains how.
</P>
<P>
   If independents cast a third of the votes and McCain wins them
by 40 percentage points, as he did in New Hampshire, that gives him
a 12-point margin overall. To overcome that, Bush has to win the
two-thirds who are registered Republicans by more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable task if voters start thinking of the race
as a contest of equals _ as they are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   So the main questions about the primary season are becoming: How
many independent voters are there? And can McCain prevent Bush from
winning big among registered Republicans? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the country as a whole, only about 15 percent of voters are
independents (many states do not keep party registrations, so there
is no sure figure). Their numbers are rising but this would not be
enough to sustain a McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   If you look state by state, though, McCain's chances look
better. In California, says Bernd Schwieren, 21 percent of voters
are independents, up from 12 percent in 1992. Among those
registering for the first time, independents outstrip Republicans
three-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush retains his lead in the state, McCain won himself
many friends when he addressed the annual gathering of the
Republican Party just after the New Hampshire vote.
</P>
<P>
   One party stalwart described the response as the most
enthusiastic since Ronald Reagan addressed the party 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the potential McCain constituency is bigger: almost
a third of those planning to vote in the Republican primary are
independents. This state is home to the so-called ``Reagan
Democrats,'' industrial workers who usually lean towards the
Democratic Party but voted for Reagan because he appealed to their
social and economic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has set about renewing that appeal. At a meeting in
Macomb County in the Detroit suburbs, he talked for the first time
of ``McCain Democrats,'' and claimed that ``the whole essence of
the Republican Party should be to reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable statement from someone contesting a primary
election. This suggests that McCain might _ just might _ be able to
win Michigan and even California. But both races are likely to be
close, and strongly influenced by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opinion polls suggest that no fewer than 37 percent of
voters are independents _ a motley bunch including ex-servicemen
(the state has proportionately more of these than any other state)
and retired Yankees (who outnumber native Southerners on the coast,
says Mark Sanford, the congressman who represents most of that
region).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, a third of voters describe themselves as
religious conservatives, twice as many as in Michigan or
California. This was the only group of Republican voters that
McCain lost in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So South Carolina will be vital in two ways: it will test the
relative strength of independents and religious conservatives, and
it will set the scene for two big states, Michigan and California,
that McCain needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he stood no chance in either place. Now, the fact
that he has even an outside chance is testimony to his
extraordinary powers of attracting support from way beyond the
party's traditional ranks. &QL;

<P>
   Something remarkable is stirring in American politics. In
California and Massachusetts, state offices are overwhelmed with
Democrats and Independents wanting to change their registration so
that they can vote for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, a Catholic priest, Joseph Gembala, interrupts a
meeting of McCain's supporters, saying, ``I have mass in 20
minutes,'' and asks the Arizona senator to sign a copy of his
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   As he hurries out, Father Gembala says that McCain is the first
Republican he has ever decided to vote for. ``I know a lot of
Democrats who are going to vote for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign headquarters is getting 1,000 e-mails a
day saying the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   American politics is littered with the remains of outsiders who
surprisingly won the New Hampshire primary in the winter but were
forgotten by the spring. In 1984, Gary Hart, a Democrat from
Colorado, won New Hampshire in February but then discovered that he
could not deny Walter Mondale the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a rank outsider, Pat Buchanan, won the Republican
primary, boasting that the peasants were storming the party with
pitchforks. The pitchforks punctured his own bubble in South
Carolina a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most powerful insurgent of them all, Ronald Reagan,
failed to topple the establishment candidate (Gerald Ford) in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   That is the measure of John McCain's task as he sets out on his
famous bus, the Straight Talk Express, to wrest the Republican
nomination from the Republicans' favored son, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first week after New Hampshire is a vital test of whether a
campaign can turn from electoral upset to wide appeal. Hart and
Buchanan failed. McCain has not.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign manager, Rick Davis, says, ``Campaigns are won
one day at a time, and we have won the past few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush was the predictable victor in the Delaware primary
this week, McCain won what you might call the expectations contest,
attracting 25 percent of the vote without even setting foot in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who won Delaware in 1996, came third and dropped
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the opinion polls revealed a remarkable surge in
McCain's support. Two days after his New Hampshire victory, he drew
level with Bush in South Carolina, the next state to vote, having
been 20 points behind a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in Michigan, which votes three days after South Carolina,
showed the two in a dead heat. In January, Bush had been 34 points
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the two biggest states which go to the polls on March 7,
McCain narrowed yawning gaps: in California, he halved Bush's lead
to 19 points and, in New York, cut it to a mild nine points.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers suggest one advantage that McCain has over
previous insurgents. Buchanan's support had been concentrated among
angry blue-collar workers worried about their jobs. McCain's
reaches out into a variety of different groups. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning an initial display of interest into real votes
requires organization. Here, McCain has an advantage over Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Having won New Hampshire in 1984, the Colorado senator was
flooded with offers of money and help. But, having been a virtual
unknown before the vote, he had no organization.
</P>
<P>
   The envelopes with the checks in them piled up unopened at Hart
headquarters. He failed to capitalize on his early win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain too is being inundated with cash. He has raised over $2
million in a week. But this has come over the Internet. The money
can be banked electronically and used immediately. And he knows
what to do with the volunteers. An amazing 26,000 have signed up in
the past week alone. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hart, McCain was a national figure when the campaign
opened. He had raised $15 million by January, and already had the
rudiments of an organization to put those volunteers vigorously to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he will never be Bush's equal in sheer volume of
money and organization. So the essence of his strategy is to bring
new voters _ not necessarily all registered Republicans _ to swing
the primaries his way.
</P>
<P>
   Wordsworth and Coleridge said that they had to create the taste
by which their poetry was enjoyed. McCain is trying to create the
electorate by which his candidacy will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire showed how powerful this approach can be. Some 40
percent of those who voted were either independents or former
Democrats. McCain won their votes by three-to-one, or 40 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's campaign manager, dismissed these people as
``quirky, maverick, liberal independents.'' His problem is that the
past week has shown how many of them there are, all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By good luck, several of the next primaries, including South
Carolina's and Michigan's, are ``open'': anyone may vote in the
Republican poll. In other big states, including California and
Massachusetts, former Democrats may vote if they switch their
registration.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts secretary of state, William Galvin, says he is
swamped by calls from Democrats asking to drop their party
affiliation so that they can vote for McCain in the Republican
primary on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Independents and those who cross party lines have a lot of
clout. Bill McInturff, McCain's pollster, explains how.
</P>
<P>
   If independents cast a third of the votes and McCain wins them
by 40 percentage points, as he did in New Hampshire, that gives him
a 12-point margin overall. To overcome that, Bush has to win the
two-thirds who are registered Republicans by more than 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is a formidable task if voters start thinking of the race
as a contest of equals _ as they are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   So the main questions about the primary season are becoming: How
many independent voters are there? And can McCain prevent Bush from
winning big among registered Republicans? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,000, OR CONTINUE TO 1,450) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In the country as a whole, only about 15 percent of voters are
independents (many states do not keep party registrations, so there
is no sure figure). Their numbers are rising but this would not be
enough to sustain a McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   If you look state by state, though, McCain's chances look
better. In California, says Bernd Schwieren, 21 percent of voters
are independents, up from 12 percent in 1992. Among those
registering for the first time, independents outstrip Republicans
three-to-one.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush retains his lead in the state, McCain won himself
many friends when he addressed the annual gathering of the
Republican Party just after the New Hampshire vote.
</P>
<P>
   One party stalwart described the response as the most
enthusiastic since Ronald Reagan addressed the party 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the potential McCain constituency is bigger: almost
a third of those planning to vote in the Republican primary are
independents. This state is home to the so-called ``Reagan
Democrats,'' industrial workers who usually lean towards the
Democratic Party but voted for Reagan because he appealed to their
social and economic conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has set about renewing that appeal. At a meeting in
Macomb County in the Detroit suburbs, he talked for the first time
of ``McCain Democrats,'' and claimed that ``the whole essence of
the Republican Party should be to reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a remarkable statement from someone contesting a primary
election. This suggests that McCain might _ just might _ be able to
win Michigan and even California. But both races are likely to be
close, and strongly influenced by South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the opinion polls suggest that no fewer than 37 percent of
voters are independents _ a motley bunch including ex-servicemen
(the state has proportionately more of these than any other state)
and retired Yankees (who outnumber native Southerners on the coast,
says Mark Sanford, the congressman who represents most of that
region).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, a third of voters describe themselves as
religious conservatives, twice as many as in Michigan or
California. This was the only group of Republican voters that
McCain lost in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So South Carolina will be vital in two ways: it will test the
relative strength of independents and religious conservatives, and
it will set the scene for two big states, Michigan and California,
that McCain needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he stood no chance in either place. Now, the fact
that he has even an outside chance is testimony to his
extraordinary powers of attracting support from way beyond the
party's traditional ranks. &QL;

<P>
   ``One almost believes the Internet was created for Reuters,''
said Peter Job, the company's chief executive, at a briefing for
analysts on Feb. 8 when he announced the company's new
Internet-centered strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet and Reuters have much in common. Both are
electronic networks, operating in real time, whose job is to
transmit information.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they have so much in common that it is easy to imagine
how the Internet could replace Reuters. And that is the danger
Reuters is now moving very quickly to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters spent much of its 149 years as a news agency owned by
newspapers to service newspapers. Twenty years ago, it spotted the
financial markets' growing need for information, and set itself up
as an information exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It now has over half a million users in 60,000 companies who pay
an average of $1,500 a month to get their information from its
proprietary network.
</P>
<P>
   It now owns about half the $6 billion business for financial
information, with growing shares taken by Bloomberg and Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its core business, Reuters still has its news
service, which it sells to newspapers, broadcasters and,
increasingly, to Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   It owns Instinet, one of the small pack of
electronic-communications networks that are challenging the old
trading exchanges; and it has a startlingly successful
``greenhouse'' fund whose main claim to fame is that it invested $1
million in Yahoo! in 1994, when its founders were still at college.
</P>
<P>
   It is the core business, which (including transactional
products) brings in 93 percent of the company's revenues, that is
under threat. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Reuters' most important clients,
such as the big broking houses, are themselves under pressure.
Their margins are falling because of competition from online
brokers, which offer trades at $15 (instead of several hundred
dollars) a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Their business is going the same way through the growth of day
trading. And the merger of banks and brokers is cutting the number
of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Internet is opening new channels for
information. In the past, sellers of real-time financial
information (such as the New York Stock Exchange) had to go through
an intermediary (such as Reuters) to get to the buyers of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies such as CityNet, which has developed a protocol
for sending financial information instantaneously over the
Internet, allow exchanges and others producing financial
information to bypass the intermediary and sell their information
direct to the end-user _ at much lower cost. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reuters has had no coherent answer to this, until now, and
investors have not been happy.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly unfortunate briefing last September, when
analysts wanted to hear a strategy articulated and Job made it
clear that he didn't have one, the share price plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reuters has come up with its answer: to go with the flow. If
the Internet disintermediates wholesalers, then Reuters will move
from being a wholesaler to being a retailer, and use the Internet
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it used to sell its information to hundreds of
thousands, down its dedicated lines. The Internet allows it to sell
to millions. ``There are upwards of 60 million people who can be
considered as targets,'' said Job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reuters will go after these people in three main ways. As well
as its high-end product, it will offer several tiers of service,
with the cheapest product $100 a month or less.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet is launching an online retail service in April. And
Reuters.com will become a financial portal to offer all sorts of
products to retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   The core business, meanwhile, will be reorganized at a cost of
Pounds300 million ($480 million) to deliver its products according
to the protocols used by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A joint venture announced on Feb. 3 with Equant, a telecoms
company, will establish a secure IP-based network. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The markets liked the strategy. Nevertheless, it creates
problems for Reuters, as well as solving them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reuters wants to get into the retail business, it will
go on being a wholesaler, because that is where its revenues come
from. But if Reuters succeeds as a retailer, it is bound to
cannibalize its own revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, as Job said in his presentation, is ``to be the
provider of the information and the capabilities that allow people
to ramp up their activities on the Internet.'' But the more
individuals ``ramp up,'' the worse it is for the brokers and banks
who buy Reuters' high-end products.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, similarly, Reuters has made a good business out
of selling its news services to Web sites _ 900 of them. Its
revenues from this business rose 220 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In America, they have now overtaken its sales to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing this business while building its own portal, where its
news will also be displayed, will be awkward.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, whereas Reuters had a stranglehold on much of the
wholesale business, the retail business is fiercely competitive.
And some of the other companies moving in have advantages that
Reuters does not.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokers moving online can offer a wealth of analysis and
research that Reuters lacks, which is why it has also announced a
partnership with Multex, an equity-research company.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies have powerful promotional vehicles such as the
Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Reuters have that nobody else does? A huge
international network of journalists, collecting both stories and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of the business has been looked down upon by the
financial-product people for 20 years, but the company is beginning
to see that nobody else has such an extensive news-gathering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all the other companies getting into the retail
business, Reuters does everything _ it reports, analyzes, offers
real-time prices and dealing _ and it operates in 23 languages.
</P>
<P>
   What Reuters does not have, and most of its competitors do, is a
strong brand outside the media and financial industries. Reuters
has always been a rather self-effacing organization, in a very
British sort of way. It has served the big names, rather than
trying to become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is run by former journalists, including Job, who is due to
retire in July 2001, and journalists are trained to hate hype. But
if you are running a retail business, that is not a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters needs a salesman behind the counter. &QL;

with the cheapest product $100 a month or less.

Reuters.com will become a financial portal to offer all sorts of

<P>
   The markets liked the strategy. Nevertheless, it creates
problems for Reuters, as well as solving them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reuters wants to get into the retail business, it will
go on being a wholesaler, because that is where its revenues come
from. But if Reuters succeeds as a retailer, it is bound to
cannibalize its own revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, as Job said in his presentation, is ``to be the
provider of the information and the capabilities that allow people
to ramp up their activities on the Internet.'' But the more
individuals ``ramp up,'' the worse it is for the brokers and banks
who buy Reuters' high-end products.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, similarly, Reuters has made a good business out
of selling its news services to Web sites _ 900 of them. Its
revenues from this business rose 220 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In America, they have now overtaken its sales to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Managing this business while building its own portal, where its
news will also be displayed, will be awkward.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, whereas Reuters had a stranglehold on much of the
wholesale business, the retail business is fiercely competitive.
And some of the other companies moving in have advantages that
Reuters does not.
</P>
<P>
   Big brokers moving online can offer a wealth of analysis and
research that Reuters lacks, which is why it has also announced a
partnership with Multex, an equity-research company.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies have powerful promotional vehicles such as the
Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Reuters have that nobody else does? A huge
international network of journalists, collecting both stories and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of the business has been looked down upon by the
financial-product people for 20 years, but the company is beginning
to see that nobody else has such an extensive news-gathering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all the other companies getting into the retail
business, Reuters does everything _ it reports, analyzes, offers
real-time prices and dealing _ and it operates in 23 languages.
</P>
<P>
   What Reuters does not have, and most of its competitors do, is a
strong brand outside the media and financial industries. Reuters
has always been a rather self-effacing organization, in a very
British sort of way. It has served the big names, rather than
trying to become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is run by former journalists, including Job, who is due to
retire in July 2001, and journalists are trained to hate hype. But
if you are running a retail business, that is not a virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters needs a salesman behind the counter. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One almost believes the Internet was created for Reuters,''
said Peter Job, the company's chief executive, at a briefing for
analysts on Feb. 8 when he announced the company's new
Internet-centered strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet and Reuters have much in common. Both are
electronic networks, operating in real time, whose job is to
transmit information.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they have so much in common that it is easy to imagine
how the Internet could replace Reuters. And that is the danger
Reuters is now moving very quickly to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters spent much of its 149 years as a news agency owned by
newspapers to service newspapers. Twenty years ago, it spotted the
financial markets' growing need for information, and set itself up
as an information exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It now has over half a million users in 60,000 companies who pay
an average of $1,500 a month to get their information from its
proprietary network.
</P>
<P>
   It now owns about half the $6 billion business for financial
information, with growing shares taken by Bloomberg and Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its core business, Reuters still has its news
service, which it sells to newspapers, broadcasters and,
increasingly, to Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   It owns Instinet, one of the small pack of
electronic-communications networks that are challenging the old
trading exchanges; and it has a startlingly successful
``greenhouse'' fund whose main claim to fame is that it invested $1
million in Yahoo! in 1994, when its founders were still at college.
</P>
<P>
   It is the core business, which (including transactional
products) brings in 93 percent of the company's revenues, that is
under threat. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Reuters' most important clients,
such as the big broking houses, are themselves under pressure.
Their margins are falling because of competition from online
brokers, which offer trades at $15 (instead of several hundred
dollars) a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Their business is going the same way through the growth of day
trading. And the merger of banks and brokers is cutting the number
of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Internet is opening new channels for
information. In the past, sellers of real-time financial
information (such as the New York Stock Exchange) had to go through
an intermediary (such as Reuters) to get to the buyers of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies such as CityNet, which has developed a protocol
for sending financial information instantaneously over the
Internet, allow exchanges and others producing financial
information to bypass the intermediary and sell their information
direct to the end-user _ at much lower cost. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reuters has had no coherent answer to this, until now, and
investors have not been happy.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly unfortunate briefing last September, when
analysts wanted to hear a strategy articulated and Job made it
clear that he didn't have one, the share price plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reuters has come up with its answer: to go with the flow. If
the Internet disintermediates wholesalers, then Reuters will move
from being a wholesaler to being a retailer, and use the Internet
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it used to sell its information to hundreds of
thousands, down its dedicated lines. The Internet allows it to sell
to millions. ``There are upwards of 60 million people who can be
considered as targets,'' said Job. &QL;

<P>
   GUADALAJARA, MEXICO _ At first glance, the electronics factory
near Guadalajara looks like any other. On the gym-sized shop floor,
robots fit circuit boards with components. Workers put the finished
boards in plastic casings.
</P>
<P>
   But look more closely and you might notice something odd. One of
the lines churns out Web TV set-top boxes, which connect television
with the Net, for Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   The line next to it makes the same device for Sony, Philips's
arch-rival. That is because the plant is run by Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a trend sweeping electronics: factories for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed by consumers, contract manufacturers such as
Flextronics, Solectron, SCI, Celestica, Jabil and hundreds of
smaller contract firms have taken about 11 percent of the market
for electronics hardware, according to Technology Forecasters, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Forecasters expects this figure almost to double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of contract manufacturing is growing by more than 20
percent a year, which is more than twice as quickly as the
electronics industry as whole.
</P>
<P>
   The business is taking off in Europe, too. Ericsson, a Swedish
telecoms-equipment firm, is outsourcing its manufacturing. Fujitsu
Siemens Computers recently sold a German factory to Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturers are rapidly consolidating. Last year saw
more than 100 mergers, up from 50 in 1997. Analysts expect the
business ultimately to be dominated by half-a-dozen firms, each
with revenues of at least $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron, the world's largest, expects to be a $20 billion
company by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers have caught Wall Street's eye. The shares of
contract manufacturers have in recent years outperformed other
high-tech firms _ no mean feat. Analysts predict that they will
extend their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron is now worth over $23 billion, more than darlings of
the media such as Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics firms, like firms in other industries, have always
contracted out some of their manufacturing, mostly to assemblers of
circuit boards, whose role was mainly to supply labor when demand
was tight.
</P>
<P>
   IBM pioneered the idea of outsourcing entire products in the
1980s by getting SCI to build its personal computers. But the
exception of a decade ago is increasingly the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today's contractors are no longer bottom-feeders, but fully
fledged supply-chain managers. They help design products to make
them easy to manufacture. They buy components. Sometimes they even
organize distribution and repair.
</P>
<P>
   These ``electronic-manufacturing services providers'' (EMS), as
they like to be called, are their customers' allies as well as mere
suppliers. The constant threat of losing orders keeps them
improving quality and service. But both parties must also work
together, building prototypes and smoothing the kinks out of the
production process.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, financial and technical integration
between customers and suppliers is growing. Most electronics firms
enjoy complete access to their contractors' books for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard can check on the Web in real time whether its
printers are being made properly, and immediately act if they
aren't. Contractors have direct and up-to-the minute access to
their customers' sales information.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with standardized communications, digital design and
quality norms that firms could split innovation from production.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients at Flextronics's Mexican plant send files with
design changes using a data network. These are then fed into the
production robots.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturing has also grown thanks to improvements on
the shop floor. High-tech gear is no longer put together in a
low-tech way by hordes of young women wielding soldering irons.
They could not possibly pack electronic components densely enough
for today's small mobile-phones or video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work now uses surface-mount technology _ robots that
place components directly on a circuit board, without wiring and
soldering. Because these robots are expensive and complex, their
operation is best left to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts know how to use them efficiently, thanks to high
production volumes and varied experience. Contractors also get huge
volume discounts from components suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, contract manufacturing today is less about cutting
costs than about getting products to market quickly. If necessary,
firms can ramp up production within weeks, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron and Flextronics, for example, each have two dozen
factories around the world. If demand in one market surges, they
can literally fly in an entire production line from somewhere
else. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility helps electronics firms cope with technological
change. Because a market leader can suddenly fall from favor,
contracting out manufacturing is less risky than building new
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors also let their customers concentrate on what matters
in electronics these days: innovation. Will all electronic gear be
made by contractors? Not if they misjudge their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors may already have acquired more firms than they can
digest. They risk becoming unfocused. And even if they do not,
electronics firms have good reason to keep at least some production
in-house for their core products and brands.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, for example, tends to build its own networking gear
until it is no longer a premium product. But there is no reason why
contracting should not become the norm. &QL;

   Tim Sturgeon, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, predicts that the electronics industry will
``vertically disintegrate.'' Traditional firms will focus on R&AMP;D
and marketing; manufacturing will be a service provided by global
suppliers. &QL;

   Probably the best example of such a virtual electronics firm is
Cisco, which makes Internet-routing gear. Although the company is
easily the market leader, it has only three plants, for its
high-end equipment and prototypes. One or other of the big contract
manufacturers makes everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cisco products are never even touched by a Cisco employee.
``Without the Internet none of it would be possible,'' explains
Carl Redfield, who runs Cisco's manufacturing and logistical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's suppliers post quotes and forecasts on Cisco's Web site
to create a form of real-time bidding. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If contract manufacturing does come to dominate electronics, the
industry will look very different. Start-ups will no longer need
factories to compete with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more firms like Handspring, a company based in
Silicon Valley that looks as if it is about to become a force in
handheld computers, despite its lack of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting could also pose problems for European and Japanese
firms, which tend to have a strong manufacturing culture.
</P>
<P>
   To stay competitive, they may need to oursource more of their
production, too. And they may have no choice but to turn to
American suppliers, because the global contractors are all based
there.
</P>
<P>
   Having come up with the modern corporation, Sturgeon argues,
America is now about to give the world the ``turnkey production
network.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, contract manufacturing looks like the next
big strategic fad. It is furthest advanced in electronics, but it
is also growing in other industries such as toys, clothing, and
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, one day, even today's car makers will become virtual
companies. A fantasy? Last August, Ford announced that it will ask
a big supplier to run its new factory in Brazil. &QL;

   GUADALAJARA, MEXICO _ At first glance, the electronics factory
near Guadalajara looks like any other. On the gym-sized shop floor,
robots fit circuit boards with components. Workers put the finished
boards in plastic casings.
</P>
<P>
   But look more closely and you might notice something odd. One of
the lines churns out Web TV set-top boxes, which connect television
with the Net, for Philips, a Dutch consumer-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   The line next to it makes the same device for Sony, Philips's
arch-rival. That is because the plant is run by Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a trend sweeping electronics: factories for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unnoticed by consumers, contract manufacturers such as
Flextronics, Solectron, SCI, Celestica, Jabil and hundreds of
smaller contract firms have taken about 11 percent of the market
for electronics hardware, according to Technology Forecasters, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Forecasters expects this figure almost to double in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of contract manufacturing is growing by more than 20
percent a year, which is more than twice as quickly as the
electronics industry as whole.
</P>
<P>
   The business is taking off in Europe, too. Ericsson, a Swedish
telecoms-equipment firm, is outsourcing its manufacturing. Fujitsu
Siemens Computers recently sold a German factory to Flextronics.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturers are rapidly consolidating. Last year saw
more than 100 mergers, up from 50 in 1997. Analysts expect the
business ultimately to be dominated by half-a-dozen firms, each
with revenues of at least $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron, the world's largest, expects to be a $20 billion
company by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers have caught Wall Street's eye. The shares of
contract manufacturers have in recent years outperformed other
high-tech firms _ no mean feat. Analysts predict that they will
extend their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron is now worth over $23 billion, more than darlings of
the media such as Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics firms, like firms in other industries, have always
contracted out some of their manufacturing, mostly to assemblers of
circuit boards, whose role was mainly to supply labor when demand
was tight.
</P>
<P>
   IBM pioneered the idea of outsourcing entire products in the
1980s by getting SCI to build its personal computers. But the
exception of a decade ago is increasingly the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today's contractors are no longer bottom-feeders, but fully
fledged supply-chain managers. They help design products to make
them easy to manufacture. They buy components. Sometimes they even
organize distribution and repair.
</P>
<P>
   These ``electronic-manufacturing services providers'' (EMS), as
they like to be called, are their customers' allies as well as mere
suppliers. The constant threat of losing orders keeps them
improving quality and service. But both parties must also work
together, building prototypes and smoothing the kinks out of the
production process.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, financial and technical integration
between customers and suppliers is growing. Most electronics firms
enjoy complete access to their contractors' books for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard can check on the Web in real time whether its
printers are being made properly, and immediately act if they
aren't. Contractors have direct and up-to-the minute access to
their customers' sales information.
</P>
<P>
   It was only with standardized communications, digital design and
quality norms that firms could split innovation from production.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients at Flextronics's Mexican plant send files with
design changes using a data network. These are then fed into the
production robots.
</P>
<P>
   Contract manufacturing has also grown thanks to improvements on
the shop floor. High-tech gear is no longer put together in a
low-tech way by hordes of young women wielding soldering irons.
They could not possibly pack electronic components densely enough
for today's small mobile-phones or video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work now uses surface-mount technology _ robots that
place components directly on a circuit board, without wiring and
soldering. Because these robots are expensive and complex, their
operation is best left to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts know how to use them efficiently, thanks to high
production volumes and varied experience. Contractors also get huge
volume discounts from components suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, contract manufacturing today is less about cutting
costs than about getting products to market quickly. If necessary,
firms can ramp up production within weeks, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Solectron and Flextronics, for example, each have two dozen
factories around the world. If demand in one market surges, they
can literally fly in an entire production line from somewhere
else. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility helps electronics firms cope with technological
change. Because a market leader can suddenly fall from favor,
contracting out manufacturing is less risky than building new
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors also let their customers concentrate on what matters
in electronics these days: innovation. Will all electronic gear be
made by contractors? Not if they misjudge their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors may already have acquired more firms than they can
digest. They risk becoming unfocused. And even if they do not,
electronics firms have good reason to keep at least some production
in-house for their core products and brands.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, for example, tends to build its own networking gear
until it is no longer a premium product. But there is no reason why
contracting should not become the norm. &QL;

   Tim Sturgeon, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, predicts that the electronics industry will
``vertically disintegrate.'' Traditional firms will focus on R&AMP;D
and marketing; manufacturing will be a service provided by global
suppliers. &QL;

   Probably the best example of such a virtual electronics firm is
Cisco, which makes Internet-routing gear. Although the company is
easily the market leader, it has only three plants, for its
high-end equipment and prototypes. One or other of the big contract
manufacturers makes everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cisco products are never even touched by a Cisco employee.
``Without the Internet none of it would be possible,'' explains
Carl Redfield, who runs Cisco's manufacturing and logistical
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's suppliers post quotes and forecasts on Cisco's Web site
to create a form of real-time bidding. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If contract manufacturing does come to dominate electronics, the
industry will look very different. Start-ups will no longer need
factories to compete with the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more firms like Handspring, a company based in
Silicon Valley that looks as if it is about to become a force in
handheld computers, despite its lack of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting could also pose problems for European and Japanese
firms, which tend to have a strong manufacturing culture.
</P>
<P>
   To stay competitive, they may need to oursource more of their
production, too. And they may have no choice but to turn to
American suppliers, because the global contractors are all based
there.
</P>
<P>
   Having come up with the modern corporation, Sturgeon argues,
America is now about to give the world the ``turnkey production
network.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, contract manufacturing looks like the next
big strategic fad. It is furthest advanced in electronics, but it
is also growing in other industries such as toys, clothing, and
brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, one day, even today's car makers will become virtual
companies. A fantasy? Last August, Ford announced that it will ask
a big supplier to run its new factory in Brazil. &QL;

   In the darkest hours of the past year, Brazilian President

authority would eventually recover from the disorderly devaluation
of January 1999. &QL;

 &HT;    Web master lends talent to Trump's bid
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ As Jesse Ventura's Web master walked into a
classroom at George Washington University last year to talk
politics, he turned and mischievously asked the professor, ``should
I do the full `Fargo' on them?''
</P>
<P>
   The question, aimed at making fun of his own Midwestern accent,
captures Phil Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen became a hot commodity in the Web world in 1998 when he
became the first to use the Internet as a political tool to
organize supporters and galvanize voters in Minnesota around Jesse
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura won the governorship with a narrow 3 percent of the
vote, but it was enough for Donald Trump to take notice. Trump
recently hired Madsen to be Web master of his possible White House
bid on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And now the whole Web is watching to see if Madsen can whip up a
ground swell of support for Trump as he did for Ventura two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet was tailor-made for Jesse and all his grass roots
appeal,'' said Phil Noble, president of PoliticsOnline, a political
Internet consulting firm based in Charleston, S.C. ``But a great
Internet campaign cannot sustain a candidate without a message. It
remains to be seen whether Trump will be a good candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the savvy world of political consulting, Madsen stands out
for more than his plain speaking ways.
</P>
<P>
   His resume includes stints as an auto mechanic, wilderness camp
guide, soldier, sales manager and church youth director.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Madsen didn't even know how to create a Web page before
he volunteered to create one for Ventura. Instead of hiring someone
to do it, Madsen bought some books and did it himself.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly the approach Madsen used with Trump. Before
Trump's campaign approached Madsen to work for them, the Minnesotan
knew very little about the billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   So Madsen started reading Trump's books on deal-making to see
just what sort of person he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no knowledge of Trump as a political entity prior to
this,'' Madsen said. ``I would not go to work for just anybody, but
Trump's politics do seem to be the politics of the political
center, which is very much what mine are and also Ventura's.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen has built a reputation among other Web masters for doing
the unconventional, for breaking the rules because he hasn't grown
up in politics. He has emerged as a folk hero of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the consummate outsider,'' said Jonah Seiger, co-founder
of mindshare Internet Campaigns, a new media Internet strategy firm
based in Washington, D.C. ``He has this wonderful Minnesota way of
speaking. Very smart, but very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen's strength in the Ventura campaign was figuring out that
a successful campaign is not about how good or flashy the
candidate's Web site is, Seiger said. What matters is ``how well
you use it strategically in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Ventura campaign, Madsen created an e-mail list more
than 3,000 strong called ``JesseNet.''
</P>
<P>
   The network enabled Madsen to mobilize volunteers as needed
throughout the state whenever Ventura would roll into town. In
essence, the Internet became the replacement for the traditional
``advance team'' that prepares a speech location or site before a
politician's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen downplays the importance of Ventura's Web site in
electing the former professional wrestler. He points out that
Ventura's electric personality, the door-to-door volunteers, the
personal calls, the handshakes at the supermarkets, even the booth
at the state fair had as much to do with Ventura winning as his Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ventura Internet effort certainly received some
recognition, but the candidate himself is what catapulted him to
victory,'' Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen got involved in politics in 1992 when Ross Perot ran for
president. After Perot dropped out, Madsen founded the Independence
Party of Minnesota, which is now called the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I did that was because in Minnesota, politics were
very pronounced,'' Madsen said. The Republicans were the party of
the conservative right and the Democrats were the party of the
liberal left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle, there was nothing. There was this big empty
space,'' Madsen said. ``What my passion was and what the turn on
was, was simply government reform. I had no faith that the
Democrats and Republicans who had been in office forever were going
to do anything more than what they had been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And seeking political reform through the Internet is why Madsen
has been so successful, said Michael Cornfield, research director
of the Democracy Online Project and associate research professor at
George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a knack for figuring out how to write prose online that
will get citizens fed up with politics to do things,'' Cornfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of impact will Madsen have?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of what he's able to do will depend on the
political war that is raging within the Reform Party,'' Cornfield
said. ``That will strain his ability to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen is just starting to rock conventional political wisdom,
said John Aristotle Phillips, CEO of Aristotle Co., a political
internet consulting firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to make a splash, it's another thing to have an
impact over a long period of time,'' Phillips said. ``He has just
started to rock the boat. Who knows what he'll come up with for
Trump.''

   &QL;  SHARPSVILLE NATIVE CALLS JOB ``A FRONT ROW SEAT TO HISTORY''
</P>
<P>
   By Sean Gorman
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 -- When Brian L. Stafford was guarding
President Clinton a couple of years ago at the Mirage resort in Las
Vegas, a fellow secret service agent informed him there was a full
grown tiger in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I instructed the advance agent to go back in there and play
with the tiger, and if he didn't bite him, it would be safe for me
to bring the president in,'' Stafford said laughingly. ``He didn't
eat the advance agent, so we brought (Clinton) in.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat was one of the friendly Royal White Tigers used by
illusionists Siegfried and Roy. Since then Stafford, has risen to
be director of the service -- a job he has held for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   He says his work in the service has provided him ``a front row
seat to history.''
</P>
<P>
   And the different chapters of that history unfold in a row of
photos on the wall of the neatly-organized Washington office of the
51-year-old Sharpsville, Penn. native.
</P>
<P>
   In one photo, Stafford looks around cautiously as a smiling
President Ronald Reagan works his way through a crowd. In another
picture, Stafford rides behind President Clinton on horseback. The
horse-riding lessons he got in Sharpsville have served him well in
the service.
</P>
<P>
   While his new position with the Secret Service doesn't have him
in the presidential line of fire anymore, that doesn't mean
Stafford's job is any less important.
</P>
<P>
   As director, he oversees more than 2,400 of the service's agents
whose far flung duties include investigating credit card fraud,
rooting out counterfeit currency, and protecting the lives of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   If anything goes wrong, particularly with the president,
Stafford is the one who must take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous responsibility,'' said Lewis C. Merletti,
who was the service's director before Stafford. ``He is ultimately
responsible for the life of the president of the United States. He
is the one who will answer if something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he guarded the leaders of the free world, Stafford was a
Blue Devil on Sharpsville High School's football team, graduating
in 1965. He received a bachelor's degree in economics and business
in 1969 from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio. He served two
years in the U.S. Army from 1969 to 1971, including a tour of duty
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a small town, he thought he might take over the
family's dry cleaning business. He developed a strong work ethic at
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything from work the cash register to deliveries,''
Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   But his connections in Sharpsville led him elsewhere. Friends of
his parents got him in touch with Roy Kellerman -- the Secret
Service agent who was in the right front seat of the presidential
limo when President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in 1963.
Stafford talked to Kellerman on the phone asking questions about
the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It very much intrigued me,'' Stafford recalled. ``The more I
learned about it, the more I knew that's the vocation that I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford began his Secret Service career in 1971 as a special
agent in Cleveland. He was later assigned to guard Reagan, and he
eventually became the head of Clinton's security detail.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't get to return to his hometown often, but every once
in a while he visits his parents -- Harold and Betty -- who still
live in Sharpsville.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpsville (population 4,793) has just one traffic light, but
no shopping malls or grocery stores. It's the kind of town where
every Halloween members of the local high school football team
patrol the neighborhood to make sure the kids are safe while trick
or treating, said retired Police Chief Willard Thompson, who knows
Brian's father.
</P>
<P>
   And having Brian Stafford at the helm of the Secret Service
evokes some local pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's, number one, great for a Sharpsville person to be
in that kind of position,'' said Walt Karsonovich, one of
Stafford's high school classmates and the principal of Sharpsville
Area Middle School. ``(It) speaks highly not only of his family and
his community, but (also) of his school district that a former Blue
Devil can attain such a high level in the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has also garnered praise from within the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I retired as director I knew this was the man that I
believe should succeed me,'' said Merletti, Stafford's predecessor.
``(Stafford) epitomizes what the Secret Service is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Merletti, who is currently the vice president in charge of
stadium operations and security for the Cleveland Browns, first met
Stafford 25 years ago when they worked together in the Secret
Service on investigations dealing with counterfeit money and
threats against the president.
</P>
<P>
   They also served together on Reagan's presidential detail.
Merletti describes Stafford as a true professional who brings
vision and integrity to the service. Stafford also cares about the
people who work under him, Merletti said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the impression Stafford has left on Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., who chairs the House subcommittee which oversees spending
for the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is considered an agent's agent, so he comes from the
ranks,'' said Kolbe, who adds he is still getting to know the
director. ``The impression I get is that he is looking out for the
men and women who serve under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Stafford's high school classmates said they haven't seen
him in years. But despite not being able to keep up with him at
high school reunions, they would catch a glimpse of him over
Clinton's shoulder on CNN or in a photo on the front page of a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many young people were turned off by authority
figures in the military or the police, those who graduated with
Stafford remember him as nice and clean cut.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Washington office, it appeared that
hasn't changed when Stafford politely fielded a reporter's
questions dressed in a crisp dark blue suit.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford has faced tough times as well. During the investigation
into the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
subpoenaed Secret Service agents to testify before a grand jury
about what they had seen and heard while guarding President
Clinton. Stafford was mentioned in press reports as an agent who
might have to testify, but he didn't receive a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford would like to see some kind of privilege that would
prevent agents from having to retell the private moments they see
or hear while guarding a president or other protectees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can be subpoenaed at will to repeat what we have heard
in the presidential limo or elsewhere, I would think most
(presidents) may not want to give us the proximity that we need''
to protect them, Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when asked for stories about guarding the president, he is
hesitant to talk about them, saying only that ``There's a lot of
interesting things. We obviously have a front row seat to
history.''

<P>
   I know it's wrong. I'm not supposed to get my thrills this way.
Still, the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American
corporate Web sites brings a smile to my face _ and to the faces of
almost everyone I speak to about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we get so much pleasure from what amounts to an
intentional and vicious campaign of cyber-terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's refreshing, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: However much I'd like to, I can't condone
cyber-terrorism. In the long run, we all pay for it. But the mere
fact that our initial response is not fear, but rather perverse
joy, means that on some level we resent the companies that now
dominate our information space.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, a rather simple program has temporarily
paralyzed the most established and profitable Web sites in the
world. The attack program works by asking the target Web site for
more information than it is capable of dispensing. With all its
resources tied up, the Web site is forced to deny service to the
millions of users who want access. The site goes down.
</P>
<P>
   This digital molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker
bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even
different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated
the most popular Web site in the world, the Yahoo search engine,
which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order.
Then, they hit Amazon, CNN, Ebay and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   These are not randomly chosen Web sites. The hackers didn't
attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who were enjoying the Internet back in the '80s and
early '90s remember a time when this technology was about
communication. Businesses weren't even allowed on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the interactive mediaspace felt like a cross
between a college campus and the Wild West. It was a level playing
field, where the size of your computer and the contents of your
wallet meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changed the way people thought about media and
power. The Net didn't feel like a particularly ``safe'' place _ but
since when are revolutions safe?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of business to the Internet changed all that.
Corporate behemoths ignored the indigenous Net population as they
colonized our space.
</P>
<P>
   Companies conducting commerce online needed to make the online
environment more secure _ in reality and in appearance. They're
asking for our credit-card information, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of the Internet changed as users were
converted into consumers. Buy more, talk less. This is not a
playground, they meant to say; this is business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed not only the way people do business; it
has changed the way criminals do business too,'' U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno said in a press conference Wednesday,
contextualizing the attacks in the prevailing American parlance of
commerce. Her cause-and-effect analysis is only slightly off.
Business has changed the way people do technology, and the
technologists are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   This week's attacks prove that the Internet is not as
impenetrable as the opaque interface of the World Wide Web might
suggest. It reminds us that the online universe was developed with
public funds and that corporate America has been getting a free
ride on a civic highway. They are guests, not landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for ways to shore up their defenses, perhaps
these companies should consider why they are under attack.

joy, means that on some level we resent the companies that now
dominate our information space.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, a rather simple program has temporarily
paralyzed the most established and profitable Web sites in the
world. The attack program works by asking the target Web site for
more information than it is capable of dispensing. With all its
resources tied up, the Web site is forced to deny service to the
millions of users who want access. The site goes down.
</P>
<P>
   This digital molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker
bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even
different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated
the most popular Web site in the world, the Yahoo search engine,
which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order.
Then, they hit Amazon, CNN, Ebay and Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   These are not randomly chosen Web sites. The hackers didn't
attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who were enjoying the Internet back in the '80s and
early '90s remember a time when this technology was about
communication. Businesses weren't even allowed on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the interactive mediaspace felt like a cross
between a college campus and the Wild West. It was a level playing
field, where the size of your computer and the contents of your
wallet meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changed the way people thought about media and
power. The Net didn't feel like a particularly ``safe'' place _ but
since when are revolutions safe?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of business to the Internet changed all that.
Corporate behemoths ignored the indigenous Net population as they
colonized our space.
</P>
<P>
   Companies conducting commerce online needed to make the online
environment more secure _ in reality and in appearance. They're
asking for our credit-card information, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of the Internet changed as users were
converted into consumers. Buy more, talk less. This is not a
playground, they meant to say; this is business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed not only the way people do business; it
has changed the way criminals do business too,'' U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno said in a press conference Wednesday,
contextualizing the attacks in the prevailing American parlance of
commerce. Her cause-and-effect analysis is only slightly off.
Business has changed the way people do technology, and the
technologists are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   This week's attacks prove that the Internet is not as
impenetrable as the opaque interface of the World Wide Web might
suggest. It reminds us that the online universe was developed with
public funds and that corporate America has been getting a free
ride on a civic highway. They are guests, not landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for ways to shore up their defenses, perhaps
these companies should consider why they are under attack.

   I know it's wrong. I'm not supposed to get my thrills this way.
Still, the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American
corporate Web sites brings a smile to my face _ and to the faces of
almost everyone I speak to about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we get so much pleasure from what amounts to an
intentional and vicious campaign of cyber-terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's refreshing, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: However much I'd like to, I can't condone
cyber-terrorism. In the long run, we all pay for it. But the mere
fact that our initial response is not fear, but rather perverse
joy, means that on some level we resent the companies that now

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Tues., Jan. 25, I had to travel from New York to Boston,
braving one of the worst ice storms in history. Since the airports
were closed and trains stood motionless, blocked by newly
accumulated white snow mountains on the rails, I had to make the
trip in a van driven by one of my sons.
</P>
<P>
   Javier is a reliable and expert driver. But the truth is he was
as terrified as I. The trip, which usually takes no more than four
hours, took us eight, most of which we spent driving behind very
slow moving trucks that were distributing tons of salt on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure, though, was well worth our effort because outside
of Vernon, Conn., we found one of those stories that reflect, by
themselves, the fragilities of the American empire.
</P>
<P>
   We had already visited several gas stations in search of hot
coffee but come to accept the fact that in that terrible minus-20
degree climate, we could find only frosty beverages. Over and over
we came upon those vending machines full of iced-cold Coca-Cola,
Sprite, Diet Coke and all the other colorful cans of those bubbly
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   It jogged me into recalling the few facts I knew about that
giant global corporate power: It sells about 85,000 million liters
of beverage per day to the people of 160 countries and earns annual
profits in excess of $500 million. There are Coca-Cola vending
machines in the Saudi Arabian deserts, in the treacherous mountains
of Albania and at the foot of the Great Wall of China.
</P>
<P>
   The company's logo, traced with elegant calligraphy, is today
one of the indisputable symbols of the North American realm. John
Stith Pemberton, the legendary inventor of this soft drink, was a
druggist in Atlanta who also sold iced syrups and cough tonics. In
1886, at age 51, Pemberton created a chemical mix that, he thought,
would really quench the thirst of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even though only three people in the world are privy to
the exact formula, its two main ingredients are well known: the
extract of the nut of the cola and the tea obtained from the leaves
of the coca.
</P>
<P>
   Hence its name: Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is rounded off with other vegetable substances, a
little caffeine and sugar. Since the liquid was also medicinal, the
syrup had an infinitesimal amount of cocaine (about one part to 50
million parts). Nevertheless, in 1929 a national debate on
addiction led to the elimination of even the slightest trace of
this substance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with its thousands of bottlers and concessions around the
world, it is still one of the most prosperous corporations on the
planet. During the past year, however, there were several
disturbing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Sales dropped steeply in Germany and Japan _ two of the five
countries in the world with the highest Coca-Cola consumption _ and
in the recent past they almost collapsed in the shaky economies of
Russia and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas N. Daft, the new president, heard the voices of alarm
among his shareholders and decided to do something radical to stop
the downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   And here we must turn back to Friendly's, where it was about 7
p.m. and we were relaxing, trying to straighten the kinks out of
our muscles. Suddenly, we heard a man sobbing _ the sound of
sadness was as disturbing as anything could be.
</P>
<P>
   The man was about 40 years old, dressed in an elegant gray suit,
necktie and starched shirt. He had a stiff leather briefcase, a
scarf and an overcoat: light clothing for weather such as we were
having that night.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden I recognized the man. He was Aurelio Sanchez
Cos, a Galician Spaniard, the son of a fisherman, who had left his
country in 1975 and traveled to Switzerland. Years back I had
shared a flight with him from Madrid to Buenos Aires. And I clearly
remembered that, on that airplane, he was feeling very proud of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   For he had finished his university studies in marketing and was
working at the Coca-Cola Co.'s Iberian division, where he was
earning $3,000 per month, a huge salary. He had set his life's
goal: to be fluent in English and then try to conquer one of the
golden jobs at the company's headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something, man?'' he told me at some point in the
conversation. ``I don't have blood in my veins. I have Coca-Cola,
undiluted and without bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   At Friendly's, I waited until the sobs died down a bit and
approached Sanchez Cos, asking, in Spanish, if I could be of any
help.
</P>
<P>
   It took him a few moments to recognize me, but after a short
pause he did.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that he had arrived in Atlanta in 1994 and ever
since then ``everything had been wonderful.'' He had an American
wife and two sons, and a couple of his fishermen uncles lived in
Maine. Sometimes, he admitted, Atlanta seemed a bit soulless and
alien: a place where you lived in a groove, without friends or
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coca-Cola is there and, well, you know, it has always been
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Jan. 24, Aurelio had been informed that the
company fired him. He was one of 6,000 employees the new CEO
considered redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the courage to tell my wife,'' he said. ``I
packed a few clothes, phoned her and told her my uncle was sick and
wanted to see me in Maine. I then climbed in my Japanese van and
drove through the storm, to nowhere. Do you see how white
everything is outside? That's my life now: a blind desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon in Boston I would see his sorry tale confirmed in the
newspaper. I read that nearly half of the workers at Coke
headquarters in Atlanta were no doubt shedding tears as bitter as
those of Aurelio Sanchez Cos, and that many others were expecting
to receive the same terrible news. What had befallen them was not
poverty, but something worse: a sense of injustice and personal
failure without a chance to recoup.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, during the Nuremberg trials, in Vietnam and
throughout our modern history, that peanut-shaped bottle has been a
symbol of untouchable American happiness. But now, nothing seems
safe.
</P>
<P>
   The American empire seems more prosperous than ever, as
President Bill Clinton told us recently, but here and there you can
see fissures, water and ice needles that fall on the people and
make them cry.

&HT;     `BEACH' OFFERS A SANDY RESPITE FROM WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ever wondered what ``Lord of the Flies'' might have
looked like had it bumped up against prints of ``Apocalypse Now,''
a Thai travel video and ``Jaws,'' relax. Your wondering is over.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is ``The Beach,'' a ridiculous, overwrought but
utterly gorgeous death-in-the-sand adventure yarn that gets the
midwinter award for guilty pleasures. Until those snowbanks melt
away completely, there are more onerous ways to spend two hours
than watching sun-kissed actors cavort in an island paradise.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Leo _ you know, Him, Leonardo DiCaprio, the guy
who (spoiler!) drowned at the end of ``Titanic'' but found new life
in the centerfolds of a thousand Teen Beats. No one's heard much
from Leo lately, except as a subject of crunchy pop songs (``Hey
Leonardo'') and weird gossip about copyrighting his name, but the
long sabbatical seems to have served him well. He finally got those
bangs out of his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Richard, what else do you need to know?'' begins
DiCaprio's laconic narration, adapted from the novel (by Alex
Garland) on which the film is based. Such dry voice-overs slouch,
slacker-like, through the entire movie, and the only thing that
keeps them from being a drag are the candy-coated brilliance of the
visuals. Darius Khondji's lustrous cinematography _ closer in light
and spirit to his work for ``Stealing Beauty'' than the dim, grim
aspect of ``Alien Resurrection'' _ gives the film's biggest
gross-outs a patina of Mickey Mouse absurdity. No matter how
repulsive, they never seem real.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Boyle might seem an odd choice to direct a slick dystopian
beach romp, but he throws himself into it with the same immoderate
glee that made ``Trainspotting'' such a hoot, ``Shallow Grave''
such a terror and ``A Life Less Ordinary'' such an obnoxious
goulash. ``The Beach'' is neither a hoot nor a terrorist's closer
to goulash _ and it lacks the filmmaker's signature electric buzz.
But it's entertaining in the way the best bad films are
entertaining, by giving us lots to look at _ seductive photography,
cool computer graphics (there's even a sequence in which Leo
becomes a video game), plenty of thespian mugging. And sand.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's pretty. Leo is pretty. Leo's castmates are pretty.
Thailand is pretty. The dancing, dappled waters are pretty. Even
the opening scenes in Bangkok, which establish Richard as a glum
American tourist and try very very hard not to be pretty, have the
fairy-tale glint of a snow dome. Less pretty is Robert Carlyle as
Daffy, the teetering basket case who slips Richard a map to a
mythical island beach. Carlyle is the man to hire when you need an
actor to telegraph Total Freakin' Wacko; he's what Gary Oldman used
to be before Oldman disappeared in a puff of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the map, Richard persuades a genial French couple
(Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet), no chopped liver in the
pretty department, to hop along on his quest for the beach. They
agree. Quicker than you can say ``Beach Blanket Bingo,'' the ducky
threesome swim across turquoise waters to a distant idyll, where
they: A) barely avoid smacking into heavily armed marijuana
farmers; and B) hook up with a group of lusty castaways who spend
their days playing volleyball and cricket (you read right) on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is paradise. Richard and his pretty French friends
settle in for the long haul, learning how to spear fish and live in
a cramped hut. But soon enough things start to go kablooey: People
die, others are revealed as cold-hearted louts and one in
particular emerges as a fascist control nut. Richard himself turns
into Martin Sheen, an ``Apocalypse Now'' metamorphosis that
thankfully does not involve any allusion to Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   While shooting on the Thai island of Phi Phi Le, the cast and
crew of ``The Beach'' were accused of ham-handedly thrashing about
the habitat with no thought to flora or fauna. That may be; it's
easy to imagine all that sunblock having a deleterious effect on
the environment. Fortunately, the locals didn't also have to endure
Angelo Badalamenti's woozy-Romantic score, an odd counterpart to a
soundtrack stuffed with electronica (Moby, Faithless, Orbital).
It's just one more layer of incoherence in a film as lovely to look
at as it is confused.

MARTIN LAWRENCE WASTED BY SCRIPT IN `BLUE STREAK' 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `BLUE STREAK'
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lawrence can be frightfully funny, but here he's stuck
with a preposterous plot that prods us to side with a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence is the bad guy. He plays Miles, a sophisticated
high-tech jewel thief in the first scenes, which goes against his
brash, impish, streetwise persona for the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Miles stages and flees a big heist, hides a jewel in an
unfinished building's air vent, and then is caught.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves prison and returns for the gem, he learns the
building has become headquarters for the Los Angeles police.
Wouldn't you know?
</P>
<P>
   No problem. He fakes his way inside as a police detective.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but his unorthodox methods quickly give Miles the
undeserved reputation of a superstar among the real cops, the
world's most gullible law officers.
</P>
<P>
   An earnest newcomer played by Luke Wilson becomes his partner,
and their buddy-movie escapades are both comic and violent _
sometimes too violent.
</P>
<P>
   David Chappelle is a stitch as Miles' big-mouthed partner in
crime, and Lawrence's put-ons provide fun _ just not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the script, not Lawrence, whose fast-talking comic energy
was better showcased in ``Bad Boys'' and ``Life.''
</P>
<P>
   On DVD, ``Blue Streak's'' extras include three music videos
(including ``Girl's Best Friend'' by Jay-Z), talent files, an HBO
special on the film and the featurette ``Blue Streak: Setting Up
for the Score.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 stars.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`ROMANCE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're prudish about sex, steer clear. This frank and
unflinching French film has enough nudity and sex to rank as
pornography in some viewers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, but it is boring, with none of the mush promised by
its title. Instead, director-writer Catherine Breillat features
depressed people with dysfunctional sex lives making futile
connections until one of them turns up bizarrely murderous.
</P>
<P>
   How romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Using a debasing eroticism to enliven a whiny feminist
manifesto, this warmed-over ``Last Tango in Paris'' is a dance you
needn't take.
</P>
<P>
   An alternate R-rated version is available, cutting 14 minutes
from the theatrical cut.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 1 star.

<P>
   Fox is making only 1.5 million copies of this version, costing a
suggested $39.98. (You can find it for about $10 less by shopping
around.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' certainly has enough fans to reserve all 1.5
million copies before the film's April 4 release to stores.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the standard pan-and-scan edition ($24.98) will be

FOR BROTHERS CREEGGANS, IT'S JUST A BROTHER THING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It matters little how old brothers get or who they become as
adults. There are three things male siblings never get tired of:
getting into trouble, blaming each other for the trouble, and
beating on one another like boxing-gym heavy bags.
</P>
<P>
   The Creeggans _ brothers Jim and Andy, along with friend and
drummer Ian McLauchlan _ are musicians by trade, but when the
concert is over and the ride to the next city starts, the tour van
can sometimes double as a martial-arts dojo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying out some new kung fu moves on Andy, and we
completely got into a wrestling match,'' bassist Jim Creeggan says
of a back-of-the-bus skirmish. ``Sometimes we forget that other
people are around.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers Creeggan are thrilled to be reunited because they
also share other passions: music and making music together. A few
years ago they formed a band and gave it the original title of ...
the Brothers Creeggan.
</P>
<P>
   The duo was an offshoot of growing up together musically in an
early-'90s small-potatoes Canadian pop band. The brothers vowed
that, no matter what musical endeavors they took on in the future,
they would continue to find time for the Brothers Creeggan.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, that promise has been put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Creeggan, 30, has stuck with that little band from the Great
White North, but Barenaked Ladies is not small potatoes anymore.
More like monster spud. In the last two years he has toured the
world and become a rock star behind the Ladies' multiplatinum
album, ``Stunt,'' and the happy-rap single ``One Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy, 28, a former Barenaked boy, left the band in 1995, three
years before the fame of ``Stunt,'' to study music composition and
get a degree from McGill University in Montreal. His life couldn't
have been lived farther away from the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It may appear that such a city mouse-country mouse tale would
keep the Creeggan combo from making music together. To the
contrary, when Barenaked Ladies ended months of touring in January
and McGill University broke for the semester, the Creeggans were
ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past, however, when the Brothers Creeggan toiled in
obscurity, the project is now benefiting from the fame of Barenaked
Ladies. Their new release, ``Trunks,'' is the siblings' third album
of jazzy, lo-fi folk dominated by Jim's double bass, Andy's
accordion and shared vocal duties.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' 44-date tour is their longest road work by about
42 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played for a full week around the Great Lakes once,'' Andy
says by phone from the Hotel Phoenix in San Francisco, which,
coincidentally, is the same hotel where he was staying when he quit
Barenaked Ladies. ``Mostly, it's been like a weekend in Toronto and
then a weekend in Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be rational to think that when the brothers finished
their separate touring and academic duties that both could use a
break from the bebop. But they agree that the Brothers Creeggan is
the perfect vacation, be it from the classroom or the green room at
the latest Barenaked Ladies concert venue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither considers the Brothers Creeggan a side project; it's
more like moonlighting from a day job. Since the first two Brothers
Creeggan albums, both released in 1998, Andy has become a musical
scholar while Jim has become a Canadian musical icon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling them apart, Andy's departure from Barenaked
Ladies forced the brothers to work harder to become better
musicians. Their contrasting livelihoods fueled the session for
``Trunks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get together, it's like we're pulling out our
new toys,`` Andy says about how they teach each other. ``We're
always meeting halfway. He's been out there doing, while I've been
discussing music a lot more than playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Functioning as part improvisational master class and part
singer-songwriter sing-alongs, ``Trunks'' is a democratic look at
how the brothers have met in the middle. ``Stuck'' is a spare
guitar ballad hoping for some musical accessories to graduate to
pop song, while ``Lila'' started off like a Barenaked Ladies song
but, according to Andy, was stripped of everything except its bass
loop for the recording.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kitchen Dancin''' is a funky, flat-keyed jam that sounds like
a laid-back rehearsal, while the accordion wheeze intro of ``Survey
the Station'' leads into an Andy-sung ditty that could have been
taken from a Gaelic songbook.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Brothers Creeggan stand independent of the Barenaked
Ladies, Andy and Jim are aware that without ``One Week'' there
would be no multiple weeks on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Ads for some of their shows have capitalized on the larger name
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Creeggans don't seem to mind as long as they continue making
music together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep doing it, but as (Barenaked Ladies) gets
busy it will probably be more spaced out,'' Jim says. ``At this
time I can see us doing this for another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? If the Brothers Creeggan act takes off, maybe
someday they could open for Barenaked Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Jim says. ``I'd be a dead dog after the
show, but a real working musician.''

&HT;     `HURRICANE' CARTER'S MIRACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ The last time I had laid eyes on him, he had been
wearing white satin trunks with a black stripe down the side. The
patina of sweat on his shaven skull had gleamed beneath the lights
of the old Madison Square Garden on Manhattan's Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He had been glowering over a Fu Man Chu mustache and launching
lethal hooks at a skinny white kid from the Bronx named Joey
Archer. Archer couldn't have broken an egg with an ax, but he could
jab. He also had moves like a ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   Archer had taken a clean decision and stepped down from the ring
with an expression of pure delight. Archer was thrilled to have
escaped intact from his confrontation with Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, one of the most terrifying punchers the middleweight
division had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Then Carter had gone to prison on a murder charge concocted by
corrupt cops and crooked prosecutors in New Jersey. He had done
decades in the can, never giving up his hopes of freedom. Finally,
he got sprung by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   He has been out 14 years now, living in Toronto and making a
living as a motivational speaker. He's also a celebrity again,
thanks to a movie about his ordeal _ and to the artistry of Denzel
Washington, a fine actor whose performance could in no way capture
the intense, blood-chilling menace that I saw Hurricane Carter
radiate that night so long ago, when I was a high school kid.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, I found myself watching Hurricane Carter again,
as he addressed an overflow crowd at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. He has hair now, and the white satin trunks have given
way to tailored suits and silk ties. Carter is as trim and athletic
at 63 as he was at 28, but the aura of menace is gone now, replaced
by an energetic message stressing self-reliance, racial harmony,
human compassion and love for his fellow human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle than I'm here before you,'' a broadly grinning
Carter told the crowd ``My standing in front of you, my brother,
that's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, a miracle that couldn't be performed today,
thanks to a bad law that went into effect a decade after Carter was
set free. In 1996, Congress passed _ and President Clinton signed
into law _ a measure that would have kept Carter in the slammer for
the rest of the days, despite his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   It was called the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.
The Republicans who had taken over the House of Representatives two
years earlier were concerned that too many death row inmates were
escaping execution because the federal courts were finding their
convictions constitutionally flawed. Clinton, up for re-election
that year, went along with them.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a serious limitation on the ability of lawyers
representing inmates improperly convicted in state court to obtain
writs of habeas corpus. That's a Latin phrase that translates to,
``You have the body.'' It permits a federal judge to determine if a
state court behaved in accordance with constitutional standards in
permitting the conviction. The new law limits application for such
a writ to one year and requires that defense lawyers prove the
state court not only violated the defendant's rights but did so in
an ``unreasonable'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear precisely how anybody's constitutional rights could
be violated in any ``reasonable'' way, and that's the subject of a
U.S. Supreme Court challenge to this statute. A decision is
expected this term.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Rubin Carter was talking about miracles, as
well he might. The real miracle, though, seems to be that such an
evil, pernicious law could be passed in the first place.

&HT;     CALLING ALL CELL PHONE HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Distributed denial of service. That's the
official government name for what hackers have been doing to
Internet companies. It hardly captures the imagination the way
these acts of vandalism against the new economy do.
</P>
<P>
   It's like calling a bank heist a ``redistribution of wealth by
concealed pointy thing in coat pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been called ``hacking attacks'' and even ``cyber
terrorism,'' which seems a little extreme since the people trying
to stir up the most terror about the attacks seem to be Internet
security experts, consultants and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are all trying to get a piece of the Internet
security action, just the way consultants raced to get rich on Y2K
fears.
</P>
<P>
   CyberGuard of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., claims that big
organizations must secure their computers against use by hackers,
or they'll be liable for crimes just as if they'd left unsecured
guns lying around.
</P>
<P>
   The New York consulting firm Predictive Systems offers ``digital
forensics experts,'' conjuring images of trials of hackers in which
if the bits fit, you can't acquit.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox of the Internet. Even seemingly
anti-capitalistic acts, like shutting down e-brokers and e-auction
houses, lead to the growth of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me for raising another paradox, but if hackers shut down
Amazon.com for a few hours, aren't they causing the company to lose
less money, thus strengthening it?
</P>
<P>
   And one more paradox: If some kind of libertarian liberation
front is launching these attacks as a protest against e-commerce
and the loss of privacy, won't the attacks result in government
intrusion and regulation?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton tends to overreact to high-profile crimes
billed as terrorism, and he was at a complete loss when asked what
Washington could do to stop the Internet attacks.
</P>
<P>
   You could imagine Clinton saying to an aide, ``Where's Al? He
invented the damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch made a clarion
call for hearings. ``In our new, knowledge-based economy, where the
Internet and e-commerce dominate, public confidence in the security
and integrity of the system is paramount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If we have a knowledge-based economy, how come no one
knows how to stop these attacks, not even the ``digital forensics
experts'' who admit they have no sure way to trace the attacks back
to the source?
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest. Let's call this a house-of-cards-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have any confidence in an economy based on companies
that don't produce much besides public offerings of stocks, which
are held briefly by e-lottery players, then traded away for quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a Luddite, but when I hear that some hackers are causing
these e-commerce companies grief, I feel the way Midwestern farmers
did in the Depression when Bonnie and Clyde held up the bank that
was foreclosing on their loan.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com shut down for a few hours? Then walk to the little
neighborhood bookstore that Amazon.com is trying to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's another Internet paradox, this one for us
Luddites: If some hackers actually figured out a way to crash all
e-commerce on the Internet, the economy probably would crash, too.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the value of my house would plummet, because it's
located in the heart of the booming new economy and, like most
Internet stocks, it's worth a lot more than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   I also have to admit, I've done some e-commerce myself, ordering
some kitchen gear and airline tickets with complete satisfaction,
and I hope no addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Romanticizing hackers is even dumber than romanticizing Bonnie
and Clyde, who were at least played by Warren Beatty and Faye
Dunaway. The hackers aren't going to monkey wrench the new economy
any more than Clyde Barrow could end the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   These hackers could be like the alienated 20-somethings in
``Fight Club,'' who, as the Brad Pitt character put it, ``have no
great war, no great depression, no great cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're a cyber-anarchic Byte Club. Or maybe they're scam
artists or, more likely, a bunch of teen-agers in a basement who
were bored with ``Doom II.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever they are, they're just clever vandals who know how to
use a computer to generate huge amounts of information ``packets''
aimed at key ``routers'' to overload companies' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   What I want to know is, why haven't these hackers figured out
how to distribute denial of service to cell phones? Then I'll be on
their side.
</P>

   If Mexico's presidential election were held today, the man who
would win by a landslide is Francisco Labastida, the ruling party's
candidate.

<P>
   Depending on whose polls one believes, Labastida would win by
anywhere from eight to 15 percentage points, or slightly below 45
percent of the vote.

left-of-center contender Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a bit above 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Given Mexico's terribly complicated electoral system, the ruling
PRI _ or Institutional Revolutionary Party _ would also probably
gain a solid victory in the race for mayor of Mexico City, the
second most powerful political job in the country. It would also
gain an absolute majority in the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies
and the State Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, which has won all of Mexico's presidential races since
its founding in 1929, has been challenged to mount a
corruption-free election on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in November Labastida won the first contested primary
ever held in the PRI's history. Of late, some are surprised that
even in a ``free and fair'' contest, the candidate closest to
President Zedillo and the establishment came out the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this equivalent of a landslide are many and
complex. When the PRI is united and essentially happy with its
candidate, the ``aparato,'' or party machinery, steamrolls
everything in its path, placing every available political resource
at his service.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, from the president of the Republic down to the last
precinct captain or schoolteacher, and including state governors,
cabinet ministers and ministry delegates, bishops, military
commanders, businessmen, labor leaders and peasant organizers gets
down to work and does his or her job.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they flood the country with propaganda, raise money by
the truckload, bring out the vote and find the missing votes
wherever they may be _ legally or not, ethically or not,
effectively or not.
</P>
<P>
   This is all done thanks to the symbiotic relationship between
government, state and political party. It is the heart of the
Mexican system and was never limited in scope to mere electoral
fraud, no matter how important that may have been on numerous
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   When the PRI finds itself with a candidate it does not like _ as
in the case of Carlos Salinas in 1988 _ or is divided as has
occurred in a dozen state elections over the past decade, the
machinery can slacken or even turn against the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But if the opposition is weak and divided, and the PRI avoids
fractures and pitfalls such as economic crises, outbreaks of
violence or major corruption scandals, the ``aparato'' will do
whatever it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   If perchance the opposition to the establishment is deeply
divided, as is now the case, and spends as much time and money on
in-fighting as campaigning, any temptation the machinery would feel
to bolt or ``throw'' the election is quickly mitigated by the
certainty of victory.
</P>
<P>
   If one adds to all of this another factor _ i.e., the inertia
behind 70 years of history, custom and habit, whereby Mexican
elites, including those in Washington, the Church, the old
political class and the business community prefer to deal with the
devil they know _ the incumbent party becomes virtually unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Herein, though, lies the key to the only, remote hope of the
opposition's chances of turning the tables and still squeaking out
a narrow win in July, despite the huge odds against it.
</P>
<P>
   There are solid grounds for thinking that if the major
opposition parties can transform the election into a referendum on
the perpetuation of the political system, and into a plebiscite on
PRI rule, that would force voters to cast their ballots not for one
candidate or another, but rather for change or continuity. It would
force people to vote either for the end of 70 years of PRI
domination or for its continuation. And if that focus could be
achieved, then a small possibility exists for the opposition to
win.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases where such a referendum has taken place, under
waning but still persistent authoritarian rule, the NOs have
overcome highly adverse circumstances. The premise for this of
course lies in the belief, to which certainly not all Mexicans
subscribe, that despite Mexico's great advances in the past decade
with its democratization process, the old system remains intact and
can only be defeated through a people's referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that more Mexicans want change, and wish to usher in
an era of alternation in power, than are willing to vote for any
one challenger. Were the opposition to succeed in framing the
election in these larger terms, it conceivably could win.
</P>
<P>
   All the moreso, if the three-way race could be transformed into
a two-man contest, with opposition voters seeking to strengthen the
value of their ballots by shifting toward the stronger Fox and away
from Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is both a highly conservative nation and one that seeks
change earnestly. It is a country that has made great strides in
recent years in building democratic procedures for transferring and
competing for power, as well as one where arguably the world's
oldest authoritarian regime is still standing.
</P>
<P>
   It is, finally, a society sundered by lacerating inequalities
and fractures, the political manifestations of which are rarely
visible. Given these contradictions, movement is infrequent, costly
and painful _ as well as rarely foreseeable. Such is the case
today.

   If Mexico's presidential election were held today, the man who
would win by a landslide is Francisco Labastida, the ruling party's
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whose polls one believes, Labastida would win by
anywhere from eight to 15 percentage points, or slightly below 45
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The runners-up would be the more conservative Vicente Fox,
attracting about 35 percent of the electorate, and third-time,

&HT;     THE LAST ACT FOR `HOMICIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With closure comes consequences. Keep that in mind if you're a
die-hard fan of ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' who felt that,
after seven seasons, there was no real goodbye to any of the
beloved characters who peopled this brilliant series since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   NBC shut down the critically acclaimed, multi-award-winning show
in May, far too late in the season for the writers to bring any
true ending to the series. However, ``Homicide'' always operated
with the knowledge that NBC never knew what to do with the series
and so, predicting its own death, there was a kind of modified
conclusion _ one that summed up mood rather than plot. It wasn't
satisfying, but it was better than the fate dealt many other
beloved series in the cruel world of television.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the urging of new NBC entertainment president Garth
Ancier (who deserves credit for the idea), the network is giving
fans all the closure they can handle with ``Homicide: The Movie''
(9 p.m. Sunday), a two-hour blowout that brings back every cast
member the series ever used (including those who were killed) and
features a special appearance by a young girl who haunted one of
the detectives throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tremendous undertaking that executive producer Tom
Fontana agreed to. And any time you try to put a bow on seven years
worth of storytelling you're bound to disappoint or fail by
reaching for too much; some of the patina of this superb series
would be rubbed off. But ``Homicide: The Movie'' is a wonderful
Valentine to longtime fans who want to know where their favorite
characters have been or where they're going.
</P>
<P>
   This is one film that, despite minor flaws that will only be
apparent to those who religiously followed the series, succeeds
grandly in tying up loose ends without the faintest hint of a
sell-out.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the caveat: This is no feel-good Capraesque wrap-up.
There are moments in this film of profound sadness, of endings that
are unexpected and painful to watch. Credit Fontana with holding
true to the ``Homicide'' idea of television _ that it's gray, not
black or white. This series often set characters on paths that were
not tidy or heroic, ended episodes with little or nothing solved
and had much of the action come from the mouths of its characters,
not their gun belts.
</P>
<P>
   The premise for ``Homicide: The Movie'' is straightforward. Lt.
Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto) is the leading candidate for mayor of
Baltimore, and as the election nears he is shot several times
during one of his last speeches. The shooting unites his past and
present co-workers as they come together to find the gunman. The
montage Fontana creates of how each hears the news is revealing and
moving. Break out your scorecard and roster:
</P>
<P>
   _ Detectives Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Falsone (Jon Seda) find
out at the scene of a drug dealer's death. So too does Giardello's
son, Mike (Giancarlo Esposito), a former FBI agent who quits to
become a Baltimore beat cop just like his estranged dad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Detective Gharty (Peter Gerety) has assumed Giardello's
role in the homicide department. He tells his detectives _ Russert
(Isabella Hofmann), Stivers (Toni Lewis, now with long hair),
Sheppard (Michael Michele) and Ballard (Callie Thorne).
</P>
<P>
   _ Disgraced ex-cop Mike Kellerman (Reed Diamond) hears the news
on the radio while working as a private detective. Detective Munch
(Richard Belzer) gets a cell-phone call in New York (he crossed
over to ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit'' as the same
character). Detective Bayliss (Kyle Secor) _ who left on sabbatical
with a hint of murder in his past _ gets a call when he's out
fly-fishing. Retired cop and current teacher Frank Pembleton (Andre
Braugher) is told during the middle of his lecture on religion (a
theme played out through the entire episode). Detective Howard
(Melissa Leo, who wasn't asked back one year after being a series
regular) pops up in the Fugitives Squad of the Baltimore PD. She's
told during a routine arrest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brodie (Max Perlich), the eccentric police videographer, hears
about the shooting while at a film festival in Washington, D.C. Dr.
Julianna Cox (Michelle Forbes), the coroner, shows up at
Giardello's bedside. And The Big Man himself, Detective Stanley
Bolander (Ned Beatty), sees the shooting on the news, as he's
opening a beer while in his bathrobe, somewhere outside Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most interesting for longtime viewers will be the
reappearance of Detective Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin), who was
killed in the line of duty, and Detective Steve Crosetti (Jon
Polito), who committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look here for an explanation. You'll find it in the movie.
But here's a hint: They don't appear as flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana does use flashbacks to bring the story up-to-date and to
revive several obscure angles of past episodes. And while much of
this movie is about characters searching for something (other than
the gunman), there are comic elements. For example, Jason Priestly
has a cameo as cooler-than-thou new detective in the homicide
department who's in way over his head. His interrogation methods
are pathetic, as witnessed by the two masters, Pembleton and
Bayliss.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mike Giardello goes ballistic on potential witnesses in
his old neighborhood as Kellerman watches the beat-downs while
eating a variety of meals. (As usual, the series uses pop music to
excellent effect during these interludes.) And, if you've got a
mind for trivia, Ed Begley Jr. shows up as a doctor very
reminiscent of the one he played on ``St. Elsewhere,'' which was
frequently written by Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a nod to its current status of being rerun
exclusively on Court TV, there's a scene where a television
reporter (from Court TV) gets pushed in the bushes by Mike
Giardello after asking him how he feels. Later she's seen being
interviewed by other TV journalists. The small moments were always
key to ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the joy of this movie is watching everyone come back,
watching them intermingle, and witnessing years of character
development clash. It's a glorious pay-off to see Munch so happily
reunited with The Big Man, who he thought spurned him. ``Retirement
agrees with you,'' Munch says. ``You've got that pink glow.'' Ever
the grump, The Big Man says, ``It's high blood pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, moments of levity are few in this movie. They just
serve to offset the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard viewers clamoring for closure should remember there is
a finality to it. There are no more ``Homicide'' movies planned _
by the end of this one, you'll know that. These characters are
coming to their own conclusions _ some good, some bad, some joyous,
some sorrowful.

&HT;     WOMEN'S SHELTER SUES PHONE COMPANY FOR LISTING ADDRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A nonprofit organization that protects domestic
violence victims has sued Pacific Bell, saying the telephone
company endangered battered women and children by listing a
shelter's address in its directory.
</P>
<P>
   The address was published after repeated requests to keep it
confidential, lawyers for the shelter said in court papers. The
lawsuit alleges that San Francisco-based Pacific Bell has made the
same mistake at least twice before in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell spokesman John Britton said the phone book with the
error, published in 1998, is out of circulation. He said the
company has not determined who was negligent in printing the
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mistake in that book, (and) we're not exactly sure
how that occurred,'' Britton said. ``Was it our fault? Perhaps. Was
it the fault of someone at the shelter? We don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mistake was made, the shelter has changed its name and
increased security, the lawsuit states. Still, at least three
spouses of battered women have arrived at the shelter since
publication of the directory, including one who tried to break in,
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said Pacific Bell has offered to pay for every
documented expense related to the error, plus increased security at
the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to hope an accommodation can be reached, but the
shelter's legal representatives have attempted to recover damages
that go far beyond any actual expenses covered by the
publication,'' Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   The group that owns the shelter is seeking $1 million in
punitive damages for alleged gross negligence on the part of the
telephone company, and wants a court-ordered policy in place that
will prevent future mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is not named in the lawsuit, which was filed last
week in San Francisco Superior Court. Susan Banker, the lawyer for
the shelter, said her clients have requested that she not comment
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   And the lawsuit states that the situation could have been
avoided, and that policies should have been in place because
similar mistakes have happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1998 publication of (the shelter's) address was not the
first time Pac Bell disclosed the confidential address of a
domestic violence shelter,'' the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit later alleges that Pacific Bell reached settlements
with those shelters, requiring confidentiality to keep other
shelters from ``learning the risk'' of the company's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said he was unaware of any other similar lawsuits
against Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of SBC Communications Inc. of
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard to make sure everything is accurate and
always right in our phone book,'' Britton said.

&HT;     GM CHAIRMAN TOUTS TRAINING PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ The head of the General Motors Corp. told 22
students studying auto mechanics that such trades do not get their
due and praised them for pursuing careers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a grease-monkey business. This is a high-tech
business and the vehicles are getting more complicated each year,''
GM's chairman, Jack Smith, told students at the new Automotive
Technician program at the Capital Region Vo-Tec Center.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of the program will find themselves in high demand for
good-paying jobs, Smith said, especially if they follow up their
vocational training with community college courses.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics with an associate's degree and three to five years of
experience can earn $30,000 to $50,000 in most metropolitan areas,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith said, many segments of American society don't give
the trades proper credit as potential career paths _ whether it's
the auto industry or some other field.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the Automotive Youth Educational Systems (AYES)
curriculum adopted by the Capital Region Vo-Tec, which he visited
Thursday as a way to focus attention on the curriculum. The program
is one of seven in New York state that has been nationally
certified by an auto repair trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by major manufacturers such as GM, DaimlerChrysler,
Toyota and Volkswagen, vocational high school students learn to
work on all kinds of cars in their junior and senior years in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   The classroom Smith visited, for instance, has a five-bay
garage. Smith told the students the classroom was impressive _
looking just like a dealership.
</P>
<P>
   AYES students here get jobs in dealerships after their junior
year. They also earn some college credit good at the Hudson Valley
Community College auto service program.
</P>
<P>
   Smith laid the groundwork for the industrywide program in 1995,
after seeing GM plants in Europe, where established apprenticeship
programs are highly respected and help prepare some students for
jobs in industry.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to replicate some of that in America, to help overcome
a severe shortage of skilled technicians at dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us wouldn't still be in school if it weren't for this
program,'' Dan Grignon, 18, a senior at the vocational school, told
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith promised more good things in their futures: real careers
and cars with even more interesting technology coming down the
line. Later this year, he said, GM will introduce a car with
Internet access that will read motorists their e-mail messages.

DEAD OR ALIVE, `HOMICIDE' ALUMS RETURN FOR MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doesn't matter if you've never sipped a National Bohemian with
John Munch at the Waterfront Bar. Even non-fans of ``Homicide: Life
on the Street'' can appreciate ``Homicide: The Movie.'' As sweeps
stunts go, it's impressive. And when detectives Pembleton and
Bayliss are on the screen, it's better'n Obrycki's crab cakes
washed down with another ice-cold Natty Bo.
</P>
<P>
   Is the movie as good as the series? Not a chance. There's
precious little on TV to match the magnificent intensity of
``HLotS'' when it was hitting on all cylinders. But as these
made-for-ratings ``reunions'' go, it's several furlongs ahead of
anything else, and far superior to most Sunday night movies, which
seem to be extruded from the same machine pumping out all that
ersatz crabmeat the supermarkets sell.
</P>
<P>
   Some of ``Homicide: The Movie'' is filler, just so everyone
who's ever had a major role in the series _ 21 people, count 'em _
can have some screen time. Still, it's great to see old-timers like
Detective Bolander (Ned Beatty), Captain Russert (Isabella Hofmann)
and Dr. Cox (Michelle Forbes), regardless of their peripheral
roles. All of our favorites are here, even dead ones like Beau
Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Steve Crosetti (Jon Polito).
</P>
<P>
   Bringing back the dead may qualify as the height of
February-sweeps gimmickry, but producer Tom Fontana does it with a
classic ``Homicide'' wink that raises an issue fans will be free to
debate from here to infirmity.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's film centers on former Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto),
a candidate for mayor of Baltimore until he's shot while
campaigning. The whole gang returns to either lend support or help
catch Gee's shooter, and the screen fairly crackles when ex-cop
Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher), leaves his college classroom to
team again with Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who's been on a leave of
absence from the department.
</P>
<P>
   As was always the case in the old days, the cerebral scenes
involving Braugher and Secor absolutely sizzle. It's fun, too, to
see Beatty's Bolander sparring again with Richard Belzer's Munch,
who never found a conspiracy theory he couldn't embrace.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent bid to let fans of ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' know
what a quality show looked like, Fontana added ``90210'' alum Jason
Priestley _ a big fan of the series _ to the cast, but to no
substantial effect.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good police story, ``Homicide: The Movie'' drops hints
about the identity of the shooter as well as a stunning revelation
involving Pembleton and Bayliss. With such a crowded cast, the
show's signature subplots, in this case all related to possible
suspects in the shooting, are a little ragged and, in some cases,
superfluous. Yet with its trademark knack for cranking out scripts
that make Baltimore vernacular immensely appealing, ``Homicide: The
Movie'' is a welcome blast from the recent past that die-hard fans
will certainly embrace.
</P>

OSCAR RACE IS WIDE OPEN THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAN ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the nominations for the 72nd annual Academy Awards are
announced Wednesday, at the indecent hour of 5:30 a.m., experts
predict the coveted list will include an unusually wide-open field
of hopefuls and a big surprise or two.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most movie years of the '90s, this past one has contained
no overwhelming favorite _ no ``Dances With Wolves, ``Schindler's
List,'' ``Forrest Gump,'' ``The English Patient'' or ``Titanic'' _
or even, like last year, two competing favorites such as
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, 1999 was a rare year in which the critics groups _ the
major Oscar indicators _ split on their best picture choices: the
New York critics went for ``Topsy-Turvy,'' the Los Angeles critics
liked ``The Insider,'' the National Board of Review picked
``American Beauty'' and the Boston critics chose ``Three Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also, as several pundits have pointed out, the
``millennium factor'': the sense Oscar voters may take this last
race of the Old Era to break tradition and make a statement by
voting a best picture nomination to the kind of film that is
generally considered non-Oscar fare: a computer-animated film such
as ``Toy Story 2,'' an absurdist farce such as ``Bowfinger'' or a
foreign-language sex comedy such as ``All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The year's three big critical favorites _ Mike Leigh's
celebration of the joys of Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan, ``Topsy-Turvy'';
Michael Mann's devastating warning on the perils of a corporate-run
world, ``The Insider,'' and Sam Mendes' zeitgeist-capturing look at
suburban angst, ``American Beauty'' _ all appear to be a sure thing
for one of the five best picture nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But the other two slots could go to any of a dozen candidates,
including the Gulf War adventure-satire ``Three Kings''; the edgy
omnibus drama ``Magnolia''; the neo-film noir ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''; the gutsy adaptation of John Irving's ``The Cider House
Rules''; the irresistible comedy ``Being John Malkovich''; the
popular occult thriller ``The Sixth Sense''; or even Jim Carrey's
acclaimed box office dud, ``Man on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   With this wide a divergence of opinion about what's great, you
can also expect Oscar '99 to be one of those unusual races with
more than one difference between the best picture and best director
lists _ a path Oscar voters traditionally take when there are just
too many worthy choices for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the directors who could be honored _ even if their films
are not _ are England's Anthony Minghella (``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''), Spain's Pedro Almodovar (``All About My Mother''),
American-indie auteur David O. Russell (``Three Kings''),
Oscar-favorite Milos Forman (``Man on the Moon''), old-pro Norman
Jewison (``The Hurricane'') and boy-wonder M. Night Shyamalan
(``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   In the best actor race, the stars of the year's three critical
darlings _ Russell Crowe (``The Insider''), Jim Broadbent
(``Topsy-Turvy'') and ``Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') _ would
each seem to have a lock, with the two other slots likely to go to
Richard Farnsworth (``The Straight Story'') and Denzel Washington
(``The Hurricane'').
</P>
<P>
   But not to be counted out in this crowded field are Terence
Stamp (``The Limey''), Bob Hoskins (``Felicia's Journey''), Jim
Carrey (``Man on the Moon''), Matthew Broderick (``Election''),
Matt Damon (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'') and _ long shots with a
breath of a chance _ either Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin for their
inspired comedy turns in ``Bowfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the male actor category, three sure things dominate the
best actress field: Hilary Swank, who swept most of the pre-Oscar
awards for her gender-bending turn in ``Boys Don't Cry''; Annette
Bening, as Spacey's long-suffering wife in ``American Beauty''; and
Julianne Moore, as two very different kinds of women in ``The End
of the Affair'' and ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Other actresses getting a lot of buzz are England's Janet McTeer
(``Tumbleweeds'') and Kate Winslet (``Holy Smoke''), France's
Cannes multi-winner Elodie Bouchez (``The Dreamlife of Angels''),
perpetual Oscar-nominee Meryl Streep (``Music of the Heart''), and,
less likely, but not inconceivable, Sigourney Weaver (``A Map of
the World'') and Reese Witherspoon (``Election'').
</P>
<P>
   For best supporting actor, the front-runners are Christopher
Plummer (as TV's Mike Wallace in ``The Insider''), Philip Seymour
Hoffman (for both ``Magnolia'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''),
Tom Cruise (``Magnolia''), Michael Caine (``The Cider House
Rules'') and Haley Joel Osment (the tormented kid of ``The Sixth
Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders are Peter Fonda (``The Limey''), Max von Sydow
(``Snow Falling on Cedars''), Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley (both
for ``American Beauty''), Philip Baker Hall (``Magnolia''), Jude
Law (``The Talented Mr. Ripley''), Michael Clarke Duncan (``The
Green Mile''), and John Malkovich for _ expect to hear this joke a
lot _ being John Malkovich in ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   For best supporting actress, the list seems sure to include
Golden Globe winner Angelina Jolie (``Girl, Interrupted''),
Samantha Morton (``Sweet and Lowdown''), Chloe Sevigny (``Boys
Don't Cry''), and either Catherine Keener or Cameron Diaz (both for
``Being John Malkovich'').
</P>
<P>
   Also in running are Natalie Portman (``Anywhere But Here''),
Thora Birch (``American Beauty''), Cherry Jones (``Cradle Will
Rock''), Jean Smart (``Guinevere''), Jean Hamilton (``Holy
Smoke''), and Toni Collette (``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar ceremony will be held Sunday, March 26, with Billy
Crystal as host.

CATHOLICS WANT TO CANONIZE EX-SLAVE/HAIRDRESSER WHO CARED FOR SICK,
ORPHANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When pollster George Gallup and Timothy Jones wrote ``The Saints
Among Us'' about unsung American heroes, they found many
African-Americans, particularly women, who seemed to qualify as
unofficial saints.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one black American, Pierre Toussaint, a Haitian slave who
migrated to New York City with his slave owners in the late 1700s,
is being officially considered for sainthood by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II proclaimed Toussaint ``venerable'' in 1996.
That is only the first step toward sainthood, but it is a major
one.
</P>
<P>
   What amazed me about Toussaint was that when his masters fell on
hard times, he helped the family. Toussaint, still legally a slave,
paid for their upkeep in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint later was freed from slavery and became one of the
country's most popular hairdressers. Some biographers speculate
that one of his famous clients was Martha Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Woodward, Newsweek religion editor and author of
``Making Saints: How the Catholic Church Determines Who Becomes a
Saint, Who Doesn't and Why,'' includes a footnote in his book
identifying Toussaint as having strong support for sainthood by
some American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   A hairdresser saint?
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint has a lot to recommend him. He was a man of honesty,
piety and charity. He attended Mass almost every day. He cared for
the sick during New York epidemics. Toussaint is reported to have
saved a woman trapped in the wreckage of her home after it was
destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   He helped finance the first Catholic orphanage in New York City.
He also donated and raised money to build churches and the original
St. Patrick's Cathedral in the Wall Street area of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his skin color, Toussaint once was barred from the
old St. Patrick's. Although Toussaint took the insult quietly,
others pleaded his cause, and those who barred him were rebuked,
said Norman Darden, one of the biggest proponents of sainthood for
Toussaint.
</P>
<P>
   I first heard of Toussaint from Darden, a rather remarkable
black American himself.
</P>
<P>
   A writer, editor and successful entrepreneur who is writing a
Toussaint biography, Darden has been through many careers. As a
teen-ager, he studied piano at Juilliard at the same time that
concert pianist Van Cliburn was attending that prestigious school.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the 1958 New York ticker-tape parade that honored
Cliburn after he won the Tchaikovsky International Competition in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so proud of Van Cliburn,'' recalled Darden, now 65.
``And people were wondering why he waved and spoke to me during the
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darden's greatest hero is Toussaint. Darden is a director of
the Pierre Toussaint Guild, which is backing Toussaint's cause for
canonization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody is a saint, it is Pierre Toussaint,'' said Darden,
a New York University graduate and former editor of mathematics
textbooks at MacMillan. He has written widely published articles
about often-unrecognized African-American business leaders and
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Darden is a longtime Manhattan resident who grew up in humble
conditions in Washington, D.C. He emulates Toussaint by attending
Mass at least once a day and by using his earnings from a
successful floor-finishing business in a benevolent way.
</P>
<P>
   Darden believes Toussaint's canonization _ which could take
several years _ is important for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he represents the saintliness possible among
businessmen,'' Darden said. ``Most people who are canonized are
priests and nuns. The church needs to recognize other professionals
who exhibit exemplary piety and philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York opened the investigation into
Toussaint's sainthood in 1989. He also had Toussaint's remains
moved from the old St. Patrick's to the Fifth Avenue cathedral
built in the late 1800s. Toussaint was reburied in the crypt, the
only person there who was not a high-ranking clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II celebrated a Mass in the newer cathedral
in 1995, he spoke about Toussaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneath the high altar of this cathedral, together with former
cardinals and archbishops ... there is buried the servant of God,
Pierre Toussaint, a married man, a one-time slave from Haiti,'' the
pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so extraordinary about this man? He radiated a most
serene and joyful faith, nourished daily by the Eucharist and
visits to the Blessed Sacrament.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Toussaint ever becomes canonized is anybody's guess. His
cause likely will be pleaded far into the century. But the saintly
former slave is certainly deserving of the highest honor and
respect.

&HT;     REVERSING THE ASSAULT ON DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CARLOS MUNOZ  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ The University of California announced last
month an increase in minority applicants. The report touted the
numbers as proof positive that campus diversity has not been harmed
by Proposition 209 or the official UC policy barring race or gender
as factors in admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers and the statements which accompanied the report
were incredibly misleading.
</P>
<P>
   An honest look at the real numbers shows that the UC system is
rapidly becoming a bastion for middle-class and upper-class whites
in both the student body and the faculty _ with serious social
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1999, only two African-American students were among the
class of nearly 300 at UCLA School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the fall of 1999, blacks, Latinos and American Indians made
up 13.6 percent of freshman enrollment at Berkeley; in 1997, prior
to Proposition 209 or UC's ``race-blind'' policy going into effect,
that number was 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overall, more than 82 percent of the UC system's tenured
faculty is white. Black and Latino tenured professors make up less
than 8 percent, although nearly 13 percent of doctorates awarded in
1996 _ 3,542 of 27,741 _ went to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers are not a result of a limited pool of qualified
minority applicants. More and more minority students and professors
are asking: Why should I come to a place that does not want me?
</P>
<P>
   The vanishing diversity on campus is a direct consequence of the
attack on affirmative action. But the harm has not ended there.
Minority students aren't the only ones feeling unwelcome and
stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   As a professor in the Ethnic Studies Department at UC-Berkeley,
the results of the anti-affirmative action attacks are palpable to
me. The validity and legitimacy of the ethnic studies discipline
have been undermined by the same kind of thinking, the same
rhetoric, even the same individuals who spearheaded the
anti-affirmative action movement.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UC-Berkeley's Ethnic Studies Department staggered
from a $300,000 budget cut that threatened to eliminate nearly 60
percent of the department's academic offerings.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis was simply another piece of a pattern of insidious
neglect, with no new hiring or replacement of faculty. Student
demonstrations were important in temporarily putting an end to the
attacks on the department. But those attacks created the same
unwelcome environment that has led to the loss of several
professors and made the students who choose to major in ethnic
studies feel as though their academic achievements are not viewed
by the university as legitimate scholarly accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to feel otherwise when members of the Board of
Regents show public contempt for these studies.
</P>
<P>
   UC Regent Ward Connerly wrote in a 1997 letter to President
Clinton: ``It is the academicians who have been using race in an
obscene matter that's now coming to light. It is the academicians
who gave birth to the proliferation of ethnic studies programs
which sometimes amount to segregated curricula.''
</P>
<P>
   What Connerly ignores is that students who enroll in ethnic
studies courses are a diverse group. One of my own courses, Ethnic
Studies 41, has had enrollment ranging from 400 to 700 over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   California's diverse racial and ethnic groups make up 52 percent
of the state's population. Nationwide, the figure is 30 percent. By
the middle of the 21st century, they will make up more than 60 to
70 percent of the population of California and as much as 46
percent of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If we continue to segregate our public educational institutions,
continue to fail to educate the next generations of teachers,
doctors, lawyers and engineers in how to function in an
increasingly diverse society, we risk creating a culture in which
racial misunderstanding and conflict flourish, devouring the
hard-won advances we have made, and undermining the emergence of an
authentic multiracial democracy.

REFUGEES FEAR POWER OF FREEDOM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ When the far-right Freedom Party took the reins of
power in Austria's new coalition government, the people at a
refugee shelter here draped a black flag out one of the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say we are in mourning,'' said Andrea Erasland, who
manages Integrationshaus, a nondescript apartment block that houses
106 refugees, 50 of them children.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, as a little girl lugged a battered plastic
tricycle up the stairs of the unmarked entrance, her mother, a
refugee from Kosovo, seemed startled when a stranger held a door
open and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, thank you,'' the woman repeated in broken English,
unaccustomed to courtesy in a country where anti-immigrant
invective is openly expressed by newspaper columnists, police
officers, and now even those who run the government.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a political platform that blames immigrants for stealing
jobs, committing crimes, and upsetting Austria's relatively stable
society, Freedom Party leader Joerg Haider and his colleagues have
become the country's second-largest vote-getters and nudged their
way into government for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   While the ascension of the Freedom Party has alarmed governments
across Europe, not to mention Israel and the United States, it is
in places like Integrationshaus where the fallout from Haider's
popularity has a human face. The look on those faces _ from Kosovo,
Congo, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Ethiopia _ were already guarded,
and is now openly worried.
</P>
<P>
   Lydie Krob, a counselor at Integrationshaus, said refugees fear
that the rise of the Freedom Party has made them more vulnerable.
At the shelter, they take German courses so they can get a job and
meld into Austrian society. But besides insisting on a ban on
immigration, Haider's party says it wants to classes to have fewer
children for whom German is not a first language, and make
citizenship harder to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know, what does this mean for my future?'' Krob
said. ``Some are afraid that asylum laws will change. These are
people who in many cases have experienced torture, and they are
terrified they might be sent back.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are worried that Haider's popularity, which has grown
despite his frequent attacks on immigrants and his serial apologies
for Nazis, has made it more socially acceptable to voice, or even
act out, anti-immigrant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people who run the government are allowed to say that
asylum seekers are criminals, and that there are too many
foreigners, then more and more ordinary people will be saying the
same thing,'' said Erasland, who is Austrian.
</P>
<P>
   About 750,000 of Austria's 8 million people are foreigners, and
about 300,000 of them entered the country illegally and are seeking
permission to stay, saying they would face persecution if sent
home. In Europe, only Luxembourg and Switzerland have a higher
percentage of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those high numbers, foreigners are not as obvious in
central districts of Vienna, where the vast majority live, as they
are in London, Amsterdam, Paris or Berlin. According to Jerome, an
African refugee, immigrants tend to stick to ethnic enclaves on the
margins of Vienna's magnificent parks and plazas, many reluctant to
venture onto turf that is seen as belonging only to white
Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Austrians are racist. Not everyone, but
most,'' said Jerome, 38, a native of the Congo who with his wife
and three children has been waiting for three years for a
government decision on their request for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Integrationshaus does not allow last names of its residents to
be published. When a woman's name appeared in a local newspaper
last year, she was deluged with racist phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   At a refugee processing center in Traiskirchen, about 30 miles
outside Vienna, Jerome said, black refugees are segregated from the
others in a separate room. One day, when he was handing out
advertising fliers, trying to earn some pocket money for his
family, a belligerent police officer confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austria is not your country. Go back to your country,'' he
said the officer hissed at him.
</P>
<P>
   Krob said many of the refugees she counsels have been harassed
and intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people, especially, have problems. They have trouble on
the underground,'' she says of the subway system. ``The police are
very rough with people; they stop them and demand their identity
cards. Most newspapers demonize foreigners, associating them with
crime even though the statistics do not suggest they cause a
disproportionate amount of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee counselors say the claims that foreigners are stealing
jobs are grossly exaggerated. They say immigrants often take jobs
that most native Austrians won't. Austria's unemployment rate of
4.2 percent _ virtually the same as the US average _ is half the
European Union rate and among the lowest in Europe. Only the
Netherlands and Switzerland are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Krob said it is frustrating to see Haider's popularity rise as
he feeds voters a steady diet of anti-foreigner diatribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a man with simple answers for difficult problems. People
like that. They don't want to hear that problems, like those of
refugees, are not easily solved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolaus Heinelt, who works at Integrationshaus, said his
36-year-old Bosnian girlfriend arrived from Sarajevo five years ago
and has just begun to feel settled. She is a classic immigrant
success story, having become a teacher of deaf students. But the
Freedom Party's rise to power has left her rattled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asks me if she should be afraid, if the government could
refuse to grant her permanent resident status and deport her and
her three children. I don't know what to tell her,'' said Heinelt.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Rahim, a 44-year-old civil engineer from Iran, has been
living at Integrationshaus with his wife and their three children
for three years. He said he does not know if the Freedom Party's
rise to power will affect them, adding that the Social Democrats,
Austria's liberal party that fell out of power, had taken a tough
line on refugees and immigrants, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference between Mr. Haider and Mr. Klima,'' he
said, referring to Social Democrat leader and former chancellor
Viktor Klima.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee counselors say only about 12 percent of those who apply
for political asylum get it. They fear that figure could plummet
under a government that includes the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Like others who provide services to refugees, Erasland worries
that the Integrationshaus budget, half of which comes from the
government, could be cut. Freedom Party members secured six of the
10 Cabinet seats last week, including the one for social services.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. President Thomas Klestil refused to
approve two men proposed as cabinet ministers by Haider. One,
Thomas Prinzhorn, claimed last year that the previous government
gave immigrants free hormone injections ``to increase their
fertility.'' The other, Hilmar Kabas, was behind last year's
Freedom Party campaign posters that warned of
``over-foreignization,'' a phrase popularized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Haider denied that his party will seek to cut
programs for refugees. He also said, as Schuessel has said in other
interviews, that foreigners are subjected to worse abuse and
violence in many other European countries. Haider said Austrians
are simply more forthright in protecting their jobs from immigrants
who would undercut wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a distinction between refugees and immigrants,''
Haider said. ``Refugees we have to protect. But we have to restrict
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Integrationshaus, they take little comfort from that. Five
years ago, when the city and the federal government agreed to set
up Integrationshaus, only the Freedom Party objected.
</P>
<P>
   As Jerome put it in his gentle French, ``It is hard to be a
refugee. It is harder to be one in Austria.''

 S.C. RELIGIOUS RIGHT DIVIDED AS BUSH, McCAIN BATTLE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The radio ad by an antiabortion group opens
with a most unlikely question about one of Senator John McCain's
top advisers: ``Who is Warren Rudman?'' The ad proclaims that
Rudman favors abortion rights, and then suggests that McCain wants
to appoint him as attorney general. So, the ad concludes, ``Don't
vote for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCain Thursday laughed off the ad and said he had no
intention of nominating the former senator from New Hampshire as
attorney general, the subtext of the spot is one of the most
important in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary. By
some estimates, as many as 45 percent of likely voters identify
themselves as religious conservatives, more than three times as
many as in New Hampshire and the most of any early primary state.
</P>
<P>
   For months, George W. Bush's strategy has been to walk to
victory in the arms in those religious conservatives, just as his
father did in 1992 and Bob Dole did in 1996. But the Christian
Coalition operation here, once considered the strongest in the
nation, has become seriously frayed as the national organization
tries to dig itself out of debt. Religious conservatives,
meanwhile, have spread their support throughout the campaigns here,
with Bush by no means assured of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who loses the religious conservative vote will lose
the primary,'' said Ralph Reed, the former executive director of
the Christian Coalition who was hired as a Bush strategist largely
to ensure a victory in South Carolina and several other Bible Belt
states. ``The question has become, `What will the religious
conservatives do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   With Reed's help, the Bush campaign this week began a new effort
to woo religious conservatives, partly by seeking to alarm them
about McCain. In one new Bush television ad, McCain is accused of
proposing to eliminate a tax deduction for charitable
contributions. A companion radio ad paid for by Bush says that
McCain is ``anything but compassionate'' toward churches.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain dismisses the claim as ridiculous _ noting that his
proposal is aimed at closing a tax break for art collectors who
give away over-appraised property _ the religion-based assault is
unlike anything he has faced in his presidential campaign. The Bush
campaign has denied that it has coordinated efforts with the Right
to Life group, and the campaign stands by the attack on how
McCain's tax plan would affect churches.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad paid for by the Right to Life political action
committee, Rudman is quoted as once saying that the Christian
conservative movement would ``discredit any party that is unwise
enough to embrace such a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman, in a telephone interview Thursday, said that abortion is
``one of the one or two issues I disagree with John on out of
hundreds.'' He blasted the group that paid for the ad, saying that
he was standing by his policy of ``not responding to what I
considered to be trash commercials written by a group of
imbeciles.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman, 69, said that the ``last thing I want to do'' is return
to government and that he is continuing to work actively for
McCain, including a three-day South Carolina trip beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain dismissed the ad as ``hilarious. Warren Rudman. A
household name in South Carolina! It's very funny . . . Warren
Rudman is not interested in being attorney general of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Bush camp thought it had wrapped up the
religious conservative vote when Christian Coalition founder Pat
Robertson all but endorsed the Texas governor. Bush, according to
Robertson, was ``worthy of support,'' adding that ``I don't see how
he could lose it.'' As for McCain, Robertson said he was unfit for
the presidency because his campaign finance overhaul proposal would
gut the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But religious conservatives, despite their large numbers here,
``no longer control the machinery of power'' in South Carolina,
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor and longtime
observer of the Christian Coalition. ``Bush needs a big religious
conservative vote to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters for the Texas governor, the
religious conservative vote is likely to be diluted because
independents and Democrats can vote in the Republican primary,
Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   An American Research Group poll released Thursday indicated Bush
had 46 percent, McCain 39 percent and Alan Keyes had 7 percent
support in the state, with 8 percent undecided. The poll of 600
likely voters has an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's support among Republicans dropped and his unfavorable
rating crept up from 4 percent to 15 percent. Likely Republican
voters cited advertising and telephone calls providing negative
information about McCain as reasons for switching from McCain to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush effort has taken on an extra air of urgency because
Steve Forbes, who made a major effort to court religious
conservatives, dropped out of the race Thursday. While Bush is
likely to pick up support from some of the religious conservatives
who backed Forbes, many other Forbes supporters backed the
publisher because they disliked Bush _ and are now likely to back
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush can't even be sure that religious conservatives
will move his way. Lois Eargle, one of the state's most prominent
Christian Coalition members, said in a telephone interview that she
was switching from the Forbes campaign to McCain and dismissed the
notion that McCain was not in tune with religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about McCain being liberal, but the Christian
Coalition rated him at 73 percent'' on his voting record ``and
anything over 50 percent is good,'' said Eargle, the elected
auditor of Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach. The Christian
Coalition does not rate governors, so there is no ranking for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush backers say the Texas governor is most in sync with
religious conservatives, who are among the most likely voters. Bush
made headlines earlier this year when he said the philosopher he
most admired is Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the more ardent conservatives have never been
comfortable with Bush because he _ like McCain _ refuses to say
whether he would have an antiabortion litmus test for judicial
nominations or for a vice president. With Forbes out of the race,
Alan Keyes is the only remaining candidate who would impose such a
litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Keyes is expected to be a factor here, as he was in
Iowa, where he got 14 percent of the vote. Some analysts think
Keyes could capture a similar percentage here, draining significant
support from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   James Guth, a widely recognized expert on religion and politics
who is professor of political science at Greenville's Furman
University, said that the Christian Coalition is far less organized
than it was in the last two primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous reasons for the Christian Coalition's lower
profile in South Carolina this year. The state chairwoman, Roberta
Combs, last year became executive vice president of the national
organization in Virginia. She still retains her title here and has
been in the state recently, but Guth, Eargle and other observers
interviewed this week said the state coalition has not been as
active since she took the national post.
</P>
<P>
   Eargle, who is the Horry County chairman of the Christian
Coalition, said that after Combs left, ``there was nobody to take
up her slack.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, religious conservatives are no monolith, with much
diversity among evangelicals, fundamentalists and members of
various denominations. But the movement has been notable in the
past for its organized, activist core. In 1998, however, the
weakness was evident, when Republican religious conservatives
failed in their effort to defeat US Senator Fritz Hollings, a
Democrat, or to reelect then-Governor David Beasley, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition referred all calls about South Carolina
to Combs, who did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reed, the former coalition executive director and Bush
strategist, said that in the end, religious conservatives will come
home to Bush, just as many did for Bush's father and Dole in the
last two primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Said Reed, ``A lot of premature obituaries have been written
about this constituency.''

ACCUSATIONS FLY AS TV ADS BECOME MORE NEGATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAWN, S.C. _ John McCain released a new TV ad this week in
his bid to become president, spending thousands of dollars to
promote one big idea:
</P>
<P>
   The other guy started it.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush, McCain charged, broke his word by
launching the first negative television ad last month _ and with
that one act betrayed himself to be a truth-shaving politician akin
to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's vehicle for the accusation? A television ad, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A negative ad, says the Bush campaign. And, lest you forget,
McCain started it.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the state of the dialogue in the Republican primary race
these days, as the frenetic and increasingly pugnacious campaigning
leading up to the South Carolina contest spills out onto the
airwaves. But what is striking about the debate is that even as
each man seeks to land a punch, both are working overtime to avoid
being seen as doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Both are, in effect, trying to prove a negative, without going
negative. And both are caught up in a campaign which shares this
much with a barroom brawl: No one agrees who started it.
</P>
<P>
   It is nothing new in politics, of course, but it is new to a GOP
campaign which has been, until recently, a comparatively decorous
affair, in which the two leading Republicans have pitched
themselves as honest opposites to the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
   And even now the point-counterpoint over the new spate of ads
has more of an edge than the ads themselves, which seem, by the
standards of the craft, comparatively tame.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In January, McCain ran an ad in New Hampshire
proclaiming his stance on social security. In the spot, named
``Every Dime,'' McCain declared: ``I won't take every last dime of
the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the
wealthy.'' He said that marked the ``one big difference between me
and the others.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain never mentioned Bush. According to Bush aides, he didn't
have to.
</P>
<P>
   What to untrained ears might have sounded like an innocent
commercial about budget surpluses, was, the Bush campaign said, a
shameless assault on the $483 billion tax proposal Bush was trying
to promote.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Bush campaign released an ad pointing out the
$2 trillion set aside in the Bush plan for Social Security. ``John
McCain's ad about Governor Bush's tax plan isn't true, and McCain
knows it,'' the ad said. It went on to accuse McCain of
manufacturing the accusation to mask the defficiencies in his own
plan. It concluded: ``On taxes, McCain echoes Washington Democrats,
when we need a conservative leader to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was, of course, an insult in the eyes of the McCain camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, in their ads, criticize our ads for being negative, and
they aren't even about them,'' said McCain spokesman Howard
Opinsky. ``They're trying to muddy the waters and to distract from
the real issues of the campaign. Their strategy has been to attack
McCain and make it look like we're attacking them. Their only
response to his victory was to take on McCain in a negative ad, but
I think in the end, voters will decide which candidate is
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, throughout the race, the candidates have bent over
backward to show deference toward one another. Bush repeatedly
calls McCain his ``buddy'' and a ``good friend.'' No one has delved
into the realm of direct insults. No one has used words like
``liar'' or ``dishonest.'' Bush has declined _ despite his daily
insistence that McCain ``says one thing and does another'' _ to
come out and call him a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call these things going on now negative ads,'' said
Senator Alan K. Simpson, director of the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University. ``A negative ad would be a big
old ad that said, `This guy's a racist. This guy's a bigot.' A
negative ad is when, in a mayor's race, someone knocks on your door
and says the candidate was caught with three chicks at a bar the
night before. Just picking away at the record and who had a bigger
tax cut is not a negative ad.''
</P>
<P>
   in the conventional wisdom of Republican strategists, a recent
McCain ad is considered by far the most negative yet in the GOP
race. The ad likens Bush to President Clinton and implyies serious
character flaws. After showing an image of Bush and McCain shaking
hands on an agreement not go negative, the ad cuts to a picture of
the White House, as an announcer asks: ``Do we really want another
politician in the White House we can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a case of McCain being negative?
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a valid point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush was the one on the receiving end of negative
ads,'' said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Which, for those who missed it, is a point Bush also made. In
another ad.

COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE FEES FOR DONATING SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than fly to Fort Lauderdale or Cancun for a spring break
of beaches and beer, thousands of college students next month will
head to Appalachia, the Dakota Badlands, even gray upstate New
York, where they will roll up their sleeves and pick up hammer and
hoe to provide the needy with a week of backbreaking, free labor.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it's not free for them.
</P>
<P>
   With more schools requiring service and more students interested
in performing it, today's volunteers are discovering that not only
do they have to give charitable groups their blood, sweat, and
tears, they also have to fork over a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in the marketplace of charitable acts this spring break
can range as high as $2,395 for students who want to do hard labor
in China (airfare not included). At the other end of cost and
travel, several dozen students at Vanderbilt University will pay
$155 each to stay home and help build housing in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   That students are willing to pay to do work speaks to how much
volunteerism _ whether contagious, required, or attractive on a
resume _ has become part of student life.
</P>
<P>
   While the charities appreciate the help, they say dealing with
the influx of student volunteers has become such a burden that they
have no option but to charge. At the same time, proving that no
good deed goes unmarketed, an entire industry of companies has
grown up around alternative breaks, offering, for a fee, to connect
students with good works in places from small homeless shelters to
vast national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get anything for free,'' said Coleman Hutchison, who
runs alternative spring breaks for Vanderbilt, one of the first
campuses to start the trips. ``But we still have to turn people
away. Alternative spring break has gotten this remarkable
reputation as something that's not only goodhearted and sincere,
but fun, hip, and cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, students spending their off time volunteering
was still just a kind hearted, and rare, gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Then high schools, colleges, even some states began requiring
students to compile a set number of community service hours for
graduation. Maryland and California state university systems, for
example, require between 20 and 40 hours of community service a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges that don't give credit often list volunteer hours on a
student's transcript, to impress employers and graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, according to the annual freshman survey done by
the American Council on Education, 75 percent of students had done
some kind of volunteer work the year before, and about 25 percent
expected to volunteer in college.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and companies offer volunteer vacations during the
summer months and during January break, but spring break has become
the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every campus now offers an ``alternative spring break,''
on some there are competing groups offering them. Demand is high;
some schools had such a hard time finding places with room for more
volunteers last year that they booked a year in advance for this
year's break.
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern University, for example, more than 300 students
will participate in alternative spring break this year, up from
just 15 when it started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Student interest has grown exponentially,'' said Katie
Stearns, a senior in charge of setting up the trips. ``Part of that
is word of mouth, but people are also starting to realize there
might be something more valuable to do over spring break than
sitting on a beach in Cancun with a beer next to you. They tell 12
of their friends and those 12 apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students find their own volunteer opportunities. But
increasingly, there are middlemen willing to do it for them.
</P>
<P>
   For high school students, there is Landmark Volunteers, a
Sheffield-based company that for $675 sends students to work on 50
projects, which range from cleaning up the trails in the
Adirondacks to spraying down the seats at Tanglewood. Those
students who perform well receive a college recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Break Away, a Washington-based company, offers to set up trips
for schools that pay $135 memberships, renewable for $85 a year.
This March, it will send 6,000 students on 500 trips. And each
summer, schools pay $365 to spend a week learning how to set up
volunteer activities for their students.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Conservation Association, based in New Hampshire,
long offered to set up volunteer jobs for students with the
National Parks Service. In the past two years, it has expanded to
offer $200 spring vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools just started contacting us, and the next thing we know
we're trying to place all these schools and keep up with it,'' said
Charmin Handy, the senior program manager. ``The job market is
really good right now, students want to spend their summer earning
money, but they still want to do service.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at schools that don't use intermediaries, students end up
paying a fee. In some cases, it covers travel. But more and more,
charities are demanding ``site fees.'' Habitat for Humanity, for
example, charges $200 per person for students to work in Florida,
$150 to work in Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
   This has raised some eyebrows among students who remember when
service groups were simply happy to have the help. After all, the
students are agreeing to sleep on church floors or in tents and eat
peanut butter sandwiches for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a market out there,'' Stearns said. ``It's
great for the organization, they're assured they're going to have
some fresh energetic volunteers, but it certainly is quite a
turnaround from when I started in 1997...it takes persistence to
find the sites that don't charge a fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Collins, who arranges ``Volunteer Vacations'' at Tufts,
agreed, ``Habitat thinks students appreciate knowing that they have
helped fund the program. That's nice, but the fact is that as
university students, we don't have a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, at Vanderbilt, said a few years ago, students walked
away from a homeless shelter in Los Angeles that wanted a site
donation; they disagreed with the idea on ``philosophical
grounds.'' The Conservation Association, Handy said, has sometimes
adjusted fees to be more ``marketable'' among students.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, though, defend the fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a larger burden put on non-profit agencies to
take on more clients than they're accustomed to,'' said Dan McCabe,
director of Break Away. ``To manage volunteers is more difficult.
Even though there are a lot that can use the help, they don't have
the resources to accommodate the influx.''
</P>

   At Landmark, director Ann Barrett points out that the $675 is
still cheaper than other summer opportunities for high school
students, and goes to paying for chaperones.

<P>
   ``We're offering a quality experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the program's popularity, she says, ``It's the luxury of the
economy that students don't have to work.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also the luxury of the economy that students are willing to
pay to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that it's a couple hundred dollars, I don't
see it as an expense,'' said Alex Belser, a Georgetown student who
will fundraise $300 and pay $200 to work in El Paso with Border
Awareness Experience. ``I'd spend that much in a week simply on
food if I stayed home. I think the traditional college spring break
is being transformed from partying to volunteering. I don't know if
you could compare the relative costs, but I know that partying is
very expensive.''

WHAT TO DO WITH ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first I yawned over John Rocker. Is it really shocking that
baseball, a sport where huge percentages of players go from high
school into the minor leagues, really has uneducated fools, racists
even?
</P>
<P>
   Then again who is the fool, since our society spends inordinate
national television time documenting the projectile spitting of
chewing tobacco in dugouts? Who is the racist when we let Rocker's
fans whoop it up with offensive logos, mascots, and tomahawk chops
associated with his team, the Atlanta Braves?
</P>
<P>
   Over time I have awakened to the Rocker incident, not for what
he said, but for the debate it generated, all the way up to the
lofty op-ed pages of The New York Times. It has the air of that
beer commercial where two broke guys stand at the checkout counter
trying to decide between the six-pack and toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   The guys forlornly and urgently go back and forth. Beer? Toilet
paper? Beer? Toilet paper? They buy the beer. The next question is
``Paper or plastic?'' You know the answer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rocker case it is: Free speech? Suspend him? Free speech?
Fire him? Free speech? Banish him? Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
suspended Rocker for the first month of the upcoming season. This
incited a primal scream of ``Free speech!'' as if Selig was a
mutant offspring of McCarthy and Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   For the ESPN-challenged, Rocker has a longstanding,
trash-talking feud with New York Mets fans. In an interview with
Sports Illustrated, he spit his venom at the city of New York. He
said, ``Imagine having to take the 7 train to the ballpark, looking
like you're riding through Beruit next to some kid with purple hair
next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got
out of jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom
with four kids. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker called a black teammate a ``fat monkey.'' Rocker said it
was a joke. The teammate said it was not. Rocker said Asian women
are bad drivers. He said, ``The biggest thing I don't like about
New York are the foreigners. I'm not a very big fan of foreigners.
You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody
speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and
Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell
did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   How in the world is there any debate about what to do with this
guy? A few weeks ago, I was asked about Rocker during a speech. I
said half seriously that Rocker should do community service among
all the groups he offended. Given the number of groups, that would
be a serious sentence. Just so Rocker understands the difference
between black people and monkeys, I would make him serve a week
cleaning up manure in the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is taking Rocker too seriously. He can say
whatever he wants. The problem I have is the length many sports and
political columnists have gone to make the case that Rocker should
not be punished by Major League Baseball on the basis of free
speech. They say that Rocker's interview was an off-the-field
matter and that he hurt only himself, since he is not a manager or
team official with power over other players.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those arguments are technically defendable. What is
being missed is something quite obvious. Free speech is not the
same as the right to a job. Free speech can still be a poison on
the job, a poison to which a proper antidote can be dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the media would understand this since news
reporters cannot have an active interest in the issues they cover,
nor state their opinions on them. A respectable newspaper rarely
hires a reporter with Rocker's avowed attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that a team or a workplace that harbors known
racists is not a happy or productive place. Perhaps Texaco might
jog the memory. Most people also understand that the more public
the method in which you vent your racism, sexism, and _ let's hope
one day _ homophobia, the more serious the disdain or sanction.
</P>
<P>
   I would say Sports Illustrated, a bible of sports fans,
qualifies as public. If Rocker kept his demons to himself, fine.
Now that he has uncorked his poison, the Braves cannot idly stand
by. After all, is this not bad for business? Name me the last
racially divided team that won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   That should be the Braves' concern. That should be the concern
in our workplaces. I would fire Rocker because the burden of his
presence is now likely to outweigh his talent. He is welcome to
work his way back into baseball after he makes sincere apologies to
every group he offended and cleans up the zoo doo.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, there is no need to be forlorn at the checkout
counter, saying this is merely a free marketplace of ideas. Some
ideas have a cost. Free speech? Fire him? Unfortunately, it is hard
to believe Rocker's team will make the right choice, every time his
teammates take the field they glorify Indian stereotypes. An
enterprise off its rocker will be hard pressed to deal with John
Rocker.

HARVARD'S WOMAN PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't tell you who the next head of Harvard's Nieman
Foundation is going to be. But I can give you a pretty rough
description of what she will look like.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has a major-league Woman Problem, and it would like to
use the highly visible Nieman curatorship _ she will choose the
Nieman fellows in journalism and make grand pronouncements on the
state of the profession _ to help solve it. Ever since Pat Graham
left the School of Education and Radcliffe College was downgraded
to a book club or sewing circle or whatever it's become, there has
been no woman occupying a leadership position at the World's
Greatest University (self-described). None of the schools, e.g.
Business, Divinity, Law, has a female dean. There are two women on
the Harvard Corporation, the seven-member cabal that calls the
shots at WGU. Come this fall, there will be one.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a little embarrassing. At real universities,
women run things. Like Duke, where Nan Keohane is president. Like
Yale in the 1970s, where provost Hanna Gray took care of business
for Kingman Brewster before going off to run the University of
Chicago. (Small world: Gray will be the only woman left on the
Corporation this fall.) Or Stanford, where provost Condoleezza Rice
minded the store until she became George W. Bush's foreign policy
tutor. Wouldn't you like to be a fly in that classroom? ``Remember
George: North Korea is the bad one. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Bit I digress. In 1989, a group of female ex-Nieman fellows
mounted a rear-guard action to champion the candidacy of
ex-Christian Science Monitor editor Kay Fanning for the then-vacant
post, which went instead to Bill Kovach, who is retiring. This
time, Harvard's not leaving anything to chance. The search is being
handled by president Neil Rudenstine's office. One contender,
former Des Moines Register editor Geneva Overholser, (Small world:
She is Nan Keohane's sister) has told Rudenstine she will not be a
candidate. In theory, a new curator will be selected by late April.

</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has decided to litigate the case of Eugene Narrett,
formerly an English professor at Framingham State College. Narrett
and his ACLU-appointed lawyer, Natasha Lisman, claim he was fired
because he published politically incorrect opinions in local
newspapers, primarily the MetroWest (formerly Middlesex) News.
</P>
<P>
   I've scanned a few of Narrett's writings, and I can't say I see
what all the fuss is about. Like many combatants in the endlessly
fatiguing ``culture wars,'' he inveighs against examples of
``diversity literature'' like ``Heather Has Two Mommies.'' He is
pro-spanking (of children, that is), and disses fashionable,
academic ``multiculturalist'' studies, feminism, and other
conservative punching bags.
</P>
<P>
   Narrett says his views were deemed incendiary at FSC: ``I was
hated there, intensely hated and shunned.'' An anti-Narrett leaflet
was circulated on campus, and his legal complaint cites e-mail from
professor Bernard Horn, a member of FSC's hiring and personnel
committee, condemning Narrett's views as ``insensitive, and
illogical at best and, more likely, immoral and vicious.'' In 1997,
he learned that his contract would not be renewed. Curiously, an
attempted grievance through the Massachusetts Teachers Association
went nowhere. According to the complaint, after Narrett refused to
settle his case for ``a tiny fraction'' of his losses and damages,
the union ``abandoned the grievance and dismissed the
arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Narrett was unpopular but is that why he was fired? The ACLU
says yes: Narrett's bosses ``acceded to the pressure of those among
the FSC administration, faculty, and students . . . who found
Narrett's personal beliefs and opinions distasteful and demanded
that Narrett be removed from the FSC community.'' FSC president
Helen Heineman says no: ``We are tolerant of all views,'' she
explains. ``He was not dismissed because of his opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Narrett now makes a living teaching English part time in the
area. ``If I had to do it all over again, I don't know if I'd ever
write a single column,'' he says. To which I can only add: Amen.

`HOMICIDE' CAST REUNITES FOR WOUNDED   GIARDELLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HOMICIDE: THE MOVIE 
Directed by: Jean De Seconzac 
Written by: Tom Fontana, Eric Overmeyer. and James Yoshimura
Starring: Andre Braugher, Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Yaphet Kotto,
Michelle Forbes, Isabella Hoffman, Kyle Secor, and Jon Seda. 
On: NBC, Sunday at 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emmy-winning Andre Braugher, who played detective Frank
Pembleton through the six seasons of the now-defunct ``Homicide:
Life on the Street,'' is reunited with all its major characters in
``Homicide: The Movie,'' airing Sunday night at 9 on NBC. The
presence of the superb Braugher, who endowed the cerebral Pembleton
with a complex humanity and plays a leading role in the two-hour
telemovie, is its greatest treat.
</P>
<P>
   His and several other sparkling performances, as well as a
number of memorably powerful moments, make this a far-above-average
made-for-the-tube movie _ though it's no more than ordinary judged
by the demandingly high standards of the series itself.
``Homicide,'' which stopped production last year after seven
seasons, was the grittiest and most uncompromisingly
three-dimensional crime show on TV and simply one of the best
dramatic series ever.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the reunion of all the detectives who came and
went in the course of the series, the plot of ``Homicide: The
Movie'' is necessarily contrived. Former Lieutenant Al Giardello
(Yaphet Kotto), their beloved ex-boss now running for mayor of
Baltimore, is gunned down campaigning on the waterfront. The attack
galvanizes his old homicide crew _ including last season's Munch
(Richard Belzer) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) and others, as well as
long-departed series favorite Bolander (Ned Beatty), and Pembleton.
A typically brisk montage reveals each at his or her job reacting
to the grim news about Giardello: Pembleton, for example, now a
college teacher, is interrupted in his classroom.
</P>
<P>
   All participate eagerly in the Giardello case, propelled by
grief and anger onto the Baltimore mean streets made familiar by
the edgy cinematography that defined and energized the series. The
nervy camera movement evokes a topsy-turvy realm of risk and high
anxiety. The rough regions of the city look scruffy and
threatening, and the tilty, swivelly perspective underlines the
hair-trigger tension of the detectives on the hunt. The movie lacks
a seamless, polished story line, but its heady atmosphere offers
nice compensation.
</P>
<P>
   So does the estimable Braugher, whose Pembleton is cool and
confident on the surface, more passionate and doubting underneath.
There's a terrific scene about halfway through ``Homicide: The
Movie'' in which he explains to Bolander why, beyond being ill, he
left the department. He hated the growing burden of hearing the
confessions of the guilty _ not merely the crimes that got them
arrested but their other dark and filthy deeds as well. Braugher,
gone a little too fat since his last ``Homicide'' appearances,
conveys an almost priestly moral disgust.
</P>
<P>
   A later hypnotically dramatic confrontation challenges
Pembleton's certitudes about good and evil. In it, his quirky
ex-partner Bayliss (Kyle Secor) makes his own unnerving confession,
tying up a loose plot strand from last season but, more
satisfyingly, throwing a moral curveball at his straight-arrow
brother cop. ``Homicide,'' the movie and the series, may not rise
to the level of Dostoevski, but their treatment of crime and
punishment is more reflective and morally searching than any 10
other crime shows or dramatic network telemovies you can name.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be an old ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' fan
to appreciate the distinctive qualities of this movie _ its
signature but still fresh, rhythmic style, its fascination with the
faces of cops and crooks and the complex depths they reveal and
conceal, and its preference for character over action and
well-written drama over suggestive celluloid sex. This isn't to say
the movie is devoid of nasty violence or serious flaws _ it
contains both. It also has an air of purpose and intelligence that
reminds us of what a great series ``Homicide'' was.
</P>
<P>
   And above all, it has Andre Braugher, an undervalued actor of
subtle skill and huge appeal, at the top of his form.

&HT;     BRADLEY IN UPHILL FIGHT FOR VOTE OF LABOR, MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GREGORY LEWIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
appeals to the wealthiest, most-educated members of his party. The
problem for his campaign in California and elsewhere: There just
aren't enough of those Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's challenge is to break the grip that Vice President Al
Gore has on the party's dominant groups - labor, minorities,
working-class families. The former senator from New Jersey will
have no better chance to start than Saturday when he speaks in San
Jose before the Democrats' most active members at the state party
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an uphill battle,'' said University of Southern
California political scientist Ann Crigler. ``Part of his problem
with reaching the rank-and-file Democrats is his message is
somewhat to the left and the rank-and-file are in the middle.
They're happy with the economy. So why switch?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has placed enormous importance on the 15 primaries and
caucuses scheduled for March 7 _ including those in California, New
York and Ohio _ in his quest to be a viable alternative to Gore. He
had a strong showing in New Hampshire. Gore's 50 percent to 46
percent win was the closest Democratic primary in the Granite
State's history. But Bradley didn't get the bounce that Sen. John
McCain received on the Republican side from beating Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the power of incumbency, national labor's blessing and,
in California, the backing of politicians including Gov. Gray
Davis, state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres and San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown, who will put their machinery to work to make
sure Gore captures the bulk of California's 367 delegates in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of
the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, praised Gore's record on
key issues of interest to union members, such as Social Security,
Medicare prescription drug benefits and the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cornu, communications director of the California Labor
Federation, said her organization started operating phone banks the
second week of January. Union members also have walked precincts
and will mobilize a get-out-the-vote effort.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed union members were nearly a third of
Californians who cast ballots in 1998 elections, although union
members are about 17 percent of the state's work force, Cornu said.
</P>
<P>
   Union members are a key part of the traditional Democratic bloc
that Bradley needs but, thus far, has failed to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to communicate better to the Democratic base,'' Bradley
said on ``Meet the Press'' last Sunday. ``If you take a look at
what I'm proposing, if you take a look at access to quality
affordable health care _ I mean, African Americans, 30 percent,
don't have health insurance; Latino Americans, about 24 percent,
don't have health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls from the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses
revealed that Bradley's support came from wealthier and better
educated members of the party.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom said he endorsed Bradley
in part because of the former senator's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``His health care plan is more comprehensive than Gore's and
more aggressive,'' Newsom said. ``That should resonate with those
at low and moderate income levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   California polls show Bradley with far less support than Gore
from every major Democratic sub-group in the state. Gore is
especially strong among Latino and African-American voters, those
under age 40 and union households.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began targeting minorities this week with speeches
backing affirmative action programs and slamming South Carolina for
flying the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's focus on race relations isn't part of any campaign
ploy, said Jacques DeGraff, his deputy campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race issue is who he is,'' said DeGraff. ``He will
continue to raise it. People don't want to talk about race anymore.
But Bill Bradley believes that we'll never achieve greatness as a
country if we don't confront the race issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Bradley to win a majority of California delegates March
7, he'll also have to emphasize his plans on gun control, education
and health care in order to appeal to appeal to rank-and-file
Democrats, independents and even some Republicans, said Julie Wong,
Bradley's California spokeswoman. Bradley unveiled his education
proposals at appearances this week.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire vote and polls in other states show Bradley is
backed by more independent voters than the vice president. But
Crigler said that won't help him in California, which will count
only th0e votes of registered Democrats in awarding delegates to
the Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Crigler said Bradley's attempt to ratchet up his criticism
of Gore may not succeed in California, where the small percentage
of
</P>
<P>
   Democrats angry at President Clinton already are likely Bradley
supporters. ``If he wants to go negative, it could create a
backlash,'' she said.

&HT;     DARK COMEDY FOCUSES ON LUST, DISCONTENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   There may be no cell phones, condoms or airbags in the Paris of
Cedric Kahn's ``L'Ennui,'' but there's enough sexual manic
depression to justify house calls from Dr. Laura.
</P>
<P>
   The angst belongs to Martin (Charles Berling), a philosophy
professor with a terminal case of the malaise of the title, which
in French means something like ``discontented boredom.'' In
America, it's just another way to be pretentious. With that,
welcome to Martin's world.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his fellow movie countrymen, his gloom outweighs
his glee. What else is new? Martin isn't happy unless he's
depressed, and pleasure is a luxury he doesn't have the ATM card
for. Thankfully, Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin) is willing to help him
find it _ and ever so passive-aggressively, too. She's the dowdy,
Rubenesque 17-year-old whose sexual skills send him spiraling into
great bouts of misery when he realizes she is not exclusively his,
sending him rushing to telephone his estranged wife (Arielle
Dombasle) for help.
</P>
<P>
   One night at a sex club, he picks up the tab for an artist's
drinks. As payment, the artist gives him the painting he happened
to be carrying. Mildly curious, as Berling's characters often are
lately, about the same sex (start with ``Dry Cleaning''), he goes
to the artist's house only to find that the guy died making love to
_ guess who. Cecilia's there when Martin arrives, admiring all the
portraits of her laying face down. Before long, Cecilia's making
daily house calls, and Martin's throwing fits with each broken play
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``L'Ennui'' is based on a novel by the late Alberto Moravia, an
Italian master of self-conscious contemporary erotic obsession.
(``Contempt'' and ``The Conformist'' were also based on his books.)
Kahn retains some of the mockery Moravia meant for Martin's
narcissism. Even with all his lecturing about Kant's and
Aristotle's writings on actions performed in a vacuum of
joylessness, Martin can't see the writing on the wall about
Cecilia. His obsession with her vexes him: How can he be hung up on
such a cheap, boring girl?
</P>
<P>
   I spent most of ``American Beauty'' wondering whether the movie
would stop to catch its breath and allow Kevin Spacey to execute a
thought _ the way the French do. But if getting my wish meant
spending two hours with a middle-aged man waxing about his sudden
loss of self-control like an over-caffeinated grad student, the
joke was on me. Why should there be less torture in a grown man's
obsession with cherubic jailbait who actually comes over every day?
</P>
<P>
   Kahn treats his story as dark comedy, and everything about
Berling's ivory-tower intensity seems to be saying, ``Excuse me but
I'm having an existential nervous breakdown over here!'' Spoken
like a horny egghead who's being ribbed for your pleasure.

`SNOW DAY' TAKES A VACATION FROM QUALITY

SNOW DAY 
Directed by: Chris Koch 
Screenplay by: Will McRobb &AMP; Chris Viscardi 
Starring: Mark Webber, Zena Grey, Schuyler Fisk, Emmanuelle
Chriqui, David Paetkau, Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Jean Smart, Pam
Grier, John Schneider, Josh Peck 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: PG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The snow in ``Snow Day'' seems made of styrofoam. In fact, the
whole film seems pretty plastic, as if written by a computer. The
cast warms it a bit, and those who demand no more than innocuous
predictability will be satisfied by it, but there's no getting
around its prefab flavor. Given its backing by Nickelodeon TV, it's
not surprisingly skewed toward preteens, with plenty of dissing of
adults, and lots of room for teen appeal. Given the thinness of the
plot, the appeal is sorely needed: Syracuse, N.Y., is hit with an
unexpected snowstorm, kids get a day off from school, and they
scheme to get a second day by thwarting the efforts of the poor
working stiff they call Snowplowman.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Webber's Hal is sympathetic enough as the lovestruck teen
mooning over Emmanuelle Chriqui's beauty, oblivious to the fact
that Schuyler Fisk's galpal is in love with him and that his
spirited kid sister, Zena Grey, resorts to playing with his action
figures all alone in lieu of what used to be his lively company.
The young women have rather the best of it, starting with Fisk's
smart, sensitive friend who'd like to be more than a friend.
Chriqui is anything but a heartless beauty. She responds with
gentle gratification and even generosity to Hal's imaginative ways
of letting her know how he feels about her. And Grey's Natalie is a
likable firecracker, even though she's stuck with the dumbest plot
strand _ stopping Snowplowman.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy Chase turns in an engagingly low-key performance as Hal's
and Natalie's dad, a loser weatherman placing third in the ratings
in a three-channel town, forced to wear silly costumes in a
desperate stab at goosing the numbers upward. Jean Smart plays the
workaholic mom, Chris Elliott survives the not-so-subtle dumping on
the working class (bad teeth, bad clothes) to seem no villain at
all as Snowplowman, and Iggy Pop turns up as the hated school
principal for no better reason than to give the kids someone else
at whom to lob snowballs. ``Snow Day'' at least has a little
personality, thanks to its players. But it wears its dialectics of
good and bad like a fright wig. At least it's short, but I refuse
to believe family films have to be as bland and characterless as
this one is. As film experiences go, ``Snow Day'' is just a
dusting.

THE BEACH 
Directed by: Danny Boyle 
Screenplay by: John Hodge, Alex Garland (based on Garland's novel) 
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen,
Guillaume Canet, Robert Carlyle, Paterson Joseph, Lars Arentz
Hansen 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, some strong sexuality, language and drug
content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could it have been the staggering grosses of ``Titanic'' that
sent its two stars running in the opposite direction, to neo-hippie
roles? Or just coincidence? Either way, Kate Winslet is much more
believable and sympathetic as a spiritual seeker in ``Hideous
Kinky'' and now ``Holy Smoke'' than Leonardo DiCaprio is as a
blissed-out backpacker in ``The Beach.'' The idea of making a film
with the ``Trainspotting'' gang _ Danny Boyle, John Hodge, Robert
Carlyle _ must have seemed irresistibly cool. But while DiCaprio
delivered a deliciously self-knowing performance as a bratty
superstar in Woody Allen's ``Celebrity,'' he seems strikingly
unaware of what a callow twit he's playing in ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those whose conception of heaven involves DiCaprio in
a sarong, but the fact is that DiCaprio's Richard palls pretty
quickly here. He's shallow and selfish and damages everything he
touches, almost from the moment he encounters Carlyle's flipped-out
Brit in a bug-infested Bangkok hotel and is given a map to a Thai
paradise _ specifically, a hard-to-get-to island commune where the
living is easy and far from drug-free. Thus pointed to Wonderland
by Carlyle's latter-day White Rabbit, Richard heads for it, taking
along an attractive French couple (Virginie Ledoyen and Etienne
Guillaume), and leaving behind a copy of the map for a couple of
stoneheads who hospitably fed him beers one rainy night.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming the last leg of the way, they find the island is indeed
a paradise _ with a catch. The part they land on is run by native
marijuana farmers who are armed and jumpy. They only escape by
taking a high dive from a cliff. They're found by a commune member
named Keaty. As played by Paterson Joseph, he's one of the film's
few redeeming features.
</P>
<P>
   The commune, as it happens, has been run for six years in rather
imperious fashion by Tilda Swinton's queen mum named Sal. She
explains that their arrival could have meant big trouble because
their understanding with the marijuana gang is that the commune
members can stay as long as they stick to their half of the island,
keep their existence quiet, and admit no newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble comes anyway, and it would be unfair to blame it
entirely on Richard, although his affair with Ledoyen strains
further the already frayed dynamic of the commune. After he has sex
with Sal, as well, during a trip to the mainland for supplies,
things grow even more tense at the commune. Although there are
idyllic moments, things inevitably come to a head, stress
escalates, and DiCaprio's credibility as Richard goes down the
tubes when he pulls a jungle fever number that's a travesty of
Marlon Brando's Kurtz in ``Apocalypse Now.'' It would be idle to
belabor the parallels here between the despoiling of paradise and
the arrival of the beautiful but heedless and ruinous American. The
film just isn't that deep.
</P>
<P>
   Like all utopias, the one in ``The Beach'' is a fragile one,
with an equilibrium too delicate to withstand the encroachments of
a newcomer whose pleasure-seeking means he's unsuited to a group
dynamic. In any case, Richard isn't interesting enough to carry a
movie. Swinton's Sal is the one we want to know more about,
Ledoyen's freshness and beauty buoy the film, and Guillaume's
generosity enhances it.
</P>
<P>
   Tailoring the film to an American star by changing the
protagonist of Alex Garland's novel from British to American and
adding sex and violence maybe wasn't the way to go, after all.
Instead of widening outward into a meditation on paradise found and
lost, as the book does, ``The Beach'' reduces it to a bummer spring
break movie. It's ``Beach Blanket Bingo'' revisited, but with a
Eurocast and more exotic locations.

HOLY SMOKE 
Directed by: Jane Campion 
Screenplay by: Anna Campion &AMP; Jane Campion 
Starring: Kate Winslet, Harvey Keitel, Julie Hamilton, Tim
Robertson, Sophie Lee, Dan Wyllie, Paul Goddard, George Mangos,
Kerry Walker, Leslie Dayman, Pam Grier 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Campion's ``Holy Smoke'' represents a throwback to the raw,
anarchic energies of Campion's ``Sweetie'' and, to a certain
extent, ``The Piano.'' The film doesn't go all the way. Its last
half trails away into muddle. But the urgency and vitality of its
first half can't be ignored. At its heart is the thrillingly
fearless performance of Kate Winslet as Ruth, whose impulse to
remove herself from Western culture, or at least her stifling
Australian family, seems eminently sound, except that her
subsequent flight to India and involvement with a guru there has
its questionable side. Also, her family isn't content to leave it
at that.
</P>
<P>
   They try several ruses to get her back. Finally, her mother's
panic attack, during a trip to India to pressure Ruth into
returning, does the trick. Once back, Ruth becomes a virtual
prisoner, figuratively corralled on an emu farm, isolated in the
Australian bush, while her family hires a slick American
deprogrammer, Harvey Keitel's PJ Waters, to bring her back into the
fold. At the start, the tension between them is interesting and
compelling, thanks mostly to Winslet. She's electrifying. There may
be something naive and self-indulgent in her Ruth, but Ruth's
instincts are basically sound. Her family is bad news. She's right
to want to escape them, and the purity of her search for something
genuinely spiritual compels respect.
</P>
<P>
   She makes an appealing pilgrim, an appealing searcher, precisely
because she doesn't know all the answers. In fact, she doesn't know
any, but she keeps pressing forward. But the film goes off the
tracks soon after she meets up with PJ, who dresses in Western
gear, like a hired gun. At first, he begins the deprogramming
regimen professionally enough. But soon the tensions become sexual,
and it becomes apparent that Ruth is aware that she can shift the
balance of power by using her body and allure to get at his shaky
male ego. Somewhere during this process, the weight of the film
shifts from her unruly but sympathetic flailing to his mid-life
crisis and belated wising up to a few rudimentary realities of
sexual politics in that hut in the middle of nowhere, as pilgrimage
becomes power struggle and negation of will becomes a clash of
wills.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the deprogrammer is on his way to being deprogrammed.
But there's no psychic or spiritual resonance attached to what
happens to him, even after he must face Ruth's hysteria-prone
family and their outrage upon learning what's been going on.
Presumably, the idea was to have Ruth and PJ both turn out to be
fellow travelers on their respective spiritual quests, but it
doesn't play that way. Ruth remains sympathetic, flaws and all. PJ,
however, barely seems substantial, much less anyone with whom we
can empathize. The yearning and depth of feeling Keitel was given
to work with in ``The Piano'' have no equivalent here. It's hard to
believe in PJ's narcissistic sexual escapades as benevolent shock
therapy for the women and maybe even for himself. PJ is not just a
miscreant, he's an unprofessional dirty old man, a large part of
the reason ``Holy Smoke,'' which begins so provocatively and
promisingly on the frontiers of risk and brave self-disarmament,
turns to ashes.

<P>
   It's one thing curling up on the sofa for a half-hour episode of
``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' on Saturday morning. It's
another thing entirely sitting through the hour and 16 minutes of
manic ricocheting and rampant woo-hooing in ``The Tigger Movie.''
Of all the ``Pooh'' characters, Tigger is the least endearing.
Let's be honest: He's downright obnoxious, a loudmouthed
bounce-house of unchecked impulses who perpetually wrecks houses
and fells friends. Not unlike a certain category of child, for whom
Tigger is probably the equivalent of the Terminator in terms of
psychological outlets for antisocial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about Tiggers/Is that I'm the only one!''
goes Tigger's familiar musical refrain. In his full-length feature
debut, however, Tigger decides that being the sole representative
of his particular feline family may not be such a wonderful thing,
after all. No one, not even little Roo, can bounce as high as he
can. It's lonely hurling your body into walls and decking neighbors
on your own. So Tigger sets out on a journey _ first through the
mail, then through the Hundred Acre Wood in a stormy climax _ in
search of his kin. In a classic example of childish
misinterpretation, Tigger believes he'll find his family _ where
else? _ in a family tree.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the most charming thing in this film. (That and the
poetic realization that Kenny Loggins has come full circle, from
his first hit, ``House at Pooh Corner,'' in 1972 to the end-title
song in ``The Tigger Movie.'') To be sure, there's a positive,
heartwarming message _ a variation on ``Home is where the heart
is.'' The notion that family is defined not only by bloodlines, but
by love and affection, is a worthwhile one. But a good message a
good movie doesn't make; it takes 40 minutes _ that's more than
half the duration of the film _ for the plot to thicken into action
beyond rushed sketches and bewilderingly brief scenes. The
filmmakers' assumptions about kids' shrunken attention spans
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; my 6-year-old companion was at
least as interested in his Slushee as the action on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost blasphemous to criticize any available
wintertime diversion for parents and their little ones. But in
terms of plot, character, imagination, and sheer entertainment
value, ``The Tigger Movie'' falls short of recent children's
animated features like ``The Rugrats Movie'' and ``The Iron
Giant.'' Even the film's six songs, by Richard M. and Robert B.
Sherman, are rote. If a long, chilly afternoon needs to be filled,
``The Tigger Movie'' won't hurt. But neither will it enchant.

THE BIG TEASE 
Directed by: Kevin Allen 
Screenplay by: Sacha Gervasi &AMP; Chris Ferguson 
Starring: Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Mary McCormack, David Rasche,
Chris Langham, Donal Logue 
Running time: 86 minutes 
Rated: R ( 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Big Tease'' isn't quite the riotous sendup of the LA
hairdressing universe it thinks it is, but it's brief and
good-natured and for the most part serves as a career boost for
Chris Ferguson. Best known here for his TV role as Drew Carey's
boss, the Scots comedian has written himself a role as a gay
hairdresser from Glasgow, Crawford Mackenzie, who thinks he's been
invited to compete in an international faceoff in LA, and proceeds
there with a documentary crew, only to find that he's only been
invited as an observer. Undeterred, he throws himself at the system
in an effort to qualify as a competitor. One needn't consult an
oracle to guess what follows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sunny frenzy with which Crawford goes at his
self-assigned task, the film more than once seems overextended,
even at 86 minutes. What saves it is that it's lighter than mousse
and is animated by a handful of engaging performers. These range in
style from Chris Langham's ego-puncturing documentarian to Frances
Fisher's savvy PR guru, who provides the Glaswegian with the entree
he needs after he rescues her from a bad hair day. She plays it a
bit straighter than the others, but also finds the fun in the role,
which is to say, she bounces it off the communal anxieties that
daily emanate from LA-like volcanic eruptions of bad karma. She's
the best thing in the film.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that other viewers will be more receptive than I to
the escalating parodies of the hairstyling game, which has always
seemed to me to parody itself better than any satirist ever could.
At any rate, the big square-off produces a screenful of
spectacularly campy (and misogynistic) silliness that no human head
should be asked to bear, but which four models bring off with
something like aplomb, investing with new layers of meaning the
concept of over-the-topness. Davis Rasche is a plus as a nasty
Scandinavian competitor. So is Donal Logue as a loosely wrapped
chauffeur. Ferguson also called in a few favors, getting cameos
from Carey, Cathy Lee Crosby, and David Hasselhoff to beef up his
merry but inescapably slight mockumentary of blow-dryer and
curling-iron heroics.

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MELTDOWN FOR MASS. GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Presidential politics is about the future. But what's happening
in Massachusetts is about right now, and it ain't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The meltdown of the Cellucci administration is accelerating.
Like a dysfunctional family that can no longer cope, the
Cellucci-ites are going cannibal. The incendiary comments of Big
Dig boss James Kerasiotes in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal landed
like a grenade at the garden party.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes, known far and wide as a Mr. Bluster whose ego is as
large as the Big Dig, carpet-bombed his boss and his colleagues in
print, in front of the very audience whose green-eye-shade gang can
pull the trigger any day now on bond interest hikes that will hit
the Massachusetts taxpayer right square in the labonzza.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's Geeta O'Donnell Anand, a Globe alumna with a
reputation for careful fact-checking, began her paper's assessment
of ``The Road Warrior'' thus: ``James J. Kerasiotes is not a meek
man. In a lengthy interview, he says the governor of Massachusetts
fears him. He calls the governor's chief political adviser a
`moron.' He dismisses the governor's former chief of staff, now
head of the Port Authority, as a `reptile.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Klown Kollege that is the governor's staff went into the
equivalent of a plane crash drill: hastily assembled staff
meetings, quick phone checks on what was to be the morning line,
elaborate reassurances to a disbelieving press corps, mumbled
excuses about coming up with new sources of funding to fill the
$1.4 billion hole in Big Dig funding that Mr. K now admits to.
</P>
<P>
   If his official family were like one of those welfare families
Cellucci is so fond of lecturing about self-reliance,
bootstrapping, and getting off the dole, a social worker would
appear on the doorstep this morning and take the kiddies into
custody. Because clearly this mob is a danger to itself, and
everyone else in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have punted on health care, punted on education, now it's
the Big Dig,'' said an exasperated Democratic legislative insider.
``What's next? It's like an octopus that has already dropped three
shoes, but you wonder if there are five more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high-ranking Democrat on Beacon Hill said that Cellucci
missed a chance to publicly chastise his outspoken transportation
czar. ``We were all waiting to see what would happen _ and nothing
happened,'' he said of the hour-long meeting between the governor
and the man who claims Cellucci is afraid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A normal governor would have said: `Jim needs to do some
apologizing,' '' said a chagrined appointee of the administration.
But Kerasiotes's only public regret was that he was sorry his
slashing remarks got into the newspaper. And that seems to have
compounded the felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leads you to the conclusion that what he said in the paper
is how he really feels,'' said the administration insider.
</P>
<P>
   The initial conclusion many draw is that for whatever reason,
Kerasiotes is too big to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the governor feels he cannot find anyone else to run the
sprawling project, which will wind up costing $15 billion when all
the bills are in, or whether Kerasiotes has too much clout in
political circles, or that he's raised too much money for Cellucci
and George W. Bush to be shoved out under fire, or whether he's too
valuable in place as an easy target for the inevitable criticism
about toll hikes and cost overruns, he stays put for now.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the reign of Big Bill Callahan, the Turnpike Authority
czar who built the Mass Pike extension and Route 128 and the tunnel
named for his war hero son has a gubernatorial appointee so cowed
an incumbent administration.
</P>
<P>
   What's important to watch next is to see the reaction in the New
York bonding community to the Keystone Kops routine in the State
House. The turmoil at the top has emasculated the governor's role
in shaping public policy. He seems unable to come to grips with the
complexities and the seriousness of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Silly junkets to movieland, elaborate politicial dalliances with
the faltering Bush campaign, and shortsighted lunges for partisan
advantage like his petititon drive to lower the income tax, all
combine to diminish his clout.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, serious officials like Attorney General Tom Reilly,
Speaker Tom Finneran, and Senate President Tom Birmingham have
filled in the gaps to keep the state's governance on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in Boston Mayor Tom Menino, who is not happy with a lot of
the smoke and lava erupting from Beacon Hill, and you have a
quartet of Four Toms trying to keep the railroad running while
Cellucci ponders the new release rack at Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   We need a whole new system of insuring health care hereabouts;
we need to come up with what will probably be $2 billion extra for
the Big Dig; we need to trim sails for a likely economic downturn
next year. We also need a real governor, which we won't get for
another three years.

OLD PALS REUNITE TO MAKE MUSIC   WITH ROCKFORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Pearl Jam hit the bigtime, Seattle guitarist Mike
McCready played in a band with childhood friends that didn't have
the same luck. They jammed together as grade-schoolers, continued
through high school, then went to Los Angeles in a futile search
for a record deal, before McCready headed back to Seattle to join
Pearl Jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to rehearse every day for seven years, five days a
week,'' McCready says of the core of the Rockfords, his new side
project which marks a full-circle return to playing with his
childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   The self-titled ``Rockfords'' album (the name was nicked from
the ``Rockford Files,'' McCready's favorite childhood TV show) is
an earnest effort, but also an impressive one. It mines
straightahead guitar-rock with new wave-ish, Debbie
Harry-influenced vocals from Carrie Akre. She wasn't one of his
childhood friends, but the other three were _ guitarist Danny
Newcomb (whom McCready can remember playing the Jimi Hendrix
version of ``The Star Spangled Banner'' with his teeth when he was
13), and brothers Rick and Chris Friel on bass and drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still dear friends of mine,'' says McCready, ``but it
was funny, because the same neuroses and same arguments came back _
things like `you're playing too loud!' or `this part is wrong.' But
we still had a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCready had another side project in the mid-'90s with the band
Mad Season _ a heavier, darker (but also impressive) group with
singer Layne Staley from Alice In Chains.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockfords are ``much more poppy,'' he says. ``And they have
more of a classic-rock sound because that's what we listened to
back then. I remember Danny would jump around playing air guitar on
a tennis racket to Aerosmith's `Rocks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the Rockfords (who may or may not tour,
depending on Pearl Jam's schedule) came when McCready caught a New
Year's show two years ago by the Seattle band Goodness, featuring
old friends Danny Newcomb and Chris Friel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let's do something,' '' McCready recalls. ``It just
felt right to come full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a democratic approach to the songwriting, with McCready
penning lyrics to about half of the tunes, most of which have an
upbeat focus. There's the Pretenders-like ``Sureshot,'' the
slashing ``This Life'' (with the line, ``I'm going to turn this
life into something real''), the propulsive pop of ``Adelaide''
(with Akre belting it out), and the alluring ``Flashes,'' with a
guitar intro evoking Jeff Beck's ``Shapes of Things,'' followed by
a tough, Fiona Apple-like vocal from Akre.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to play with other people,'' says McCready.
``It ignites everybody and gives you an influx of new ideas and
confidence. That's what Mad Season did for me, and the Rockfords,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the new Pearl Jam album is nearing completion and is
expected out in late April. ``There's one song I'm really excited
about called `Nothing As It Seems,' '' McCready says of a track
written by Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament. ``It's my favorite Pearl
Jam song ever, I think. It's dark and Pink Floyd-ish. I love
that.'' Another song is ``Letter for the Dead'' (written by Pearl
Jam singer Eddie Vedder), though most still don't have titles.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam will tour Europe in May, but a US tour is not firm
yet.
</P>
<P>
   After the next round of tours, however, McCready is thinking of
taking a break from playing. ``Maybe I'll go back to school. I love
playing in (Pearl Jam) and feel blessed that people like us, but
I'd like to finish my degree. I'll probably study history and
literature. No math, that's for sure.''

MARILYN HORNE'S FOUNDATION ENERGIZES RECITAL SINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marilyn Horne has been before the public for nearly
50 years, and a star for 39 of them _ she became a celebrity the
night she sang her first performance opposite Joan Sutherland in
Bellini's ``Beatrice di Tenda'' in 1961. She made much of her
illustrious career in opera, but she also loved singing in
recitals, and on her 66th birthday last month she demonstrated that
she still does. It is hard to say whether her admirers remember the
staggering bravura of her coloratura in Rossini's ``Semiramide''
any more fondly than the simple and touching way she used to sing
Stephen Foster's ``I Dream of Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair'' in
her concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Horne has announced that after this season she will retire from
singing classical music but will continue to perform popular music,
reminding us that her career began in pop music. She ``ghosted''
the voice for Dorothy Dandridge in the film of ``Carmen Jones'' and
recorded supermarket ``covers'' of pop hits by Kay Starr, Peggy
Lee, and other ``canaries'' of the period.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the mezzo-soprano has devoted many of her
energies to her own foundation, which she set up to draw attention
to the art of recital singing. Each season she has organized a
benefit for the foundation at which she sings, along with other
established artists, and some young singers that Horne and the
foundation have chosen to bring forward.
</P>
<P>
   This year, to celebrate the millennium, Horne arranged the
concert not as a benefit but as a gift to the music-loving public;
the Carnegie Hall event was free. It was preceded by masterclasses
by soprano Regine Crespin and collaborative pianist Martin Katz and
a panel that discussed the nature and future of the recital. This
writer, along with Peter G. Davis of New York magazine, John von
Rhein of the Chicago Tribune, Heidi Waleson of the Wall Street
Journal, and Manuela Hoelterhoff, formerly of the Wall Street
Journal and recently the biographer of Cecilia Bartoli, served as
paid panelists.
</P>
<P>
   The recital was a remarkable event. Horne's singing guests
included such famous golden throats as Renee Fleming, Bryn Terfel,
Jerry Hadley, Dolora Zajick, and the countertenor David Daniels.
The younger singers were soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian, baritone
Lester Lynch, and countertenor Bejun Mehta. At the piano were such
notable figures as Katz, Brian Zeger, newcomer Carrie-Ann Matheson,
and the magnificent Warren Jones, who played all his accompaniments
from memory and appeared to be shaking the fearsome octaves of
Schubert's ``Erlkoenig'' out of his shirt sleeve. James Levine
dropped in, unannounced, to accompany Horne in Schubert's ``Who Is
Sylvia?'' Isaac Stern made a speech honoring the diva _ ``You must
spend the next 20 years giving farewell performances, like Madame
Schumann-Heink,'' he said, before presenting her with a manuscript
of Arsace's aria from ``Semiramide'' in Rossini's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the concert was mostly serious, the second
half mostly a collection of encore material, informally presented _
the singers sat in a semicircle around the stage, and Horne clucked
over them like a mother hen. There was some great singing, some
very good singing, and a little that was not quite so good. Zajick
is formidably indefatigable, but her brazen tone and delivery are
not those of a singer of songs. Lynch has an imposing voice that
suffered from his attempts to make it still more imposing.
Bayrakdarian, a young soprano who had sung in William Bolcom's ``A
View From the Bridge'' in Chicago, was lissome and appealing in
voice and presence. Goose bumps rose when Terfel sang ``Erkoenig''
and when Fleming soared into the climax of Schumann's ``Stille
Traenen'' (``Silent Tears''), which sounded, as she sang it, like
the most beautiful song in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta's highly individual countertenor timbre seemed a little
exotic for Schumann's ``Widmung,'' but for his encore he sang a
``Handelian'' version of ``Little Jack Horner'' with drop-dead
virtuoso ornamentation. Hadley poured it on in ``The Homing Heart''
by Albert Hay Malotte and delivered an absolutely shameless
peformance of ``Lydia, the TattooedLady.'' Daniels was elegant in a
Gounod song, but his efforts to sound laid-back in an Alec Wilder
tune emerged as dainty.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming and Terfel defied political correctness by singing the
love duet from ``Porgy and Bess.'' Gershwin wouldn't have minded _
he was in the studio for the first recordings of his opera, which
starred two white singers from the Met, Helen Jepson and Lawrence
Tibbett. But in recent years white singers have been wary of
approaching even African-American spirituals, which is a paradox,
because the point everyone always makes about music is that it is a
``universal language.'' Fleming and Terfel justified their choice
by singing the music _ and the text _ honestly and gorgeously.
</P>
<P>
   Horne was suffering from a cold and confessed to the audience
that the last thing on earth she wanted to do when she woke up that
morning was go to Carnegie Hall and sing. But sing she did, with
the distinction of timbre, steadiness of tone, and evenness of line
that have always marked her work, and an emotional immediacy that
appeared more erratically than technical perfection in some of her
glory years. She opened with an invocation from the first opera, by
Jacopo Peri, and later sang a duet from Rossini's ``La Regatta
Veneziana'' with Fleming. She also presented two premieres, songs
by Bolcom, who knows just how to write for her voice, and Richard
Hundley. Hundley's song, based on an Amy Lowell poem, was an
old-fashioned parlor ballad, unabashed and luscious. Bolcom's was a
witty setting of an amusing poem by May Sarton, ``The Digital
Wonder Watch,'' and Horne put every word and innuendo across,
underlining how she would never grow old. She also sang Irving
Berlin's ``Suppertime,'' a song about a lynching that is indelibly
associated with Ethel Waters. In introducing it, Horne mentioned
Waters but not lynching, so it might have seemed like just another
blues song, except for the the intense poignancy of her delivery.
For the very end, Horne chose another Irving Berlin number,
``Always,'' and she began it with a bewitching tenderness. But Katz
didn't allow her to get through it _ segueing, instead, into
``Happy Birthday,'' which can seldom have been sent aloft by such a
luxurious complement of voices.
</P>
<P>
   The panel might have profited from an alternative to critical
presence _ a singer, a collaborative pianist, a composer, a
manager, and a critic might have mixed it up more. The ``recital
business'' covers a wide range of activities, from the Three Tenors
singing, amplified, into arenas, to very small events. Several
kinds of recital came under discussion, and aspects of one kind of
concert, the diva recital, for example, that are endearing in their
own context can become irritants in another. It is a mistake to
judge something for failing to accomplish something it never set
out to do. It is also probably a mistake to make some kinds of
recitals more ``popular'' because the nature and intensity of the
experience depends not just on the art of the singer (and pianist),
but on the intimacy of the situation. For Jessye Norman to sing a
Schubert song in Carnegie Hall is every bit as much an act of
transcription as Stokowski arranging Bach for full orchestra. This
writer recalled how different the experience was of hearing Mitsuko
Shirai and Hartmut Hoell perform Schubert's ``Winterreise'' in a
New York concert hall and, later, for a small audience in a room in
Harvard's Houghton Library. The Harvard performance, a year ago,
may have been the most intense musical experience of my life.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion demonstrated the one reason why the recital will
never vanish from musical life _ this is the most direct and
personal of all the musical arts, and in recitals people hear
things they carry around with them for the rest of their lives. And
it's entirely possible that someone in Carnegie Hall on Jan. 16 may
have had his life changed because he heard Marilyn Horne.

SAFIRE DISHES THE DIRT OF 2 CENTURIES AGO 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SCANDALMONGER 
By William Safire 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, Illustrated, 496 pp., $27 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name James Thomson Callender popped up in news stories out
of Washington near the end of last month, as it invariably does
whenever there is new evidence that Thomas Jefferson had fathered
children with his slave mistress, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   That was nice timing for columnist-turned-novelist William
Safire and his publisher, because it was Callender _ the
``scandalmonger'' of Safire's title _ who first published an
account of the relationship in September 1802.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well known,'' Callender wrote in the Richmond Recorder,
``that the man whom it delighteth the people to honor, keeps and
for many years has kept, as his concubine, one of his slaves. Her
name is Sally. The name of her eldest son is Tom. His features are
said to bear a striking though sable resemblance to those of the
President himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty strong stuff for those times _ and perhaps even for these
days, although Safire drops a hint or two that it was not
impossible for him to imagine some present-day scandalmonger
writing a similar piece about people named ``Monica'' and ``Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   What Safire, the New York Times political columnist (and author
of a previous historical novel, ``Freedom''), has sought to do in
this right-off-the-news (of today and of 200 years ago) novel is to
bring Callender out of the historical underworld so his impact on
the events of his day can be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much that the leaders of the early
republic loom so large in our historical consciousness. Rather, it
is that the crucial events of those years transpired despite the
revelations and allegations of Callender and his rival
scandalmongers.
</P>
<P>
   But scandalmongering did play a role in the fascinating story
that Safire not just retells, but recalls vividly from the
historical mists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1798, with French privateers seizing American merchant ships,
President John Adams sent envoys to France in an effort to bring a
halt to the practice. When the French demanded a million-pound loan
in return, the American envoys broke off negotiations and sent a
secret report to Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Callender, a Scottish fugitive from British sedition laws, was
then editing the Aurora, an anti-Federalist paper (and in this
context pro-French) in Philadelphia. Callender believed that Adams
was keeping the report secret because it was favorable to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drumbeat in the Aurora to reveal the report was taken up
in the next few days by the rest of the republican press,'' writes
Safire, and was ``echoed in the Congress'' by the Jeffersonian
anti-Federalists. After several days of partisan attacks, Adams
called their bluff, releasing the report, with the French officials
identified as X, Y, and Z.
</P>
<P>
   The Federalists were triumphant, the Jeffersonians were
confounded, coastal towns began raising money to build a navy _ and
Callender was sacked by the Aurora's owner. ``The pity,'' Safire
has Callender muse to himself _ and perhaps to observers of today's
political scene _ ``was that the combination of a minority voice in
the House . . . magnified by the voice of the opposition press . .
. had the power to lead an entire political movement over the
cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his tale, Safire sticks reasonably close to the
historical record _ and documents it as necessary. His major
departure is in expanding the role of a young woman named Maria
Reynolds (a player in a real sexual/fiscal scandal involving
Alexander Hamilton and likely the lover of Aaron Burr) to later
become Callender's mistress. In that fictional role, she fulfills
the need for someone through whom to view Callender. But Safire's
reports of her activities _ among them, her calling upon the wife
of a Virginia planter to get confirmation for Callender of
Jefferson's attempt to seduce her _ push the historical envelope
somewhat too much.
</P>
<P>
   Safire's decision to tell virtually his entire story through
dialogue _ mainly invented, in the case of his historical
personages _ gives a certain dramatic movement to the novel. But
without the movie camera's eye, there is too little sense of
physical context, like, for instance, the bustle and clutter of a
scandalmonger's print shop.
</P>

   Safire has been so important a figure in American political
journalism for the past quarter-century that the reader will be
looking for his comments on the practice of that craft. There's a
dandy one when Callender is hired to write for the Richmond
Recorder, the paper in which he will subsequently expose the
Jefferson scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall neither calumniate nor flatter men in office,''
Callender tells the Recorder's editor. ``We shall neither defame
not worship men who are out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What will we do, then, to gain a readership?'' the editor
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will soon see,'' Callender replies, ``that from
whatever political or commercial quarter deceit and falsehood many
come, it shall be our ambition . . . to blast them with the
lightning of truth.'' Scandalmongering? Or just good journalism.

A YEAR AFTER FUROR, A LYCOS LOVEFEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Count it as one small executive perk that goes along with stock
market popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc., was in a position to
shut down the grueling cross-country road show promoting the
Waltham, Mass. Internet company's latest stock offering a few days
ahead of schedule, thanks to excess demand for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos raised about $500 million by selling new stock in the
oversubscribed offering last month, far above the original target
of $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of exuberant investor reaction is a far cry from the
stock market uproar Davis faced a year ago, as his planned merger
with elements of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc. started to come
apart at the seams. Critics, who eventually included CMGI Inc.
chief executive and former Lycos director David Wetherell,
complained the company was selling its future too cheaply to the
home-shopping king.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Davis believes the deal would have been a lay-up if it
had come after, rather than before, the high-profile megamerger
agreement between America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole bunch of people misjudged the market reaction to the
merger of traditional media and new media,'' he said. ``I think we
were ahead of our time. Sometimes pioneers claim new territory,
sometimes they take a few arrows. We took a few arrows during that
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Davis thinks it is unlikely Lycos would buy or be purchased
by a media company. He points to the company's European joint
venture with the media giant Bertelsmann AG as a much more likely
model for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has continued to buy and build Internet content and
services at a furious pace since the Diller deal folded, paying $45
million just this week for a software company that helps online
clubs function. It spent $207 million three months ago to buy
Gamesville.com, the popular Watertown-based online game company.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other purchases are all fueling a Lycos strategy that
has built more than a dozen Internet brand names, as many as four
on the Web's top 20 during some months. Unlike Yahoo, which
produces its content under one name, Lycos manages sites such as
Angelfire, Tripod, Lycos.com, and Hotbot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all built on what I would argue is the rapidly
fragmenting Web audience,'' Davis said. ``We're finding it's less
the white, tech-savvy, highly educated male as the online user. The
online user mirrors society more.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has pushed Lycos ahead of a pack in the last two
years, grabbing nearly one out of every two Web users. But its
combined sites still trail Yahoo, America Online, and Microsoft
Corp. in the competition for Web eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's proprietary content and its Web site combined
attracted 53.8 million unique visitors in December, according to
the Internet tracker Media Metrix Inc. Yahoo was second, with 42.4
million, still well ahead of Lycos and its combined total of 30.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the likes of Yahoo remains a tall order, though Davis
notes Lycos is growing faster and insists the advantages of its
multibrand strategy will only grow over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe it's an Achilles heel of Yahoo, that
eventually the site reaches a point of saturation,'' Davis said.
``There has never been a brand in the history of mankind that has
been able to capture all the audience. Look at the soap companies
that have 10 brands, and deodorant companies and the cola
companies. They all have families of brands that segment the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also believes America Online will face a different kind of
challenge that could erode the huge customer base attracted to its
basic pay service for Web connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a new model developing, which will be free
access,'' he said. ``We will find every imaginable type of company
providing free Internet access, and I don't belive many of us will
be paying for it a year or 18 months from now. I think that puts
them under a lot of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you think investors have been worried about putting money
on the Internet's front-runners, think again. Lycos and its stock
earned a place above the Internet pack but haven't been able to
compete with shares of the Web's leaders over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares soared by 697 percent between the start of 1998 and
the end of 1999. But Yahoo stock shot up by an amazing 2,512
percent, and America Online advanced 1,254 percent over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's total stock market value, a whopping $96 billion
Thursday, dwarfed the $7.8 billion value of Lycos stock. That
advantage, more than tenfold, exists despite a revenue lead that
was less than four-to-one in Yahoo's favor in the last reported
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that revenues from five international joint
ventures that place Lycos in 24 countries don't show up in the
company's financial statements. Lycos put no money into the
ventures, so there is no balance sheet entry or recognized revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   One solution: Davis believes all of the company's international
joint ventures will go public. He said investment bankers at
Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are already working on a stock
offering for Lycos Europe, the joint venture with Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, expect Lycos to role out lots more Internet
content. Davis suggests the company could do more in areas such as
sports, careers, and computing. The one sure thing: More Lycos
brands are in the future. ``It's my belief that it should
accelerate as the Web continues to become more fragmented.''

of January 1999. &QL;

   When it eventually came, the end was quick and anti-climactic.
As dawn broke on Feb. 6, nearly 2,700 unarmed federal police walked
into the main campus of the National Autonomous University in
Mexico City, and led away 745 students and staff still holed up
inside its buildings. Thus ended a 292-day student strike and
occupation of the biggest university in the Americas. &QL;

much in common _ in fact, so much so that it is easy to imagine how
the Internet could replace Reuters. And that is the danger Reuters

As dawn broke on Feb. 6, nearly 2,700 unarmed federal police walked

Mexico City, and led away 745 students and staff still holed up
inside its buildings. Thus ended a 292-day student strike and

IT'S TIME FOR CELTIC BOSS TO CONFESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Pitino should say aloud what he knows to be true. I am sure
he has come close to saying it before. Maybe he has pushed the
words to the edge of his tongue, dared them to leap, and then
reeled them back to a place of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Rick. Push them off.
</P>
<P>
   When the president and head coach of the Celtics does that, we
will have the necessary audio for what we already know to be a
visual wreck. There are so many ways to say it.
</P>
<P>
   He can say he has failed.
</P>
<P>
   He can say he is not going to lead the Celtics to the playoffs
(never mind an NBA title) before he leaves Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He can say he has failed.
</P>
<P>
   He can say he has made some crippling moves since becoming a
celebrated executive and coach in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Or he can say he has failed.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think failure is anything to be ashamed of, because the
experience usually makes you better. I have no doubt Pitino will be
stronger from his Boston failure. It's too bad that's not the case
for the franchise that employs him.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has played Ali to the Celtics' Frazier _ ``Down goes
Frazier!'' _ since he has been in town. The team's sad 21-28 record
at the All-Star break, following a Pitino playoff guarantee, is
merely the public face of Pitino's behind-the-scenes chaos.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Pitino almost acknowledged his failure to PBS
talk show host Charlie Rose during a program that aired Wednesday
night. Rose asked Pitino if he ever had dreams or nightmares about
Tim Duncan. This is what followed:
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: ``Not nightmares. I think more dreams. I think, if you
said to me today . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Rose: ``Yeah?''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: ``. . . As much as I love going back to Boston . . . If
you said to me today, `Would you leave Kentucky knowing that you
would not get Tim Duncan?' I probably would say, `No, I would not
leave Kentucky.' . . . Turning this thing around to the
championship level without Duncan is very difficult to imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, he could have said he failed.
</P>
<P>
   I don't consider myself a narcissist, but I wish Rose would have
invited me to join the interview. I would have asked Pitino why he
left Lexington, even though he had less than a coin flip's chance
of getting Duncan. How many people switch jobs because they are
banking on a lottery that hasn't even happened?
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Duncan is not why Pitino has won 42 percent of his
181 games here. It is not Paul Gaston's fault. It is not Antoine
Walker's fault. It is not the fault of the fans, the fault of the
NBA lockout, or the fault of M.L. Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's liberal spending and bad decisions are the major
reasons the Celtics are looking up at, of all teams, the Orlando
Magic. It is as if he puts his personnel thoughts on a compact
disc, slides it into the CD player, pushes ``Random Play,'' and
goes with whatever he gets.
</P>
<P>
   His three-year anniversary doesn't come until May, but Pitino
has already traded away three lottery picks (No. 3, No. 6, No. 8).
That's three lottery picks exchanged for no playoff appearances.
Bobby Grier, Dan Duquette, and Harry Sinden have presided over
playoff teams since Pitino has been here. But if any of them had
done what Pitino has done, the commentary would be unmerciful.
There are volumes of Pitino's words which, when put together,
provide a vivid portrait of his Boston struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell myself to chill out. Antoine and Ron are going
to be great players. They make mistakes, but I have to remember how
young they are. That's when I tell myself to chill out, to settle
down. Both of them could still be in college.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that about Walker and Mercer in March 1998. A year
later, he began exploring trades for both players. Before sending
Mercer to the Nuggets last summer (in another unsuccessful deal),
he traded for center Vitaly Potapenko.
</P>
<P>
   This is where talk of a budget becomes humorous. He overpaid
Potapenko, who was a backup in Cleveland, and tried to get Mercer
on a discount. If he hadn't traded for the center, he would have
had the cash to sign Mercer, and he also would have been able to
keep his first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you don't have to worry about killing me because I'll kill
me. The best bridge to hang from is the BU Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in March 1999. He said he would do that if this
year's Celtics don't make the playoffs. (Rick, let's not take this
failure thing too far: You ain't gonna make the playoffs, but
please don't take your life.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Celtics are not going to make the playoffs. They
will finish with a losing record this year, and it will be the
first time in Pitino's career that he will lead a team to three
consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His team will not win now because he still doesn't know how to
communicate with his players. He lurks on the sideline, coaching as
if he were watching over pawns rather than players. Many of the
pros who play for him regularly tune him out. He complains about
his team's lack of defensive talent, even though he built the team.
For three seasons, he has been promising a team that will defend
tenaciously and play unselfishly. He hasn't delivered yet: The
Celtics allow the highest field goal percentage in the league
(.473).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you are young and talented, what you need is
practice. And I am positive that we'll get the necessary practice
time and become a very good basketball team. I think we have the
necessary ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   That was last April. I don't agree that this team has the
ingredients, but if Pitino believes that it does, what does the
awful record say for him?
</P>
<P>
   Pitino draws a $7 million annual paycheck from the Celtics, and
many people don't walk away from salaries like that. But I will be
surprised if he is here next year and shocked if he is here in two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny is going to get 13 or 14 rebounds a night.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that about Danny Fortson in November. Three months
later, he couldn't find playing time nor money for the ferocious
rebounder. Fortson averaged five rebounds and was dealt to Toronto
for nondescript point guard Alvin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The spring day Pitino held his FleetCenter press conference, the
parquet floor was taken out of storage and some of the title
banners were lowered. Now we know they were lowered in half-staff
sadness rather than joy. Pitino arrived. He brought his charisma,
savvy, and exciting system.
</P>
<P>
   The system failed.

SCORSESE'S VIEW OF THE MOVIES

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Reviews of ``A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through
American Movies,'' and ``A Dog's Life.'' Embargoed until MONDAY,
Feb. 14; tonight is MONDAY in this story. Fact box below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are different types of passion and love, and tonight a
couple of different cable networks spend Valentine's Day exploring
them.
</P>
<P>
   On Turner Movie Classics, the television premiere of ``A
Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies''
(running through Wednesday) is a celebratory experience for any
film fan, a great college film course condensed to a breezy 4 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Scorsese suffered from severe asthma as a child, which served to
plant him in front of a TV, where he discovered a wealth of classic
cinema. This is a loving look at American cinema from the golden
days of the studios to the iconoclasm of the '60s and '70s. It
serves two unique purposes _ it provides a fascinating alternative
history of the art form, and it offers intimate insights into
Scorsese's mind and aesthetic, showing how these movies shaped the
films Scorsese himself has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a film critic _ I love them too much to be a
critic,'' Scorsese said in a recent phone conversation. ``If I see
a film that has one or two great scenes, and the rest is not very
good, I'll tolerate so much.'' Even at the age 10 and 11, Scorsese
watched movies repeatedly and obsessively, drinking in the
techniques used and the moods created.
</P>
<P>
   ``This documentary was meant to throw it out there to the young
people, really,'' Scorsese said. ``I'll talk to some student
groups, and I'll mention `Sweet Smell of Success' or Andre de Toth
or John Ford's `Wagon Master,' and suddenly I realize they don't
know what I'm talking about. And you find that, unfortunately, film
history starts, maybe, with `Forrest Gump.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I tried to do was make a film that was about the history
of the American cinema but seen through my eyes,'' he continued.
``If the younger people are seeing a straight history, a
chronological history, it may not be as interesting and may lose
some of its juiciness, in a way. What I'm trying to do is excite
some of the younger filmmakers or people with this documentary, to
make them go and search out the older films, films of the old
masters, so to speak, and films of the B directors.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to such well-known filmmakers as John Ford, Stanley
Kubrick and Vincente Minnelli, Scorsese also copiously discusses
lesser-known auteurs _ his affection for B movies and filmmakers
who prove to be resourceful on tight budgets is expansive. He
discusses Edgar G. Ulmer (whose no-budget ``Detour'' he
particularly adores), Jacques Tourneur (the 1942 ``Cat People'' is
one of his favorites) and Ida Lupino, the actress who became a
B-movie director.
</P>
<P>
   Even film buffs will probably find something they didn't know in
this lovingly assembled package. More good news: Scorsese is
currently working on a similar documentary on Italian cinema.
</P>
<P>
   And TCM is accompanying the documentary with a number of the
films Scorsese dissects. Tonight, following Part 1 of ``Personal
Journey,'' are``The Bad and the Beautiful'' and ``The Crowd.'' On
Tuesday, ``Some Came Running'' and ``Cat People'' will be shown,
and ``Wild Boys of the Road'' and ``Hell's Highway'' will screen on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday and Friday will feature complete evenings of Scorsese
favorites, and some of his own early work will be available for
insomniacs: ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'' will air at 3:30
a.m. Tuesday, ``New York, New York'' at 3 a.m. Wednesday and ``The
Last Waltz'' at 4 a.m. Thursday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`A DOG'S LIFE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Channel, on the other hand, chooses to focus on
the love a lot of us have for our dogs. In ``A Dog's Life,'' three
one-hour specials presented back-to-back, narrator Kelsey Grammer
informs us that no two species have connected more affectionately
than humans and canines. He drolly and empathetically describes the
myriad manifestations of love we have shared since man domesticated
the animal 100,000 years ago to aid in hunting for food.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet as it is, ``A Dog's Life'' isn't terribly fact-heavy.
Through the three hours, it dispenses such nuggets as: There are
450 different breeds of dogs. They're colorblind but have terrific
night vision and a wider field of vision than we do. When they wag
their tails, they're conveying anxiety as well as happiness. They
show up at your front door even before you get home because they
can detect your car's engine from great distances.
</P>
<P>
   But the documentarians are more interested in showing lots of
footage of cute puppies and swapping heartwarming tales, so we hear
of acts of heroism and sacrifice by both dogs and their owners. One
man gladly lost his leg rescuing his dog from a passing train; a
Vietnam vet poignantly recalls the dog that saved his life (the
cameras linger a little too manipulatively long as he tries to
compose himself).
</P>
<P>
   By the time they get to the folks who plunk down $1,000 so their
dogs can attend a week of summer camp, you'd likely be wagging your
own tail _ more out of anxiety than happiness. &QL;

NCAA MISHANDLED BARKLEY   INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The business at St. John's last week in which Erick Barkley was
suspended by the NCAA for three games for reportedly trading in his
late model Jeep Cherokee for an older model Ford Expedition to a
family friend is the latest example of the way the NCAA governs
college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA system needs to be revamped. The current policy on
these matters is ``guilty until proven innocent,'' which is why
Barkley was suspended last week before all the facts were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   That is flat out wrong. Barkley missed last Saturday's game
against Boston College before the NCAA got to the matter Monday
morning. Subsequently, he missed Tuesday's game against Providence
and will presumably miss Saturday's game against Villanova before
he is allowed to return _ against Boston College at Conte Forum _
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the NCAA had found no wrongdoing? What does it do then,
tell Barkley it's sorry he missed a game? What if Troy Bell's
last-second basket had gone in and St. John's had lost the game and
because of that loss the Johnnies did not make the NCAA tournament?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry? That doesn't cut it. The NCAA constantly talks about the
concerns of the ``student-athlete.'' Where was it in this instance?
</P>
<P>
   If there is a suspicion of wrongdoing involving an athlete in
season, the NCAA can't go on its Monday-Friday, 9 to 5 clock. Make
a ruling right away or let the player participate until that ruling
is made.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent until proven guilty is a nice concept that seems to
have worked in this country. The NCAA should try it.
</P>
<P>
   Now as to Barkley. Let's use some common sense here. Trading
cars in the middle of a season? That does send off some pretty loud
alarms. Who owns each car? How were they paid for? And why the
switch?
</P>
<P>
   Now we come to St. John's coach Mike Jarvis. He simply needs to
activate his mute button. First, he states that Madison Square
Garden is not a home-court advantage for St. John's, which is a
stretch at best.
</P>
<P>
   Then he comes out, mouth blazing, after the Barkley incident,
comparing it to being raped?
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis correctly and wisely backed off that comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to his off-the-cuff remarks made earlier this month
when he suggested Notre Dame's All-American forward Troy Murphy was
a great player, and it was a shame he would probably be in the NBA
next year.
</P>
<P>
   An opposing coach has no business making a statement like that
about someone else's players.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Matt Doherty could have countered and said
Jarvis had a great recruiting class coming in next season and it
was a shame that those players wouldn't have the benefit of
Jarvis's coaching because he would be in the NBA next season.
</P>
<P>
   Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese had enough of that and told
everyone no more NBA talk from coaches for the remainder of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A blown call
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiasco No. 2 of the week occurred last Saturday when Boston
University's game at Northeastern was postponed because the
officials weren't informed that a game originally scheduled for 7
p.m. had been switched to 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a last-second switch, there would be some
understanding (not much). But the switch was made weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somehow the officials weren't told. For that, the America
East deserves full blame.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more. League policy states 90 minutes prior to any
game, officials from the home team get together with game officials
to go over pregame preparations. Another meeting is scheduled for
45 minutes before the game with the timers and other officials
working the clocks and scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no referee on site an hour before the game,
shouldn't someone be making some calls? According to America East
officials at the game, no one from that office was informed there
was a problem until almost game time.
</P>
<P>
   If the America East wants to be considered a solid mid-major
conference, which the quality of its teams and coaches suggests it
is, incidents like this can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Who pays the price for this mistake? Northeastern and BU, which
must now play five games in seven days, including the makeup of
this game Tuesday night.

   At UMass, the topic du jour of the basketball program has been
not only wins and losses, but a decline in attendance. Speculation
has been made that such a decline will be part of coach Bruiser
Flint's evaluation at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly more than 4,000 people attended Mullins Center
Wednesday night to watch the Minutemen roll over LaSalle.
</P>
<P>
   Flint's main job is to win games. He has no control over the
attendance and should not be blamed for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is get our team to play hard every night and try
and win every game,'' said Flint. ``I think we're doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning games is clearly tied to attendance, so by winning,
attendance should go up.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be argued that there are unmistakable signs of
progress, which combined with what looks like a decent recruiting
class next season, should at least buy him another year.
</P>
<P>
   That is a logical argument. But the bottom line for the
Minutemen is to win enough games to get into postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proof's in the package
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting testy at UCLA where Bruins coach Steve Lavin
is under fire. The Bruins have become a .500 club, capable of
winning or losing to anyone on any given night. That's not enough
for the Bruins brethren, especially if the Bruins fail to make the
64-team NCAA tournament field, something that has not happened
since 1987-88 in Walt Hazzard's last season as coach.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? Lavin came to his office one day and found a
suspicious package. Taking no chances, the bomb squad was called,
only to find the package contained feces, with a note reading:
``You're team played like it. Here's some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Also disconcerting to Bruins fans is this: Southern California
could produce four NCAA teams without UCLA being part of the mix.
Southern California, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, and Cal
State-Northridge are all contending for NCAA spots . . . Thursday
night's upset binge in which Top 10 teams Ohio State, Auburn,
Indiana, and Duke all lost shows how fragile rankings are this
season . . . With the resignations of Notre Dame athletic director
Mike Wadsworth and Michigan athletic director Tom Goss, Boston
College athletic director Gene DeFilippo's name is reportedly on
the short list of both schools. DeFilippo says he has absolutely no
interest in either job and wants to continue working to build BC
into a Top 25 power in many programs . . . It's been a tough season
for New England schools, with almost everyone struggling, including
national champion UConn. But Central Connecticut and Quinnipiac are
both thriving.

IT'S BEEN A LEAP YEAR FOR SKATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Tim Goebel is fantasizing about the quint. The
quintuple jump, five revolutions in the air in maybe six-10ths of a
second. ``I think anything is possible,'' figure skating's newest
teenage skywalker says. ``Fifteen years ago, nobody thought a quad
would be possible. The sport is changing so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't Goebel quint? He's already over-rotating his quad
salchow. He landed an unprecedented three quads in the same program
last autumn. Evgeny Plushenko, the Russian aerialist who looks like
a blond crane about to take wing, is already doing a
quad-triple-double combination. And Goebel has been fooling around
with a quad-triple-triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us don't even warm up doubles any more,'' shrugs
Goebel, who was gunning for US champion Michael Weiss when the
men's event began at Gund Arena. ``It's like a waste of time. We do
a double axel and go right to triples.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's skating, in a landbound lull since Tonya Harding landed
the last triple axel nine years ago, is taking off, too. Irina
Slutskaya, who didn't even make the Russian team last year, hit an
historic triple lutz-triple loop combination to win last month's
Grand Prix final and landed another triple-triple combo for good
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hughes, the 14-year-old who'll be dogging three-time
victor Michelle Kwan, will try a couple of triple-triples in
Saturday night's long program. She's already working on the triple
axel in a harness and was trying out the quad last summer. ``It's
fun sometimes to try new things,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The bar is rising rapidly in a sport where skaters haven't done
figures for years. And even though artistry still counts for more
than athleticism when the medals are awarded, the pull is all
upward these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once something's been done, it has to be done,'' says Frank
Carroll, Kwan's coach. ``That's the way of the game. That's the way
of any sport. You have to keep up, or you're left in the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who ruled the world with her blend of technique and grace,
is feeling the squeeze. Until Tara Lipinski came along, Kwan's
triple toe-triple toe was state-of-the art. Now, it barely gets her
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to up the ante,'' Kwan concedes. ``I can't back down.
It's sort of like bidding for something at an auction. If you want
a piece of artwork, you have to be able to pay more than anyone
else. That's how I feel right now. I'm willing to pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kwan wants to win the Olympic gold medal in 2002 that eluded
her in 1998, she knows that she will have to land two triple-triple
combos and possibly a quad. Odds are, she'll have to do that even
to win the US trials.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who finished a startling seventh in her world debut last
year, was planning on doing two triple-triples here even before
Slutskaya used them to beat Kwan. ``She'd been doing them in
practice, so why not go for it?'', says Robin Wagner, Hughes's
coach. ``As I tell Sarah, why not be the first person to do it,
rather than having to be the chaser?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hughes can land both her combos Saturday night, she
still may not win. The 19-year-old Kwan, who's competing at her
eighth Nationals, has already won two world crowns. Her program
still has more easy speed, more flow and more maturity than that of
any of her ninth-grade pursuers and her elegant expression assures
her a line of 5.9 artistic marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gap that exists right now,'' Carroll says. ``If that
gap closes, you're in big, big trouble. But right now, there's
still a gap.''
</P>
<P>
   But gaps in skating are closing more quickly than ever as
younger skaters, with their disdain of limits, push the vertical
envelope. After Axel Paulsen landed the first single axel (named
after him) in 1882, it took 66 years before anyone landed a double.
After Dick Button did it at the 1948 Olympics, it took another 30
years until Vern Taylor landed a triple axel.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurt Browning landed a quadruple toe loop in 1988, it was
treated as a moonwalk. When Goebel did his three at Skate America,
it was considered a mere checkpoint. ``Where will it end?'' muses
US champion Michael Weiss. ``I don't know. I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The quad went from optional in the men's short program to
virtually mandatory in a blink. And a quad-triple in the long
program is now a must for a medal. ``Whoever wins the world
championship this year will do a quad and a triple axel-triple toe
in the short program,'' says Audrey Weisiger, Weiss's coach. ``And
he'll do a quad-triple and two triple axels in the long.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, three quads and the quad-triple-double are parlor
tricks, glimpses of Tomorrowland. ``Look at the people trying these
things,'' says Weiss. ``They aren't the world champion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kwan hadn't botched her program, doubling a pair of triples,
she probably would have beaten Slutskaya at the Grand Prix final.
Besides, Carroll claims, Slutskaya didn't land her unprecedented
triple lutz-triple loop cleanly. ``I don't want to put anybody
down,'' he says, ``But it would be interesting for you to look at
the combination on videotape in slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, Slutskaya will land it cleanly. And if she
or Kwan don't, it'll be Hughes or Sasha Cohen or Naomi Nari Nam or
one of the precocious juniors. ``Elizabeth Kwon is 13 and she's
bugging herself to do a triple axel and she wants to do it now,''
says Weisiger, her coach. ``Anybody who thinks you can keep doing
what you're doing forever . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Yagudin, the two-time world champion, isn't even the best
in his own country any more. Plushenko beat him at the Russian
nationals. And Weiss, the world bronze medalist, is under siege
from Goebel, who'll go for three quads again Saturday. ``Being safe
is very dangerous,'' Goebel says.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel was landing triple axels at 15. He was landing quads in
practice at 16. He can do a triple jump from a standstill. Goebel
could do four quads here, but he sees no need. ``Until everybody
else is doing four,'' he says, ``it's not worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, women don't have to do two triple-triples, either.
But if Hughes lands them here, they'll quickly go from optional to
mandatory. ``Once Linda Fratianne began doing triple jumps as
easily as the men, the other ladies had to do them, too,'' says
Carroll, who coached Fratianne to world titles in 1977 and 1979.
``There was no backing down.''
</P>
<P>
   By next year, a woman (more likely a girl), probably will land a
quad. And before long, a man will go for the quint using
essentially the same boot and blade that Button did half a century
ago. ``We've had the same skates for decades and decades,'' says
Weiss. ``Look what happened in speedskating when they went to clap
skates. Maybe we should go to spring skates. We'll be doing seven
and eight rotations.''

STARS TO PLAY NOTHING BUT A GAME SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing about this year's NBA All-Star Game is that Al
Green is singing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The second best is the jump meter.
</P>
<P>
   Once and for all, as TNT analyst Kenny Smith pointed out, the
public can see just how high the Raptors' Vince Carter gets above
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what the NBA All-Star Game is about _ individuality.
``It's going to be exciting,'' Smith said. ``Throughout the year,
it's all about the team. But the All-Star Game is the one time when
players can show people what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no way the jump meter can measure Doctor J's windmill or
Michael Jordan's double-pump leap from the foul line or Dominique's
self-pass off the backboard. Spud Webb had hops, too.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, his cousin and teammate Tracy McGrady, the Rockets'
Steve Francis, the Warriors' Antawn Jamison, Larry Hughes of the
76ers, and Jerry Stackhouse of the Pistons will take part in the
dunk contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participation has changed a lot over the years,'' TNT's Marv
Albert said. ``Some of the older players are very skilled but don't
want to be embarrassed by not performing as well. The dunk contest
has new meaning for the younger players. They have a new attitude.
They are planning to steal the show.''
</P>
<P>
   TNT will air the dunk contest and 3-point shootout Saturday at 8
p.m. with Albert, Mike Fratello, and Danny Ainge providing
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has the game Sunday, starting at 6 p.m., with Bob Costas,
Doug Collins, Jim Gray, and Ahmad Rashad doing the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Radio has All-Star weekend covered, starting 4 p.m.
Saturday with the game between this year's rookies and last year's
newcomers. Jim Durham and Jack Ramsey will call the rest of the
action, including the slam dunk and 3-point-shooting contests.
</P>
<P>
   Collins told reporters he didn't know what to make of Dennis
Rodman's return to the NBA with the Dallas Mavericks, except, maybe
to ``sell a few tickets.'' Collins said Rodman is nowhere near the
player he once was. ``He's slowed down, he has not played with the
new rule changes, he's not going to be able to to maul guys in the
post . . . and he's going to be matched up against Rasheed Wallace,
Tim Duncan, Karl Malone, Chris Webber, to name a few of the Western
Conference power forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A slam at McMahon
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is better than Leigh Montville. His take on CNN/SI
Tuesday night regarding the proposed football league by Vince
McMahon, the World Wrestling Federation promoter, was . . . well,
you be the judge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Can football really be played inside a steel cage, first team
to unlock the door wins the game? Will there be a team of
paramilitary neo-Nazi bad guys from, say, New York, playing a team
of steroid-filled farm boys from, say, Chicago? . . . Will a
folding chair be a part of each team's equipment? Will fire be
involved? Power tools? Will the coaches be geeks and braggards and
mysterious characters from who knows where? What, pray tell, will
the cheerleaders look like? Will the word `dominatrix' come to
mind? Will there be nefarious plots, skullduggery surrounding every
game, quarterbacks attacked in stadium parking lots by thugs
wielding ax handles . . . Will there be titles for everyone, every
week a championship belt on the line?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knight moves
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS college basketball analysts Al McGuire and Billy Packer have
known controversial Indiana coach Bobby Knight for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Bobby ever since college,'' Packer said. ``Of all
the people I've met, in or out of sports, he is one of the most
complicated guys I've ever been around. I would be the last one to
say I understand him. If I had a serious problem in life and I
needed someone to call, I know Bob Knight would be there. On the
other hand, if I'm at the top of my game, he is the one guy I
wouldn't want to be around because he would figure out a way to
shoot you down. I've seen him do things for people _ things he
doesn't want credit for _ which are as positive as anything anybody
could ever do. I've also seen him do things to people that are as
negative as anything you could ever do. That's who he is and you
have to accept him for that or totally reject him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight's 10th-ranked Hoosiers will be shown on CBS's national
game Saturday at 1 p.m., traveling to Michigan for a Big Ten
contest. Boston viewers, though, will see No. 4 Syracuse vs. UCLA,
with Gus Johnson and Bill Raftery providing commentary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whereabouts known?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TNT has a good special airing Feb. 16 at 10 p.m. As the title
suggests, ``Whatever Happened to Michael Ray'' takes a look at the
career of former New York Knicks All-Star guard Michael Ray
Richardson. The NBA banned Richardson for life after repeated
failed attempts at drug rehabilitation. Chris Rock narrates the
special . . . WGBH's Darren Duarte has a feature on legendary
boxing promoter Don King. The episode of ``Basic Black'' airs Feb.
17 at 8:30 p.m. Duarte talks with King about his murder conviction,
alleged connections with the Mafia, and cheating boxers out of
their money. Duarte also talks with King about his role in the
creation of the nation's exclusionary rule, which prohibits law
enforcement agents from illegal search and seizure . . . Here's a
second to New York Daily News sports media critic Bob Raisman's
idea of improving CBS's pregame NFL show. Raisman said CBS should
hire the four unemployed coaches _ Mike Ditka, Jimmy Johnson, Bill
Parcells, and Dick Vermeil _ and let them talk about the games
every Sunday. In one move, CBS could outfox Fox with four Super
Bowl coaches in offering analyses.

IN PLAIN TEXT, HERE'S HOW ATTACHMENTS WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: One of the pleasures we senior citizens have is
e-mailing pictures of our gorgeous grandchildren to each other. I
cannot open photos that carry an .MIM extension. When I try, my
system defaults to an Excel spreadsheet!
</P>
<P>
   _ Gramps
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GRAMPS: One of the pleasures we grizzled old veterans of
the Internet used to have was e-mailing bootlegged copies of
Wolfenstein 3-D and naughty pictures of Loni Anderson to each
other. Unfortunately, the way e-mail worked back then _ and the way
it still works _ made us jump through some hoops.
</P>
<P>
   In its simplest form, e-mail is no more than plain text
transmitted a character at a time. Put an A in here, get an A out
there. Programs and pictures are much more than simple text.
They're globs of bits and bytes, and if you try to send one as
though it were text, you get gibberish on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   But geeks are an inventive, if somewhat odd, lot. Before long
they had encoding schemes that could take a program file and
convert it into mailable text strings. As long as the recipient had
the decoder, the e-mail file could be reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   When you ``attach'' a picture to an e-mail, you're actually
asking the e-mail program to use its encoder to turn the file into
something that can be reassembled by another program.
</P>
<P>
   Most e-mail programs can handle decoding, but occasionally
you'll run into an incompatible one. The mail either arrives with
the coded stuff in the body of the letter or it will have an MIME
(multipurpose Internet mail extensions) attachment, the .MIM file
you described. In either case, free (or cheap) decoders abound.
WinZip, the file-compression utility, does a good job on .MIMs, or
you can go to a shareware site like www.hotfiles.com and search for
``MIME decoder.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Excel is caused by a bad file association. For
whatever bizarre reason, your computer thinks .MIM is a
spreadsheet. Dumb machine. The easiest thing would be to download
an image-file viewer like ACDSee 32 (www.acdsystems.com), which
associates itself with all types of graphics when it installs
itself.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently, I was made aware of tracking, or
leaving footprints when we visit a Web site. I'm told it's called
``cookies'' and that there is a way to prevent this. I would
appreciate not being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspicious
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SUSP: But if we couldn't track your every movement, then
how would we know when to deploy the black helicopters and send in
the shock troops?
</P>
<P>
   Look, cookies aren't so bad when you realize the incredible
amount of information you reveal by simply visiting a site. If you
want to see what a Web master knows about you, just go to
www.anonymizer.com and scare yourself silly.
</P>
<P>
   Most cookies are fairly benign. They're small files placed on
your computer when you visit a site so the operators know who you
are when you return. Maybe that means you won't have to type in
your name and address again, or it could mean somebody's counting
how many Britney Spears pictures you download. Each cookie is
different.
</P>
<P>
   To disable them in Internet Explorer, go to the Tools menu and
pick Internet Options. Click on the Security tab, then Custom
Level, then the Disable Cookies button. In Netscape, open the Edit
menu, go to Preferences, then Advanced. Click the Disable Cookies
thingie. Feel better?

AN INTERVIEW WITH `SALLY HEMINGS' STAR CARMEN EJOGO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use SUNDAY, Feb. 13 or thereafter) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sally Hemings, a house slave of mixed race at Thomas Jefferson's
Monticello plantation, in the past year and a half has become one
of the most talked about, yet least documented figures in early
American history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from a thin official record and a heavily fictionalized
script, Carmen Ejogo said she came very close to understanding the
woman she plays in the CBS miniseries ``Sally Hemings: An American
Scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ejogo said one of those moments came when Sally experiences the
harshest realities of slavery that she had been sheltered from as
Jefferson's mistress.
</P>
<P>
   In Tina Andrews' script, based in large part on Fawn Brodie's
1974 best-seller, ``Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History,''
Hemings had been caught aiding other households' slaves fleeing to
the north. A slave catcher recognizes her as the notorious woman
described in 1802 newspaper stories about the president's scandal,
and he whips her nearly to death and leaves her in the mud outside
a barn. Ejogo said that was her hardest day on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I went to the ground to take the position I would
hold for the next few hours, there was an immediate lack of control
of my emotions, which is not the best place to be in if you're an
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right emotions that were coming up, but I wasn't in
control of them at all. It was the closest I ever got to being and
feeling Sally in some odd way,'' Ejogo said. ``It was somehow
uncontrolled that day and I'm not sure for what reasons. It just
seemed to be a moment of absolute understanding and absolute
empathy ... If ever I felt less than human, it was at that point in
making this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-part miniseries was filmed in and around Richmond, Va.,
where a $1 million replica of Monticello in its various stages was
built. The slave quarters at Monticello, known as Mulberry Row, are
gone, but the nearby Tuckahoe plantation provided that setting.
</P>
<P>
   Ejogo, previously seen in the features ``Metro'' and ``The
Avengers,'' said she first toured Tuckahoe with director Charles
Haid a few weeks before filming began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into what was the kitchen area, and it smelled damp
and very alive,'' she said. ``Without wanting to sound wanky in any
way, it really felt during the entire process that there are
spirits of sorts on that ground that were with us, so for all of us
it felt very precious to have actually been able to film on ground
that had that piece of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of what had been and what had occurred on that
plantation was with us immediately, before we even started
filming.''
</P>
<P>
   Monticello was unavailable for filming because of the Thomas
Jefferson Memorial Foundation's policy of allowing only documentary
shoots on the property, but Ejogo, a Londoner born to a Scottish
mother and a Nigerian father, visited the estate to learn as much
as she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on a private tour to see parts of the house which
otherwise weren't accessible,'' she said. ``I went on the public
tour to hear what the guides tell the public at large. It was more
what they didn't address that was interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, going on Mulberry Row, which is now nothing more
than dirt, the terminology was `the people who used to work here.'
There was never really reference to slaves as such. It was slightly
softer than it really was.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a white actress in the cast asked in the gift shop for
books on Sally Hemings and was told by a clerk ``that really didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got that sense generally at Monticello,'' she said.
``They're terrified about preserving the name of Jefferson to the
point of denying what so obviously happened.'' Ejogo said she
understands, but she is disappointed that formal acknowledgment of
Jefferson's liaison with a slave ``somehow dirties his name ...
because it was circumstance that made this woman a slave.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Four college students killed in van wreck
 &HT;    By Gail K. Beil
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ Four Prairie View A&AMP;M students were killed and
six injured when their van flipped several timesThursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nine students and a coach were on their way to a track meet at
Arkansas State in Pine Bluff, Ark., in a rented Ford 350 van,
according to Department of Public Safety Trooper Sgt. Robert
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the first call from the Harrison County Sheriff's Dept.
at 6:54 p.m.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Troopers R.B. Buchanan and Gregg Greer said they arrived
to find the crumpled vehicle, resting on its top, with the five
passengers lying outside the vehicle and the 21-year-old driver,
Houston Watson, pinned inside the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland said he was unwilling to speculate as to the cause of
the accident, the speed of the vehicle or any extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``DPS has a accident reconstruction team for this region, and
they are on their way up here to take a look at the physical
conditions, map out and diagram what they find there, and talk to
the victims and bystanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland said it will take 30 to 60 days for them to finish
their report.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Watson of Greenville, Texas, Samuel Jason Sturns,
20, of Jasper, Texas, and Vernon Maurice James II, 18, of Vallejo,
Calif., were pronounced dead at the scene by Justice of the Peace
Hugh P. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Deshaun Jackson, 18, of Dallas died in LSU Medical Center
at 10:30 p.m. in Shreveport, La., after being airlifted from the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   One of those injured included former Marshall High track star
David Arterbery, 19. Arterbery and five others, including head
track coach Hoover Wright, 71, were taken to Marshall, where Wright
remains in serious condition in the hospital's intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other injured track team members are Rashad Shiniem
Shelton, 19, of Raywood, Tex., in critical condition at LSU; Lamar
Fitzgerald Adams, 35, of Vallejo, Calif., in stable condition at
Marshall Regional with minor injuries; Trenton Eugene Harris, 20,
Bloomburg, in stable condition at Marshall Regional with minor
injuries, and Lewis Cermaine Edmonson, 20, of Caldwell, at Good
Shepherd in serious condition with multiple injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Arterbery was in the middle of the center seat and asleep at the
time of the accident. He told his mother, Shirley Davis, that he
remembered very little of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is my face? How does my face look?'' he repeatedly asked
his mother last night while undergoing treatment last night she
said. She told him of a cut above his eyebrow, a knot on his head,
and other small lacerations on his face, she said.
</P>
<P>
   His little brothers Ray, 8, and Derrick, 13, waited impatiently
in the emergency room waiting area, Ray alternately brooding and
begging to see his much-admired older brother.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finally allowed to see David, he said his older
brother wanted to know how he was doing in the second grade, and
again asked about the condition of his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it was a little swollen,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to see him. My sister Andrea will be glad to see
him ,too. He's her favorite-est brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Trenton Harris' mother Shirley Harris said she had seen
television reports of the accident on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw, 'A track team from Prairie View,' I called
Trent's roommate,'' she said. ``He told me Trent was all right, and
in the hospital in Marshall.''
</P>
<P>
   After visiting with him before he was taken away for X-rays and
a CT Scan, she came out to the waiting room, where she was
comforted by relatives from Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris had a more difficult question to answer than the one
David had posed to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he asked me, I had to tell him that his other roommate,
Houston, didn't make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head is hurting and he's all cut up,'' she said. ``He told
me the van flipped 10 times. From the way he was talking, I think
he was in the front, but I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   At Prairie View, which is about 40 miles northwest of Houston,
students gathered at 10 a.m. for a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we are in a very somber mood,'' said Vice
President Larry Raab. ``And yet we have a very caring, loving
(atmosphere) in which all our students have come together.''

 &HT;    Wrong turns derail `Black Entertainment'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a ``documentary'' chronicling the contributions of
African-American performers in the 20th century, Showtime's ``It's
Black Entertainment'' proves that a good idea is also a terrible
thing to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by actress-singer-beauty queen Vanessa Williams, it's
meant as an homage. But the 90-minute show is a clueless and
confusing clip job that ultimately does a disservice to many of the
historical entertainers it claims to honor.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by recording mogul Russell Simmons, the program gamely
tries to squeeze in as many performers as possible by dividing them
into six genres: dancers, divas, rock and soul, male singers, jazz
and swing, and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a helpful device at first, and gives the
filmmakers enough latitude to include greats such as jazz composer
Duke Ellington along with unheralded unknowns like ``Crip'' Heard,
the one-armed, one-legged tap dancer from the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't work when it comes to multi-talented entertainers
like Josephine Baker or Dorothy Dandridge. These women defied trite
categories, and unless they could sing, dance, and act, they would
have never gotten work in an industry that considered them
second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another major flaw. Although Williams casually
mentions the issue of race and racism, it's almost an afterthought.
We are left to imagine how, or if, discrimination shaped the work
of Ella Fitzgerald or Jimi Hendrix or Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There are some memorable moments, however. Watching sepia-toned
film clips of dancers like ``Rubberneck'' Holmes, or listening to
Cab Calloway hi-de-ho-ing in a Harlem, N.Y., nightclub, or best of
all, seeing James Brown swiveling his hips in the 1965 ski bunny
movie ``Ski Party'' will make you feel better about paying for
premium cable.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not enough to save this show from itself _ and some
unpardonable excesses. Among the worst is Jamie Foxx, the WB sitcom
star who is one of several modern-day celebrities enlisted as a
cultural critic.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Eartha Kitt, the seductive songstress who
clawed and purred her way to stardom, Foxx says lustily: ``If I see
Eartha Kitt, I'm going right at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about Grammy-winning soul survivor Tina Turner? ``If I
ever see Tina, I'm hitting on it,'' Foxx says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's not entertainment. It's just stupid.

   __ A new study raises questions about the influence of
``vanishing veterans.'' __
</P>
<P>
   .....................................................
</P>
<P>
   Nestled within view of the Potomac River, the Pentagon is
flanked to the north and south by the Memorial and 14th Street
bridges, spans that connect the Defense Department with its
political patrons in Congress across the water on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not marked on any map is another link that also provides an
important connection between the two institutions: military
service. Lawmakers who have donned a uniform, especially those who
served in combat, are widely regarded as providing an important
bridge of understanding between the world of professional
politicians and the professional military.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 30 years, lawmakers from the World War II
generation have moved on, and the abolition of conscription has
resulted in fewer lawmakers who span the political-military divide.
This trend has caused handwringing and analysis for a few years by
many observers concerned that, with fewer veterans, the federal
legislature may not adequately oversee and guide the U.S. armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study by William Bianco, a political science professor
at Pennsylvania State University, concludes that military service
does not have a notable impact on a legislator's voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If the decline of military veterans in Congress is leading to
significant changes in defense policy, Bianco found, its effects
are indirect and generally through changes in legislative agendas
or in the quantity and kinds of information available to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the decline of lawmakers with military experience has
been much discussed, this study found that Congress now has an
unexpectedly low number of members who have served in the armed
forces compared to veterans in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Does military experience matter? ``I think that's a fair
question,'' Bianco said, in a recent interview. ``If you look at
what a lot of veterans are saying, they are very concerned that a
Congress without veterans would behave differently than a Congress
with veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco examined the trends of military experience in the House
and Senate from 1789 to 1999, closely looking at partisan
differences in military experience during the last century. He also
analyzed the impact of veteran status on select military votes
during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bianco concluded, ``The gross effect that veterans are going to
vote differently on military-affairs issues, broadly defined, just
doesn't show up in the data.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Vanishing Veterans: The Decline in Military
Experience in the U.S. Congress,'' found ``no evidence that the
absolute decline or emerging underrepresentation of veterans have,
by themselves, had a significant impact on the kinds of policies
emerging from Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper was co-authored with Air Force Lt. Jamie Markham, then
a Harvard undergraduate ROTC student, as part of a study conducted
by the Triangle Institute for Security Studies' ``Project on the
Gap Between the Military and Civilian Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran status, Bianco and Markham found, has ``at best a
modest'' impact on vote decisions and policy outcomes. This, the
authors argue, doesn't mean that the decline in the number of
lawmakers who have served in uniform has no impact on votes. ``What
it suggests is that this effect, if it exists, is primarily
indirect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianco acknowledged that this argument implies that by the time
a bill gets to the House or Senate floor for a vote, veterans are
forced to go along with non-veterans. ``But if the agenda was truly
being skewed one way or the other, you could expect veterans to
break away from non-veterans on most votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the only place you see that is on bills like the `don't
ask, don't tell' (policy on homosexuals in the military), and even
there the effect isn't shocking. It's not like all the veterans are
on one side of the issue and the non-veterans are on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinning of military veteran ranks in Congress has been
severe over the last 50 years. In 1971 more than 75 percent of
House members had military experience compared with 25 percent in
1999. The Senate has seen a similar decline, although it began
later and was a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the House and Senate over the last generation has
been more or less evenly divided among Republicans and Democrats.
However, the decline of lawmaker veterans of the military has not
been as dramatic on the committees that deal with defense issues,
which ``continue to have a high percentage of veterans,
facilitating their role as information suppliers,'' according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   This includes lawmakers on the House Armed Services, House
Veterans Affairs, Senate Armed Services and Senate Veterans Affairs
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, the two party caucuses have had roughly
the same percentage of military veterans. While Republicans have
generally maintained a slight advantage _ a few percentage points _
the study noted: ``Surprisingly, the largest differences are
observed in the contemporary Senate, where Democrats have a better
than 10 percentage-point advantage over Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger trend toward fewer lawmakers with military experience
may be viewed as a statistical correction, Bianco said, because for
decades during the Cold War, Congress had a higher percentage of
veterans when compared to the general population. And while Bianco
found that Congress today is underrepresented by those with
military experience compared to the general population, the
Congress of the early 1900s was even more so.
</P>
<P>
   With an all-volunteer, professional military, the number of
lawmakers who will have saluted a commander is expected to continue
to dwindle. Without universal conscription, Bianco found, an
individual with a high education level and high socioeconomic
status is less likely to serve in the military than one with less
education and lower income.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's happening in Congress,'' the Penn State professor
said, ``is that it's been drawing from the same group over time _
that group is much less likely to have served (in the military) in
the past, and much less likely to have served relative to the whole
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers with military experience certainly bring a unique
perspective and familiarity with many defense issues that Congress
must address. However, these veterans by no means have a lock on
what is required to understand the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this very cherished belief about how military service
educates people,'' Bianco said. ``They learn about getting together
with a group of people that you don't necessarily like and learn
about patriotism and shared sacrifice. And while I'm certain the
military does that for some people _ and you can get it other ways
too _ it's not inevitable. People don't all come out of the
military as egalitarian internationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An Air Force colonel told me that his feeling on this was that
two years of flipping burgers at an air base in Texas doesn't teach
you much about national security. We all make a big deal about Bill
Clinton not being a veteran. But remember,'' Bianco said, ``that
Sam Nunn, one of the most respected defense influentials of the
last generation, is not a veteran.''

<P>
   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.

   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the

you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.

   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the

   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.

   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already

<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

<P>
   Do you cower in your car when a tall sport utility vehicle
menaces you from behind, its headlamps reflecting from your mirrors
into your eyes? Your next vehicle may have mirrors that instantly
darken to block that glare. It could also have windows that go dark
on command, keeping the outside world somewhat at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Auto mirrors and glass may be on the brink of significant
change, thanks to the use of suspended particle devices, known in
the industry as SPD, which make it possible to control precisely
the amount of light passing through glass. Mirrors or windows that
use this technology instantly change from transparent to opaque,
and a driver could, in theory, brighten or darken them by twisting
a knob or pressing a button. The technology can be applied to
rear-view mirrors, inside or out, as well as to sunroofs, side
glass, rear windows and a new type of translucent plastic sun
visors.
</P>
<P>
   SPD mirrors darken instantaneously, in contrast to the
electrochromic mirrors now found in many medium- to high-priced
cars. Electrochromic mirrors have a coating that responds to a
slight electric charge. When a sensor detects the presence of
bright light, the charge darkens the surface of the mirror. The
process occurs gradually, especially for larger pieces of glass.
</P>
<P>
   SPD technology was refined by Research Frontiers Inc. of
Woodbury, N.Y., which holds several patents to the technology and
is licensing companies around the world to manufacture SPD flat
glass for residential and commercial use, as well as for automotive
mirrors and glass.
</P>
<P>
   The technology works like this: A material, liquid or film, is
sandwiched between two layers of glass or plastic. This material is
dark until a small electric charge is applied. When this occurs,
the suspended particles align themselves in a pattern perpendicular
to the glass, allowing light to pass through and lightening the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The voltage can be applied to the glass manually, using a
rheostat or a switch to control the level of lightening, or it can
be applied automatically by using light sensors. The brighter the
perceived light, the darker the glass, and vice versa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Research Frontiers' founder and chief executive, Robert Saxe,
traces the technology to a happy scientific accident, like the ones
James Burke celebrated in the PBS series ``Connections.'' This one
involves the accidental combination of dog urine and iodine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, a British chemist named Phelps, working with
a Dr. Herapath in his labs, noticed that a dog that had been fed
quinine bisulfate for an upset stomach had urinated in a tray
filled with iodine. The chemist discovered that green crystals
(known ever after as herapathite, after the doctor) had formed in
the tray and further discovered through microscopic study that the
crystals were able to filter light.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, in the 1930s, Dr. Edwin Land, the American
optical scientist who developed the Polaroid camera, came across
lab reports from the British experiments. He acquired a patent, but
even after mixing electronic and magnetic voltage with liquid
crystals, he was unable to create anything of commercial value. His
patent expired in 1951. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the 1950s, Saxe, then a physicist with Corning, became
interested in ``smart glass'' technology. At the time, Corning was
developing photochromic eyewear that darkens automatically in
bright sunlight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saxe heard about Land's earlier research on herapathite
crystals. After acquiring Land's patent for $168,000, Saxe and his
colleagues at Research Frontiers refined the light-filtering
technology into what is now called SPD, using microscopic
light-absorbing poly-iodide crystal particles that are suspended in
a layer of film.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Research Frontiers in 1965, and the company went
public in 1986. (``When you're doing something that's never been
done before,'' he said, ``you don't know how long it's going to
take.'')
</P>
<P>
   Research Frontiers recently signed an agreement with Global
Mirror of Germany, the world's largest supplier of mirrors for
commercial vehicles, to make SPD mirrors and translucent sun visors
for medium and large trucks. Saxe says the big truck mirrors will
be a good proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors using suspended-particle devices can change from light
to dark in less than a second. Competitive electrochromic mirrors
and glass take six seconds to change from fully clear to fully
dark, Saxe said, and do not darken uniformly.
</P>
<P>
   Saxe says that in real-world use, suspended-particle mirrors
will have a big cost advantage over electrochromic mirrors, partly
because they can use less expensive plastics instead of the glass
commonly used with electrochromic technology. SPD also uses less
electrical current, he said.

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping

   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access

CAMPAIGN SINS OF THE FATHER

<P>
   John McCain meets Willie Horton in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Even a crab apple.
</P>
<P>
   So the systematic attempt by the Bush machine to shove John
McCain into the sheepdip in South Carolina bears a distinct
resemblance to the low-blow tactics deployed for Bush the Elder by
the late Lee Atwater, the South Carolinian whose specialty was
trashing his bosses' rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater, whose religious conversion late in life was accompanied
by apparently sincere regrets over some of his brass-knuckle
tendencies, was the man who rolled out the attack ads against
Michael Dukakis in the '88 campaign. Ominous video fantasies of
assorted black and Hispanic convicts coming through a prison's
revolving door galvanized wavering voters into believing that
Willie or some other dark-hued rapist-murderer would be slicing his
wicked way through their screen door the minute Dukakis became
president.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it wasn't pretty, but it worked. Now it's George W. Bush
who's the candidate, and instead of the lawyerly Dukakis, it's
rough-and-ready John McCain who's being trashed by the Bush
political operation. After getting shellacked in New Hampshire by
18 points, Bush Junior decided to go negative in South Carolina,
assailing McCain as a fraudulent campaign finance reformer and some
kind of slippery Washington lowlife.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP establishment gagging at the prospect of a reformer
like McCain actually winning their nomination, the rubbishing of
McCain went into overdrive. McCain blamed Bush's heavy-handed
operatives for phone banks spreading lies about his record. Still,
the mugging continues. With $31 million to toss at his lone
remaining serious rival, Bush ignited a dirty ad war. Killing the
messenger of campaign finance reform fits right in with the
desperate attempt to resurrect the Bush candidacy for a lot of
special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The fear-spreaders in the gun lobby and the anti-abortion
business would lose their livelihood if McCain's proposed ban on
soft money became law. So the gun boys, and the consultants and
fund-raisers who live off the anti-abortion movement, are linking
hands with Bush to throttle the McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The clever lads telling Gov. Bush what to do and say know from
experience that negative campaigning depresses turnout, and lowers
the proportion of cross-over Democrats and independent voters who
might be attracted to McCain's Braveheart campaign. So the
avalanche of mud continues to roll. McCain fights back, but he has
a puny little shotgun, against the arrayed howitzers of the Bush
field artillery brigade.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth reconstructing the change of heart undergone by
Atwater, who died of a brain tumor after reflection on his
reputation as a rough-and-ready roustabout for the likes of Sen.
Strom Thurmond (R-SC) and Bush the Elder, whose presidential
campaign he managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reputation as a fierce and ugly campaigner has dogged me,''
Atwater said before he died. ``I didn't invent negative politics. I
am one of its most ardent practitioners.'' He publicly regretted
the tactics he employed for Bush Senior against Dukakis, for having
vowed to ``strip the bark off the little bastard,'' and ``make
Willie Horton his running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Atwater in Life Magazine: ``I am sorry for both
statements, the first for its naked cruelty, the second because it
makes me sound racist, which I am not.'' Replied Dukakis: ``He had
the courage to apologize. That says a lot for the man. My heart
goes out to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   There will no doubt be apologies aplenty at the GOP convention
this summer in Philadelphia, when the Bush and McCain forces are
obliged to bury the hatchet, or at least pretend to. But the rough
treatment in South Carolina and elsewhere resurrects the suspicion
in this writer's mind that the Bush clan will use low blows when
shoved against the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to horse McCain off the ballot in New York. The
low-turnout Delaware primary Bush just won was a joke _ the GOP
apparatus Bush controlled slashed the number of polling places from
260-plus to just 28, making a mockery of open-access rules. In
state after state, they are pulling bag jobs against McCain, whose
incendiary appeal to folks fed up with business-as-usual in DC
ignited this prairie fire.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday I became one of the thousands of Massachusetts
voters to re-register to vote as an independent, or ``unenrolled,''
so as to be in position to cast a rare (but not unique) vote for a
Republican presidential candidate. If you can't figure out which
one I'm for, you're not paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Bradley challenge to Al Gore is sputtering out. The
real action this season is in the GOP column. You don't have to
agree with John McCain on abortion (he's against it, except for
rape, incest and life of the mother) or Clinton (he's against
Clinton on most counts, except he supported the NATO war in Kosovo
and bravely commited publicly to supporting any deployment of
ground troops) to see in the Arizonan a rare combination of
character and life experiences.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get many chances to vote for a John McCain at the
presidential level. So you better take it while you can. If Bush
Junior's Let's-Raze-McCain approach snuffs out the crusade of the
man who vows to chase the money changers from the Washington
temple, we're all worse off.

   Christine Schoaff, executive director of the Libertarian Party

achieved ``major party'' designation by the Secretary of State's

7th. You Libertarians will have no less than six presidential
candidates to peruse, as well as state and town committee
candidates. Apologies for the omission.

<P>
   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (HELPFUL 500-WORD SIDEBAR FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

LIFTING THOSE PESKY TUB DECALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 13, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have tried just everything to get those anti-slip decals
off the bottom of my tub. Is there any easy or hard way?
</P>
<P>
   H. YOUNG, Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   A. If the decals are attached to the tub, that is, they are
plastic medallions, of a sort, glued to the bottom of the tub, here
is what you can do: Add enough water in the tub to cover the
strips. Add a cup of Mr. Clean or other heavy-duty detergent to the
water, and leave for an hour or more; the strips should rise to the
surface. If not, nudge them off with a wood spatula. Remove residue
with acetone.
</P>
<P>
   If the medallions are a part of the tub, and they are just
dirty, clean the tub this way: Add water to cover the bottom of the
tub, add a cup or two of Spic and Span, and wait an hour or so. If
that doesn't clean it, nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My hardwood floors are in great shape after many years,
except on high-traffic areas, where the finish is worn, sometimes
to the bare wood. Is it possible to refinish just those
high-traffic areas, without having to refinish the entire floor?
</P>
<P>
   D.S., Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it is possible, with caveats. The refinished area may be
lighter than the original finish, but that may even out over time,
as short as a few months. The second caveat is that the gloss of
the new area will be far greater than the original. But that too
will even out in time.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize these differences, confine the refinishing to entire
boards. If you can stop where parallel boards meet, all the better.
If you can't, the result will not be as satisfying but it might be
something you can live with.
</P>
<P>
   Sand the worn spots to the bare wood, sanding off any gray wood.
Sand the surrounding, partly worn area as thoroughly as practicable
but not to the bare wood. Then finish with two or three coats of a
high-gloss, oil-based polyurethane varnish. Or, use instead a
semigloss or satin varnish, but the high gloss wears better.
Sometimes, if you notice a big difference in color between old and
new, you can apply a light stain to the bare-wood areas before
varnishing.
</P>
<P>
   I have done this and was quite surprised at how quickly the
difference in shine and color literally disappears. That reminds
me, I have to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The gutters on my house are rusted. What is the best
treatment for this problem?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD CHIN, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. The gutters must be galvanized steel, and if the rusting is
widespread and severe, replace them with aluminum gutters.
</P>
<P>
   If the rust is not extensive, you can sand off the rust and
repaint the gutters, but this can be tedious, or expensive if it is
done by someone else. You have to sand off every trace of rust; if
not, the rust will bleed through the paint very quickly. However,
you can apply Rust Reformer, which is essentially phosphoric acid,
to any rust that remains; it turns the rust black and makes it
paintable. To paint, apply an exterior oil-based primer and finish
off with an oil-based house paint.
</P>
<P>
   If there are holes in the gutters and they are leaking, that is
another matter. If there is not a lot of rust, you can cover those
holes with an asphalt repair tape, which you can buy in a building
supply or hardware store. Or, this way: Smooth roofing cement over
and around the hole, then apply heavy-duty aluminum foil, and
another layer of roofing cement. This kind of patch can last for
years.

</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find studs behind a plastered wall? I found one in
a wall where I want to hang a lightweight cabinet 17 by 20 inches,
but I cannot locate a second stud. Besides, the hanging loops for
the cabinet are 12 inches apart. How can I hang that cabinet?
</P>
<P>
   A.H., Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First things first. There are many gadgets out there,
electronic and not, that locate studs magnetically or by detecting
mass. Many handymen swear by them, but this one does not think much
of them, mainly because (sob!) they never work for me.
</P>
<P>
   So, use your knuckle. Tap on the wall; tapping a hollow wall
will produce a hollow thump; tapping a stud will produce a solid
tock. Use a finish nail as a probe to determine the exact location;
drive in a nail; you'll know if the nail hits the stud. If the nail
drives in without effort, you've missed, so move the nail left or
right and drive it until it hits the stud. Once you locate one
stud, measure left or right 16 inches and you will find the second.
Fill any holes you made with joint compound for an invisible
filling.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you've located one stud, so drive a hook into it. For the
second hook for holding the cabinet, drive in a molly bolt; this is
a special bolt with an expandable sleeve around it. When you drill
a hole and insert the bolt, then turn the bolt in place, it expands
the sleeve and holds well in plaster or plasterboard walls. There
are many bolts on the market that are new versions of the original
molly bolt designed for hollow walls.

   A cork in the ocean, that has been New Zealand during the past
few years, bobbing around on the waves that rebound from Australia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand dollar has tumbled, the electorate has thrown
out its conservative government, and the stock market is becalmed
as the mania for global investing sails by.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanders have actually lost money in their market over the
past three years, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index has
surged almost 90 percent since December 1996. Even neighboring
Australia's stock index has climbed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As buyers snapped up telephone stocks around the world, Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand (which trades as an ADR on the NYSE) managed
only a 1.2 percent gain in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't discriminating against small countries here.
Enough Portugal Telecom stock has been bought to drive up its ADR
by 17 percent this past year.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's decision on Nov. 27 to vote in a new, left-center
government, led by Prime Minister Helen Clark, hasn't helped
matters. The currency lost more ground against both the yen and the
dollar, and foreign investors began demanding higher interest rates
from New Zealand borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Left-center governments such as those led by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have presided over
prosperity, and even Canada's Liberal Party, which has driven the
Tories nearly to extinction, enjoys a nice economy, so what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, not all left-center governments are the same,
especially in their relations with central banks. Independent
central banks are more trustworthy, and this calms inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prudently followed former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's advice to ``shut up'' and let Alan Greenspan do what he
wants. (The latter's success has been so grand that presidential
candidate John McCain suggests that if Greenspan dies we put
sunglasses on him, prop him up, and let him continue to run the
Federal Reserve!)
</P>
<P>
   Blair's first important official act was to grant the Bank of
England independence, so it could raise interest rates without
first begging politicians for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder's left-center German government, on the other
hand, hasn't been so wise, often butting into the European Central
Bank's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For this, and other sins, the market knocked down the value of
the euro by about 15 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clark's new government in New Zealand resembles
Schroeder's more than Clinton's or Blair's. The Labor Party and its
coalition partner (the Alliance) slammed the New Zealand central
bank during the election campaign, suggesting that money policy is
the root of all evil.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's first official act was to send her new finance minister
to persuade the excellent central-bank chief Donald Brash to loosen
up his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with a wishy-washy agreement to ``seek to
avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the
exchange rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly dangerous words, for the market would rather the
government keep out and let Brash do his job. Additional worries
about regulatory and tax policies add to the market's doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any good news? Well, New Zealand is hosting the
America's Cup this month. Also, the economy is actually recovering
nicely from the Asian flu it caught in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Growth should reach almost 3 percent this year, led by exporters
who look forward to shipping more lamb chops, lumber, and fish all
over the world. A cheaper currency should make such goods more
attractive to foreigners and spur the economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   If only the government would shut up, 2000 could be a pretty
good year. &QL;

A BACHELOR'S BIOLOGICAL CLOCK TICKS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Feb. 13) 
(jt) 
 By RICK MARIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all heard how women rounding 30 start yearning to
experience the joys of heavily sedated childbirth, how their little
genetic time bomb turns career-absorbed power gals into
mating-obsessed baby machines. Enough about them already!
</P>
<P>
   Coming up on 38, I, too, have longed for the pitter-patter of
little feet. I have tried to picture a crib in my crib. I have
coveted my downstairs neighbors' life, buying their baby boy the
Mr. Potato Head I never had. If my biological clock was ticking any
louder, they'd have to bring in Tom Cruise to &QL; 
defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes'' stopwatch in my head started a couple of
years ago. The words ``we're pregnant'' would invariably make me
think I needed to get moving on the family front. Other reminders
were the many ill-advised evenings spent with young women for whom
homework was still a fresh memory. So I traded up to more
age-appropriate mates. Turns out the big-time career ladies are not
dying to give up their weekly spa treatments for the sake of
passing down my genetic code and old hockey cards.
</P>
<P>
   I may be atypical of my gender, but I'm not alone. As many
successful women seem to be postponing having children, it is the
men pushing to pair off and procreate. Shrinks have told me they
hear it from male patients. Warner Brothers is developing a movie
adapted from a 1998 novel called ``The Daddy Clock.'' The author,
Judy Markey, writes in the voice of a sportswriter so
stereotypically macho you expect to find pizza stuck to the pages.
Except that the book's girly cover _ a little red heart, a stork
and male model running to catch the baby in its beak _ is
guaranteed to scare away any regular-guy readers.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, lady, if someone's going to write about this thing, she
ought to be a he. My book cover would be Harold Lloyd hanging off
that big silent-movie clock in terror of the long drop below. There
are enough of us out there with ticking tickers.
</P>
<P>
   I've discovered all kinds of would-be nurturing men looking to
persuade their high-powered wives or girlfriends to schedule some
maternity time in their Palm Pilots. A friend directed me to Jeff
Tittel, who is the director of New Jersey's Sierra Club and who
this week turns 43. He tells me he has been living with his
girlfriend for four years. She's divorced, with children, and won't
have more. He never married and now he wakes up and wants children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I didn't get into that old nuclear family
idea and I also traveled a lot for work,'' Tittel said. ``And now
I'm hitting the age where it becomes really critical in a way. Are
you going to have children or are you not?''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, the Tittel name dies with him. There will be no
one to pass on stories of his ``old-time lefty'' grandparents. ``I
used to say I'd only get married when I was ready to have kids,''
he said. ``Now I'm ready to have kids but can't in the relationship
that I'm in.''
</P>
<P>
   I felt for him, because my situation is nowhere near that dire.
My biological clock bit is partly a pose. I can safely go around
saying it's ticking because I have a commitmentphobic girlfriend
who isn't about to call me on it. If I really wanted children
pronto, I'd be issuing an ultimatum: give me kids or I start
shopping around. Which I'm not doing. Living together is good
enough for now. When I stop having to pick up her toys, then we'll
talk about Phase 2.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm a ``scorekeeper,'' as a friend once labeled me.
Children are one more measure of success to me, like an IPO or a
first novel. ``He's got two kids already,'' I berate myself.
``Where am I on this?'' A competitive-male thing, maybe. But I'm
sure many women feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Parenthood also seems like a reprieve from the self-absorption
of our Seinfeldian lives, a more worthwhile time investment than
dinner at Pastis and the latest Anthony Minghella film.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weekends ago, I was in Toronto, my hometown. I saw
an old friend's band play at their usual dive bar. The lead singer
is a Jim Morrison type with a few hit records to his name _ a star
of the local scene. He's one of those narrow-hipped bad boys that a
certain kind of woman can't get enough of. My age, 37, he still
looks impressively downtown and a little dangerous. The point is,
even this guy has a baby! A devoted father, no less.
</P>
<P>
   I know. Being a father isn't the same thing as being a man.
That's fine for high-school seniors, but I'm with Wordsworth on
this one: ``The child is father of the man.'' There's a little
voice in our heads that says manhood means producing a bambino.
Women might complain, rightly, that the male clock is more of a
midlife crisis than a biological imperative. We don't have a hard
deadline. Look at Saul Bellow, a proud papa at 85. What's the
hurry?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of aspiring fathers in their 30s and 40s don't see it that
way. They dread being ``old dads.'' Marilyn Graman, a New York
psychotherapist, said some of her male clients tell her they don't
want to be retired when their children are entering college. One
38-year-old thinks he's already ``too old'' to have a family, she
said, because ``he's worried he won't be able to play catch with
his son.'' This is probably the kind of guy who thinks installing a
projection-screen television counts as exercise.
</P>
<P>
   That same weekend in Toronto, it seemed children were
everywhere. I felt like Pee-wee Herman in ``Pee-wee's Big
Adventure,'' when his bicycle is stolen and suddenly everyone
around him is riding one, happy and laughing, while Pee-wee sits on
a park bench, alone.
</P>
<P>
   I visited my high-school friend David Eddie, a writer and
stay-at-home dad with two toddling lads under his charge. The
younger one had a big round head like a ``South Park'' character. I
pushed his stroller though the park, while Dave tried to coax the
3-year-old out of a whiny mood. This was the dark side of
parenting, I was told: truculence and sleep deprivation and ``Blues
Clues.'' None of it dampened my desire.
</P>
<P>
   Dave was always a resolute bohemian, seldom far from debtor's
prison. Hardly seemed like daddy material. But his wife saw it in
him, and now he's got two more than me. This was like someone who
doesn't even like tennis getting players' box seats to the U.S.
Open. Seeing Dave in action was, in a way, heartening. One look at
him and I thought, If he can do it ...
</P>
<P>
   Plus, my dad was 48 when I was born. That gives me 11 years.
Right?

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the stock market into a correction poses its own danger.
Pricking the market bubble could set up a negative feedback loop.
Falling stock prices could undermine consumer confidence and
spending, slowing the economy and depressing stocks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead are shaping up as the biggest challenge the Fed
has faced since the global financial crises of August and September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's financial markets almost reached
meltdown, but the Fed took decisive action to head off that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the Fed right now might be tougher than that
one. In 1997, it had a good blueprint for heading off a financial
crisis. In 2000, it isn't clear what the bankers should do.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, should be able to track the response to the
Federal Reserve's action or inaction very precisely. From last May
through December, the bond market was stuck in a trading range:
Whenever bond investors got nervous about inflation or the dollar,
they would send bond prices down far enough to take yields up to
about 6.3 percent on the 30-year U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   That yield was always attractive enough to bring new buyers into
the market _ and their money would drive the yield back to about 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks of the year, though, bond yields pushed
through the previous top and reached 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, in 2000, bond yields move up but establish a new trading
range not too far above the one of 1999, investors can then
conclude that the Fed's policy is draining money out of the economy
at a rate that's neither too fast nor too slow.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the bond market hasn't settled into a trading range
in January _ or if it shoots up before showing signs of settling _
then the danger that the Fed has overreacted one way or another has
increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, running the world's most powerful central bank is
really no fun at all. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the stock market into a correction poses its own danger.
Pricking the market bubble could set up a negative feedback loop.
Falling stock prices could undermine consumer confidence and
spending, slowing the economy and depressing stocks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead are shaping up as the biggest challenge the Fed
has faced since the global financial crises of August and September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's financial markets almost reached

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using Jarrett's software and checking all 44 of the 30-year
periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical
performance 64 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are
virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we'll probably do better accumulating money than we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, we'll probably do worse in retirement, so spending
needs to be managed with great care. &QL;

composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL;

   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>

   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL;

   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.

</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.

<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the

</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.

TRUTH PLAYS A MINOR ROLE IN `SALLY HEMINGS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson is the U.S. ambassador in Paris when he gets a
gander at Sally Hemings, his newly arrived slave from Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   And promptly decides that what this teenage head-turner really
needs is some good mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instincts tell me that you have a good mind, worth
mentoring,'' Jefferson (Sam Neill), a widower, tells Sally (Carmen
Ejogo).
</P>
<P>
   So Massa Tom mentors the bejeepers out of Sally until her
nightie happens to drop one night as she's sitting on her cot.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes widen, he plants a wet one on her bare shoulder and,
oops, time for CBS to cut away for a commercial, the better for
viewers to be mentored.
</P>
<P>
   With that, ``Sally Hemings: An American Scandal,'' which airs
Sunday and Wednesday, is off and running in its partly true, mostly
fanciful exploration of, uh, history.
</P>
<P>
   All the mentoring lasted for 38 years and, apparently, seven
children. Last month, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation
finally acknowledged ``compelling'' genetic evidence that Hemings
bore the children of the third president and the writer of the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   It's a juicy historical fact, given Jefferson's conflict over
the institution of slavery, his expressed alarm over the prospect
of racial mixing and his famous authorship of the line that all men
are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   The facts don't go far. Though Jefferson's relationship with his
attractive servant created a scandal during his lifetime, details
about the affair and about Hemings herself are frustratingly
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   But then, TV has never let the facts, or their absence, get in
the way of a good story. And the CBS two-parter _ pulpy,
pot-boiling and fat with flaws _ is undeniably alluring for a
nation obsessed with race and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Thomas Paine, visiting Paris and imparting a little
common sense as he checks out Sally at a royal ball and asks
Jefferson, ``What are you waiting for?'' Not much; moments later,
Jefferson is dancing nose to nose with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Jefferson, the morning after Sally dropped her nightie,
clearing his throat awkwardly and saying um, about last night ...
and Sally locking lips with him before he can finish the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Jefferson, stepping out the front door at Monticello just
as Sally's first baby _ vanilla white _ is being lofted for all the
slaves to see, and then quietly retreating inside.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Hemings, in what becomes a continuing theme, admonishing
President Jefferson that ``you cannot come to my bed, then go to
your white Congress and do nothing about the plague on my people.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Sally's brother, James (Mario Van Peebles), angrily
vowing that ``I'm gonna kill one'a these white folks,'' and then
blowing his own brains out instead.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Jefferson's daughter Martha (an always irate, and
irritating, Mare Winningham), by his first wife, imploring her
father to ``sell her, Papa, sell her!''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Sally being lured from the safety of Monticello and being
horsewhipped by vicious whites, as if to layer a bit of
``Roots''-style racial brutality into ``Sally Hemings.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's a visitor noting, as viewers will too, that
Monticello seems to be ``crawling with white slaves.'' They're the
children of Jefferson and Hemings, all played by whites.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that the two leads in this all-American sudser
are played by foreigners. Neill is a New Zealander; Ejogo, a beauty
who was in the film ``Metro,'' is English, of Scottish and Nigerian
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Neill ambles through the miniseries like some perplexed sitcom
dad, high-minded but scolded constantly by the women in his life.
He never fully professes his love for Hemings but doesn't deny it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   He walks away from crises. He frees his children by Hemings and
yet never openly embraces them as his own. This Jefferson seems to
deflect embarrassing questions by regarding all at Monticello as
his ``children'' _ until, crippled by debt, he sells most of his
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a feeble depiction of one of the most brilliant
men of his millennium, though viewers do at least get a pungent
taste of the contradictions in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ejogo is a more arresting Sally. She certainly has the looks to
make Jefferson's sexual attraction understandable. But she also
injects tenderness into the older Sally, free to leave Monticello
but unwilling to spurn the increasingly enfeebled man she genuinely
loves.
</P>
<P>
   Diahann Carroll is Sally's forbearing mother, Betty Hemings; one
sidelight involving her is that Sally was actually the half-sister
of Jefferson's first wife. And Rene Auberjonois chews props,
scenery and costumes as a snaky journalist _ he really existed _
who tries to blackmail Jefferson into a political appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Auberjonois couldn't have hung around a little longer.
He could have been chewing makeup, too. Intended to age the
characters in the second half of the miniseries, the stuff is
practically sliding off faces. Maybe the makeup department needed
some proper mentoring.

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     CHEAPER DEFENSIVE PLAYS HELP 49ERS MEET SALARY CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Faced with a daunting salary cap overrun of $24
million when the season ended, the San Francisco 49ers nevertheless
managed to get under the cap limit of $62.172 million by Thursday's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   They made it with more than four hours to spare. This they
accomplished by waiving 12 players, restructuring the contracts of
14 more and accepting the retirements of two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of hard work, planning and researching _ all
that we did in order to meet our obligations to the league,''
general manager Bill Walsh said in a statement. ``We will miss the
players who are gone and appreciate that many others have stepped
forward and were willing to restructure their contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroes of the cap nightmare include Chris Dalman, Steve Young,
Bryant Young, Ken Norton and Ray Brown, who re-did their contracts
to save the club a whopping $13 million. Individually, Dalman saved
the 49ers $3.72 million, Steve Young $3.050 million, Bryant Young
$2.9 million, Norton approximately $2 million and Brown $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, the 49ers said they are now $492,901 under
the salary cap, but that did not include the savings from the new
contract for Young, the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching compliance with this year's salary cap, the 49ers
perpetuated a practice that got them in trouble in the first place,
that of converting high salaries into signing bonuses that are then
prorated over the length of the contract, even if the player is no
longer with the team.
</P>
<P>
   For example, departed 49ers such as Merton Hanks ($2.035
million), Chris Doleman ($1.9 million), Lawrence Phillips
($212,500) and Mark McMillian ($200,000) will count against the
salary cap this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have said before, for us to get full control of our
salary cap situation, it is going to be a three- or four-year
process,'' Walsh said. ``This was a difficult step to take, but we
feel we are heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   In their various moves to get under the salary cap, the 49ers
intend to rebuild on defense. Four defensive players who started
the Sept. 11 opener in Jacksonville were waived: strong safety Tim
McDonald, outside linebacker Lee Woodall, defensive end Marvin
Washington and cornerback Darnell Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two underachieving defensive starters, end Gabe
Wilkins and linebacker Winfred Tubbs, were retained after signing
more cap-friendly contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up playing every down this year _ first, second, and I
even stayed on the field on third down,'' Woodall said. ``I
question the move there. A person ends up playing every down and
ends up released for cap reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodall said the main problem for the 49ers last season was pass
defense, or lack of it. They ranked 31st and last in the category.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas they need to work on,'' he said. ``If you have
a weak spot in this league, believe me, teams will seek and destroy
it.''

A BACHELORETTE FEARS MAKING A COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 13) 
(EDS: See also TICKING-CLOCK-MEN) 
(jt) 
 By ILENE ROSENZWEIG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a cocktail reception at the Museum of Television
and Radio recently, I lived the dream of many single women my age:
meeting Mary Tyler Moore. She was being honored on the eve of
``Mary and Rhoda,'' her TV-movie reunion with Valerie Harper, which
was broadcast Monday night on ABC. I went to ask a few questions
about Mary Richards _ the heroine of ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show''
and mine, too _ in search of the meaning of single life.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that we were both wearing pink cashmere twin sets,
Moore said something surprisingly heavy: that the prim, peppy,
unmarried TV Mary was the real Mary's chance to play out her own
fantasy. ``I was 18 when I married, 19 when I had a child,'' she
said. ``Such a mistake. A woman can't be passionate about a career
and also be a passionate wife and mother. You can't have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. So while I was copying Mary Richards' scarf-tying
techniques on my little sister, Mary Tyler Moore was wishing she
could live the life I live now in my 30s. Little wonder I'm so
reluctant to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Commitment issues. It's still widely held that men are the ones
who have them, who need to be cattle-prodded to the altar. But
there are, in fact, many women, like me, who get seasick when
thinking about taking the plunge in the white dress. They cling to
bachelorettehood as strongly as many men do to their singleness.
And for many of the same reasons. We cherish freedom, independence,
the illusion of youth. I call it the Peta Pan syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In Melissa Bank's best-selling collection of stories, ``The
Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' the heroine's romantic quest
includes doomed relationships with an underemployed jet-setter and
a man old enough to need Viagra. What's the author's explanation?
``Women choose commitmentphobic men in order to hide their own
commitmentphobia,'' Bank said on the phone last week. That was my
strategy when I was in my 20s: falling for emotionally unavailable
men who went catatonic when asked to talk about the future. But
now, I'm in a solid, sunny relationship with a 37-year-old guy, and
it has cast a blinding light on my commitment issues.
</P>
<P>
   I have always seen marriage, children, etc., as an ending rather
than a beginning. To me, single life has always been about
protracted adolescence _ without a curfew, parking at inspiration
point, midnight steak dinners out with the boys. Marriage means
sensible behavior and short hair.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Gurley Brown, another godmother of the single girl I
consulted last week, put it this way: ``You're no longer the free
spirit, the gamine, the elfin creature.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriages advertised on television night after night don't
help. All that sexual frustration and bickering leavened with
toothpaste humor, endless variations on the nuptial hell of
``Married With Children.'' Where are the high-living, fun-loving
marriages? Couplehood in the '90s was defined by ``Mad About You.''
Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt schlumping around an airless apartment
in their sweat pants. Now on Fox's hot new family sitcom, ``Malcolm
in the Middle,'' the mom is so zanily busy she answers the door
topless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, pop culture teems with paeans to single life,
from ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Sex and the City'' to Helen Fielding's
``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' whose sequel is due from Viking this
month. And yet, these supposed celebrations of single life focus on
heroines whose central plight is finding Right. The idea that deep
down they may not really  &UR; want &LR;  to trade in their fabulous fashions
or sexual high jinks and ``settle down'' never even comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just picky,'' said Darren Starr, the executive
producer of ``Sex and the City,'' unwilling to acknowledge that his
four female characters might not be ready to commit.
</P>
<P>
   Men can be rogues, rakes, playboys or what ``Sex and the City''
calls ``toxic bachelors.'' But there is no word for women who like
to gallop just out of reach. ``I don't think we're far from the
toxic bachelorette becoming a stereotype one day,'' Starr said.
``But none of our girls is yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it is now more socially acceptable to stay single longer.
But the assumption remains that women who do so are either
obsessive ``career gals,'' as my grandmother would say, or unable
to throw an effective lasso. And it's not just daughters of broken
homes for whom married life carries unpleasant associations. My
mother and father divorced when I was 5, but some of my most
commitmentphobic friends have happily married parents. One is
married now but still makes telling slips when she introduces her
husband as her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the culture has been pushing single and married life
even further apart. As Bank pointed out, ``Single life has been
more sexualized, and married life has been undersexualized and
desexualized. It's all children and chores and balancing. I think
on some level, neither is really true.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Being husband and wife didn't always mean sacrificing all sense
of style or your interest in the world beyond your Upper West Side
apartment. It was once portrayed as something sophisticated and
elegant to aspire to: the Tracy-Hepburn model in ``Adam's Rib,''
where intellectual battles were served up with the newspapers and
croissants on a breakfast tray. Or the ``Thin Man'' movies: Myrna
Loy and William Powell mixing good manners and bad habits. A
marriage fueled by murder cases and martinis might not have been
realistic, but it instilled a hope of shared adventure and high
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   A single woman looking for motivation nowadays would do better
taking examples from real life. Husbands may no longer be necessary
for financial support, but they're not quite obsolete. Behind many
of the high-profile, hard-charging women these days is a man who
acts as emotional and professional pillar. ``He can help you with
your career,'' said Helen Gurley Brown, who has been married 40
years. ``A man can be quite supportive. We doubt Hillary would be
running for office if it weren't for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mary Tyler Moore party, Barbara Walters, who has been
married twice, offered this advice: ``You don't have to marry to
get money, to have children, to have sex. You have to marry for
love, which is the hardest thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The power wife ideal does allay some of my fears of having to
surrender all identity after saying ``I do.'' I do appreciate some
of the charms of couplehood. My spousal equivalent and I live
together and have even bought real estate together. We share the
domestic duties I've always dreaded as wifely. I cook. He
rearranges my closet _ hey, Cary Grant did that for Dyan Cannon _
and takes the clothes to the dry cleaner. Though my life runs far
more efficiently than it did when I was on my own, I was still
having trouble grasping the upside of making it all legally
binding.
</P>
<P>
   No one, even me, wants to end up old and alone, but that hardly
seems like grounds for marriage. In need of some remedial
attention, I called Sue Sim-ring, a psychotherapist, who with her
husband, Steven Sim-ring, a psychiatrist, wrote ``Making Marriage
Work for Dummies'' (IDG Books Worldwide, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to do with wanting to stay a child,'' she said,
``and not realizing that by giving up certain privileges you get a
lot in return. Sometimes that's hard to see.'' Like what?
</P>
<P>
   Sim-ring, who has been married 30 years, continued: ``What's
hard to understand is the sense of meaning and joy and satisfaction
and comfort that comes from a committed relationship when you
really do take responsibility for another person over time. You
develop an exceptionally high level of intimacy and trust that you
don't get from just living together. But it does mean giving up
that vision of yourself as someone who's young and dating and free
and all that, because you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, she had the right psychology for an arrested
adolescent, piquing my curiosity by telling me about the special
grown-up privileges in store. Sim-ring even managed to make it
sound kind of romantic, as if the sacrifices were noble, and would
take you to a higher plane of love.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm going to make it after all.

A CAR FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mazda Millenia is a vehicle whose time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this is the new millennium, right? So what better time
could there be to produce a special Millennium edition of the
Millenia car, Mazda's flagship sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this special designation will help rescue this
outstanding vehicle from the depths of obscurity. The Millenia
(yes, the misspelling is correct), introduced in 1995, has been
perhaps the most overlooked premium sedan on the planet since its
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The car was designed to be the first offering of Mazda's planned
separate luxury-car division, which was to be named Amati. But the
recession of the early '90s and Mazda's own financial difficulties
forced the company to abandon plans for the separate division,
which would have been similar to Toyota's Lexus and Honda's Acura
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But because Mazda's U.S. and Japanese designers already had
designed the Millenia, Mazda chose to introduce it as the company's
high-end sedan for the U.S. market. Unfortunately, sales have been
flat from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   For a car that is every bit as good as a Lexus ES 300 or
Infiniti I30, that's curious, but explainable. First, Mazda has
done little to promote the car, and second, people who are shopping
for luxury cars like Lexus, Acura and Infiniti expect to find them
in separate showrooms and/or dealerships where there are only
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Someone looking to buy a $25,000-$32,000 car just doesn't
normally gravitate toward a Mazda dealership, where the base
Protege sedan sells for under $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because this is a car that would sell itself if
potential buyers would just give it a chance. Even in base form,
with a sticker price of $24,995, the Millenia has a lot to offer _
power, luxury, lots of amenities and a fun driving experience. It
comes with a 170-horsepower V-6 engine, four-speed manual
transmission, power-everything, and four-wheel antilock brakes,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   But the value increases exponentially when you upgrade to the S
model, which lists for $29,995, or this year's special Millennium
edition, at $30,995. (Prices for the base and S models have been
dropped $1,750 and $1,250, respectively, for 2000 to try to
increase sales.)
</P>
<P>
   The S model and the Millennium edition have all the amenities of
the base version, plus Mazda's revolutionary Miller-cycle
supercharged 2.3-liter, 24-valve V-6 engine, rated at 210
horsepower. This award-winning engine uses delayed intake-valve
timing and a Lysholm compressor to deliver the power of a larger
engine with the fuel economy of a smaller one. The result is plenty
of zip, but with excellent EPA fuel-economy ratings of 20 miles per
gallon in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the Millennium edition with this special engine, and
found it to be a real driver's car, like a BMW or Audi.
Acceleration is brisk, especially on take-off, and road handling is
quite sporty, with the car hugging the curves. There is room for
five adults, and the trunk is fairly roomy for a midsize sedan,
with 13.3 cubic feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium model will have a limited production run of just
3,000 units for the U.S. market, and is available in two exclusive
colors, highlight silver mica and Millennium red mica. Other
special features include 17-inch chrome alloy wheels,
charcoal-colored synthetic suede seats and door trim, unique
woodgrain trim panels, six-disc in-dash compact-disc changer,
leather-wrapped shift and handbrake levers, and special Millennium
Edition exterior badging and interior markings.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on all Millenias includes front bucket seats
and rear bench seat, automatic transmission (sorry, no manual is
available), leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control,
automatic climate control, 16-inch alloy wheels, AM/FM/CD/cassette
audio system, remote keyless entry, fog lights, eight-way power
driver's seat and dual air bags.
</P>
<P>
   The S model adds leather seating surfaces, electronic traction
control, 17-inch alloy wheels, power moon roof, eight-way power
passenger's seat and a BOSE audio system.
</P>
<P>
   The Millenia rides on a four-wheel multi-link independent
suspension, and comes with variable-assist power rack-and-pinion
steering. In addition to its standard air bags, safety features
include front and rear crumple zones, side-impact door beams and
special reinforcing boxes beneath the rear seat cushion to help
protect the occupants in a side impact. Side air bags are not yet
offered.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with one option: the four-seasons package
($300), which added heated front seats, heavy duty windshield-wiper
motor, windshield-washer fluid-level indicator light and large
capacity reservoir, heated outside mirrors and a heavy-duty
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $31,745, including $450 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 18 gallons of gasoline, and premium unleaded is
recommended.

 &HT;    WRESTLING GRAPEVINE
 &HT;    By John Allen

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's that time again _ dog show time. That means no
``Raw is War'' at 9 p.m. on USA, and a golden opportunity for
``Nitro'' to get a foot back in the door of the Monday night
ratings war. Of late, ``Raw'' has more than doubled ``Nitro's''
ratings. But this Monday ``Nitro'' is expected to call out all the
big guns _ Hulk Hogan, Sting, Ric Flair and Bret Hart. But some of
the excitement is gone as Hogan and Flair have appeared in recent
shows and it looks like Hart (post-concussion syndrome) will not be
able to show unless he drives from his home in Calgary to Long
Island for the show. And where would Sting fit in? Maybe the WCW
should have a Lex Luger-Hogan match, have Hogan get injured and
Sting come down and make the save. Then they could get Sting, not
Hogan, into the pay-per-view on the 20th against Luger.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Super Brawl, the WCW could have a very surprising
debut. WCW.com is reporting that the WCW is in negotiations with
ECW franchise Sabu. Reports on the internet say Sabu is signed with
ECW through 2003, but that would be surprising since most ECW
performers do not have contracts. We'll find out Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   One WCW feud may lose its fire before it takes off _ DDP vs.
Buff Bagwell. Bagwell injured his neck a week ago and DDP injured
his back on Friday. Both could be on the shelf for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   New, hot Website of the week is www.readytorumble.net, the
official Website of the new WCW 3movie ``Ready To Rumble.'' The
movie is scheduled for release on April 14. The site features
photos taken on the set, video clips, a detailed description of the
plot, and even a section devoted to the WCW wrestlers and Nitro
Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Injury problems that have haunted Eddy Guerrero since his major
car accident in 1998 struck again last week. In his first ring
action for the WWF, he dislocated his elbow while trying to perform
a frogsplash. It is estimated he's out of action anywhere from six
weeks to three months.

 &HT;    WWF and WCW shun midget wrestling, but it thrivesBy Kevin Braun
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The era of Sky Low Low may be over, but that doesn't mean the
little people have left the building. Just ask Tiny the Terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the ability to make people feel uncomfortable,'' said
Tiny, the midget champion of Northeast Wrestling. ``When you have
that power, people don't want to test you.''
</P>
<P>
   Little people aren't featured in the two major wrestling groups,
the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling,
but regional associations such as Northeast still use them.
Northeast, which promotes matches in New York, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey, features little people
in about three-fourths of the shows, said president Michael
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe Vince McMahon and Turner are missing the boat on
them a little bit,'' said O'Brien. ``They are a very big draw, and
they get as big a reaction as some of the big-name WWF stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, whose real name is Doug Tunstall, would say ``amen'' to
that. ``If Vince McMahon gave me an opportunity to go in front of
an audience,'' he said, ``I guarantee I'd have a nation screaming
my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Sky Low Low had a nation _ the wrestling nation, anyway _
screaming his name from the 1940s to the 1970s. He and his
contemporaries _ the likes of Little Beaver, The Haiti Kid, Fuzzy
Cupid and Little Tokyo _ were known as the ``Mighty Midgets.'' They
were semi-regulars on TV wrestling shows and showed up on the live
cards as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Low Low, whose real name was Marcel Gauthier, died in 1998
at age 70. He may have been the most recognizable midget wrestler
because of his bald pate.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Sky Low Low's era, midgets (the term used then, as
opposed to the currently correct ``little people'') were in the
ring mostly for comic relief: to give the fans a few laughs and
give their frayed vocal cords a rest. That's not the sole mission
now, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys that we use, they don't go through the referees' legs
and bite their butts. They do some funny, comedic stuff, but at the
same time they're using wrestling moves, suplexes, jumping off the
top rope with elbows. They are unique, but they also show some
athleticism.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens after the little people's matches isn't always
serious, though. Sometimes the loser has to sit in a high chair. In
one case, Tiny lost a match and had to put on a blue dress. Even
so, he and O'Brien draw a distinction between the match itself and
the consequences for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that seems to demean little people must be approached
carefully. About a decade ago, there was an outcry over the fad of
``dwarf bowling,'' in which little people wearing helmets played
the role of the bowling ball. There was no similar backlash against
little people competing in the ring, but nevertheless, wrestling
opportunities for little people have diminished since.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Byrne, the senior vice president of marketing at the WWF,
said there are no little people under contract now. The same goes
for WCW, said a source who wished to remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a function of novelty,'' Byrne said. ``For now, the
audience has lost its appetite for that specific novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Byrne, ``Little people do find their way into our
story lines. We look at virtually every performer in the same way,
and that is, can they deliver? Are they entertaining? Are they
fun?''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, who has no doubt about how he'd answer those questions
about himself, begs to differ with Byrne. ``You don't really need a
story line,'' he said. ``Just throw them in there. You want to see
how the crowd reacts. You gotta give the shock first, then let it
trickle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny's held the championship a few months; he won the belt from
an opponent named Half Nelson, who is actually his brother Jason.
Now they often wrestle as a tag team: the Low Blow Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``His brother's the better athlete, but Tiny has the better
personality,'' O'Brien said. ``He's more of a showman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, 32, has his sights set on more than wrestling. He's
majoring in television production at the Community College of Rhode
Island. He's made some guest appearances on ``The Jerry Springer
Show'' and is set to appear in a Jim Carrey movie, ``Me, Myself and
Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny said he's been involved with athletics since he was about
5. He participated in Pop Warner football, playing running back and
outside linebacker. When he was a teenager, he said, he saw Sky Low
Low wrestle and got to meet the midget star afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought me a ginger-flavored brandy,'' Tiny recalled. ``He
probably thought I was about to try to rob him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Tiny acknowledges the influence of Sky Low Low and
his contemporaries, he clearly was not in awe. ``I shook his hand
and thought, `Now I'm ready for the midget championship.'''

 &HT;    ANALYSIS: WWF and football?
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ World Football League (1974-75).
</P>
<P>
   United States Football League (1982-84).
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Football League (1993-95).
</P>
<P>
   Those are the headstones for three groups who tried and failed
to gain a foothold in the U.S. professional football market over
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   All have tried different ways to squeeze something out of the
lucrative football market _ playing in the spring, summer and fall;
major television contracts, no television contracts; rich owners
and poor owners, but nothing has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Enter World Wrestling Federation head honcho Vince McMahon. Last
week he announced that a year from now, he will begin play in his
football league, the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-team league will play a 10-game schedule starting in
February and ending in April. Teams will be formed in New York, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Orlando with two more
sites to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   And just as he did with wrestling, McMahon hopes to take the
football fans behind the scenes and keep it raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a league for pantywaists or sissies,'' said McMahon
at the press conference. ``This isn't going to be an overregulated,
oversanitized type of ball.''
</P>
<P>
   While he says the results will not be scripted, some are
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll fail miserably if it plans to compete with the NFL,
using real rules, real players,'' said Ryan Schinman, marketing and
advertising president of investment bank CNB Capital. ``If McMahon
decided to make this entertainment _ a show loosely based on
football where they don't wear helmets and there are females in the
league _ then it could work.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may not push that far, McMahon can look to the
success of Oliver Stone's recent football film, ``Any Given
Sunday,'' for some guidance.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon expects to have all the grunts, groans and curses of the
football pile caught on audio and video tape with helmet cams.
Coaches and locker rooms will be wired with microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Of course none of this will come to any good without a
television contract and there McMahon could use the popularity of
his wrestling shows to make a difference. USA Network, which
broadcasts ``Raw is War'' on Monday night, will be interested. They
televised World League of American Football games. No one watched
those games in the 1990s and networks would like to find a way to
keep cable's most popular show, ``Raw,'' beyond its current 2001
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, UPN, which is home to WWF's ``Smackdown'' on Thursday
nights, could also be a suitor. An outside shot goes to Fox, which
has taken televising NFL games to a new level. They are also
looking for new programming and have had talks with various people
about acquiring a wrestling show.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some current and former athletes and coaches who might
work well with the XFL:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Greene _ Just retired, but is no stranger to the
wrestling ring and once tried to choke his coach on the sidelines
</P>
<P>
   _ Deion Sanders _ Cowboys don't want him, XFL would love him, he
could preach on the sidelines and design the team's uniforms with
his flair for fashion.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Rocker _ He knows how to run out of the tunnel... now
this would be a real punishment by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Tyson _ Bites off ears, hits after the bell, former WWF
referee ... Of course now that Mike's only living in England might
be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Latrell Sprewell _ He could be the next Randy Moss on the
football field and smilar to Greene, once choked his coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frank Kush _ The former Arizona State and Indianapolis Colts
coach was arrested once for physically abusing his players and
knows how to curse a bit too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dennis Rodman _ What can we say that hasn't been said about
this bad boy? ... Bonus _ you get Carmen Electra and maybe a locker
room scream scene.

 &HT;    AFTER LEBANON FLARE-UPS, ISRAELIS WONDER WHAT COMES NEXT
 &HT;    Updates 6th graf to note that a seventh Israeli has been killed 
 &HT;    Optional trim at 800
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13 
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEVASERET ZION, Israel _ Stopping in a coffee shop after
exercise class last week, three Israeli friends talked about
whether they had been right to vote for Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for change,'' said Nili Israel, 47, who has a son in
the Israeli army and a daughter who will serve in a few years. She
hoped Barak could bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised us a lot of things, but he turned out to be
completely the opposite person of what I thought he was,'' said
Ella Naimi, a 50-year-old professional mediator. She says Barak has
ignored the Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we are in a fog,'' said Nurit Persitz, a 49-year-old
architect.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday (Eds: Feb. 13) was supposed to be a landmark, when
Israelis and Palestinians would map out a general plan for settling
their final disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the peace process is stalled and bitter. Israeli talks
with Syria also are at a standstill. And worse still for these
mothers in suburban Jerusalem, fighting between Israel and Lebanese
Hezbollah guerrillas claimed seven Israeli lives in the last two
weeks. There were no Hezbollah casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Israel responded with repeated air raids on Lebanese power
stations and Hezbollah camps, wounding about 15 civilians. Barak
found himself visiting Israelis in bomb shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the ``fog'' that Persitz sees will require a return to
the details of peacemaking. American officials, convinced they are
on the verge of stability in the Middle East, will need to be
closely involved, preparing all sides for tough concessions.
</P>
<P>
   When there are crises here, if often means that people are ready
to deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get down to the real tough issues, there is
always a real crustiness,'' said Kenneth W. Stein, a professor of
Middle Eastern history at Atlanta's Emory University. ``Both sides
still want an agreement, they just don't like the contours.''
</P>
<P>
   Success will hinge largely on Barak, the man who raised hopes in
the first place when he campaigned for election last May. The
former general's image as the can-do commando, the self-proclaimed
``number one soldier,'' is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really disappointed,'' said Israeli journalist Shimon
Shiffer, who happened into the coffee shop. ``He really has a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's deadline for a peace outline with the Palestinians came
up at Barak's insistence to renegotiate the Wye River Plantation
agreement, which was signed by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The deadline would have been a major milestone in the 6-year-old
Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oslo, the Palestinians agreed to drop their armed struggle
against Israel in exchange for control of land in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak put off the latest land transfers while he conducted
negotiations with Syria. Then, the Palestinians rejected the barren
land he was offering and halted the talks.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, Israelis and Palestinians were supposed to
outline solutions to the toughest issues in the process _ who
should control Jerusalem, where will the final borders of Israel
stand, what happens to Palestinian refugees? While no one expected
Sunday's (Feb. 13) deadline to be met, most thought the two sides
would at least be meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Oslo Israelis hoped Barak could lead the country to make a
deal with the Palestinians, but they are not so sure anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stuck in a kind of limbo,'' said Israeli Ron Pundik,
who helped design the Oslo accords. He said Barak does not seem to
know what concessions to make for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that his maximum at this stage would not be
enough to meet their minimum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats will need to reassure Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat that it's worth it to him to return to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is under tremendous pressure internally and cannot make
a deal that is seen as a sellout,'' said University of Pennsylvania
Middle East expert Ian Lustick. ``Arafat wants Barak to share some
of the political costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is in limbo with the Syrians, too. Israeli hopes were
almost euphoric in December when Barak reopened talks with Syria
for the first time in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians want the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from
them in 1967. Israel wants normal diplomatic relations and
assurances that Syria will not use the Golan plateau to launch
attacks on Israel. Israelis also want peace on their border with
Lebanon, which is in large part controlled by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak predicted when the talks started in December that
agreement could come within months and showered Syrian president
Hafez Assad with praise. But the Syrians walked out on those talks
last month and many Israelis felt Barak's flattery had gone too
far.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The immediate problem here is a kind of Catch 22 about the order
in which the topics will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians do not want to offer anything until Israel agrees to a
complete withdrawal from the Golan first. Israelis do not want to
promise the Golan until Syria states what it will give up.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators can serve here to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they could promise the Syrians that, if they return
to negotiations, America would press Israel to return all the
Golan. They could promise Israel that, in exchange for the Golan,
America would keep an eye on the Syrian military and press Syria to
open full relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But, it could all still hinge on Barak's relations with people
in the malls and coffee shops of Israel. He has promised to let
them vote on any peace deals he initials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Referendum results could depend on Barak's credibility, which is
suffering these days with his first political scandal. Police are
investigating his campaign fund-raising after a government
comptroller reported that his party flagrantly violated election
laws.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll last week showed only 45 percent of Israelis
supporting Barak when asked if they would vote for him again over
Netanyahu. That's down from the 56 percent he received in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Stein suggests that Barak turn to core political issues, such as
fulfilling campaign promises to fix Israel's lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   That appeals to people like architect Persitz. She's willing to
give Barak another chance, but says the scandal has shaken her
faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Netanyahu's party was corrupt, but now we're seeing
the same thing,'' she said. ``We feel like we are a banana
republic. I didn't believe it could happen.''

 &HT;    CLINTON: NO QUICK FIX TO INTERNET HACKING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying it's unlikely the Internet can soon be made
safe from attacks by computer hackers, President Clinton announced
Friday that government officials and business leaders will hold a
cyber-summit next week to deal with the rising threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be an instantaneous solution'' to the
Internet's open design structure, Clinton said in the White House
briefing room. These inherent weaknesses were on display this week
when unknown hackers launched relentless ``denial of service''
attacks that successively took down several popular Web sites for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different from any other development in human
history,'' the president said. ``Willie Sutton said he robbed banks
because that's where the money is.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``banks are a lot harder to rob today than they used to be.
That's what's going to happen here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an ongoing effort to try to make sure we keep all
the benefits of the Internet, all the benefits of the computer
revolution, but (to also) develop better defenses and better
defenders. I believe we will do that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to some 35 key players in commercial cyberspace will
go out Saturday by phone, fax and e-mail, presidential spokesman
Joe Lockhart reported. ``We're going to cast a pretty wide net,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of getting together,'' Lockhart said, ``is to see
where we can share information and where we can, in a joint effort,
do something that helps protect both the federal assets and
critical infrastructure and those in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   National security adviser Samuel Berger, Attorney General Janet
Reno and Commerce Secretary William Daley are also due to attend
the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton put forward a comprehensive program to
safeguard the nation's America's public and private computer
systems from hackers and viruses. The plan called for subsidizing
college tuition costs for computer students who agree to work for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed administration budget for fiscal year 2001 includes
$2 billion to handle the security challenges posed by the explosive
growth of the Internet.

DRESS FOR SUCCESS GOES NETWORKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After work on a recent night, about 25 women met for a
networking session at a local hotel. That's not odd. After all,
working women meet at breakfast, lunch and dinner club meetings
every day of the week to swap stories and offer support.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was unusual for this group of working women because
they've recently gotten off welfare, completed treatment programs
for alcohol and drug abuse, been released from prison or left
violent spouses.
</P>
<P>
   They were meeting under the auspices of Dress for Success, the
national group that outfits economically disadvantaged women in
donated business suits.
</P>
<P>
   The free suits helped them get jobs, and now the organization
wants to take the women to a new level by helping them organize a
good-old-girl network in which they can help each other through the
workplace maze. Dress for Success has set up networking groups in
21 cities in addition to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's a critical need because women who move from public
assistance, violent situations, prison or recover from drug and
alcohol abuse often lose their safety net when they leave their old
environment, said Nancy Levicki, co-founder and executive director
of Dress for Success in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When someone breaks a mold, it's hard for family and friends who
get left behind, said Levicki. They often push away the one who has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   So Levicki _ who used her networking talents to persuade
influential and monied friends to donate a showroom for the
clothes, movers to move them and dry cleaners to clean them _
launched the Professional Women's Group for the formerly
economically disadvantaged in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EXCITED GROUP OF WOMEN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting had the feel of an excited group of Junior
Leaguers. The women were beautifully dressed with many wearing
their ``new'' suits as they enthusiastically applauded each other's
accomplishments. Some already had been promoted, while others
passed their high school equivalency exams and were taking college
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Like other professional groups, there was a speaker _ Jan
Glazner _ who talked about the written and unwritten rules of
business.
</P>
<P>
   While Glazner's advice would be helpful to most anyone, it was
especially important to the women who haven't had someone guide
them through the cutthroat world of office politics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Glazner, a human resources manager at Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in Houston, talked about an employer she knows who wants
everyone to be at work by 7:30 a.m. even though the official start
time is 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times, supervisors don't explain their expectations, so
it's up to an employee to figure out what is expected, said
Glazner, warning the women to be on the lookout for clues at their
own work sites. Sometimes a new employee starts out on the wrong
foot because of that misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A PLACE TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to reveal too much about yourself at
work, Glazner told the group. It can put other people off,
especially things of a confidential nature.
</P>
<P>
   That advice hit home for Kim Tope. Tope, who was outfitted by
Dress for Success and has landed a job as the outreach coordinator
for Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston, said she is used to
talking with therapists about her bipolar illness but realized
there are boundaries at work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a stigma to mental illness, said Tope, who wouldn't be
talking about it if she hadn't missed a couple of days recently and
was ``outed.'' She said her employer is supportive and has offered
to bring in a bipolar expert to talk about the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The networking meeting is a safe place to discuss issues that
you can't discuss with a supervisor or co-workers, said Tope, who

bottles of Woolite to keep her suits looking nice and a coupon for
a ``new'' suit at Dress for Success.

   And like all networking clubs, after the program, women sought
each other out to pick up strands of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It was uplifting and positive _ a real boost of self-esteem,
said Jane Lemoine, who went through Dress for Success and landed a
secretarial job at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.

   Lemoine said she wishes she didn't have to wait three months for

MADONNA REINVENTS HERSELF AGAIN, THIS TIME WITH DON MCLEAN'S '70S
HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the winter of 1971, I was 12 years old and going through a
sort of musical latency period. My older siblings had left home,
and the radios in our house were tuned to my parents' preferred
country stations. I enjoyed much of the music they played _
remember, Johnny Cash, Buck Owens and Merle Haggard were at career
peaks back then _ and my mind was curiously closed to most rock
music.
</P>
<P>
   Some rock songs, though, were inescapable and irresistible. One
of them was ``American Pie,'' Don McLean's epic tribute to Buddy
Holly, which dominated the airwaves in late '71 and early '72.
During junior high, the song blared out of classmates' radios;
friends of mine recorded it on primitive mix tapes; it seemed to
pour out of every teen-ager's car window as they blasted music on
our street.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buddy Holly would become a musical hero of mine, at the
time I had no idea who he was and probably wouldn't have been able
to figure out that the song was about, among many other things, his
death in a 1959 plane crash. But I loved the song for its more
basic elements, especially its ``Drove my Chevy to the levee''
chorus, which has extra meaning to someone who grew up in El Paso,
where the Rio Grande levee was a popular party spot in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, any rock station would have played McLean's song; the
mere ``American Pie'' title fit the tone of the times, when the
country was divided by the Vietnam War. The song had nothing to do
with the war, of course, but you could still easily interpret it as
patriotic anthem, hippie rabble-rouser, or wistful nostalgia for a
time when America was less embattled. No doubt all these factors
played into the song's becoming an enormous hit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years later, Madonna _ who is roughly the same age as
me _ has brought ``American Pie'' back to us with a bubbly remake.
But if McLean's version of the song inspires nostalgia for Buddy
Holly and the '60s, Madonna's inspires nostalgia for McLean's
original. She's a longtime fan of the song, and when Rupert Everett
talked to her into recording it for their upcoming movie, ``The
Next Best Thing,'' he didn't have to twist her arm (it reportedly
plays a key role in the film, which opens March 3). Her version is
bouncier than McLean's, with William Orbit production that isn't
too far from what he did for her career-rejuvenating ``Ray of
Light'' album. It's also shorter, dropping a couple of key verses
to become more radio-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Er ... ``more'' radio-friendly. Something's wrong with that
phrase. More radio-friendly than a song that was No. 1 for four
weeks, back when radio was more ``song''-friendly, when it wasn't
unusual for a station to take a risk on something that ran 8 1/2
minutes. Back when a song like that could become a cultural
phenomenon on its own power, without feeling like it was
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   It probably means something that although people know of
Madonna's version of the song, several friends have told me, ``I
haven't heard it yet,'' even though it's been on the Metroplex
airwaves for two weeks. As for me, I've heard it once, and not for
lack of trying. I got it on the first try, though, when I tuned
into Top 40 station KHKS/106.1 FM (better-known as KISS) about 7
p.m. last Thursday, and there Madonna's version was in all its
contemporary glory.
</P>
<P>
   KISS boasted of being the first Metroplex station to play the
song. According to the Los Angeles Times report, Madonna's
``American Pie'' was supposed to debut Feb. 2 (a day before the
41st anniversary of the Holly plane crash, which also killed
Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper). KISS, however, says it has been
playing it since Jan. 28. (Calls to KISS' programming department
were not returned).
</P>
<P>
   Competing stations have been more cautious, but they aren't
letting KISS run away with the song. Most of them have been like
KISS' sister station, soft-rocker KBFB/97.9 FM (B-97.9), which
waited a little longer to add ``American Pie'' to the playlist,
putting it into rotation beginning last Friday. Reaction, as it
turns out, has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get probably a half-dozen female calls saying that they
liked the original better,'' says Garry Leigh, B-97.9's program
director. ``But we probably got four times as many calls saying
that they liked it.'' Leigh points out that just about any remake
is going to have naysayers. But, even though Madonna has more than
her share of detractors (and McLean's original has many
worshippers), the new song appears to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that it worked on B-97's sister station had nothing
to do with it, Leigh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do things separately,'' Leigh said. ``The original
gets played on (B-97.9's) ``'70s Saturday Night,'' and Madonna is a
big part of our regular playlist. So it wasn't an unnatural thing
for us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the dial, KVIL/103.7 FM, which aims its soft rock at an
audience older than KISS' but younger than B-97.9's, has been a bit
more wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an official add,'' said John King, KVIL's music
director. ``We've played it a couple of times on Ron Chapman's
morning show to see what kind of response we'd get.'' Expect the
station to add it soon: Response was 75 percent positive. But
putting the song into rotation isn't automatic. ``We run a very
tight playlist here,'' King said. ``It has to fight to be added.''
</P>
<P>
   Other stations likely to add the song include KDMX/102.9 FM (The
Mix) and ``maybe'' KRBV/100.3 FM (V-100). Calls to the Mix were not
returned; calls to V-100 were not even answered. To be frank, it's
possible that these stations ``have'' added the song, but I haven't
heard it yet after extended attempts at trying. The song probably
will begin getting more airplay after Madonna's ``American Pie''
video debut on MTV yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   When you're old enough to remember the original version, it's
odd to think about having to try to hear a new take on ``American
Pie.'' As much as we complain about overplayed songs, it's overplay
that gives a song its place in the culture and a lock on our
memories. Anyone who listens to rock radio isn't going to be able
to hear Santana's ``Smooth'' or Smash Mouth's ``All Star'' without
thinking of the latter half of 1999, just as anyone who heard the
original ``American Pie'' when it first came out will always be
thrown back to the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's version, though, has had an odd fallout. Over on
oldies station KLUV/98.7 FM, where McLean's version is a staple of
the format, program director Chuck Brinkman reports an ``abnormal
amount of requests'' for the original hit. Brinkman says that
requests usually spike in early February, around the anniversary of
the plane crash, but that they've been even higher this year in
reaction to Madonna's song.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've tired of McLean's original; after a certain
number of listens, even some great songs lose their luster. But
Madonna's version _ as well as ``Weird Al'' Yankovic's parody ``The
Saga Begins,'' which tells the entire plot of ``Star Wars _ Episode
I: The Phantom Menace'' to the tune of ``American Pie'' _ have
helped me regain my appreciation for McLean's song. Madonna may
have a hit on her hands, but I wonder if 30 years from now, some
wistful writer will ponder how a long, long time ago, her version _
and the radio _ made him smile. Somehow, I kind of doubt it.

from the Style section for use Sunday, Feb. 13, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   TEENAGE-WITCHES (New York) _ Witchcraft is becoming a growing
movement among teenagers, mostly girls, who are in part captivated
by the glossy new image of witches portrayed on television shows
and in the movies. No longer the hideous, wart-covered crone of
folklore and fairy tale, witches in hit television shows like
``Charmed,'' starring Shannen Doherty, and the 1996 movie ``The
Craft,'' a favorite with teenagers at video stores, are avatars of
glamour, power and style. By Ruth La Ferla. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   PRADA-FASHION (New York) _ A long the docks of this
sailing-obsessed city, there is a brand name as deeply coveted as
it is on the stiletto-trod avenues of Manhattan or Milan. Known far
and wide for its image of extreme urban chic, exemplified by a
black nylon backpack, that brand is Prada. The understated,
futuristic uniforms issued to sailors on the Prada Challenge are
sought after by Aucklanders and by other crews _ now more than ever
since Prada has vanquished 10 other teams for the right to face
Team New Zealand in the America's Cup, beginning Feb. 19. By Herb
McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-WOMEN (New York) _ It's still widely held that men are
the ones who need to be cattle-prodded to the altar. But there are,
in fact, many women, like me, who get seasick when thinking about
taking the plunge in the white dress. They cling to
bachelorettehood as strongly as many men do to their singleness.
And for many of the same reasons. We cherish freedom, independence,
the illusion of youth. I call it the Peta Pan syndrome. By Ilene
Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-SOMERS (New York) _ Suzanne Somers knew to keep them
waiting. On Wednesday night, inside the Kit Kat Klub near Times
Square, the air jingled with anticipation _ and costume jewelry.
More than 150 guests, who had been invited to a private party she
said she was giving to ``thank everyone who had supported me
throughout the years,'' were buzzing and nibbling hors d'oeuvres.
Though best known for her role as Chrissy, the dumb blonde on
``Three's Co.,'' Somers has a brain for business and a genius for
public relations. By Nancy Hass. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   TICKING-CLOCK-MEN (New York) _ As many successful women seem to
be postponing having children, it is the men pushing to pair off
and procreate. Shrinks have told me they hear it from male
patients. Warner Brothers is developing a movie adapted from a 1998
novel called ``The Daddy Clock.'' By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   FISHNET-FASHION (New York) _ If Victoria's Secret caters to the
fantasy of a Vassar coed taking it all off at her parents' Park
Avenue apartment, then Frederick's of Hollywood, that traditional
bastion of ``bad girl'' fashion, is for the determined starlet who
knows all the angles of the casting couch _ even when it's in the
parking lot. And today, Frederick's finds itself at ground zero of
one of spring's biggest fashion trends, the resurgence of the
fishnet stocking. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ I had been thinking about putting up
some bluebird boxes, and seeing a bluebird on our land (and the
assumption that his mate could not be far off) sent me to the
library and the Web, where I found a wealth of information, from
how to build and set up a bluebird box, to how to keep out
marauding sparrows and snakes, to what bluebirds eat. By Anne
Raver.

MOST OF THE TIME YOU WILL WANT TO RESTORE LATEST VERSION OF FILE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have discovered several features of Windows 98
that are not readily apparent. One of these is the ability to
identify conflicting versions of files through the Version Conflict
Manager. My question is: Should all of the versions identified in
this program be restored, since the backup versions are always the
more current version?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Version Conflict Manager is just one of several tools
included in the System Information utility that comes with Windows
98 and Windows 98 SE. For me, the System Information program alone
is worth the price of the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Version Conflict Manager takes a look at key system files
and compares them against a group of backup files. If a file
currently being used is different from the file in the backup set,
then it appears in a list of suspected version conflicts. You're
shown the date of the backup and the version number of both the
current and backed-up files.
</P>
<P>
   You can go through the list and restore the one you want. In
theory, you always want to have the latest file version in use.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's a caveat.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the older files are placed into use by applications that
have been installed. Some of these programs may expect these older
system files to be present after they've installed them. The older
files may include bugs or even features that are no longer present
in new versions. Believe it or not, some programmers write to take
advantage of certain bugs. As a result, the files don't respond as
the programs expect them to, possibly causing those programs to
crash.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is rare, however. It's better to have the newer
versions of system files in place. If, after you run the Version
Conflict Manager, you begin to have problems with specific
applications, try reinstalling them. That will put those older
files back into service.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Other than being able to put active content on the desktop,
is there any real use or advantage to having Active Desktop enabled
in Windows 98 or 95?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Active Desktop feature is one of those options that is
better as a concept than it is in everyday use. It essentially
turns your desktop into a big Web page, onto which you can drop
content from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To turn it on, right-click on the Windows 98 desktop (or Windows
95 if you've upgraded to Internet Explorer 4 with the desktop
update) and choose Active Desktop, then click View As Web Page.
</P>
<P>
   To test it, connect to the Internet if you haven't already, and
go to the Houston traffic map at traffic.tamu.edu/traffic.html.
Click on the traffic map image and drag it onto your desktop.
You'll get a confirmation dialog box, and from there you can also
customize how often it is updated. You can have the image updated
as often as you like, essentially giving you live content right on
the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems with this. If you are a dialup user, you
have to log on to your Internet provider to get an update. (It
really works best if you have an always-on connection, such as
through a cable or ADSL modem.) And, your system will take a huge
performance hit _ a 500-megahertz PC suddenly starts acting like a
300-MHz model. For most folks, the cool factor is not worth the
hassle.

   NIRELAND-BRITAIN (London) _ The government of Catholics and
Protestants in Northern Ireland that held out the tantalizing
promise of an end to the British province's polarized political
life and took years of negotiations to set up, came to a halt
Friday after only 10 weeks in operation. Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary, Peter Mandelson, announced in Belfast Friday evening
that he was suspending the power-sharing administration because of
a continuing conflict over paramilitary arms. He added that he
hoped the shutdown would not last long and that he expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing'' if the

TIPS FOR CREATING AUDIO CDS ON PC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Owners of writable CD-ROM drives know there are few computing
endeavors as satisfying as using a home computer to create an audio
CD of favorite songs. When you finish the ``burn,'' move the
freshly made CD into a home stereo and hear the digitally perfect
results, it's just this side of geek heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes it doesn't work. Despite the exploding
popularity of writable and rewritable CD-ROM drives _ also known as
CD-R/RW or burners _ the technology can be finicky.
</P>
<P>
   Failures are common enough that there's a tongue-in-cheek phrase
for them _ making a coaster. When the creation of an audio CD
fails, it's ruined. You can't go back and recover from the mistake.
About the only thing you can use the disc for is preventing water
stains from your sweating glass of iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, coasters can be prevented if you follow a few steps
and don't try to cut corners. Here are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Quality and power: You'll want a capable computer, a well-made
burner and quality discs. Skimp on any of those three and you're
asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Your PC should be relatively new and muscular, with at least a
300-megahertz processor and 64 megabytes or more of memory. You'll
also need a hard drive with at least 2 gigabytes of free space for
temporary and image files. More, of course, is better.
</P>
<P>
   Burning music onto a CD requires the maintenance of a constant
stream of information from the PC into a memory buffer, and then
from the laser onto the disk. The computer must be able to manage
this flow of information and keep it constant. If the stream breaks
anywhere in that chain and the laser stops burning, you've made
yourself a coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Some CD-R/RW veterans insist that a drive using a SCSI
connection is the way to go. Traditionally, SCSI (Small Computer
Systems Interface) has been faster than the type of connection
found in most PCs, which is EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive
Electronics).
</P>
<P>
   However, modern EIDE drives handle CD audio just fine, and they
are much less expensive. Plus, SCSI can be difficult to configure
in a PC, and usually requires inserting an add-in card. For most
home users, I'd recommend sticking with EIDE drives.
</P>
<P>
   Get a brand-name drive, such as those from Hewlett-Packard,
Plextor, Pioneer, Phillips, Sony or Creative Labs. And make sure it
will handle both writable discs _ which can be written to only
once, and are the type most often used for audio _ and rewritable
discs, which can be written to multiple times.
</P>
<P>
   The same advice goes for the discs you buy. Avoid off-brand
media, even though those packs of 50 discs on a spindle may come at
an attractive price. Stick with names you know, such as TDK,
Maxell, Memorex, Fuji, Imation or Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be dedicated: Even if you've got the biggest, baddest, fastest
PC on the block, consider it a one-trick pony when it comes to
making an audio CD. Forget about multi-tasking when you're burning.
Your machine should be dedicated to that task, and that task alone.
</P>
<P>
   Turn off everything running in the background, particularly
screen savers and virus checkers. Shut down power management.
Disconnect from the Internet if you use a modem. Kill your e-mail
and Web browser if you have an always-on DSL or cable connection.
Let your PC concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pre-write: Most software used to create audio CDs lets you
first create an image of the CD on your hard drive, then use that
image to create the actual disk. This way, you are working with one
large file rather than many small ones.
</P>
<P>
   If you are working from multiple MP3 or WAV files on your hard
drive, the software being used must move from one file to the next.
And if you are working from a compact disc _ or multiple ones, if
you are making a compilation CD _ you'll definitely want to create
an image file first. Writing from one CD drive to another can be
dicey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch your speed: CD-ROM burners are getting faster and
faster, but in some cases speed can kill.
</P>
<P>
   Note that most blank CDs come with speed ratings _ 2X, 4X, 6X or
8X. Just because your burner can run at an 8X doesn't mean you
should write at that speed. Stick to the rating on the CD. If you
make a few coasters at the rated speed of the discs, try backing
down a notch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it clean: Basic computer maintenance can help prevent
coasters. Keep your hard drive defragmented, and before you burn a
CD on a Windows system, clean out the windowstemp folder.
</P>
<P>
   I've also had some luck using a shareware program called
Memturbo (www.memturbo.com), which clears out Windows 95/98 memory.
The registered version of the program will also set up your Windows
virtual memory, or swap file, so that it works best with a CD-ROM
burner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure the blanks you're using _ as well as any
source music CDs _ are clean. Scratches, smudges and dirt can
translate into pops and clicks on an audio disk, and they won't be
part of the music.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on using recordable CD-ROM drives, check
out these two excellent Web sites: resource.simplenet.com and
www.fadden.com/cdrfaq/.

<P>
   Admittedly, it rarely pays to be optimistic about anything
describing itself as a ``peace process'' in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, talks between Israel and Syria in recent months had
made greater progress than ever before. It was at least possible to
hope that a turning point might have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, that peace process has been definitively
shattered. Following attacks on their soldiers, Israeli jets have
pounded Lebanon, destroying power stations and killing civilians.
And there are threats that things may yet get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The theoretical target of the Israeli attacks is the
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, whose fighters harass the Israeli military
occupying southern Lebanon. But Hezbollah fighters are too canny to
be easily hit. So instead, it is civilians who suffer from the
Israeli attacks _ just as they have always done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the negotiations with Syria _ as important a part of the
peace process as the separate talks between the Israelis and the
Palestinians _ it seemed that Israel and Syria alike had come to
understand the need for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad, the Syrian leader, failed to deliver the
emollient soundbites that might have made life easier for the
embattled Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the repeated meetings in recent months between
Israeli and Syrian negotiators offered indications that the iceberg
might finally be ready to crack.
</P>
<P>
   On one crucial issue, it was clear that Assad would not budge.
Syria insisted that Israel must quit the Golan Heights, which it
has held since the Six Day War in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has indicated that he is ready to compromise over this,
but he needs time to force Israel's 17,000 settlers to move.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs and bullets cannot break deadlocks. But too often, the
protagonists in the Middle East have failed to understand this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's Syria is too powerful to be attacked directly.
Hezbollah, cynically encouraged by Damascus, is too cunning to be
badly damaged; it has, in any case, occupied propaganda high ground
by concentrating its attacks on Israeli soldiers in the so-called
``security zone'' in south Lebanon, instead of attacking civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and Syria know that the killing of soldiers acts as a
red rag to the Israeli bull; hence, the attacks. Now, Israel seems
ready to punish Lebanon, the powerless pawn-in-the-middle.
</P>
<P>
   It threatened this week that ``Lebanese soil will burn'' if
there is one Hezbollah attack on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Kiryat Shmona, on Israel's northern border,
have spent the past three nights in shelters in expectation of such
an attack. But it is Lebanese civilians who have suffered so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak is undoubtedly a far better bet for regional peace
than his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. But he too seems capable
of backing a policy that is depressingly reminiscent of Russia's
dealings with Chechnya _ bomb them to hell, in the wrongful belief
that killing civilians will damage the terrorist cause.
</P>
<P>
   As with Moscow, this violent refusal to understand anybody
else's point of view can only backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has the firepower to inflict more suffering on others
than they can inflict on Israel. But that does them little good in
the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Israel needs Syria as much as Syria needs Israel. Finally, both
sides must learn: peace comes from olive branches, not bombs. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The unpredictable governor of Minnesota, Jesse
Ventura, announced Friday that he is taking his state's Reform
Party out of the national organization to protest against the
infighting that has plagued it in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a former professional wrestler who swept to the
governorship in 1998 on a wave of anti-establishment feeling, thus
formalized a split that had long been on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and the Reform Party's founder, Ross Perot, the Texan
billionaire, have sparred for months over every aspect of the
party's activity, from its future direction to its presidential
candidate, and even the venue of its next convention.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's gathering descended into open warfare when Ventura
capitalized on his advantage of actually having won high electoral
office to secure his choice of national chairman, Jack Gargan of
Florida. He then set about vying for the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   But with the party headquarters about to move to Florida and out
of his purview, Perot fought back. He encouraged Pat Buchanan, a
former Reaganite and television presenter, to compete for the
party's presidential nomination, and even hinted that he might
consider another run himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 1992 campaign that put the Reform Party on the map
and indirectly allowed President Bill Clinton to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, meanwhile, backs Donald Trump, the New York property
tycoon, for this year's nomination, while not excluding the idea
that he might run himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the party so comprehensively split, Perot called a crisis
meeting in Nashville for Saturday to discuss the crisis. Ventura's
announcement Friday was his way of explaining why he would not be
turning up.
</P>
<P>
   Perot is now expected to take back control of the national
organization, and Ventura could use his party's base in Minnesota
to form a new party of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Reform Party now, though, is not just the
aftermath of the rivalry between two big personalities.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of the party's platform _ disgust with the system
and reform of political funding _ has been hijacked while the
Reform Party squabbled.
</P>
<P>
   Overhauling the system is now associated not with Perot, or even
Ventura, but with the Republic challenger, Senator John McCain, and
the Democrat, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   With the reason for its existence in question, the Reform Party
is hemorrhaging support by the day. Mostly, it is going to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Perotists will be hard put to get it back; the Venturans may
have jumped ship just in time. &QL;

   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, wearing a Rolling Stones jacket,
announced Friday he is leaving a ``hopelessly dysfunctional''
national Reform Party and recommending that the Minnesota state
party do the same. He said he wants his state party to leave the
national organization as soon as possible and reclaim the name
Independence Party. Ventura, a former pro wrestler and Navy Seal
and the Reform Party's highest-ranking elected official, said the
party ``is unworthy of my support and the support of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES HE MEAN?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush on Friday defended his father's decision to end
the Persian Gulf War without sending troops after Saddam Hussein,
and said as president he would make sure Iraq didn't develop
weapons of mass destruction. Bush said he would ensure that U.N.
weapons inspectors were allowed back in Iraq, ``and if we catch
them developing weapons of mass destruction, there won't be any
weapons of mass destruction left in Iraq if I'm the commander in
chief.'' When pressed for details, Bush said, ``I'm not going to
tell you what I mean, because I'm not going to tell Saddam Hussein
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   THE JOKE'S ON HIM
</P>
<P>
   Still laboring to loosen up his image, Al Gore appeared on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno.'' The comedian's opening monologue
included this jibe: ``Earlier today, computer hackers actually shut
down Al Gore for two hours.'' But Gore managed a few good lines of
his own. When Leno offered an apology for all the Gore jokes he's
done over the years, Gore shrugged it off: ``We have kind of a
family ritual. We just sit around the dinner table every night
around 11:30 and make jokes about you.''
</P>
<P>
   IN CLOSER TOUCH WITH URBAN ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning in Los Angeles, Al Gore's motorcade was
delayed for about half an hour when three people were shot on a
street near L.A. County USC-Medical Center. Gore was promoting his
health care proposal at the hospital when the shooting occurred.
Police said the victims were shot near a fast-food store a few
blocks away. The gunfire erupted just before Gore was to leave the
hospital, and neither he nor anyone else in his motorcade was ever
in any danger, police said.
</P>
<P>
   EXCITED ABOUT COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is reaching into cyberspace for a new twist on an
old-fashioned campaign priority: raising money. McCain chatted on
the Internet in real time via satellite video to 500 people who
paid $100 each to watch and send in questions. ``Even more
impressive than the money is the way we communicate,'' McCain said
from the College of Charleston in South Carolina. ``We can
communicate with somebody eight to 10 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH NOT AS THRILLED ABOUT MCCAIN'S CYBER-DOINGS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush took note Friday of John McCain's use of the
Internet to chat by video with campaign donors, saying they
included many corporate lobbyists and interest groups. Bush, on
Kiawah Island, S.C., called on his rival to quickly release names
of all his Internet donors and mocked McCain for raising money from
special interests while championing campaign finance reform. It was
the fourth straight day Bush has focused on campaign money as part
of a strategy of sharper attacks against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   CALM DOWN, IT'S UNDER CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   As George W. Bush hammered on John McCain through ads and
speeches, his aides moved to reassure Republican fund-raisers and
supporters that John McCain's insurgent candidacy can be contained.
In a private conference call to Bush supporters in Congress,
campaign manager Joe Allbaugh reportedly said the increased
criticism of McCain was able to ``stanch the hemorrhaging'' of
support to McCain in South Carolina, and that Bush would step up
his efforts in accusing McCain of disloyalty to Republican
principles.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, MAN, I'M ON YOUR SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for more questions about his anti-abortion record, Al
Gore conceded his position has shifted over the years and accused
Bill Bradley of trying to use the issue to drive a wedge between
Democrats. ``For far too long some politicians have been willing to
play with the issue of choice for their own personal political
ambition,'' Gore said at a Beverly Hills, Calif., fund-raiser
organized by women activists. ``So I say to Senator Bradley: Stop
trying to divide us on the issue of choice. It's time to join hands
and fight the real enemy'' in the Republican Party, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGY CHANGE _ AND SOME CONCERN
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush plans to take his criticism of John McCain in yet
another direction, painting him as a do-nothing senator and drawing
strong links between McCain and Democrats, according to The
Associated Press, citing some Bush advisers. McCain told ABC there
is a ``legitimate concern'' that fighting among the two Republicans
would leave the eventual nominee wounded going into the general
election race, and renewed his call for a mutual agreement to stop
running negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY URGES CLINTON RESTRAINT
</P>
<P>
   Count Bill Bradley as one Democrat not at all happy to see
President Clinton back on the trail raising money for the party.
``There's got to be some restraint here,'' Bradley said in a MSNBC
television interview. ``How can you be for eliminating soft money
and be participating in the process of raising it?'' The White
House said this week that Clinton is ready to raise millions for
the Democratic National Committee by attending four or five events
a month for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   SQUABBLING OVER DEBATES CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Bill Bradley continue to disagree over planning for
a series of debates leading up to the Super Tuesday round of March
7 primaries and caucuses. Bradley's campaign halted discussions
Thursday after Gore's representatives removed as a possibility a
Feb. 16 debate that the campaigns had tentatively agreed upon. Both
sides have agreed to debates Feb. 21 and March 1, but there was no
indication that talks about scheduling additional debates would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT TAKEN ON GUN CONTROL ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, appearing in Los Angeles with parents of children
killed by guns, accused Al Gore of coming late and ending up weak
on the emotional issue of gun control. Said Bradley: ``This is not
an issue that I came to after seeing television pictures of
Columbine; this is an issue that I believed as a matter of
fundamental principle throughout my public life. ... I have always
supported common-sense gun control. Al Gore has not always done
that.'' The Gore campaign countered that Bradley was trying to
manufacture differences where none exist.
</P>
<P>
   WHO CAN WIN? THAT'S THE QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's chances of upsetting George W. Bush now may rest
on the same claim that earlier propelled Bush to an early lead in
party endorsements and fund-raising: Who can beat the Democrat?
Even though a lot of Republicans can't stand him, they're starting
to wonder whether McCain may be their best hope. But the same
maverick style and anti-establishment message that helps McCain
attract independents and Democrats infuriates Republican regulars
and could cost him the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH FINDS WAY TO TURN POLL AROUND
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush gained an edge in South Carolina as a new poll
showed Republicans shifted away from John McCain, whose negative
ratings crept up. The American Research Group poll (4 percentage
point margin of error) released Thursday, indicated Bush had 46
percent, McCain 39 percent and Alan Keyes had 7 percent support in
the state, with 8 percent undecided. Right after the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 1, McCain led Bush 45 percent to 42 percent _ too
close to call. The ARG said likely Republican voters cited
advertising and telephone calls providing negative information
about McCain as reasons for switching from McCain to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   OK NOW, THEY'RE BEGINNING TO LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   Americans finally began tuning in to the presidential campaign
after New Hampshire, with three-fourths of people in a new
Vanishing Voter Project poll indicating they're paying at least
some attention. More than one-fourth said they were paying a
``great deal or ``quite a bit'' of attention to the campaigns in
the days after the Feb. 1 primary. Fewer than one-fourth said they
paid no attention at all. In earlier weeks, four of 10 people in
polls for the Vanishing Voter Project said they were paying no
attention to the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   TIME SERVED WINS GAY ENDORSEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore picked up the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign,
the nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group. ``The vice
president has toiled at our side through one issue after another
over the last seven years,'' said Elizabeth Birch, the group's
president. ``Senator Bradley didn't start speaking out on these
issues until he started running for president. At the end of the
day, that's late in the game.'' Birch and Judy Shepard, mother of
Matthew Shepard, who was slain in Wyoming, appeared in Los Angeles
this morning with Gore and California Gov. Gray Davis .
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY HIT ON D.C. STATEHOOD
</P>
<P>
   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) compared the Senate records
of Al Gore and Bill Bradley on D.C. statehood Thursday and gave the
nod to Gore. She said she took the action in light of a statement
by Bradley that he now supports D.C. statehood. Norton's fact sheet
showed that Gore was one of three original co-sponsors of the
statehood bill, and that Bradley never supported it. ``Beware of
politicians who come out for you when they can't deliver, but
passed on you when they could,'' Norton said. The D.C. primary is
May 2.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FAUX PAS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton may have slipped up while campaigning in New
York state the other day. The Washington Times reported that she
failed to leave a tip after chowing down scrambled eggs at a diner
in the hamlet of Albion. The diner comped her meal, but Clinton
apparently forgot about the waitress. Under the headline ``Hillary
Stiffs a Single Mom,'' the newspaper reported that it's all the
locals have talked about since.

ON A WING AND A PRAYER, THE BLUEBIRD RETURNS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I couldn't believe my eyes last spring, when a bluebird flew out
of a walnut tree on our farm in Maryland. But that iridescent blue
is unmistakable. The color of blue, blue sky, with a sheen like
water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joyful sign, because native bluebirds, once plentiful,
have been devastated by habitat loss, pesticides and competing
imported species like house sparrows and starlings.
</P>
<P>
   I had been thinking about putting up some bluebird boxes, and
seeing a bluebird on our land (and the assumption that his mate
could not be far off) sent me to the library and the Web, where I
found a wealth of information, from how to build and set up a
bluebird box, to how to keep out marauding sparrows and snakes, to
what bluebirds eat.
</P>
<P>
   (Two excellent sites are run by the Dawes Arboretum,
www.dawesarb.org, and the North American Bluebird Society,
www.nabluebirdsociety.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Like robins, bluebirds belong to the thrush family and are quite
gregarious songbirds. The males, big surprise, have the showiest
plumage. The male Eastern bluebird has a bright blue head, back and
wings, a reddish-orange breast and white belly.
</P>
<P>
   His mate looks more gray-blue than blue, with more reddish-brown
on the neck and back. The Western bluebird is sky blue, with
lighter blue feathers from chin to belly and a bit of white under
his tail. Mountain bluebirds are slightly larger, with longer bills
and tails.
</P>
<P>
   These shy beauties were at their peak around 1900, when there
was plenty of open farmland and apple orchards with good nesting
holes. Bluebirds also love to nest in the holes of old fence posts
on the edge of grassy pastures, where there are plenty of insects
to eat, as well as berries, rose hips and other small fruits for
winter foraging.
</P>
<P>
   But more aggressive species came and drove them out of their
nests and killed their young, farms were sold for development and
farmers who stayed started using metal fence posts. So Eastern
bluebird populations took a nose dive from the late 1930s to the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old fence posts attracted woodpeckers looking for insects,
and those were perfect nest cavities for bluebirds,'' said Tim
Mason, a biologist at the Dawes Arboretum, which set up a bluebird
trail with 36 nest boxes in 1983. ``That first year, we fledged 18
bluebirds.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, a man named Thomas Musselman built a bluebird trail of
more than 1,000 boxes in Adams County, Ill., Donald and Lillian
Stokes wrote in ``The Bluebird Book'' (Little Brown, 1991), which
is highly recommended by enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   William Duncan set up trails in Jefferson County, Ky., about the
same time and developed a nest box with a round hole an inch and a
half in diameter _ too small for starlings. The box is easy to
build of pine, cedar or even plywood. Another box, designed by Dick
Peterson of Brooklyn Center, Minn., more than 30 years ago, has a
sloping roof and front, to help keep out rain, and an oval hole.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes should be mounted in an open area, from four to five
feet off the ground, about 300 feet apart, with perches scattered
in a 20-foot radius for foraging posts and resting spots for
fledglings. Low vegetation is best, enabling birds to see insects.
</P>
<P>
   Planting fruit-bearing trees and shrubs, from American holly to
bayberry and pokeweed, is also helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Bluebird trails have a passionate following. In 1980, Joan
Heilman, the author of ``Bluebird Rescue'' (Camden House, 1992),
wrote a little article on the North American Bluebird Society for
Parade magazine, offering a bluebird box plan for 25 cents. ``They
got 80,000 responses the first week,'' said Heilman, whose book is
great for kids.
</P>
<P>
   New York, where the bluebird is the state bird, has its own
bluebird hero in Raymond Briggs, a dairy farmer in Cobleskill, a
little town west of Albany, who taught agriculture and
environmental studies at the local high school to subsidize his
Holstein operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were studying endangered species, and the bluebird was on
the `special concern' list,'' said Briggs, a past president of the
New York Bluebird Society.
</P>
<P>
   So they put up some bluebird boxes, and he and others later
built a trail that now extends 1,700 miles, from the Massachusetts
border through Albany down to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs was awarded a special citation by Gov. George E. Pataki
in 1998, when the Environmental Conservation Department took the
bluebird off the special concern list. He was given his own license
plate _ RDB 101 _ which depicts a bluebird, of course. (Other New
Yorkers with bluebird plates carry Briggs' initials.)
</P>
<P>
   Though the box with the one-and-a-half-inch round hole works
just fine, Briggs said, the Peterson box, with the oval hole, is
much preferred by bluebirds. ``We experimented with the two boxes
side by side,'' he said, ``and bluebirds will choose the Peterson
box 60 to 70 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to face the boxes away from prevailing winds to
keep out rain and snow and to monitor them weekly during nesting
season to remove house sparrows or blowfly larvae, which can feed
on the young. If there are signs of raccoons or snakes, axle grease
should be spread on the poles.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that the cold month of February is the perfect
time to build some bluebird boxes and start a trail across the farm
_ and who knows where that may lead?

WHEN ARMIES   OF CONQUEST   MARCHED IN,   SO DID SAINTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Ariz.,   Canada, Haiti, Japan, Mexico)   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Old World may have conquered and colonized the Americas
largely for commercial gain, or the extraction of gold and silver,
or imperial expansion, or sheer adventure. But the grand endeavor
was sanctified by the Catholic and Protestant churches as the
greatest religious campaign since the crusades.
</P>
<P>
   The empires of France, Spain and Portugal, along with the dour
and messianic Protestant sects that settled New England, acted
swiftly to create their own native hagiography and to record
miracles so as to establish that they, too, were working under
divine providence and were building a new Jerusalem. The ordeals of
martyred missionaries, warriors and visionary nuns matched the
weird and sometimes gruesome tales of virgins being torn apart by
wild beasts that inspired the early Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The intertwining of vengeance, genocidal slaughter and slavery
with religious zeal that characterized the beginnings of the
Americas has often been overlooked or minimized in histories of the
period. Now, however, scholars are rediscovering a vast body of
hagiographic literature and the impact it had in the colonizing
process. One of them is Allen Greer, a professor of history at the
University of Toronto, who is organizing the first academic
conference on colonial saints, to be held in May in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   There was, when the Americas were settled, a 1,500-year-old
Christian tradition of writing about saints' lives to inspire and
direct the faithful. Spain, which had just completed an 800-year
crusade to drive the Muslims out of Europe, had refined the image
of the warrior saint. The conquistadors who sailed for the New
World were all reared on stories of Santiago Matamoros, literally
St. James the Moor Killer, who was the patron saint of the Spanish
war against Islam. All would have been familiar with medieval
images showing him on horseback trampling an infidel, which was
reworked to show him trampling an Indian (he became known as
Mataindios or Indian Killer). The Spanish fighters constantly
invoked his name and often equated the battle against the Aztecs
and the Incas with the campaign against the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Jean de Brebeuf, a Jesuit missionary, for example, was tortured
and burned alive, and the Christian mission destroyed, by an
Iroquois force in 1649 during the last part of the Iroquois-Huron
wars. The deaths, venerated in lugubrious popular histories, helped
garner support among the colonists for the decimation of the
Indians who resisted..
</P>
<P>
   While Protestants and Catholics alike used biographies of the
righteous to perpetuate colonization, they diverged widely about
the qualities that should be venerated. Cotton Mather's ``Magnalia
Christi Americana,'' often sounding more like Plutarch than ``The
Little Flowers of St. Francis,'' duly records the lives of pious
ministers and patrician, Moses-like figures _ John Winthrop, for
example _ struggling against the forces of sin. His are male
symbols of order, probity, self-restraint and exemplary leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic saints, however, included martyrs, missionaries, nuns,
aesthetic visionaries, mystics and Indians, blacks and mulattoes,
often from humble backgrounds, who had visions or led pious lives.
``There was more room in Catholic tradition for sacred biographies
of women, as well as men, for veneration of the humble and the
powerful, the colonized races as well as Europeans,'' said Greer.
``But this does not mean that when holding up an image of a saint,
such as Martin de Porres, a mulatto doorman for a monastery in
colonial Peru, that other races were treated any more equally. It
was rather a validation of their humble status. It illustrated a
different conception of what constituted achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a way in which the colonized races, the Indians,
blacks and mixed races, are part of the vision in the Catholic
colonies,'' he continued, comparing them with the view of
Protestant New Englanders. ``They are considered socially inferior,
but not, as in New England, excluded from view.''
</P>
<P>
   But such veneration was always in the service of the campaign to
obliterate traditions and replace them with those imported from
Europe. The stories of saints, martyrs and exemplars of probity and
wisdom, churned out by local printing houses, served to justify the
newly imported culture as well as the barbarity against the local
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The saints became a colonizing tool as well. Many indigenous
people, especially given the persecution and forced conversions,
found it prudent to fuse the imported Catholic saints with their
own deities. Slowly, the transplants began to mutate. Native
saints, even those imported from Europe, began to take on
characteristics peculiar to the New World, and they were joined by
a pantheon of new saints who legitimized the colonial process and
embraced its peculiar elements
</P>
<P>
   ``There were saints brought from the Old World who were
conflated with indigenous deities,'' said Charlene Villasenor
Black, assistant professor of art history at the University of New
Mexico, who has just finished a book on St. Joseph, the patron
saint of Mexico. ``St. Joseph was conflated with the Aztec rain
deity Tlaloc, and he ends up taking over some of the tasks of
Tlaloc. He becomes associated with earthquakes, rain and fertility.
The saint did not have these associations in the Old World. The
Virgin was, as well, conflated with Tonantzin, the major mother
goddess figure of the Aztecs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Bilinkoff, an associate professor of history of the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro, said, ``The colonists
attempted to transplant whole institutions, genres of literature
and religious practices to the New World, but eventually
everything, including questions of race and hierarchy, were mixed
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolution in Haiti in 1791, the only successful slave
revolt in the Americas, led to perhaps the most radical mixture of
religions _ between Catholicism and African Dahomean beliefs. Here,
too, native saints fused with Old World saints, but often the
doubling picked up on particular experiences that were minimized in
the Old World. The veneration of St. Patrick in Haiti, who is tied
with the spirit Danbala, stresses heavily St. Patrick's bondage in
Ireland, a bondage many Haitians understood. The spirit
Ezili-Freda, identified with the Virgin, was also fused with the
goddess of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profane and the sacred, lust and purity, were not opposed,
as in European culture,'' said Joan Dayan, a professor at the
University of Arizona who writes on Haiti. ``There is a two-way
movement between purity and impurity. Ezili-Freda in contemporary
Haiti counts among her devotees prostitutes, virgins and widows.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Old World was slow to acknowledge the revelations of the
New. The first beatified saint of the New World is St. Rosa de
Lima, but this does not take place until the late 17th century,
more than 150 years after the conquest. In Mexico, the Holy Child
Martyrs of Tlaxcala, children martyred by their parents or fellow
villagers for having converted to Christianity, swiftly gained a
following, although the church did not promote the cult. The
Mexican national St. Philip of Jesus, martyred in Japan in the 16th
century and the patron saint of Mexico City, was not canonized
until the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on there was a reluctance to recognize New World
saints,'' said Black, ``but they continued to appear, the cults
bound up with emerging national pride. The emergence of native
saints, the fusion of Old and New World beliefs, were all part of
the establishment of national characteristics that led to
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   This gave to all the religious impulses in the New World a
common thread, one that increasingly defied the interests of their
Old World progenitors. Greer said: ``The way race, gender and
religion in the Americas intertwined can be better understood when
we compare how the different empires took root, rather than
constantly holding them up to Europe. Stories of exemplary
religious figures and saints provide wonderful material for
analyzing this interaction, for the common experiences of all the
colonies.''

a career of her own. His vice president is on the road seeking to
become his successor. Left behind, at least, is Buddy, the
Labrador, who now spends all night with the president when Hillary
Rodham Clinton is away.''(end ital) __ The New York Times, Jan. 19,
2000
 &HT;    Strange.
 &HT;    Strange that my best days here at the house should be his
saddest. Look at me, right here at his side, every night, in the
master-bedroom bed, and this whole place to ourselves now.
 &HT;    No more ``Hillary'' _ kind-but-oh-so-stern,
get-down-off-of-there-this-instant-Mister! Hillary. And no Chelsea;
where's Chelsea?
 &HT;    Just him and me and the nightlong play of his heavy hands upon
my head, and such a good view of wherever this is that we live with
all the white buildings glowing among the trees like, well,
behemoth and delicious-looking bones. Just him and me, finally, and
yet now he hardly ever wants to play.
 &HT;    What's wrong?
 &HT;    (ital)Head tilt.(end ital)
 &HT;    I should know. I'm his Buddy. Buddy is all that I am:
``Bud-dy,'' that simple, two-beat tug on my heart with which he
long ago hooked me, when I was only 3 months, flopping around on
the South Lawn beneath the great loom of him and his lilting,
crackly voice, issuing, with a long, upraised finger, those first,
memorable commands: ``Buddy, sit! Buddy, stay!''
 &HT;    ``Commander.'' ``Commander and Chief.''
 &HT;    I've heard him called this. He's the alpha. I'm sure of that.
But to me he is, above all else, a deeply familiar, visitable
scent. How should I describe it? Sun-dried hay with unmistakable
traces of cooked beef and pickle. That's what I miss most now.
There's a new tincture of worry and sorrow about his essence. He's
not himself, not one with his scent. I can no longer follow him.
 &HT;    The bedroom light is still on. It's getting very late. Hillary
would have had this room dark hours ago. He misses her, I think.
Nothing stirring now out in the house's hallways except the faint
shuffle of security feet and an occasional gash of radio static.
Down with his book, up with the phone again.
 &HT;    The fourth call tonight. Blab, blab, blab, and on and on, rivers
of blab that my brain hasn't nearly enough indents and folds to
absorb but for meaningless, flyaway pieces: ``Gore.'' ``Budget.''
``Barak.'' ``State of the Union.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck.''
 &HT;    (ital)Head tilt.(end ital)
 &HT;    What lame duck? Where? I'm the Labrador. I'll retrieve him. Is
it me? Have I displeased him? If I was to go get my tennis ball
right now and drop it directly into the lap of his sadness, would
that be what he wants?
 &HT;    ``Hey, Buddy.'' His hands again, stroking my ears, fast and
needy, even as he goes on talking, his long fingers playing my head
for a worry bead, all that worry, a whole wobbly world of it,
emptying down through the length of me. Has he more worries than
other masters? Is he like the others of you?
 &HT;    ``Syria.'' ``Assad.'' ``Chappaqua.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck.''
 &HT;    I know what's wrong. We're leaving here soon, aren't we? I can
sense such things, the about-to-happen, even when he means just to
go out for the night, all night these days, the big whoosh and
whine of his whirlybird's blades not sounding again until the early
morning hours, finally lifting me away from the fond fuzz of my
tennis ball for the sound of his footfall.
 &HT;    We're leaving here. For good. I know it. His body has a far
deeper lean to it than that of his other departures. He keeps going
about the house these days, checking the rooms as though looking
for something. What could it be?
 &HT;    I've checked them all. That's my job. To sniff out the furniture
for any signs of revolt, to explore even the unfurnished, orphaned
spaces, so that he can be more secure in them, can sit back in his
chair and do his job, issue his commands, me curled at his feet in
the Oval Office, watching his finger in the air, thinking the whole
world must be sitting, must be poised to stay for him for now.
 &HT;    That's it, isn't it? After all this time, he's about to leave,
wondering who is still listening to him, who has ever really
listened. He has that same steely look now that he gets when I
don't obey.
 &HT;    Blab and blab and blab on: ``Republicans!'' ``Congress!'' ``My
agenda!'' ``Health care!'' Slam goes the phone.
 &HT;    I'm tired. Where is sleep? He hardly sleeps anymore, always
worrying about what he'll leave behind. So many layers and tones it
has, his world. Too many-sided, his brain. It keeps working even in
his sleep, in the dreams that I guard as devotedly as I do his
days, dreams often as riled as my own when I'm chasing something,
chasing so hard that my paws flip faintly across this bed and my
barks bubble up in puffball trails of woofs.
 &HT;    There he goes, finally drifting off now, but still faintly
talking: ``Hillary.'' ``Chelsea.'' ``Legacy.'' ``Lame duck. ...''
 &HT;    Where? Just point, and I'll retrieve him.

CONGREGATIONS STRIVE TO CROSS THE LINES OF RACE AND CULTURE

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ In the 1950s, the Rev. Billy Graham told
Reader's Digest that 11 a.m. Sunday is the most segregated hour of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Although churches are making concerted efforts to diversify
their congregations and leadership, the process has been slow,
church leaders and church-growth experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor inhibiting growth has been overcoming the
cultural differences between services, many leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a great deal of adaptation for an African-American
Baptist to go to a traditional Anglo church because they are not
nearly as expressive,'' said Charles Chaney, a research professor
in missions at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort
Worth. ``And for someone who is Anglo who goes to an
African-American church where there's celebration and joy, it could
be uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, because even churches that are considered multicultural
tend to conduct services in English, many people who speak English
as a second language may just feel more comfortable attending a
mono-cultural church, Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who, hey, they've been speaking English all
week, at least on Sunday they want to hear good ol' Spanish like
it's spoken in heaven,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for St. Matthew Catholic Church in Arlington,
which lost 1,700 Vietnamese members when they moved to their own
building on East Mayfield Road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the church is holding its own in terms of diversity as
Masses become more and more mixed, the Rev. Joe Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   But many say the resistance is not necessarily a negative.
</P>
<P>
   And a church that strives to be diverse may run into problems
when it meshes the cultural differences that make groups unique,
said Sylvester Key, senior pastor of Grace United Methodist Church
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, a predominantly African-American church, does have
members of different cultures. Once headed by an Anglo female
pastor, the church has not tried to create a worship style that is
a conglomerate of the diversity, but instead keeps its
African-American cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to be middle ground, no one's going to identify
with what you're doing,'' Key said. ``We're going to keep our
identity, yes we're going to keep the worship style.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a worship style that appeals to a mixed congregation has
been the major obstacle for the Rev. Steve Drake, who left
Cornerstone Baptist Church in Arlington to form a multicultural
church now meeting in Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tough finding the right type of music, the right
preaching style, to accommodate people who may have grown up with
vastly different church styles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation at Christ Memorial Baptist Church is about 50
percent Anglo and 50 percent African-American, Drake said. He hopes
that with the addition of an Asian staff member, he will be able to
reach that population as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say that it's a Chinese restaurant, but when
you get in and it's soul food, that's false advertising,'' Drake
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, few churches are completely integrated, and many feel
Graham's comments in the 1950s are as relevant today as they were
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience here in Fort Worth is we tend on the whole to be
pretty segregated,'' said Ken McIntosh, executive director of the
Tarrant Area Community of Churches. ``You'll see some individuals
who tend to be ethnically different, but it's not very
noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says some churches have prospered amid diversity. The
Polytechnic Methodist Church in Fort Worth, for example, refers to
itself as ``Tri-ethnic.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the other end of the spectrum, he has heard of a
predominantly African-American church that was willing to hire a
pastor of another denomination in order to continue leadership
under a black pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large churches will have some ethnic diversity,'' he said.
``But the senior leadership seems to be the same as the majority of
the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church has made it a priority to make
several cross- racial appointments in its leadership, said Carolyn
Stephens, director of communications for the Central Texas
Conference of the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is of major importance for the United Methodist
Church,'' she said. ``We've had been particularly successful in
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Episcopal Priority Focus, an initiative started eight
years ago, Bishop Joe Wilson encouraged churches to commit their
energies to building greater sensitivity and joy in diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to become the multicolored family of God, where race
does not divide but broadens perception and experience of his
family,'' he said. ``We cannot know God unless we get to know the
different kinds of people he created.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of a congregation's makeup is dependent on the location of
the church, Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   The most diverse churches tend to be in larger cities. They tend
to grow slowly and they mirror the area they reflect, Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches reflect what is happening in the community.'' Chaney
said. ``It would be very hard in a 99 percent Anglo community or a
99 percent African- American community to develop as much as you
want into a multiracial or multicultural church.''
</P>
<P>
   And though growth for multicultural churches remains slow, it's
steady, said William Merrell, vice president for convention
relations of the Southern Baptist Convention's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite uncommon for me to go to a church that doesn't have
more than one racial group represented,'' Merrell said. ``I do
think there's more interest, not only in starting more
multicultural churches as well as existing churches becoming more
reflective of their communities. People are realizing that what we
typically call ethnic differences are truly skin deep.''

   ARLINGTON _ In the 1950s, the Rev. Billy Graham told Reader's
Digest that 11 a.m. Sunday is the most segregated hour of the week.
Not much has changed. Although churches are making concerted
efforts to diversify their congregations and leadership, the
process has been slow, church leaders and church-growth experts
say. The biggest factor inhibiting growth has been overcoming the
cultural differences between services, many leaders said. By JAIME

HERE THEY COME AGAIN: FISHNETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Feb. 13) 
(jt) 
 By ALEX WITCHEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst present I ever got was a black silk teddy, because it
came from a man I had no interest in. The fact that he gave it to
me was nerve of the highest order _ though clearly, his opinion of
himself far exceeded mine. We had dated only a few times, and I had
kissed him good night _ reluctantly _ on the street, clambering
into a cab. Any cab.
</P>
<P>
   But that's men for you. And lingerie. The two have always seemed
inextricably linked: ``I decide what's sexy. And you wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, says Amanda Diaz, a designer and the spokeswoman
for Frederick's of Hollywood, that traditional bastion of ``bad
girl'' fashion. If Victoria's Secret caters to the fantasy of a
Vassar coed taking it all off at her parents' Park Avenue
apartment, then Frederick's is for the determined starlet who knows
all the angles of the casting couch _ even when it's in the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   But lingerie today is for women's pleasure first, Diaz says. And
maribou baby dolls aside (repopularized by the Austin Powers
movies), Frederick's finds itself at ground zero of one of spring's
biggest fashion trends, the resurgence of the fishnet stocking.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci and Prada have jumped on the look, and Gucci has the idea
_ appropriate to the weather now _ of layering the stockings, solid
color underneath, fishnets on top. Prada fishnets go it alone, for,
yes, it's true, $84 a pair. At Frederick's, where fishnets have
stayed in stock since 1946, a pair sells for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is amused by the trend. ``I hope they're the next
Hula-Hoop,'' she said, leading the way through Frederick's flagship
store on Hollywood Boulevard. ``It was Twiggy in the 60's, Madonna
in the 80's. Every 20 years it comes around again. Women are
wearing open-toed shoes 12 months a year now, so it makes sense.
It's lingerie for the legs.''
</P>
<P>
   I, of course, am old enough to remember being terrorized, in the
preteen departments of the late '60s, by the specter of Twiggy in
fishnets (and everything else she wore), but the people running
fashion today just aren't that old. Next year, they'll probably
revive this year. In the meantime, my legs have never grown that
long or that thin.
</P>
<P>
   But Diaz says that's not the point. She admits without
hesitation to being 51 and a size 14, and says more than a third of
Frederick's business is plus-size. ``Cellulite doesn't matter,
because everyone has it,'' she said. ``If you balance your body,
you will feel fantastic. An hourglass, whether it's a little tiny
one or a big one, is beautiful. A lot of women don't want to be
thin, and men like them the way they are.''
</P>
<P>
   To balance the fishnets, Diaz favors Frederick's H2 O Water Bra,
which has gotten implants so you don't have to. Instead of
silicone, each cup has a packet of oil and water that boosts you a
full size, a visual trick guaranteed to focus the eye. Mine almost
left my head when Diaz showed off a white lace 42DD that she
trumpeted as ``an engineering masterpiece.'' Most astonishing, it
was padded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heavy bust line needs something to sit on,'' she said. ``The
core of Frederick's business is bras and body contouring.'' Indeed,
this is where padded and push-up bras have been sold since the late
1940s, a legacy that Diaz cheerfully continues. She is a bottle
blonde with deep cleavage and bears more than a passing resemblance
to Mae West. Incongruously perhaps, she is also the mother of five
children, ranging in age from 12 to 32, and the wife of a Superior
Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so popular on the cocktail party circuit,'' Diaz said,
laughing. ``A lot of the judges' wives are lawyers or brain
surgeons. Within five minutes of finding out what I do, I'm usually
in the ladies room measuring somebody, looking at a bra cutting
into someone's side.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stroll through the in-store lingerie museum, where the
collection includes everything from Madonna's bustier from the
Who's That Girl tour to the Balconette bra Natalie Wood wore in
``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,'' Diaz helped me pick out my
stockings and sent me on my way.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, with the temperature hovering at 20 and snow
and ice everywhere, I opted for the layered look, but only with a
closed-toe shoe. I had to agree with my husband's pronouncement
that all things considered, ``our health plan just isn't good
enough to risk it.''
</P>
<P>
   My bottom layer was a pair of fire-engine-red suspender
pantyhose from Frederick's, which meant large areas had been cut
out beneath the waistband to simulate the look of garters; I put
black fishnets on over those.
</P>
<P>
   It did look swell, I admit, though of the eight women who
admired them on the subway, half then looked at my black pump, then
up at my face, searching, it seemed, for signs of lunacy. Each of
them was wearing pants and boots or sneakers. I could just imagine
the sneering if the shoes had been open-toed.
</P>
<P>
   These women certainly don't work at Conde Nast, where the
bare-leg look in the dead of winter has been de rigueur for the
last two years, an affectation I've seen copied among other
fashionistas sporting chapped knees and scarred heels. But as Lisa
Pomerantz, the director of public relations and advertising for
Celine points out, that look is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosiery is coming back next fall, starting now with
fishnets,'' she said. ``They're a step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex White, a fashion stylist at W magazine, whose recent photo
spread ``Kinky Business'' featured fishnets, said: ``They are a
fashion classic. Semi-concealing is semi-revealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the layered look won my heart rather than the
fishnets alone. During the summer I can enjoy their too-bare,
hardly-there feeling, but at this time of year I most certainly do
not.
</P>
<P>
   And I must admit that the suspender cut had me on edge most of
the night; since the crotch and much of the backside had been
removed, my hand kept traveling to my behind, thinking that my
skirt had hiked up. Somehow, I found it hard to imagine that a
woman would wear these for her own pleasure; rather, they seem
invented for a man with no sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kessler, the accessories director at Vogue, says
fishnets are heralding the return of hosiery in general (at least
for the people who've been going without).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishnets give the sexiness of the bare leg without the bare
leg,'' she said. ``Gucci showed it with the most basic looks and
always with a skirt length just above the knee, never that
short-skirt `sex kitten' look. The idea of the lady is coming back
for fall, and fishnets let you do that without looking like your
mom. Their appeal in general is to sexy-up your look.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for that. But when this lady is a tramp, she'd rather do
the shopping herself. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suzanne Somers knew to keep them waiting. On
Wednesday night, inside the Kit Kat Klub near Times Square, the air
jingled with anticipation _ and costume jewelry. More than 150
guests, who had been invited to a private party she said she was
giving to ``thank everyone who had supported me throughout the
years,'' were buzzing and nibbling hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   Though best known for her role as Chrissy, the dumb blonde on
``Three's Co.,'' Somers has a brain for business and a genius for
public relations. She was not promoting a book or project, but
giving a goodwill shindig merely to celebrate her mini-empire,
including confessional books on dieting and recovering from
childhood trauma; a jewelry line for the Home Shopping Network;
television roles; and, of course, infomercials for the ThighMaster.
</P>
<P>
   In black leather pants and a black skinny-ribbed top, she
appeared at 7 p.m. and milled among her guests, most of whom were
connected to her through her businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There were top editors from Crown Publishers, which has put out
several of her books, including the most recent, ``365 Ways to
Change Your Life''; marketing wizards responsible for the
near-iconic status of the ThighMaster; and the man who helps Somers
find manufacturers for the flashy jewelry she pitches.
</P>
<P>
   A few celebrities were on hand, like Florence Henderson and
Linda Ellerbee, who was there with a film crew to shoot footage for
an ``Intimate Portrait'' segment she is producing about Somers for
Lifetime Television. Somers charmed editors from magazines like
Ladies' Home Journal and Women's World.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea how it makes me feel to be with all of you
who are so important to me,'' she said, flashing her trademark
girlish grin as she entered into a group hug.
</P>
<P>
   While most of those there were in their 40s or 50s, Somers, 53,
had also attracted younger fans, who see her as a retro idol.
``She's a '70s sex symbol cum '80s role model,'' said Hillary
Borton, 25, an editor at Penguin Putnam, which has published
Somers.
</P>
<P>
   Borton's dapper date, Michael Driscoll, 26, sipped a manhattan
and swore that one of his most treasured possessions is an
autographed copy of Somers' 1973 book of poems, ``Touch Me.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8, Somers appeared on a small stage, in a skintight,
near-transparent gown that was strategically adorned with
rhinestones. It made sliding sex-kittenishly onto the piano a bit
hard. Backed by a jazz ensemble, she belted out an hourlong set of
standards with Las Vegas verve.
</P>
<P>
   Her patter wasn't exactly Dean Martin, but she had her own goofy
style. She tossed a ThighMaster into the audience as a memento. She
joked that Hillary Rodham Clinton had handled ``the thing'' wrong.
``I would have hired my own intern,'' she said. ``Lorena Bobbitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway, she coaxed Crown's boyish president, Chip Gibson, onto
the stage and crooned to him Marilyn Monroe-style, ``I Don't Know
Why I Love You Like I Do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her final number, ``New York State of Mind,'' was met with a
standing ovation. She and her husband, Alan Hamel, then slipped out
for dinner at the Royalton.
</P>
<P>
   Somers sweetly cajoled the maitre d'hotel into putting two
tables together in the back alcove to accommodate her party of 12,
including publicists and friends who had flown in for her fete.
Then she asked them to lower the lights and to bring some votive
candles, jokingly playing the diva. Of course, they did. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The Middle Atlantic states will be noticeably cooler Saturday as
a cold front sweeps across the region, accompanied by showers and
some light snow in places. A wave of low pressure on this front
will bring periods of light rain to the Carolinas as onshore winds
direct moist air inland. In addition, showers will develop ahead of
the front in the Southeast. To the north, light snow will fall in
western Virginia and the West Virginia mountains. The snow will mix
with ice in the Shenandoah Valley where cold air will be trapped
beneath a layer of warm, moist air.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will surge into the Northeast, accompanied by
abundant sunshine and cool conditions. Farther to the west, a cold
front will clip the northern Plains and the northern Great Lakes,
bringing a period of steady but light snow. Partly cloudy skies and
light breezes will cover most of the central Plains where readings
will be seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   There will be numerous patches of snow across the Rocky
Mountains as low pressure traverses the region. In the northern
Rockies, winds will be directed up the east-facing slopes, leading
to snows in central Montana and northeastern Wyoming. Farther
south, Pacific air will stream inland, bringing snows to the
Wasatch and the northern mountains of Arizona. Periods of snow will
also fall in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at lower elevations, there will be showers in
southern Arizona and southern California. Clouds will cover much of
the Pacific Northwest, save for some breaks east of the Cascades
and the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Going Through a Phase
</P>
<P>
   During winter, big storms in the East often result when a
disturbance in the cold northern branch of the jet stream merges
with a disturbance in a moist southern branch. Meteorologists call
such a complex merger ``phasing.'' The computer models that attempt
to simulate atmospheric motions are notorious for too eagerly
phasing the two branches whenever there is opportunity for a
merger. The fizzled storm that the models slated for the East this
weekend was an example of the computer being overeager.

FORBES' EXIT CLEARS WAY FOR MCCAIN AND BUSH TO FIGHT FOR TRUE GOP
VOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best comment on the demise of Steve Forbes' presidential
campaign was disseminated by The Associated Press, which quoted the
executive director of a group that studies the financing of
campaigns: ``Never has so much been spent with so little in
return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will go down in the annals of presidential politics as a
spectacular example of the dictum that just throwing money at an
election doesn't win you an office,'' said Larry Makinson of the
Center for Responsive Politics. ``It's a lesson that seems to be an
expensive one for millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Ask Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offered a different take on his $60 million-plus
investment in two futile campaigns for the Republican presidential
nomination. He said the money was well-spent because he ``created a
new conservative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure he did. And Perot gets credit for balancing the federal
budget because he railed about deficit spending in two pointless
campaigns for president.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. People who set fire to all that money are probably
entitled to rationalize the spending any way they want to _ even
though the rest of us know that self-aggrandizing egomaniacs such
as Forbes and Perot contribute nothing of value to the political
process in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Forbes has become the seventh Republican to bail out of
this year's race, the pundits are pondering the impact of his
departure on the remaining candidates. Most of the experts figure
that the impact will be minimal or nonexistent because Forbes would
have commanded even less voter support in upcoming primaries than
he did in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That's an accurate assessment, as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes' decision to quit the race will have an effect
because it helps clear the field for George W. Bush and John McCain
to confront each other without the annoying distractions created by
marginal candidates. With Forbes gone, the only marginal candidate
still standing is Alan Keyes _ and even the self-righteous Keyes
will surely realize before long that he's making a nuisance of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Bush-McCain showdown has begun, and Republican
voters must seriously come to grips with the challenge of choosing
a candidate to carry their party's banner into the November
election against the Democrats. The operative words here are
``Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The media and the pollsters are fixated on McCain's popularity
among Democrats and independents, but Democrats and independents do
not choose Republican nominees for president. Republicans choose
Republican nominees for president.
</P>
<P>
   So. Once these early primaries that allow and even encourage
capricious party-switching are out of the way, Bush and McCain will
settle down to the task of winning Republican votes in Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   All these left-leaning commentators who are beating the drum for
McCain would like nothing better than to see both major political
parties nominate presidential candidates who espouse liberal
causes. The Democrats will give them what they want in the person
of either Al Gore or Bill Bradley; but Republicans, believe it or
not, do not share the media's view that the only good candidate is
a liberal candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to be represented in the general election by a
conservative nominee, which puts McCain at a colossal disadvantage
as the GOP race proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain might be a conservative, but he's been pandering to
liberals in his effort to draw Democrats and independents into
Republican primaries. He'll be hard-pressed in coming weeks to
convincingly portray himself as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has forthrightly proclaimed his conservatism
from the beginning. He is the natural choice for real Republicans
in real Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans get down to the serious business of choosing
their candidate for president, McCain's independent/Democrat-driven
surge will melt faster than a New Hampshire snowball in the warm
sun of Texas.

&HT;     PHIL JACKSON: PART ZEN, PART TEFLON 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In the weeks leading up to the NBA All-Star
Game, Phil Jackson did a lot of winking and joking about wanting to
wriggle out of coaching the team from the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time I watched an All-Star Game if I
wasn't coaching in it,'' he said. ``I just don't find them
interesting, in any sport. Maybe in baseball, where you have two
individual players competing against each other. But in basketball,
you can't play the game the way it's meant to be played, so I don't
find it very appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   He started to say something else, then stopped himself. ``I
already got into trouble the last time I talked about this,'' he
said, half-grinning. He nodded when asked whether he had heard from
league headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ended up stuck with the coaching job anyway, despite his
own reluctance, despite the fact that the league can't use any of
his candid comments for promotional material. His team, the Los
Angeles Lakers, had the best record in the Western Conference at
the deadline for picking coaches to come to All-Star Weekend in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't escape his own success, the burden of coaching
stardom. At least, that's the way he's playing it. Pat Riley does
the same thing, arguing that the All-Star Game is a drain on his
energy, a nuisance, a task he was just as happy to see turned over
to his former protege, Jeff Van Gundy of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting posture, disdaining the rewards of greatness
because they don't advance a team agenda. At the same time, by
belittling one of the NBA's showpieces, Jackson is tweaking
authority figures. As the educators say these days, he is acting
out.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a bit of a contradiction from a man who bills himself
as a teacher, who has to exercise authority over some of the most
exasperating young stars in the sport. But one of Jackson's prime
assets has always been his ability to convey the message that he
has control, not because someone made him a head coach, not because
he has molded himself into a faux paternal figure or military man
like so many other coaches, and not because he believes in
respecting authority for authority's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's power comes from his own belief that he deserves it,
that he can exert control without really trying. His image as a Zen
master coach has become a pathetic cliche, belied by the fact that
he can be a rigorous taskmaster, as intimidating as a Riley or a
Bill Parcells, as tough as P.J. Carlesimo tried to be.

   On the sidelines of Lakers games, Jackson does not harp or pace
frantically throughout the game. But if Kobe Bryant interrupts the
harmony of the game with one of his maddening Lone Ranger riffs, he
can count on a stern glare from Jackson. Shaquille O'Neal, too,
knows that he will face the same. Reporters who have covered the
team for a while have observed that Bryant tries to duck Jackson's
gaze, while O'Neal seems almost to enjoy the scrutiny, like a
teen-ager eager for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris, the first coach to cope with the unwieldy Kobe-Shaq
phenomenon, tried to be an educating coach, to do the same things
that Jackson does. It didn't work, because Harris didn't have their
respect, their ears, their attention.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson got that immediately. Six championship rings and Michael
Jordan's proclaimed devotion will do that for a coach, give him
instant credibility. But with Jackson, the question always remains:
Did he make the Bulls what they were, or was Phil Jackson, Zen
Leader, simply an image spun out of remnants of Jordan's magic?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it might not matter which is true, or if it's a
combination of both. Cliches become cliches for a reason. The Zen
master coach is real if people believe he is, because (warning:
more cliches ahead) perception is reality and success breeds
success.
</P>
<P>
   Would Jackson have been a championship coach without Jordan?
It's pointless to answer that except by posing another question:
How many coaches could let Jordan flourish, let him be The Man all
the while espousing a triangle offense intended to distribute the
ball to everyone?
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people who have argued that Jackson's
coaching philosophy is more shtick than anything else. The office
decorated with Native-American artifacts. The annual bestowing of
books on each player. The intellectualization of basketball, an
attempt to take it to a higher plane that would come across as
geekiness in most men. All of these traits have been ridiculed at
one time or another, as completely out of touch and hopelessly
irrelevant to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, a disciple of the hard-edged Riley, Jackson's leading
rival for Alpha Coach of the NBA, has sarcastically referred to the
Lakers coach as ``Big Chief Triangle.'' Reporters have pointed out
that most of Jackson's literary offerings go unread.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said he doesn't demand that the players read the
books. He gave some of Nietzsche's writings to O'Neal because he
wanted him to understand that there was a world broader than the
basketball court, greater challenges than putting together a
recording contract.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson comes across as pedantic, a parody of a Zen master
more than the real thing, it doesn't really matter. In the end, he
has results, successes that validate whatever image he chooses to
project. In his first few months with the Lakers, he already has
turned O'Neal into a more complete player, persuading him to play
defense with passion. Bryant still hasn't surrendered his
self-destructive audacity, his belief that he has to do things all
on his own. But Jordan had that tendency once, and look what
happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Four elements of the Bulls' success illustrate Jackson's
influence. The first is the winning shot of the 1993 NBA Finals.
Before the ball ended up in John Paxson's hand, every single Bull
had touched it on that possession. They weren't trying to get the
ball to Jordan. They were doing what their coach wanted, playing a
team game. This shouldn't have been so extraordinary, but in the
modern NBA, it was a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The second example is the winning shot of the 1997 Finals, when
Jordan swung the ball out to Steve Kerr and let him deliver the
knockout punch to the Jazz. If the Bulls were only Jordan, Jordan,
Jordan, how did that happen?
</P>
<P>
   Third, even in his team's greatest moment of weakness, The
Crisis of 1.8 Seconds, Jackson demonstrated uncommon poise. In
1994, the first year of Jordan's sabbatical from basketball,
Scottie Pippen assumed that he had become The Man. During a timeout
with 1.8 seconds left in a playoff game, Pippen heard Jackson call
for a play that gave Toni Kukoc the last shot. He refused to go
back into the game, one of the grand mutinies in professional
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Jackson did not tell Pippen that he had committed the
cardinal sin of team sports. The coach let the other Bulls tell
Pippen, and Bill Cartwright's tears spoke more about betrayal than
any coach ever could.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that Jackson did not have control over Pippen in
the critical moment, most coaches would have faltered afterward. At
any level _ high school, college, pro, recreation league _
Jackson's decision to let the team explain Pippen's failures would
have been the perfect coaching response.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth example also stems from how Jackson coped with loss
of control. The example is Dennis Rodman. His practice-skipping,
his forays to Vegas in the middle of the postseason, his boorish
behavior on the court all seemed antithetical to Jackson's style of
coaching. But he took advantage of Rodman's unique defensive skills
and did not tug too hard as he tried to rein Rodman in. If Jackson
had fought harder with Rodman, the limits of his control would have
been revealed, and he could have been weakened as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Pippen's rebellion and Rodman's defiance could
have damaged Jackson's reputation, but he is the Teflon Coach. He
has a deep reservoir of hipness, fed by his relationships with two
of the most riveting characters ever to play in the NBA _ Jordan
and Bill Bradley, the Knick/Rhodes scholar/senator/presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is the boss who stood up to an executive, who refused to
bow to Jerry Krause. He deliberately antagonizes NBA management,
apparently for the fun of it. In recent weeks, he has worn Bradley
for President paraphernalia on national television just to see
whether the NBA or NBC will ask him to stifle his political
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, in Los Angeles, Jackson's style seems to be holding up.
Despite their recent swoon, the Lakers are playing the best
basketball of the brief Kobe-Shaq era.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may have strayed too far from his hippie roots by
publicly questioning whether rap music decreases attention spans.
After all, a man of his generation, a Grateful Dead devotee,
shouldn't take the risk of sounding like 1960s parents who wailed
that rock 'n' roll was undermining their children's values.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what book he would give to Jackson if he had the chance,
Bryant said, with a wry grin, that he would find a history of
hip-hop music. He wants to educate the educator.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson has nonetheless made an impression on the
21-year-old. Bryant announced two weeks ago that he would skip the
slam-dunk contest at this weekend's All-Star Game. He is the
defending slam-dunk champ, but he said that the contest, the
antithesis of team play, would detract from his larger goals.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, upon hearing the news, looked mildly surprised, and
pleased. ``I didn't talk to him about that specifically,'' the
coach said. ``But this is in keeping with the messages we've been
trying to send.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll both be here this weekend, in sync in one respect.
They're holding back some of themselves from All-Star Weekend.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot rests on just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 11 million registered voters in New York state, 3
percent to 11 percent of them tell pollsters that they have not yet
made up their minds about the race for U.S. Senate. The figure is
surprisingly small this early in an election campaign, perhaps
because the two candidates, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Hillary Rodham Clinton, are celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The undecided voters are registered in both major parties, or no
party, or they cannot remember which party. Some yearn for a third
choice, a candidate on a white horse. Some have single-minded
concerns like the upstate economy or campaign finance reform. One
voter, perhaps exaggerating, says he simply wants to hear a
candidate say the word ``lymphoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the thinking of these voters, and winning them
over, will be crucial to both campaigns, but no easy task. The
calculus behind a decision to support a candidate can have as much
to do with personal circumstances and gut feelings as with
political philosophy and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these undecided voters, culled from respondents to
recent New York Times/CBS News polls, have agreed to discuss their
decision-making as the campaign unfolds. Their willingness to do so
suggests they are not typical, if there is such a thing, and their
participation could alter their thinking about the campaign. But,
with those caveats, they will offer a window in the coming months
into the minds of the handful of voters who could decide this race.
</P>
<P>
   Well-Informed, And Cynical
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Barbara Smith of Saugerties speak the familiar, even
fashionable, language of voter cynicism. But for them, skepticism
is no pose. Their lives are so hard, their status so lowly, that
they do not expect much from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our end of the food chain, nothing they say or do
matters,'' said Mr. Smith, 41, a customer service manager at
Wal-Mart and the embodiment of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths scrape by, barely. His current job, at $18,000 a
year, is a step up from his last, at a convenience store, because
he now has health insurance and the opportunity for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   But repairs are out of the question at the house they rent on an
unpaved street in a rundown part of town known as ``the Gut.'' And
the Smiths do without a car. Their old one died, and their ``new''
'88 Ford Tempo needs $600 in repairs, which the Smiths do not have.
</P>
<P>
   They are well-informed voters, he a registered Democrat and she
a Republican. But they are not party loyalists: Mr. Smith twice
voted for Ross Perot, not in protest but because he believed the
blunt industrialist had something to offer people like him.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Smith, who works part time stuffing advertising inserts
into the local newspaper, chose Charles E. Schumer in the last
Senate race because he seemed to have a good heart.
</P>
<P>
   In this race, for the seat being vacated by the retirement of
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, they see little but negative
qualities in either candidate and wish for a surprise third option.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is ``too mean, too harsh,'' said Mrs. Smith, 53, who is
stooped by osteoporosis. ``It's the old U.S. attorney coming out in
him,'' her husband agreed. ``He doesn't know when to back off or
give in.'' As for the first lady, both say she has much to
overcome. ``There's Whitewater, Travelgate, her husband, the fact
that she's imported, so to speak,'' said Mr. Smith, who moves
stiffly on a lame leg, the result of a childhood injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he runs New York and the way she just decides to come
here and set up residence, I get the feeling we're dealing with
superior beings, and you can put that in quotes,'' he said.
``People like us, trying to make ends meet, that's who they should
answer to. But I don't get the impression they care.''
</P>
<P>
   `Isn't There Anybody Else?'
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Beck, a guidance coordinator at a special education
school on Long Island, is also hoping that ``somebody will ride in
on a white horse'' and offer an alternative. ``Isn't there anybody
else out there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Beck says he is not particularly interested in ideology or party
affiliation and makes his political choices in a personal way. He
is at least as interested in a candidate's qualities as in policy
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1992 presidential election, he voted for Bill Clinton,
because ``he made sense'' and ``looked like a grass-roots
politician'' _ without George Bush's ``patrician'' airs. In 1996,
he chose Bob Dole because of Clinton's personal indiscretions.
``He's a lounge lizard type of guy,'' Beck said. ``Can't you just
see him in a Holiday Inn dancing to `Feelings'?''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, 47 and divorced, sees good in both candidates. ``If you
could take Hillary and Rudy and combine their best attributes,
you'd have a great senator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But each, in his mind, also has huge deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is ``well-organized, has an excellent political mind
and a great staff,'' Beck said. `But his management style is `My
way or the highway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets things done, no doubt about it. But he gets it done by
not caring who he steps on. He's very callous in the way he treats
people. You can get rid of the squeegee guys in a more humanistic
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is ``clearly in the forefront,'' he says, on issues
close to Beck's heart, like education and mental health. But he
doubts that a stranger to New York can ``know the problems and the
pluses'' of the state. He cites, as an example, the challenge of
keeping the Long Island economy booming should the current bubble
of prosperity burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do, to an extent, think about the carpetbagger thing,'' said
Beck, who lives in his childhood home in Bethpage and continues to
frequent sporting events there, sometimes as a coach or referee.
``If the Democratic Party had a viable candidate who was
charismatic and could raise money, I doubt she would even get the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Taking Offense At Corruption &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Taggart, a 41-year-old vice president at Standard &AMP; Poor's,
says he is offended by the corruption of the American political
system. The candidate who interests him most this political season
is Sen. John McCain, the Republican insurgent who has built his
candidacy for president around the issue of campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting campaign contributions, in what is expected to be
the most expensive Senate race in history, is what Taggart cares
about. And he doubts that either Giuliani or Clinton, vying for a
seat in what he calls the ``special interest branch of
government,'' will make campaign finance reform a Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Taggart, a father of two from Cortlandt Manor in northern
Westchester County, sees little to like in either Senate candidate.
``I wouldn't want to say they are monstrous,'' he said. ``But they
are both very unlikable people.''
</P>
<P>
   He appreciates Giuliani's accomplishments in making New York
City a more orderly place and commends him as a ``take-charge
person'' compared with his predecessor, David Dinkins, ``who was
laid back to the point of doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor chooses the wrong battles, Taggart said: rousting
the homeless from the sidewalks, ticketing jaywalkers, prohibiting
protests on the steps of City Hall. Referring to Giuliani's
``relationship management skills,'' Taggart wonders ``how somebody
who is such a bully will adapt to a consensus-building
environment'' _ the Senate _ ``where he doesn't always have the
right of way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady is just as easy to scorn, he said _ for small
matters like whether she roots for the Yankees or the Cubs,
medium-size matters like whether she lives on Old House Lane or on
Pennsylvania Avenue and large matters like whether she made money
in questionable stock deals. Lumping Clinton with her husband,
Taggart calls them ``the couple that never learns their lessons,''
continuing to ``live in a totally unconscious way'' despite a
succession of scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to both Senate candidates, he asked: ``Why reward that
type of person? I almost don't want to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstate, Tired Of Being Ignored &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upstate, in the land of abandoned carpet mills and toy
factories, politics matters. The old industrial cities are hurting,
untouched by the prosperity in the metropolitan region. And voters,
of all political stripes, are looking for government to pay
attention, relieve their pain.
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam, Bob and Cathy Harrison are insulated from economic
distress because of their professions _ he is a high school history
teacher and she is a nurse. But they were born and raised in these
parts, are committed to the well-being of their community and sick
of being ignored by downstate politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrisons, both in their late 40s, with two teen-agers,
usually vote Republican. But they took a liking to the first lady
during her summer visits upstate and think her connections in the
nation's capital could help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to find incentives to get industry back?'' Mr.
Harrison asked. ``We need help from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harrisons recall with excitement Clinton's appearance at a
Labor Day parade in Albany, where their daughter played the flute
in a high school band. The first lady was accompanied by the
Harrisons' neighbor, their state assemblyman. He whispered
something in her ear and she flashed a thumbs up at 14-year-old
Kristin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the ultimate baby-kissing, I know,'' Mr. Harrison said,
as if ashamed that he enjoyed it. ``But she's showing some
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Harrison said he was automatically suspicious of someone
like Giuliani, who made his mark south of New York's Mason-Dixon
line. He mentioned a family trip to Disney World, where fellow
tourists identified New Yorkers by how pushy they were. ``We always
say we're from  &UR; upstate &LR;  New York,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Harrison, citing the turnaround in New York City during
the mayor's tenure, was more forgiving. After all, she felt
perfectly safe in Manhattan last spring during her daughter's class
trip to see ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was New Year's Eve in Times Square, which she saw
on television. ``It was a pressure situation and Giuliani came
through,'' she said. ``With him being _ what's the word? _
pig-headed, wouldn't he fight for us if he knew what we needed?''
</P>
<P>
   When Illness Is the Only Issue
</P>
<P>
   Karl Schwartz has only one thing on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Joanne, has non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and Mr. Schwartz, a
self-employed computer consultant, has spent the last five years
learning everything he can about her disease, its treatments and
its causes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, 47, has never voted. She dislikes them all, she
explained. But her husband goes to the polls each Election Day,
usually voting Democratic. He made an exception, and does not
regret it, in choosing Giuliani over Dinkins. ``I respect the idea
of enforcing little rules,'' Schwartz said of the mayor's campaigns
against urban nuisances. ``That's a good sane position to take.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days he cares little about the quality of life in New
York City. Or about crime rates or race relations. Even the havoc
in the New York City school system, where he once taught, is a
minor ripple next to his wife's illness. And Giuliani has never
spoken a word about cancer research or qualifications for drug
trials, at least not in Schwartz's hearing or in any of the
publications, mainstream and otherwise, that he reads on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Schwartz gives a slight edge to Clinton. Despite the failure
of her plan for universal medical coverage, Mr. Schwartz has no
doubt that the first lady knows all about the ins and outs of
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But he has gone way beyond that into the minutiae of his wife's
disease, and he wants a candidate who cares about the details as
much as he does. He said he would gallop to the nearest polling
place on Staten Island, where he lives and works in a tidy cottage
near Raritan Bay, if one or the other would say the word
``lymphoma.'' Or talk about the Food and Drug Administration, the
agency that sets criteria for drug trials, for which his wife has
been ruled ineligible. Or issue a position paper on the
environmental causes of cancer or the safety of foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues for a senator,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ``But
you're considered on the fringe if you're concerned about these
things.''

   OFFICE-TRENDS _ ATLANTA _ MunicipalTrade.Com has signed for the
top floor of the Flatiron building downtown. Although the lease is
small it is significant. The startup is paying part of its rent to
developer Jim Cumming with warrants to buy future stock before it
is offered to the public. The trend has fueled the office markets
in San Francisco and likely will start the trend here. Cumming said
it is the first time he has done it or heard it be done in Atlanta.
It also helps developers get past a dilemma: Should they gamble on
leasing space to a company with no credit history. The same type of
dilemma arises even with well-known tech companies such as ETrade.

   OFFICE-TRENDS _ ATLANTA _ MunicipalTrade.Com has signed for the
top floor of the Flatiron building downtown. Although the lease is
small it is significant. The startup is paying part of its rent to
developer Jim Cumming with warrants to buy future stock before it
is offered to the public. The trend has fueled the office markets
in San Francisco and likely will start the trend here. Cumming said
it is the first time he has done it or heard it be done in Atlanta.
It also helps developers get past a dilemma: Should they gamble on
leasing space to a company with no credit history. The same type of
dilemma arises even with well-known tech companies such as ETrade.

 UNDATED: these things.''

   Day-to-Day Life Before Politics
</P>
<P>
   For some people, politics doesn't matter much. Their lives are
good, their problems few and personal, and their days stretched
full with new careers, new babies, new houses.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it is for Brad Easterbrook and Kim Shaunesey, both
33 and parents of an infant daughter. Ask this couple what they
need and they will tell you: a shorter commute; lower property
taxes; weekends together; more sleep. These are not issues that
United States senators can do much about.
</P>
<P>
   Easterbrook is the pro for tennis and other court sports at the
Short Hills Club in New Jersey. Shaunesey is clinical coordinator
for disturbed children at a hospital in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate these far-flung careers, they chose to live in
between, in Rye Brook in Westchester County. Now Easterbrook
commutes 90 minutes each way and his wife 45 minutes. He works
every day except Monday, until 8 at night. She works four days,
including Monday. This saves money on child care, but the savings
is more than eaten up by their property taxes _ $12,000 a year for
a routine three-bedroom raised ranch on a quarter acre. It also
means that they rarely see each other awake.
</P>
<P>
   So commonplace concerns trump politics. ``We're too involved in
our own lives,'' said Easterbrook, a registered Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Their thoughts on the campaign come haltingly. Easterbrook is a
fan of Giuliani because ``the city is definitely a better place to
be.'' He has heard that crime reductions might have been a result
of heavy-handed tactics, but he dismisses that as media
exaggeration. Plus, Clinton's strong suits are ``touchy feely
things'' that don't interest him. He sees Giuliani as a politician
with a clear agenda. ``Guys with simpler approaches tend to make
things happen better than guys who think too much,'' he said. But
he's not sure Giuliani's style would work in the Senate, and
``that's where my undecidedness lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaunesey knows she is registered but isn't sure of her party
affiliation. ``Probably Republican,'' she said, with the distracted
air of a sleep-deprived mother.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, she said, is ``a hothead,'' who ``overreacts and makes
things a huge deal.'' She notes that ``at least Hillary treats
everyone nicely.'' But, Shaunesey said, the first lady ``is so far
removed from what my life is, I don't see how she can represent me.
Do you think Hillary washes her own floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty May Be More Pressing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politics can also take a back seat to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Clinton, a 44-year-old Buffalo Democrat, barely noticed
that the first lady was in town twice in recent weeks. Struggling
to make ends meet as she eases her way off welfare, Clinton _ no
relation to the president _ has more pressing matters on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   For her, the political visits came on days like any other:
waiting in a drift of dirty snow for the bus that would take her to
her job as a school monitor; wheezing with asthma and listening to
her 13-year-old daughter do the same; worrying about her grown son,
a high school dropout, and his girlfriend, pregnant with their
second child, with four others under the age of 5 scattered in
foster care; trying to find a ride to her weekly Bible study class.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Clinton does not whine about her lot and, in fact, says
she has much to be thankful for. She owns her two-story house on
Buffalo's east side, where her parents raised one son and eight
daughters. Her late father, a janitor at the post office for 30
years, ``made excellent money,'' Clinton said. She hopes to do the
same and praises the decision to phase out welfare.
</P>
<P>
   At her current job she nets $488 a month, compared with $230
from Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Briefly, as a
secretary for a state drug program that lost its funding, she
brought home $940 a month. She attends a training center where she
is polishing her computer skills, hoping for another office job.
She continues to get food stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that to choose a candidate this early in the
campaign would be ``taking wild guesses.'' She simply doesn't know
enough. ``I have to hear these people speak on different
subjects,'' she said. She has every intention of voting, having
missed only one election that she can recall, the last presidential
contest, when she was recovering from a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The issue she cares about most is how to move people from
welfare to work. Will they get help finding a better job? How long
will they remain eligible for food stamps? Will there be affordable
health care when they no longer qualify for Medicaid?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she would shape her views from television and
``word of mouth,'' especially discussions with her elderly
next-door neighbor, whom she generally escorts to the polls, for
safety in a rough neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``She reads the paper faithfully,'' Clinton said of her
neighbor, ``and is always telling me something about something.''

 &HT;    Unlike the faithful, churches hoard power
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The church is its own worst enemy. The
institution constantly undermines the witness of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Denomination doesn't seem to matter. Catholic, Protestant and
Orthodox are, in apostasy at least, alike.
</P>
<P>
   While many church members serve the world, the institutions seek
power and property in the name of a Lord who dismissed both as
idolatrous temptations. They urge the faithful to trust God's
promise but can't trust it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Christ were not risen from the dead, we would say that he
is turning in his grave,'' said Nobel prize-winning Bishop Desmond
Tutu in a recent sermon from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s old
pulpit at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu cited the ongoing chaos at the place of the Crucifixion.
Six Christian denominations mutually govern the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It took them three years to agree to replace a sewer cover, Tutu
said. Each group fears loss of power to another. They mutually
postpone decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to the building have been kept by a Muslim family since
the Middle Ages. The governing churches can't trust each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church just demonstrated an extraordinary
example of religious greed. The Orthodox Church in Exile was
created at the time of the Communist Revolution, took root in the
West and dismissed the Orthodox Church in Moscow as a tool of the
Kremlin. They have since maintained the church's property in the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Church in Moscow, which rejects the exiled bunch, wants
the buildings for themselves. Politics, not faith, will resolve the
issue. Christian individuals and groups do try to serve the Gospel.
Members of Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church in West Palm Beach
are teaching kids to read. Roman Catholics and Protestants serve
the poor at St. George's Episcopal Church in Riviera Beach. They _
and countless others _ follow their Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus proclaimed a Gospel of service, trust in God and the power
of weakness. He lived that message and died for it. The church
teaches that God raised him from the dead for his faithfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Many people give life to that good news, but no institutional
church seems willing to die for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lutherans and Episcopalians are about to merge, but it is not a
merger. Everything will be interchangeable, clergy, sacraments,
ministry, buildings and theology, but the power structure of each
institution will continue independently.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Pope Pious XII placed the safety of the Roman
Catholic Church above attempts to save Jews in World War II.
Apparently, he was unwilling to put the church at risk. But that is
precisely where it is meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Churches cannot seem to live by the Gospel they exist to
proclaim. That requires being a servant and trusting God.
</P>
<P>
   And churches _ in sharp contrast to countless religious
individuals _ seldom take such risks.

 &HT;    Leads breathe life, heart into Jefferson's illicit love
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If political scandals were ranked on a
scale of one to 10, the illicit affair between Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings would be a 25.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it was a doozy, all right. He was white, she was black. He
was the nation's president, she was a slave. He was free, she
wasn't. He was ... well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year liaison produced six children. The Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation, keepers of Jefferson's legacy, however, was
always cool to the idea of a relationship. But recent DNA evidence
revealed that Jefferson had indeed fathered at least one of
Hemings' children. After conducting its own exhaustive study, the
foundation admitted there was a ``strong likelihood'' all six
children were fathered by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   One of America's most complex _ and controversial _ affairs
boasts all the steamy elements networks love: passionate sex,
forbidden romance, a gorgeous babe. But if you think ``Sally
Hemings: An American Scandal'' turns the Jefferson-Hemings
relationship into one of those sordid affairs you see in a trashy
Cinemax film, you'd be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   While there are such requisite love story lines as, ``When I'm
with you, I feel again,'' ``Sally Hemings'' is a surprisingly
moving and heartfelt film that handles the secret love affair with
quiet dignity and delicate grace. While no one really knows how
much Jefferson loved Hemings _ or if he loved her at all _ CBS'
four-hour miniseries will certainly make you believe he did.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Neill (``Jurassic Park'') beautifully humanizes the
enigma-riddled Jefferson, playing him as a tortured soul who knows
his actions are reprehensible, but remains unable to contain his
emotions. He's a smitten schoolboy, for instance, while gazing
lovingly at Hemings during a high society ball.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. newcomer Carmen Ejogo wonderfully embodies
Hemings' deep hurt and pain in her soulful eyes. When Hemings tells
a jealous Jefferson, ``You don't have to hurt me, you own me,'' the
moment is somehow both poignant and repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Andrews' (``Why Do Fools Fall In Love'') evenhanded script
is essentially a bittersweet love story that paints a fairly
realistic portrait of how the Jefferson-Hemings relationship may
have happened. Charles Haid's (``Buffalo Soldiers'') careful
direction lets the story unfold slowly and convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fine turns from Neill and Ejogo, Mare Winningham
is strong as Jefferson's fiercely protective daughter, Martha. Rene
Auberjonoiis is appropriately sleazy as James Callender, the smarmy
journalist hellbent on blackmailing Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Neill and Ejogo who carry ``Sally Hemings'' by
breathing life into these long dead, yet still fascinating,
characters.

 &HT;    BLACK GROUPS SAY CLINTON ORDER ON TOXIC SITES NOT ENFORCED
 &HT;    440&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of African Americans living in areas with
federally owned facilities are becoming ill despite an presidential
order intended to help protect poor communities against toxic
contamination, black environmental groups said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said at a news conference that African American
children are suffering from higher than average rates of cancer,
respiratory ailments, birth defects and other illnesses as a result
of being exposed to nuclear weapons production plants, chemical
weapons incinerators and military bases, although they have been
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies have not complied with Executive Order 12898,
which President Clinton issued a six years ago, according to
National People of Color and Disenfranchised Communities
Environmental Health Network (NPCDC) and the Interim National Black
Environmental and Economic Justice Coordinating Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That order directed federal agencies to develop by March 1995 an
environmental justice strategy that identifies and addresses
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental
effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations.
</P>
<P>
   Members of minority environmental groups traveled to Washington
to meet with legislative officials and urge the president to take
immediate action, as well as issue a status report on how federal
agencies have complied with the executive order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fed up and we are fired up,'' said Dr. Mildred Makini
McClain, facilitator of NPCDC. ``We draw the line when
environmental facilities begin to affect our children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow our young people to be destroyed before they
get the opportunity to be all they can be,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Group members met with representatives from the Department of
Energy, the Council on Environmental Quality and White House staff
Thursday. But they said they got no answers and found the
representatives patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the departments Friday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Earl Yates Acree, who will turn 16 on Sunday,
nearly died because his family lived near an Alabama incinerator
where chemical weapons were burned. He went into a coma for 19 days
after being exposed to toxic smoke and his left side was paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Acree's body is fully functional now, but he had to relearn how
to talk, walk and feed himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's society, people who break the law are sent to jail,
but those who break the laws of health are not punished,'' Acree
said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Harris, 18, is a senior at Hamilton High School in
Memphis, Tenn., said her high school was built in the early 1970s
directly on a ditch that is owned by the Memphis Defense Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said her school's band and others organizations often
practice in parts of the ditch that is still exposed. A friend and
some relatives were even diagnosed with cancer, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm going to be diagnosed with cancer
tomorrow,'' said Harris, vice president of a group called Youth
Terminating Pollution. ``Most teens only worry about violence, but
we have to worry about violence and toxic chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm young. I'm only 18, and I don't want to die. We just want
the order to be enforced, that's all we want,'' she said, holding
back tears.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mills, 18, is also afraid that he will soon be affected.
He said his grandfather is legally blind, his father has high blood
pressure and his mother has heart problems, all of which he
attributes to their having worked in the Memphis defense depot for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 200 chemicals currently stored at the
Memphis depot, enough to cover three football fields, said Kenneth
Bradshaw, project director for the Defense Depot of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is environmental racism,'' he charged. ``What you had was
white army commanders making decisions (to build the facilities)
without us knowing about it. It has affected our ground water and
our drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the community didn't know about the chemicals at the
plants until they were shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four million gallons of radioactive waste are being
stored in glass-lined canisters buried at the Savannah River Site
in Aiken, S.C., said McClain. She said even though the facility is
in South Carolina, people in Savannah, Ga. are being affected
because chemicals enter water in the river, which also runs through
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youth is our future, but if our youth is so damaged, what
kind of future are we going to have?'' asked Gilbert Sanchez,
chairperson of NPCDC.

500 DAVIDS MEET THEIR GOLIATH

<P>
   The steel track below disappears into a black hole that looks
about the size of a dime. Think twice about raising your arms.
</P>
<P>
   Free fall _ at a stomach-flipping 85 mph. The hole passes in a
flash and the car twists back into the sky. Whoa, for a few seconds
there you're floating _ zero G _ then a tight spiral slams you back
into the seat at four times the force of gravity. It's over way too
soon; three minutes just felt like 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Goliath, the newest monster on the Six Flags midway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was screaming my guts out and feeling damn good about it,''
says David Petersen, a 28-year-old environmental analyst from Santa
Clarita who was among the first to test drive Goliath on Thursday.
``That first drop just beats your pants off. And you feel some
severe G forces, really amazing G forces. I had a little cheek
flutter going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen was among 500 Davids _ including ``Scream'' trilogy
star David Arquette _ and roller coaster enthusiasts invited to the
park to inaugurate Magic Mountain's newest attraction on Thursday.
The ride opened to the public on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible roller coaster,'' said Arquette, who _
along with his wife, Courteney Cox _ cut short his honeymoon tour
of American roller-coaster parks last summer to begin work on
``Scream 3.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best drop I've been on a roller coaster,'' says
Arquette. ``It's a thriller ride, and it's really smooth. It's not
a real rattly ride. It's definitely my favorite on the West
Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for coaster enthusiasts, says Paul Ruben,
roller coaster historian and editor of Park World magazine. Records
fall fast, so theme parks must keep upping the ante.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're experiencing is a roller coaster renaissance,'' he
said. ``The number of coasters in North America has tripled in the
past 20 years. And today's coasters are being built bigger, faster
and wilder than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   And to illustrate this, Goliath with its 255-foot near-vertical
drop and 85-mph top speed is a record breaker now, but those marks
are expected to be topped in May by a new coaster being built in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? Coaster enthusiasts agree Goliath distinguishes
itself from an increasingly tough crowd of coasters with a smooth,
fast ride that takes riders from no gravity to heavy-duty gravity
in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goliath is an extreme coaster with a spectacular ride
experience,'' says Ruben. ``It's nonstop action from the moment you
drop off the lift hill until you get back to the loading
platform,'' he says. ``I've never experienced that long a period of
heavy Gs on any coaster I've been on.''
</P>
<P>
   And he should know. Goliath was the 536th roller coaster he's
test ridden in 57 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cold, sometimes stinging, rain _ and it does sting at 85
mph _ failed to dampen the enthusiasm of first-time Goliath riders
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rain _ totally extreme, dude!'' screamed two riders
before taking the plunge for the second time. Then they bolted back
in line for a third ride.
</P>
<P>
   The lines for Goliath were _ and will be _ long. But who's
counting?
</P>
<P>
   !tag!end optional trim
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a total rush _ well worth waiting for,'' said
David Koos, 47, a postal carrier from Newhall. ``Anybody who comes
here, they have to get on it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Canary tips off medical detectives who solve mystery of Mozart's
death
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the canary that tipped the doctors off.
</P>
<P>
   The patient was a musician, and the tuneful bird was his
favorite pet. He had been sick for a week _ lucid at first, and
then so agitated he ordered the canary taken out of his bedroom. A
week later, comatose and too swollen to fit into his clothing, he
died.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists couldn't agree why. Then one remembered his
unreasonable irritability over the canary. The diagnosis came only
a little late: The patient died Dec. 5, 1791.
</P>
<P>
   The patient's name was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   A group of medical detectives based at the University of
Maryland announced Friday that they have solved the mystery of
Mozart's death, a puzzle so tantalizing that 200 years of musical
gossip _ and a prize-winning play and movie _ were spun from it.
Mozart, they said, did not die from kidney failure, nor from
typhoid fever, nor from poisoning by rival composer Antonio
Salieri. He died from an infection that today could be wiped out
with antibiotics: rheumatic fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Mozart was a great and famous man, we tend to look for
an extraordinary cause of death,'' said Dr. Faith Fitzgerald, a
professor at the University of California-Davis who conducted the
diagnosis for the annual historical clinical pathologic conference
held by the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the
Veterans' Affairs Maryland Health Care System. ``In fact, the clues
point to an illness that was a common killer in Mozart's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatic fever is as uncommon in the United States now _ about
one case each year for every 100,000 people _ as it was common in
the 18th century. It develops after streptococcal bacteria that
have caused a minor problem such as a sore throat spread throughout
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Its symptoms match those recorded at the time by Mozart's
physician and family: fever, pain resembling arthritis, a flat red
rash that does not cause scars, and fluid retention as the heart
fails. It usually occurs in children, but an adult who has had the
disease in childhood can be re-infected.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, Fitzgerald said, had rheumatic fever twice as a child
and young adult, and Vienna was experiencing an epidemic when he
died suddenly at 35.
</P>
<P>
   The annual conference, now in its sixth year, has previously
re-analyzed the deaths of Pericles (diagnosis: typhus), Edgar Allen
Poe (rabies) and Alexander the Great (typhoid) as a teaching tool
for med students.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the historical record, usually without knowing the
patient's name, they look for small clues _ like Mozart's caged
bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudden distaste for the singing of his pet canary'' was a
diagnostic discovery, Fitzgerald said. ``Irritability is a classic
symptom of rheumatic fever.''

IN SEARCH OF PROFIT, OUTSIDE THE POWER GRID  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., N.J., Va., Pa.)   (af)  
 By ELAINE S. SILVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There haven't been any blockbuster deals to attract much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But like jackhammers demolishing a wall with a thousand small
blows, gas and electric utilities are gobbling up contracting
companies in bunches, and threatening to transform both themselves
and the construction business in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the utilities, whose once-sleepy world is being remade by
deregulation and competition, buying contractors is a way to put
idle cash to work. But the acquisitions also open lines of business
``beyond the meter,'' giving utilities hope for faster growth and
richer returns than they find in their core businesses _ and
without straying too far from what they already know.
</P>
<P>
   For the contracting industry, the arrival of a bevy of flush and
eager buyers has greatly accelerated the pace of consolidation.
While some contractors are seizing the chance to sell out at fat
premiums, those who remain independent face the specter of
competing with the giant utilities that are remaking their risky,
long-fragmented and habitually cash-short industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months alone, a subsidiary of First Energy, an
Akron, Ohio, utility, has bought 12 heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning, or HVAC, contractors; KeySpan, based in Brooklyn,
has added four such companies to the seven that its unregulated
services arm already owned, and a subsidiary of Conectiv, a utility
in Wilmington, Del., bought five mechanical and HVAC contractors,
bringing its total to 21.
</P>
<P>
   While not buying contractors itself, UtiliCorp United of Kansas
City, Mo., has invested $400 million into a Houston-based
construction industry roll-up, or aggregation of many small
contractors, called Quanta.
</P>
<P>
   Construction has always been a vital part of the energy
industry, which never stops needing trenches dug, lines strung and
plants built and maintained. Most big utilities have in-house
construction and engineering divisions to handle many of these
tasks, farming out the rest to so-called infrastructure
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., long ago created
subsidiaries or joint ventures that act as infrastructure
contractors for other energy companies; Duke's partnership with
Fluor Daniel, a giant construction firm, is a dominant player in
engineering and construction work on nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   So a big part of the acquisition trend is that utilities are
bringing more of this kind of work in-house by buying
infrastructure contractors. One example is GPU's purchase last
December of the MYR Group, an electrical contractor based in
Chicago and the fifth-largest specialty construction company in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   GPU, based in Morristown, N.J., has sold off all its generating
plants to concentrate on building infrastructure and distributing
energy in order to ``stay within our legitimate areas of
expertise,'' said Fred D. Hafer, the chief executive. ``One area
that meets that criteria perfectly is in transmission and line
construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The price paid for MYR _ $215 million in cash _ looks cheap when
compared with the company's 1998 revenue of $459 million, but a bit
rich as a multiple of its net income of $8 million that year.
Though MYR's pretax return on sales lags behind the industry
average of 7 percent to 10 percent, according to the FMI Corp., a
construction industry consulting company, MYR specializes in
high-voltage work, an area where analysts expect a big increase in
demand. Hafer said that GPU was satisfied with the price it paid
and that it saw the deal as a base for further acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Exelon Infrastructure Services, a subsidiary of PECO Energy of
Philadelphia, is pursuing a similar strategy; it recently bought
six infrastructure contractors. Gary Murphy, an Exelon vice
president, said his company saw opportunities in providing other
utilities with a full range of services. ``As utilities converge
and service companies achieve economies of scope _ the same crew
and the same truck supporting all the work _ we believe there is
tremendous value creation for us, and certainly for the customer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes time to master the mosh pit after a lifetime of the
minuet. Utilities that are accustomed to reaping steady
regulated-monopoly profits must now decide where to focus their
efforts and how to grow in those chosen fields. Some are merging
with other kinds of utilities to create ``convergence entities''
that provide gas, electricity, water, telecommunications and even
satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others are narrowing down, like GPU, to specialize in ``pipe and
wire'' distribution of gas and power supplied by others. Companies
in both categories are hoping to thrive by finding a magic mixture
of the up-for-grabs service businesses beyond the meter.
</P>
<P>
   Is buying construction companies the way to get there? Jay
Dobson, electric power analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said the jury was still out. ``It's one thing to buy a company;
it's another to manage it well,'' Dobson said. Construction, he
added, ``is a fragmented business that has economies of scale, but
if the business is not managed well, you can clearly hang yourself
from an earnings point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Building a construction business through repeated acquisitions
has often proved tough sledding for managers. ``It is very
difficult to integrate and manage a labor-intensive construction
business over a broad geographical range,'' said Stephen P.
Darnell, managing director for mergers and acquisitions at FMI.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy depends in part on buying expertise as well as a
company, but not everyone in the contracting world relishes the
idea of selling out to a utility. Michael Moore, president of
Southland Industries, a large mechanical contractor based in
Southern California, said Southland had just sold its energy
services division to a longtime client, Reliant Energy of Houston,
but he would not consider selling the remainder of the company to a
utility. ``I wouldn't want to have my employees doing service
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several utilities that have been buying contractors have
reason to be pleased. One example is KeySpan, which has evolved,
Pokemon-like, out of the former Brooklyn Union Gas. ``We broke even
in our first year of operation and have been profitable ever
since,'' said William Feraudo, executive vice president of
KeySpan's energy services subsidiary. ``Now we are trying to scale
it up and make it sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit has won contracts to design, build and maintain heating
and air-conditioning systems in several big, high-profile projects
in New York City, including cogeneration plants for several
hospitals, the city jail complex on Riker's Island and Mutual
Redevlopment Houses (Penn South), an immense housing complex on
Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   The trend raises potentially thorny questions for the specialty
contracting industry. The small, privately owned companies that
populate the field find themselves competing against the utility
next door, with its much greater capacity to supply the energy
financing for projects as well as the equipment and installation.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the industry are worried that utilities may be
tempted to unfairly use regulated rate-payer money to finance their
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``State utility commissions still need to monitor utilities,
even though they are in a transitional mode,'' said Dennis
Bradshaw, spokesman for the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning
Contractors' National Association. ``Contractors who have been in
the business for years shouldn't be at a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Without continued state oversight, others say, utilities will
use the brand names and customer relationships built by their
regulated monopoly businesses to imply that they have expertise in
a business they have only just entered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many independent contractors, the jackhammer's
banging has not yet risen above the level of background noise.
According to Lewis Tagliaferre, a Springfield, Va., consultant to
the electrical contracting industry, ``the small contractors will
start realizing that they're in trouble when they start losing
accounts to the utilities.''

   Thanks to Morrow Publishing for helping us keep all the
Valentine's Day bases covered.
</P>
<P>
   Received in the same package this week: ``The Most Important
Thing I Know About Love: Inspiring Messages From Eminent Writers,
Poets, Musicians, Thinkers and Others'' (Morrow; $13), and
``Healing Hearts: Compassionate Writers on Breaking Up'' (Morrow;
$16 ... Hmmm. It seems that breaking up is not only hard to do,
it's also more expensive.)
</P>
<P>
   Is your holiday mood going to be Hallmark or hell? Pick a
passage:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Love is like hash. You have to have confidence to enjoy
it,'' writes Bob Hope in ``About Love,'' ad-libbing as Huckleberry
Haines in the 1933 Broadway Production ``Roberta.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Why is the measure of love loss?'' writes Jeanette Winterson
in a short story reprinted in ``Healing Hearts.'' ``It hasn't
rained for three months. The trees are prospecting underground,
sending reserves of roots into the dry ground, roots like razors
opening any artery water-fat. The grapes have withered on the vine.
What should be plump and firm, resisting the touch to give itself
in the mouth, is spongy and blistered.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on.

CAKE AND CANDLE IN ONE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rich, moist chocolate cake, the kind with fudge frosting that
melts on lips and sticks to your hips. Ahh, sweet memories.
</P>
<P>
   If you've avoided kitchen time with Betty Crocker because you're
counting calories, rekindle the romance with a single match.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered the company famous for cake mixes has whipped up a
collection of cake-shaped candles that look and smell like the real
thing. The life-size cake slices are available in angel food,
lemon, strawberry and vanilla scents, as well as TWO types of
chocolate (fudge and German chocolate), priced at $7 each. Or you
can buy the whole cake for $14.99 at gift shops, including Coach
House Gifts at the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills; the Welcome Home
store in Lancaster; and the Le Gourmet Chef shop at the Camarillo
Premium Center in Camarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the possibilities. You can make your house smell homey
without getting out the egg beater or turning on the oven (and
maybe sell your house quicker, say Realtors); you can diffuse
less-appetizing odors (like burned broccoli or fish), and also
indulge in a chocolate fix without the fat. &QL;

   VOTING-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pity the poor strategist for
a presidential campaign. He is trying to cobble together a cohesive
national strategy that appeals to an electorate so diverse, so
stratified, so much in flux as to make the Tower of Babel look tame
and unified by comparison. Unlike past elections no one group seems
key. Each seems important. It's a niche marketer's dream, and a
pundit's nightmare.There are many reasons why both demographically

   INTERNET-PROFESSORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Universities have

   INDONESIA-PRESS-REVIEW (Jakarta) _ In the nearly two years since
Indonesia's strongman, Suharto, stepped down in 1998, the press has
been the most free, and the most tumultuous, of Indonesia's
institutions. It has been the fundamental underpinning for the
continuing move toward a democratic society. But in many ways today
it is also in trouble, and its condition reveals a lot about the
chaotic freedoms of the new Indonesia, where the harsh hand of the

mob. By Seth Mydans.

GROW YOUR OWN POTATOES
</HEADLINE>

By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potatoes aren't a veggie that anybody but the most dedicated
gardeners usually try to grow, but the Southern California Garden
Club has an idea that'll let you grow a few 'taters without feeling
like an Idaho farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Robin Pokorski shares how to do it in the group's
newsletter:
</P>
<P>
   Find two or three old potatoes in that bag from the supermarket.
Ideally, they'll be beginning to sprout. Cut up the potatoes in
1.5-inch chunks, with at least two ``eyes'' _ the spots the eyes
emerge from _ in each chunk.
</P>
<P>
   Poke a couple of drainage holes in the bottom of either a heavy
plastic garbage bag or a plastic trash can, then dump in several
inches of good, rich soil that's loose, sandy and fast-draining.
</P>
<P>
   Plant the chunks of potato a couple of inches beneath the soil.
As they sprout, add more soil to just below the leaves. Water to
keep moist, but not soggy. Good planting times for Valley gardeners
are March through May; potatoes will take 90 to 105 days to mature.
For early potatoes, dig them when the tops begin to flower; dig
mature potatoes when the tops die down and wither.

 &HT;     CLINTON IMPEACHMENT FIGURES IN ANNUAL LAWMAKER RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 
 &HT;    (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from
the Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that may further buttress the argument
that the impeachment of President Clinton was driven by partisan
political motives, two prominent _ and ideologically opposite _
interest groups are using the episode to rate lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1999 ranking of Congress, Americans for Democratic
Action, a liberal advocacy organization, cited the Senate vote on
whether to convict Clinton of obstruction of justice over the
Monica Lewinsky affair as a key indicator of a good liberal.
Lawmakers who voted to acquit Clinton of that charge scored points
in the ADA's evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   In its rival ratings, the American Conservative Union gave the
impeachment saga even greater weight by including a second Senate
vote on the perjury charge. In this case, good conservatives were
those who voted to convict the president on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   And though the House vote to impeach Clinton occurred in 1998,
the ACU managed to find one 1999 impeachment-related vote in that
chamber _ the appointment of House managers as the case headed to a
Senate trial _ to include in its latest ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ACU spokeswoman Patricia Fava said her group counted the
impeachment votes because they were ``a matter of right and
wrong.'' A spokeswoman for ADA cited their ``historical'' value.
Both groups included other votes for their ratings, including those
on abortion and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And while both groups bill themselves as nonpartisan, each year
the results are the same: Democrats soar in the ADA ratings and
crash in the ACU ratings while the reverse is true for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top Southern scorers in the ACU rating were: Sen.
Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.; Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C.; and North Carolina Reps. Howard Coble and Charles
Taylor, all of whom scored 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AHEAD OF THE STORM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Millions of federal dollars being spent to recover from
Hurricane Floyd are just the latest in a long line of hefty
storm-related expenses to hit Capitol Hill. Now some lawmakers are
trying to get disaster planners to take preventative steps that
could cut future losses.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and James
Inhofe, R-Okla., would encourage the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to do more before a storm hits through a program known as
Project Impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't prevent violent weather from happening,'' said
Graham. ``But we can take preparatory action to reduce the human
and financial costs of inevitable natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic efforts, such as hurricane shutters on hospitals, can pay
dividends and reduce emergency spending by $10 for each $1 spent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time we make mitigation, not response and recovery, the
primary focus of emergency management,'' said Graham.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BENCHING BRADLEY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley's recent visit to South Carolina was no slam-dunk
as far as the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination,
delivered an impassioned speech on Wednesday, calling for the
Confederate flag to come down from the South Carolina statehouse.
He blasted the Republican presidential contenders for refusing to
call for its removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very helpful to our efforts to get the flag down,''
said Dick Harpootlian, chairman of the state Democratic party. ``It
was just a photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Harpootlian, who called on Bradley to drop out
of the primary race, predicted the Confederate flag issue would
prove to be troublesome for the Republican contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does John McCain or George Bush go to California or
Michigan and explain to people there why the Confederate flag
hasn't come down from the statehouse here?'' Harpootlian said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A MATTER OF PRIVACY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have something to talk about, but it's private.
</P>
<P>
   More lawmakers are rallying around the notion that enacting
stronger privacy protections for American consumers is good public
policy as well as sound political strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``New technologies allow our personal information to be
disseminated around the world with the click of a mouse,'' said
Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sits on a new Democratic task force
looking at the issue. Breaux said bank accounts, medical records
and stock accounts are vulnerable to privacy violations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., is heading up a separate,
bipartisan caucus dedicated to pressing for greater privacy
protections for ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a diverse coalition, Shelby led an unsuccessful effort
last year to restrict the ability of banks to sell or trade
personal customer information.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful bank conglomerates lobbied hard against the proposed
restrictions, but Shelby said the new caucus will ``educate members
of Congress on matters of individual privacy.''

WHERE DO THE EMOTIONS OF LOVE REALLY MAKE THEIR HOME?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until  Monday, Feb. 14). 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time a would-be Cassanova tells you that his heart
aches for you, call him a liar. Or at least correct him. That
person has it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   News flash, folks: The heart doesn't ache, and it has nothing to
do with the tender feelings of love, heartache or heartbreak. While
you're going through your private ecstasy or torment, the heart is
just sitting there pumping away, doing what it does to keep you
alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're love struck, it's your brain you should blame ... or
thank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that we have a heart-shaped valentine is that, for
centuries, people thought the heart was the seat of the soul,''
says Dr. Kimford Meador, professor of neurology at the Medical
College of Georgia in Augusta. ``It took some keen observers to
figure out that the brain has a lot to do with emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had recognized it sooner, maybe we would have had a
brain-shaped valentine.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's !ital!really going on upstairs? Researchers aren't
completely certain, but they offer a couple of possible
explanations as to how the brain kicks your emotions into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Neurobiologists will direct you to the limbic system, a golf
ball-shaped mass in the center of the brain that includes portions
of the lobes of the cerebral cortex, the thalamus and the
hypothalamus. It's this portion of the brain, doctors say, that is
responsible for memory as well as emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Neurotransmitters _ biochemicals that send nerve impulses from
one region of the brain to another _ cause a person to feel a given
emotion. A stimulus _ like an unexpected bouquet of roses or a
``Dear John'' letter _ sends biochemicals like endorphins and
dopamine (for happiness) in certain sequences to the brain's
frontal cortex. Those impulses will trigger the autonomic nervous
system, which takes care of accompanying reactions like a quickened
heart rate and sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Acting like a light switch being flipped on, these
neurotransmitters cause a person to feel emotions such as anger,
fear, euphoria and longing _ the type of longing we might otherwise
call heartache.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the brain is the work station, the entire process
takes place without the person realizing it's happening. So when we
cry, we do so automatically, without thinking about it before the
tears are on our cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neurotransmitters drive us to feel the puppy love and the
pain of loss,'' says Dr. Cheryl Craft, a neurobiologist at USC's
Keck School of Medicine, who adds, ``We don't understand exactly
what happens, and I'd be lying if I said we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions are governed, Craft says, by the sequences and
combinations of the neurotransmitters working both with each other
and with the autonomic nervous system. It's the same process
whether the emotion is embarrassment, anger or fear.
</P>
<P>
   Not all manifestations of emotion are the same. The tears Ben
Affleck sheds after being dumped by Gwyneth Paltrow, for example,
will have a different composition than the tears he'll produce
while slicing onions for an Affleckburger. Lab analysis will prove
that, Craft says.
</P>
<P>
   When you start talking about ``love,'' matters get more
complicated. Animals, after all, have a limbic system. They feel
pain, loss and anger. The hormones estrogen and testosterone have
been linked to the human sex drive. But love? Those feelings that
can turn us into a heart-pounding, thought-obsessed, flower-buying
composer of sonnets? Is that entirely chemical?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Meador contends, is an emphatic no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't at this point say what are the physiological straits
related to love,'' says Meador. ``It's a pretty complex set of
behaviors, and I don't think complex emotions are limited to the
limbic system.''
</P>
<P>
   So before you start scissoring a cerebellum out of pink
construction paper, keep an open mind. Researchers haven't figured
out the workings of every single pathway in the brain. In many
ways, the biology of love _ like the feeling itself _ remains
unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   Which in some ways is a good thing, according to Craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do keep a little mystery in it.'' &QL;

FORMER DOLE AIDE NAMED TO NEW POST AT SMITHSONIAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sheila Burke, the top aide to Bob Dole when he was
majority leader of the Senate, was named on Friday to a new
position at the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, once known as the 101st senator because of her influence
in Congress, was named under secretary for American museums,
programs and national outreach and as leader of a program focused
on the American experience.
</P>
<P>
   She is now executive dean at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University. Burke, who trained as a nurse
before entering government, is also on the adjunct faculty at the
Georgetown University School of Nursing here.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the appointment, the Smithsonian's new secretary,
or chief executive officer, Lawrence Small, said: ``It is an
extraordinary opportunity to participate in the strengthening of an
American institution. It is part of our past and will be part of
our future.''
</P>
<P>
   In her Smithsonian position Burke will deal largely with the
same people she did in her Senate days: elected officials and the
press. As chief of staff for Dole, she helped shape the Senate's
agenda when he was the Republican majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   She described herself then as a moderate Republican, a former
Democrat and a supporter of abortion rights. Her positions led
conservative columnist Robert Novak to accuse her of militant
feminism and conservative advocate Phyllis Schlafly to call her
Hillary Lite and an antifamily radical.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who is 49, is married to David Chew, a management
consultant and former Reagan White House official, and has three
children.
</P>
<P>
   Burke continued to live in Washington while serving as a Harvard
dean, commuting daily. She said on Friday that she would remain an
adjunct on the faculty at Harvard, where she received a master's
degree in public administration after earning a bachelor's degree
in nursing from the University of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her selection, Small said of the new post, ``The
individual who heads the group must have a wide range of skills,
talent and experience, know how to communicate with a great array
of people and institutions and to manage complex organizations and
in particular know how to function effectively in official
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Small also named a second under secretary, promoting the current
Smithsonian provost, Dennis O'Connor, to head the institution's
science division.

ALDERSON SAYS SMALL-MARKET TEAMS MAY CASH IN ON INTERNET INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JEFF FLETCHER   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TREASURE ISLAND, Calif _ Just when you thought the Internet was
good for nothing more than e-mailing and shopping, it has emerged
as perhaps the greatest hope to close the gap that has divided
baseball's haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, who is second to commissioner Bud Selig in the
hierarchy of the major leagues, said that a recent agreement
calling for all Internet income to be divvied up by the
commissioner's office could be a saving grace for cash-strapped
clubs like the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the current theory that eventually everything
is going to be over the Internet, that could be a great deal of
money,'' Alderson said Thursday after speaking at the annual Bay
Area baseball luncheon hosted by Fox Sports. ``It speaks well of
the future of revenue sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson agreed that baseball's No.1 problem is the widening gap
between large- and small-revenue teams. Clubs like the Yankees,
Dodgers, Braves and Indians, with the most money to spend, are
dominating the sport, while teams like the A's, Expos, Royals and
Twins face a much tougher climb.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson pointed out that even though the A's and Reds made a
push toward the postseason with relatively low payrolls last
season, neither team made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams can make a relatively nice showing with a lower payroll,
but we still haven't seen a team like that to make the playoffs,''
he said. ``We've got to solve the competitive issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While there doesn't appear to be any quick and simple solutions,
Alderson is somewhat optimistic because of a few recent
developments.
</P>
<P>
   First, Selig was granted broader powers by the owners. The
commissioner now can fine teams up to $2 million for actions deemed
to be ``not in the best interests of baseball.'' Some of that money
could be used to subsidize teams like the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Selig also has the power to veto trades, particularly those
judged to be simply salary-dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Internet deal eventually will mean all income from the
Web will go to the commissioner's office, to be distributed among
the teams in a manner that ensures competitive balance. The
commissioner's office would control all team Web sites, plus
Internet broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As technology for high-speed connections becomes more common, it
won't be long before fans can order up a game, or a full-season
package, to watch on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   A's president Mike Crowley isn't expecting any significant help
from the commissioner's office in the short term, but he is hopeful
that things might change a few years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, the problem has been recognized, and two, there are
people in power trying to do something about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the key to leveling the playing field is going to be
held by the guys who hold most of the money: the players. The
current collective bargaining agreement will expire after the 2001
season, and any serious revenue-sharing plan will have to be
approved by the players in the new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson expressed some hope that perhaps the union, thought to
be dead against anything that would limit salaries, might be
softening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are completely deaf to our arguments,'' he
said. ``I think they understand.''

U.S., RUSSIA TO LAUNCH SPACE STATION'S CREW MODULE IN JULY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Russia has agreed to launch the
long-awaited crew module for the new international space station in
July, the U.S. and Russian space agencies announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The launching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia is tentatively
scheduled to occur between July 8-14.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for an April 1998 launching, the 21-ton,
43-foot-long module fell behind schedule as Russia experienced
financial difficulties. Failures of the Russian Proton rocket that
will loft the module in October and July last year further stalled
its launching.
</P>
<P>
   Once in orbit, the crew module _ also known as the service
module and Zvezda (Russian for ``star``) _ will allow the Americans
and Russians to proceed with the launching of the new station's
first resident crew, U.S. commander Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts
Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev in November.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of future Russian segments of the new outpost,
the crew module contains crucial life support apparatus as well as
propulsion, flight control and power generation capabilities that
are also necessary for new U.S. components.
</P>
<P>
   The unstaffed, first two components of the station were launched
by the Russians and Americans in late 1998. They were assembled by
a space shuttle crew in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, NASA components will supplant the crew quarter,
power and propulsion functions of the Russian service module. But
the 7-person U.S. crew module will not be launched to the new
station until late 2004 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement followed a joint meeting between the
Russians and Americans in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The precise date for the crew module launch, which the Russians
are forecasting as July 12, will depend on at least a couple of
factors, said NASA spokesman Kyle Herring.
</P>
<P>
   One is a pair of successful launches of the Russian Proton,
which is undergoing modifications of its second and third stages,
ahead of the crew module. Last year's Proton failures were blamed
on contaminants, including a cloth rag, which fouled the turbine
pumps of the second rocket stages.
</P>
<P>
   The Proton modifications the Russians and Americans have agreed
to include the installation of contaminant filters in the
propulsion hardware, said Herring.
</P>
<P>
   The July launch date for the Russian module will be further
determined by orbital lighting conditions. Once lofted, the crew
module will orbit passively while the station's first two
components attempt an automated rendezvous and docking.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians want the docking to occur over Asia in daylight so
ground controllers can closely monitor the operation through
television cameras on the merging station hardware.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. shuttle crew is scheduled to visit the station's first
components in mid-April to repair two of the station's six
batteries, which are not functioning properly, deliver supplies for
future occupants and secure American equipment on the outside of
the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   A successful docking of the Russian crew module will unleash the
launching of a large backlog of U.S. station components aboard the
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those include external trusses, solar-powered
components for the generation of electricity and the science
module.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is also evaluating the launch of a propulsion module that
would be docked with the station so that it could temporarily
maneuver the outpost in the event the Russians cannot refuel the
propulsion systems of their crew module. Called the interim control
module, the component would raise the station's orbit if the
Russians fail to launch the Progress cargo capsules they have
promised.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have pledged four Progress launches a year. The
cargo ships are loaded with fuel, food and other dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   The international station's major partners are the space
agencies of Europe, Japan and Canada as well as the United States
and Russia. When fully assembled, the station will provide research
facilities for a permanent crew of seven.

 &HT;    Griffey deal wasn't all about money
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ One of Carl Lindner Jr.'s three private jets picked
up Ken Griffey Jr., and his family in Orlando Thursday and whisked
them to Lunken airport, where Lindner's Rolls-Royce Bentley
provided ostentatious transportation to Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was trappings fit for royalty, of which Griffey certainly is
to Cincinnati Reds baseball.
</P>
<P>
   For the next nine years, Griffey is the visible symbol of
baseball in Cincinnati, but the man behind the scenes for now is
the 80-year-old Lindner, the club's chief executive officer and the
man who signed off on signing the checks that will provide Griffey
with $112.5 million over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Does Griffey's arrival signal an open-wallet policy for the
Reds? Well, probably not a wide-open New York Yankees-style policy,
but Lindner's wallet is fat enough that he doesn't have to open
very wide.
</P>
<P>
   He has told chief operating office John Allen and general
manager Jim Bowden, ``I don't want to make money, I'd just like to
break even.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes lists Lindner's personal wealth at more than $800 million
and includes him among the richest 400 persons in the United
States. His wealth comes from controlling interest in Chiquita
bananas, controlling the majority stock in Amtrak, United Dairy
Farmers, Thriftway groceries and he is chairman of American
Financial and American Annuity Group.
</P>
<P>
   And for the most part, he is a wisp, preferring to stand in the
shadows, ignoring publicity and recognition. He won't be on the
field with his pet dog before games, as was the preference of his
predecessor, Marge Schott. And he won't keep an office at the
stadium, as Schott did. He comes to games, but slips in unnoticed
and sits in his private box.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man of few words, three- and four-word sentences, but a
man of fast action. He returned a telephone call to WLW radio host
Bill Cunningham Thursday and when Cunningham threw a few quick
questions at him, Lindner asked, ``Are we on the air?'' Told that
he was, the conversation quickly ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner, a life-long Cincinnatian, loves the city and loves the
Reds. When it looked as if even $112.5 million might be too much
for the Reds' budget, Lindner gave a quick nod of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even COO Allen was dubious just a few days ago about bringing
home the prodigal son, who so wanted to return. A personal reply on
a Cincinnati Web-site by Allen became public knowledge. Asked if
the Reds would get Griffey, Allen typed:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not all about dollars, especially for the 2000 season.
The $16-$20 million for 2001 and beyond is a huge concern, but not
the 2000 salary of $9 million. Just as big a concern is the four
players the Mariners are asking for in return for a player that
will be a free agent in 2001. This team won 96 games without
Griffey in 1999. If we gave them the players they want for Griffey,
there is no way we'll win near that many games, since we will
decimate our pitching staff to do the deal. How do you explain that
to our fans that we gave up a winner to get Griffey?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey solved the salary dilemma by accepting far less than his
market value and spreading the money over 25 years. Bowden solved
the player dilemma by refusing to give up Scott Williamson in the
trade. The only pitcher in the deal was Brett Tomko, who won only
five games last year and was in a season-long stubborn struggle
with manager Jack McKeon and pitching coach Don Gullett.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Griffey is the biggest exchange of a superstar via
trade since the St. Louis Cardinals obtained Mark McGwire from
Oakland. The Cardinals estimate his presence has been worth 600,000
additional fans a season at home and they drew 3.22 million fans
last year, even though they won only 75 games, fourth in the
National League Central, 21 games behind division-winner Houston
and 20 games behind second-place Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Says Cardinals chairman Fred Hanser, ``If you look strictly at
the financial impact, it is a plus for tickets and concessions. But
whether the plus is greater than his salary ($11 million this year
with attendance incentives), I would doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the main item. You have to pay attention to
what he means to the team and the city in terms of being a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey means more to Cincinnati than McGwire does to St. Louis.
McGwire is not a native son. Griffey grew up in Cincinnati. And
McGwire is one-dimensional, a home run hitter. Griffey means more
to a team because he does it all and is a modern-day Willie Mays in
center field (Yes, Griffey makes basket catches, too).
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to Forbes (1999 figures aren't yet
available), the Reds generated $54.4 million worth of revenue,
before expenses, 20th among the 30 major league teams. The New York
Yankees generated $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds figure their revenue will double when a new park opens,
scheduled for 2003. But they'll lose 14,000 of their 52,000 seats
in Cinergy Field when construction on the new stadium forces them
to knock down parts of left field during the 2001 season. And the
Reds must contribute $30 million toward the new park.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, though, will make a huge difference to keep revenue
flowing in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner attended Thursday's press conference and read from a
prepared statement in his low, measured voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly an exciting day for Cincinnati and the fans who
have grown up rooting for the oldest team in baseball,'' he said.
``I love this city. It is where I grew up, raised my family, built
our businesses and brought in new businesses from other cities.
I've always tried to give back some of my good fortune and do
what's best for our city. One of the highlights of my career is
what we've accomplished today. . .bringing Ken back to Cincinnati
for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these times, where big markets and big money seem to steal
the stars, it speaks so much of Ken's character that he has chosen
instead to come back where he belongs. The future of the Reds, with
Ken and the new stadium, can't be more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindner couldn't have left a better legacy to fans of the
Cincinnati Reds.

CITIBANK AND DEUTSCHE BANK WIN TAKEOVER BATTLES FOR 2 MAJOR BANKS
IN POLAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the wake of two highly politicized
takeover battles, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG are about to
become key players in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a month of machinations, Deutsche Bank appeared
to have won a boardroom coup Friday that will enable it to take
over Poland's fourth-largest bank, BIG Bank Gdanski SA. BIG is an
acronym for the bank's original name in Polish.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Citigroup outmaneuvered Commerzbank AG of Germany
and is now poised to take control of Poland's biggest corporate
lender, Bank Handlowy SA, for about $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The twin takeovers come as foreign banks are racing to carve up
the market in Poland, Central Europe's biggest and most robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been colored by national anxieties and the legacy
of World War II. Although the Polish government has generally been
open to foreign investment, many political leaders are anxious
about allowing too much German control in their economy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Polish leaders actively tried to thwart Deutsche
Bank and quietly supported Citigroup over Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 40 million people and one of the fastest growing
economies in Europe, Poland has become a magnet for foreign
investment of all types in the last few years. The banking sector
has been a particularly fierce battleground, in part because it is
still much less developed than that of Western Europe and is
therefore primed for rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials estimate that foreign investors already
hold about 60 percent of the shares in Polish banks, and dozens of
West European and American banks have operations in Warsaw. German
banks have been the biggest players here, controlling about 20
percent of the market. The Polish government actively opposed
Deutsche Bank's effort to oust BIG Bank's supervisory board two
weeks ago. Deutsche Bank owns 19 percent of BIG, and analysts say
other foreign investors allied with it brought its share of the
vote to about 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncharacteristic and combative move for a European bank,
Deutsche Bank and its allies attempted to take control of the
supervisory board on Jan. 28, replaced the bank's president and
suspended top officials.
</P>
<P>
   One key to that success was an agreement between Deutsche Bank
and PZU SA, Poland's biggest insurance company and owner of a 5
percent stake in BIG Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The coup was not completed that day, because supporters of the
bank's management were able to suspend the meeting and prevent the
changes from becoming official.
</P>
<P>
   When the board meeting resumed Friday, shareholders supporting
the BIG management and the Polish government tried but failed to
disqualify the shares being voted by PZU. On a second vote,
Deutsche Bank defeated an attempt to adjourn the meeting for
another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the battle was not entirely settled by Friday evening,
analysts said they were certain that Deutsche Bank will end up in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup also owed its victory to support from PZU, which owns
9.9 percent of the shares in Bank Handlowy. Unlike Deutsche Bank,
Citigroup had strong support from the Polish government.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Commerzbank had hoped to take over Handlowy and
merge it into BRE Bank, a smaller Polish bank in which Commerzbank
holds 49 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ran into intense opposition from PZU, the Polish
insurer, which argued that Commerzbank's offer of 60 zlotys per
share was too low.
</P>
<P>
   PZU then solicited Citigroup, which had built up its own banking
operation in Poland with about 690 employees and six offices. Most
of that business has been with corporate customers rather than
individuals, which is also Bank Handlowy's main emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Though Citigroup has yet to reveal the details of its bid,
analysts in Warsaw say it is about 70 zlotys per share. Friday,
Commerzbank formally abandoned its bid and admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Though its acquisition of Bank Handlowy appears assured,
Citigroup remained cautious in its statements Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Nelson, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said the company
hopes to acquire a controlling interest in Bank Handlowy, pending
regulatory approval in Poland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to dispel suspicions of another backroom deal, Citigroup
insisted that any takeover would be ``fully transparent'' to all
shareholders.

   NIRELAND-BRITAIN (London) _ The government of Catholics and
Protestants in Northern Ireland that held out the tantalizing
promise of an end to the British province's polarized political
life and took years of negotiations to set up, came to a halt
Friday after only 10 weeks in operation. Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary, Peter Mandelson, announced in Belfast Friday evening
that he was suspending the power-sharing administration because of
a continuing conflict over paramilitary arms. He added that he
hoped the shutdown would not last long and that he expected the
government to return ``on an even firmer footing'' if the
persistent dispute is settled. By Warren Hoge.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Grozny) _ Russian soldiers did not capture
central Grozny; they obliterated it. The apartment houses along
Lenin Prospect have been pulverized. Minutka Square, a
once-bustling plaza, has been blasted beyond recognition. The
devastation is so extensive that it is hard to find a single
structure that has not been damaged by artillery, wrecked by a bomb
or raked by gunfire. Russian troops may have hoisted the Russian
flag, but Grozny is Chechnya's capital only in name now. Acting
President Vladimir Putin proclaimed on Sunday that Russian forces
had finally taken Grozny. What he did not say was what the Russia
government plans to do with the ruined city and its traumatized
population, mostly elderly people who stayed in the city because
they were afraid to lose their housing. Russian officers, for their
part, believe there is not much to decide. The city, they say, is
simply beyond repair. By Michael R. Gordon.

   CENSUS-RACE (Undated) _ Acknowledging the country's increasing
diversity, the U.S. Census will no longer instruct people to
``select one'' race to describe themselves when it begins mailing
out forms in April. Instead, it will tell them to mark one or more
of 14 boxes representing six races _ white, black, American Indian
or Alaska Native, Asian, Indian, and Pacific Islander _ that apply,
or to mark ``some other race.'' But many, indeed most, people who
could claim several races are not expected to do so, according to
demographers and Census officials. Part of the reason is habit,
demographers say. On a deeper level, however, the change is fueling
a weighty debate about the meaning of race, in which
interpretations of history, politics and experience frequently
overshadow the simpler matter of parentage. By Diana Jean Schemo.

<P>
   WEB-ATTACK-HACKERS (Undated) _ The computer industry has a long,
respected tradition of hiring so-called Tiger Teams of professional
hackers who attack a computer system to determine how secure it is.
The idea is that only by waging a full-scale siege on a system with
an authorized break-in can its true level of vulnerability be
determined. But over the years, that hacker tradition has grown to
embrace unauthorized attacks in which programmers find a way to
invade or cripple a system, then publish the details of the
vulnerability _ and often the software code they used to exploit
the weaknesses they discovered. While the wisdom and ethics of
these practices have long been debated, this week's attacks on
popular Web sites have fueled the controversy because the siege was
accomplished in part using a technique and software published last
year on the Internet by a hacker who calls himself Mixter. By Katie
Hafner.

IN AMERICA'S CUP, PRADA TEAM DRESSES AS WELL AS IT SAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Feb. 13) 
(mk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Along the docks of this sailing-obsessed
city, there is a brand name as deeply coveted as it is on the
stiletto-trod avenues of Manhattan or Milan. Known far and wide for
its image of extreme urban chic, exemplified by a black nylon
backpack, that brand is Prada.
</P>
<P>
   The understated, futuristic uniforms issued to sailors on the
Prada Challenge are sought after by Aucklanders and by other crews
_ now more than ever since Prada has vanquished 10 other teams for
the right to face Team New Zealand in the America's Cup, beginning
Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   For racing, each Prada sailor has a set of technical clothing,
including custom-made foul-weather gear for heavy-weather days and
form-fitting, tri-laminate Lycra-based spray shirts for moderate
conditions. Silver, with a distinct red stripe featuring the Prada
logo, they would look right at home on a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they've got a whole line of street wear to die for,''
said Martha MacKechnie, the retail operations manager for the New
York Yacht Club's Young America syndicate. These include polo
shirts, shorts, cotton T-shirts in the team colors of gray,
charcoal and red, and vests and jackets, both unlined and
fleece-lined.
</P>
<P>
   But in a cruel blow to the fashion-minded, the team gear is not
for sale; it seems all the more desirable for its inaccessibility _
an echo of Prada's practice of heightening demand for high-fashion
items by curtailing the supply at retail.
</P>
<P>
   The Prada sailors are under strict orders not to give away or
swap any clothing. Still, MacKechnie has managed to score a sea bag
full of stuff in trade for Young America team garb. ``Everything
but their shoes,'' she said. ``No one has finagled shoes. But I'm
working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Prada compound swung open its doors for a victory party
last weekend, after the Prada Challenge defeated of America One in
a best-of-nine- race series, one slim young woman was observed
peeling off her top in exchange for a sweaty, Champagne-soaked
Prada T-shirt worn in the heat of battle earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the $55 million America's Cup campaign,
which Patrizio Bertelli, the husband of the designer Miuccia Prada,
bankrolled from his own deep pockets, is fundamentally a marketing
effort, designed to promote Prada's leisure line, Prada Sport,
which includes clothes for golf, skiing and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money was spent on the image. After all, we are
Prada,'' said Doug Peterson, who designed the Prada racing yachts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertelli, an avid sailor who has owned and raced sailboats
for decades, insisted he entered the America's Cup as a sporting
challenge, not as part of a marketing scheme. ``We didn't start
this cup campaign to show or enhance the brand name,'' said
Bertelli, who is Prada's chairman and the financial wizard behind
the company's rapid expansion. ``I'm an unusual sponsor because I
bring my passion for sailing with a talent for organization. And
organization is always of paramount importance to me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts Bertelli's level of passion, or his commitment to
his America's Cup campaign, which he began nearly three years ago.
His emotions toppled over in the later stages of Prada's battle
with the America One team, from San Francisco, after his crew had
relinquished a 3-1 lead and allowed the Americans to tie the
series.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over and Prada had swept the last two races to
win, Bertelli and America One's skipper, Paul Cayard, engaged in a
public war of words. Bertelli especially took umbrage at Cayard's
assertion that Prada won simply because it outspent the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bertelli's denial of a marketing goal, the high-end
fashion industry clearly finds good value in its association with
the cup. This year, the watch makers Omega, Breitling and Audemars
Piguet have entered sponsorships with various syndicates, and Louis
Vuitton has been the title sponsor of the challengers' series since
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``For luxury-good products, it's a good complement to
advertising,'' said Bruno Trouble, a former cup skipper who now
runs a Paris public relations agency and organizes the event.
``It's one of the few world-class events with no low-profile
brands. When McDonald's comes, Louis Vuitton and Prada may not wish
to be associated.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada does, in fact, include some nautical items in its Prada
Sport selection. ``There is a connection in the sense that the two
clothing lines are similar,'' said Alessandra Ghezzi, a publicist
for the sailing team. ``But you can buy things from the Prada Sport
line, but not our America's Cup uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   At the small Prada store in the Customshouse Galleria in
downtown Auckland, which opened around the same time the cup trials
began last October, the sales staff spends an inordinate amount of
time explaining that fact, particularly to the large number of
Asian tourists who vacation in New Zealand and are always on the
lookout for duty-free treasures.
</P>
<P>
   A sailing writer on a cup assignment who visited the store last
week was politely dismissed when he observed that his hefty
backpack from the British nautical outfitter Henri Lloyd _ yellow,
$55, and you can walk through a car wash with it and the contents
will remain dry _ could hold two of the petite black Prada
backpacks, which retail for just over $400 apiece and which have
become an urban staple on both sides of the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have the good stuff,'' said Deborah Hill, a
business editor who has shopped in Prada stores in New York and
London, referring to the Auckland shop's inventory of bags, shoes
and accessories. ``But we're lucky we've got one, even if it is
more of a kiosk in a department store rather than a Prada
superstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prada's storefront may not be huge, but the team's presence in
Auckland is. Interestingly, Prada is not the first Italian cup
entry funded by an Italian fashion giant. In 1987, Maurizio Gucci
was the prime sponsor of the Italia challenge, each member of which
received a 290-piece Gucci wardrobe including shorts, deck shoes
and one-piece storm suits.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelli is the latest tycoon in a long line of wealthy cup
patrons to toss his hat into the ring. ``It's not just about
sport,'' he said, ``it's about the human emotions and feelings of
people who have spent years working on this.''
</P>
<P>
   A month from now, the racing will be over and the world will
know if Bertelli's team has been successful in its quest to bring
the America's Cup to Italian shores for the first time ever. If it
does, the Prada crew will no doubt feel as good as it looks.

 &HT;    PAC gifts fell as Gingrich woes rose
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's political fund-raising took a
nose-dive after he filed for divorce last year, according to a
financial disclosure report released this week.
</P>
<P>
   But observers say the messy divorce wasn't the only factor _ or
even the primary one. The reorganization of the former U.S. House
speaker's political action committee and his waning political
influence played significant roles, they say.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Elections Commission, the Friends of
Newt Gingrich Political Action Committee took in about $288,000
from July to December. The previous six months, Gingrich had raised
more than $1 million, a blistering fund-raising pace for a man who
no longer held office.
</P>
<P>
   But the past six months have been full of bad press for
Gingrich. In July he filed for divorce in Cobb County from Marianne
Gingrich, his wife of 18 years. Gingrich later admitted to having a
six-year relationship with Washington congressional aide Callista
Bisek. The divorce has been settled but is not final.
</P>
<P>
   Even weeks after the news broke, some contributors to Gingrich's
PAC began to have second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Alvarado, 45, a defense and telecommunications lobbyist in
Virginia, gave $1,000 to FONG in April. In September, she vowed not
to give again, and she hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of disillusioned,'' Alvarado said at the time. ``It
seems to me his life _ sort of starting with his catapult out of
the speaker's office and now with this divorce _ is out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the PAC's most recent disclosure, more than 400
people gave money during the final six months of last year.
However, fewer than 30 of those donations, totaling about $23,000,
came between October and December, when Gingrich's affair dominated
news coverage of his divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich spokesman Mike Shields said no one knows for sure why
the dollars dwindled. ``Anything anyone would say would be
conjecture at this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gingrich closed FONG and began the Committee for New
American Leadership, which is not required to disclose its
contributions and donors because it will not give funds to a
candidate for federal office. Shields said FONG intentionally
ratcheted down its fund-raising during the last reporting period to
make way for the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Like FONG, the new tax-exempt committee is devoted to Gingrich's
belief that America must use technology to revolutionize Social
Security, defense and tax systems. Gingrich has been developing his
new vision since he left the speaker's office after the GOP
suffered losses in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Towery, a former Gingrich campaign manager who has since
distanced himself from the former speaker, believes time has as
much to do with the fund-raising decline as anything else. He said
the longer a politician is out of office, the further his donations
will dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Towery wouldn't dismiss the impact of a divorce and admitted
affair, but said, ``That could easily have been a contributing
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich hasn't ignored the possibility, either. He recently
apologized for his actions in a letter to his closest supporters
that outlined his newest ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,'' he
wrote, ``a human being with shortcomings who has made, and will
continue to make, his share of mistakes.''

 &HT;    Bush has a new voice on the campiagn stump
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Introducing the new, the unvarnished ...
Preacher Man.
</P>
<P>
   Born Again after New Hampshire, Gov. George W. Bush is
testifying, punching the air with his fist, talking all about Billy
Graham and the mustard seed and how he's got Christ in his heart.
Bush is connecting it all with politics. That's because it's here,
deep in the Bible Belt, where he needs faith the most right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all lowly sinners,'' he tells cheering students at a
private Christian college in Greenville. ``That's what redemption
is all about, it seems like to me. And I'm doin' the best I can do.
And I don't know whether it's God's plan or not. The truth of the
matter is the people of South Carolina's gonna be votin' on Feb.
19. And I hope we get the vote. But I do believe in prayer and I do
believe in a personal walk and that's exactly what I'm gonna
do...''
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved Bush Show _ with the candidate morphing
into Preacher Man and making his Texas twang a little twangier _
has gone from pre-New Hampshire ``compassionate conservative'' to a
``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   He's the genuine article out to clean up Washington, he says.
He's chucked the podium and now stands before audiences on a bare
stage, microphone in hand. He's cut his 30-minute, issues-laden
speech in half so he can answer more audience questions. As Bush
described it to an audience at the Kiawah Island golf resort in
South Carolina: ``Less windy on the speeches, more windy on the
answers. ``
</P>
<P>
   He's begun holding round table discussions with senior citizens,
teachers and students _ average citizens often outnumbered by the
reporters documenting the moment. And then there's the ``One on
One.'' That's the campaign's new name for Bush's appearances, aimed
at evoking the cozy feeling of the town hall meetings that McCain
made his own in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will need more than a new style to conquer a state that not
long ago looked like a sure bet. Though he commands Republican
establishment support and far more money than McCain, Bush saw his
wide lead here evaporate after his rival beat him by double-digits
in New Hampshire. To complicate matters, South Carolina has an open
primary, which means that Democrats, who aren't holding a race on
Feb. 19, can cross party lines to vote in the Republican race.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bass, a political scientist at the College of Charleston,
said he believes the open primary could work to McCain's advantage
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the top Democratic establishment figures who six weeks
ago were sort of chuckling and pleased with McCain because they saw
him just weakening Bush are becoming a little concerned because he
could become the candidate and they do believe he would be a
tougher candidate to beat,'' Bass said, adding that Bush's style
change, ``seems to be responding in part, at least, to coming
closer to McCain's style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a campaign tactic, it's probably a positive move,''
Bass continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just getting him to appear a bit more natural. How
effective it is, it's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a strategy to refashion Bush as McCain moves up
in polls, not just in South Carolina, but in other, important
primary states such as Michigan and California, where polls show
McCain also gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the looser style, Bush is buttoned-up compared with
McCain, who continues to roll down the highways gabbing with
reporters in a campaign bus dubbed the, ``Straight Talk Express.''
Consider the following moment at a McCain campaign event this week:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wood of Spartanburg, S.C., an older man who is concerned
that presidents lose touch with average Americans, suggests to
McCain that he consider the Internet as a way to communicate if
McCain reaches the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Wood gets in return: ``I'm glad an old geezer like
you is getting on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's vintage McCain. He mixes humor, sometimes affectionately
insulting, with endless repetition of his message.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems that McCain's campaign operates by the seat
of its pants. But the candidate has not changed the basic approach
to his presidential run or to his signature event, the town hall
meeting in which he takes up to 45 minutes of questions and
sometimes pointedly tells questioners he thinks they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Bush, known in Texas for his back-slapping style,
can seem halting in front of audiences on the presidential campaign
trail. He spent this week trying to get comfortable in his new
skin. It wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the desert,'' he told the well-heeled audience at
Kiawah Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I saw this much money...This much water, this
much beautiful water, was in National Geographic.''
</P>
<P>
   At an overheated, overcrowded National Guard Armory in Gaffney,
S.C., Bush wandered through his stump speech for 15 minutes while
he answered a straightforward question about public schools and
attracting African-Americans to the Republican party. At an
assisted living center in Delaware, where Bush won the primary
Tuesday, he could have ended on a light note when a man asked him
if the Texas Rangers would beat the Yankees. Instead, he laughed,
complimented the man on his, ``perspective'' and launched into a
speech on defense and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   And dogging him always are the Bushisms, first made famous by
his dad, but being refined to a new art, such as his own
explanation of his new look:
</P>
<P>
   ``A reformer with results is a conservative who's had
compassionate results in the state of Texas.''
</P>

   NEW YORK _ Occupying a place of honor in Emn Haddad-Friedman's
bedroom in Brooklyn is a trunk. ``Just a box really,''
Haddad-Friedman said, one that doubles as an altar, providing a
perch for such items as a pair of candlesticks, an incense burner,
a cast-iron cauldron and, she said wryly, sometimes her cats.
</P>
<P>
   A solitary practitioner of Wicca _ a name for modern witchcraft
_ Haddad-Friedman has, in the parlance of the craft, lately ``come
out of the broom closet.'' She displays the symbols of her beliefs
in full view of friends and family members, who have come to regard
them, she said, with mild bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Haddad-Friedman, a senior honor student at an alternative high
school in Manhattan, practices witchcraft as time permits. ``My
best rituals are spontaneous,'' she said. ``I'm 17, I'll be going
to college; I've got a life to live.'' She never fails, however, to
acknowledge a full moon with a skyward glance and a wave.
</P>
<P>
   Falynn Trayer, also 17, is similarly breezy about her
witchcraft. ``I have no set rituals,'' she said. Trayer is the
daughter of a Wiccan author, who uses the pen name Silver
RavenWolf. ``If I want a better grade at school, I may ask the god
and goddess for their help, burn a candle _ something like that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is utterly diligent, however, about wearing her pentacle,
the five-pointed star enclosed within a circle that is the symbol
of Wicca, displaying it outside her clothes. There was a time, she
said, when her icon alarmed classmates and teachers at her high
school in south-central Pennsylvania, who thought that they
detected about it a faint whiff of sulfur. ``They used to look at
my pentacle and call me names,'' Trayer said. ``Now, they see it
and want to know more.'' She usually obliges with a brief
explanation, but stops short of describing the subtler mysteries of
her faith. ``Every religion has its secrets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trayer and Haddad-Friedman are members of a movement gaining an
ardent following among teen-agers, mostly girls, who are in part
captivated by the glossy new image of witches portrayed on
television shows and in the movies. No longer the hideous,
wart-covered crone of folklore and fairy tale, witches in hit
television shows like ``Charmed,'' starring Shannen Doherty, and
the 1996 movie ``The Craft,'' a favorite with teen-agers at video
stores, are avatars of glamour, power and style.
</P>
<P>
   Other youthful adherents of Wicca, seeking an alternative path
to spirituality, are attracted by the craft's lack of structure and
dogma.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans, as they have been known since Gerald Gardner, an
English high Wiccan priest, popularized the faith in the 1950s and
'60s, have no codified beliefs or essential texts. Practitioners
are unified primarily by their belief in a dual divinity: a god and
goddess. They also share a reverence for the natural world, which
they see as permeated with powerful energy that may be tapped
through rituals or magic for healing or success in work or love.
</P>
<P>
   Generally meeting in covens, which anoint their own priests and
priestesses, Wiccans chant and cast or draw circles to invoke their
deities, mainly during festivals like Samhain and Yule, which
coincide with Halloween and Christmas, and when the moon is full.
</P>
<P>
   Few are willing to discuss what they call their faith openly
with strangers, for fear of being stigmatized. Fewer still seek
converts, perhaps because there is no need. In recent years, this
once largely underground practice has come out in the open, its
numbers climbing strongly since 1986, when a federal appeals court
ruled that Wicca was a legal religion protected by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the movement's size in the United States vary from
100,000 to about 1 million, the latter figure cited by Fritz Jung,
who with his wife, Wren Walker, created the Witches' Voice, a Web
site at www.witchvox.com. Teen-age Wiccans, who tend to worship
alone or to meet in small, informal groups, are the hardest to
track. While there is no definitive count, 35 percent of the total
visitors to the Witches' Voice _ or close to 5,000 of them _ are
under 18, said Jung, who tracks their ages. ``So Ya Wanna Be a
Witch?'' the company's Web page for teen-agers, has drawn 175,000
visitors in the last two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the popularity of Web sites aimed at teen-agers (some
320 are listed on Witchvox alone), and by the small army of
television producers, movie makers, magazine editors and
booksellers now promoting the Wiccan lifestyle, the craft has cast
a powerful enchantment on the high-school and college-age
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contemporary witch is the beautiful 25 year old that you
see on TV,'' said Jami Shoemaker, the publicist for Lllewellyn
Worldwide, the St. Paul-based publisher of RavenWolf's books ``Teen
Witch'' and ``To Ride a Silver Broomstick.''
</P>
<P>
   The pert, comely and often sultry Wiccans of recent movies,
including ``Practical Magic,'' and of television hits like
``Sabrina, the Teen-age Witch,'' ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer'' and
``Charmed,'' are cast as slender Circes.
</P>
<P>
   The three fetching Wiccan siblings of ``Charmed,'' broadcast
Thursday nights on the WB network, wear skin-baring sweaters and
coral-slicked lips as they dispatch demons, exuding a wholesome
randiness all the while. Their candid sexuality, played against
their otherwise genteel demeanors, has made ``Charmed'' the No. 2
rated show on the network among viewers 18 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, too, have heeded the pagan's siren call. A recent
issue of Jump, a monthly for teen-age girls, featured a fashion
layout on ``goddess style'' _ an update on hippie exoticism. The
magazine refrains from discussing witchcraft directly lest it
alienate some readers, said its editor, Lori Berger, but it peppers
its pages with features on astrology, herbal cures and color
therapy _ witches' stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our reader surveys, those stories just score though the
roof,'' Berger said. ``There's a sense of magic that girls get from
this that is very empowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers have been particularly enterprising in trading on
witchcraft's appeal to the lovelorn: the Borders bookstore on 57th
Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan has dedicated no less than 21
feet of shelf space to Magical Studies, including titles like ``The
Little Book of Love Spells'' (Andrews McNeel, 1997) and ``Titania's
Wishing Spells: Love'' (William Morrow, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, even cosmetics makers have capitalized on
Wicca. MAC, a hip small brand, introduced a collection called Earth
Goddess, and recently expanded it to include fragrances it calls
``potions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These products are not about sorcery,'' maintained Michelle
Feeney, MAC's vice president for global communication. But it is
hard to miss the witchy message in the advertisements. Asphalt
Flower, a pungent oil, is described as ``a harmony of dark
blossoms, perversely empowered by dense woody notes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a cosmetic for the soul, witchcraft is a lodestone for
the defiantly unconventional and the would-be hip, who stream into
Manhattan shops like Morgana's Closet on West 10th Street, which
sells pendulums for divining, tarot cards and moonstone rings; and
into Enchanted Childe on Orchard Street, where tightly laced frocks
with bell-shaped sleeves recall the singer Stevie Nicks, a favorite
of Wiccans, who took to the stage in the 1970s trailing wispy
scarves, her face illuminated by a hundred candles.
</P>
<P>
   But to focus on Wicca's trappings is perhaps to miss its impact
as a faith on sincere seekers. They burn incense, consecrate
candles, chant and draw ``magick'' circles in the air. Simone
Magaletta, 21, a junior at New York University and a self-taught
aspiring Wiccan, maintains that learning the craft has influenced
her profoundly. ``It has made me more determined to make something
of myself,'' she said. ``And taught me to live in a more positive
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The craft is ``especially appealing to the young people who want
to be active participants in their own spiritual lives,'' said Wren
Walker of the Witches' Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft is also a magnet for feminists, who identify with its
female deity, and for environmentalists drawn by the reverence for
nature. It also exerts a pull on the eccentric, the sensitive and
the socially disconnected. Wicca ``empowers the marginalized,''
said John K. Simmons, a professor of religious studies at Western
Illinois University, who has studied contemporary witchcraft. ``It
appeals most of all to the intelligent, poetic young woman who is
not necessarily going to go out for cheerleader or date the captain
of the football team.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Such pursuits hold little charm for a 15-year-old Wiccan in from
Roseville, Calif., a town near Sacramento, who is one of many
teen-age witches who list their e-mail addresses on the Witches'
Voice. Asking to be identified only as Tuesday, her on-line name,
she said in an e-mail message: ``I still read these childhood
favorites, `The Young Wizard' series by Diane Duane and so many
others I can't begin to list them.'' Her rituals are mostly
spontaneous, she added. ``I'll draw the blinds up and sleep in the
light of the full moon if I can. I also try to pray daily at my
altar. I light the big red candle and kneel before I do math and
English homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends sometimes tease her, she went on, humming snatches of
``Black Magic Woman'' in her presence and asking her to turn their
teachers into frogs. She tries to take their taunts in stride and
to cope with her mother's disapproval as well. ``My mother thinks
that this is weird,'' Tuesday wrote. ``Wiccans to her are not to be
trusted. She tells me that this is a temporary thing that she and
my father must discuss. They're considering not allowing me to
practice in our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Wicca appeals most to middle-class kids, mostly girls, who live
in rural areas and suburbs, said Andres I. Perez y Mena, an
assistant professor of anthropology at Long Island University in
Brooklyn. ``They have few distractions and even less control over
their lives, and they practice sorcery to exert power over their
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Rituals and cauldrons aren't a substitute for
social action.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, potent symbols of rebellion. ``The witch
stands outside the notion of acceptable behavior; she challenges
the power structure, she's dangerous, she's angry,'' said Phyllis
Curott, a lawyer, Wiccan priestess and the author of ``The Book of
Shadows'' (Broadway Books, 1999), in which she describes her
discovery of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wicca portrays itself as a positive creed, it remains
the bane of some parents, educators and clergymen, who are
concerned or even alarmed by its associations with black magic and
demons.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans are not to be confused with the black-cloaked,
hardware-festooned Goths and Satanists, other subcultures popular
with teen-agers that are obsessed with death and invoke the devil
in their rites. Wiccans reject Satan as a fiction devised by man.
``There is no black magic or white magic, there is only magic,''
maintained Lady Armida, a Wiccan priestess, who is the owner of
Enchanted Childe.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring such disclaimers, some school officials have sought to
root out the Wiccans in their midst. At Lincoln Park High School in
Lincoln Park, Mich., a Detroit suburb, Crystal Seifferly, a
17-year-old honor student, was told not to wear a pentacle. But in
a court case decided just over a year ago, the American Civil
Liberties Union successfully argued that the school's prohibition
violated her First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   When they emerge from the ``broom closet,'' young Wiccans like
Haddad-Friedman of Brooklyn, who dresses primarily in black and
paints streaks of color in her long, tar-black hair, still draw
comments and quizzical looks from teachers and strangers. Recently,
a teacher stopped her in the school hallway, Haddad-Friedman
recalled, and asked with concern, ``Are you all right?'' ``Some
people _ strangers in the street _ even tried to get me to go to
counseling,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, such anxieties are understandable. There is no
overlooking witchcraft's charisma for self-styled rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a big metal head, with the chains, the leather jacket,
the whole nine yards, and I wanted to become a Satanist,'' said
Chris, 24, who prefers to be identified by his first name only.
Leaning on a counter stocked with rainbow-colored incense powders
at Enchanted Childe, where he works, he recalled discovering
witchcraft instead, while a teen-ager. He calls it an uplifting
path to inward transformation, but he frequently hears from people
``who are getting into the craft because they want to be feared,''
he said. ``You know _ they imagine people will take one look at
their pentacle and rush to get out of the way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Certain performers, an elect group particularly
noticeable in that endangered genre known as the musical comedy,
seem to carry their own personal spotlights. Their built-in glow is
so intense that it can match whatever electric wattage is thrown
upon them. And no matter where one of them is actually standing on
any given stage, it is de facto dead center, the place where an
audience's eyes are destined to gravitate.
</P>
<P>
   That Kristin Chenoweth belongs to this cherished minority became
evident last season in the opening minutes of a less than gripping
Broadway revival of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' in which
she played an existentially anguished preschooler with utter and
unlikely conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it was obvious, was a natural theatrical resource to be
exploited. Only months later, Chenoweth was starring in her own
Broadway show, ``Epic Proportions,'' an unfortunate yuck-fest
through which her radiance remained touchingly steady.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has been given the intimidating assignment, in this
season's opening production of the wonderful Encores! series of
American musicals in concert, of carrying a less than perfect show
haunted by the tenacious shadow of its original leading lady,
Barbara Harris, who won Broadway immortality in it only to
disappear forever from live musicals a few years later. And
Chenoweth seems to treat the entire experience as if it were a
piece of cake, tasty and easily digested.
</P>
<P>
   The show is ``On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' the 1965
musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane about extrasensory
perception and reincarnation, today largely known only for its
title song and a lumpy movie version starring Barbra Streisand.
``Clear Day'' was the product of an especially tortured gestation
process for Lerner, who with his best-known collaborator, Frederick
Loewe, had created ``Brigadoon,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and ``Camelot''
and was now in a period of anxious uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   This all showed when ``Clear Day'' finally opened on Broadway in
October 1965 after many painful reincarnations of its own. Its book
was strained and muddled, most critics agreed; its big production
numbers were simply cumbersome. But it did have two invaluable
assets. One was the lushly melodic score by Lane (``Finian's
Rainbow''); the other was Harris, an actress whose name quickly
became a byword on Broadway for a singular charm that balanced wit
and wistfulness.
</P>
<P>
   As it was then, so it remains. The new concert adaptation, which
opened Thursday night under Mark Brokaw's direction and runs
through Sunday, isn't one of those Encores! evenings that makes you
think, ``Now why hasn't this been revived more often?'' The answers
have not been camouflaged here.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original ``Clear Day,'' however, this one is a must-see
for its music and its star. The former, as might be expected, is
presented at its luxurious best by the conductor Rob Fisher,
working from the original orchestrations of the fabled Robert
Russell Bennett and his Coffee Club Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Chenoweth, who beams through the night in what
seems to be (and of course is not) a state of effortless ecstasy,
lending wholesale sincerity to an outrageous gimmick of a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear Day,'' which has been tweaked and clarified (somewhat)
by the playwright David Ives, is the tangled story of Daisy Gamble
( Chenoweth), a self-deprecating young woman notable for her New
York nasality, low self-esteem and addiction to cigarettes. She
also has these little gifts for making plants grow at warp speed
and for predicting when a phone is going to ring.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bruckner (Peter Friedman), a psychiatrist treating Daisy's
smoking problems with hypnosis, soon uncovers another personality
in his patient: that of the beautiful and headstrong Melinda, who
lived a tragic life in 18th-century London. You really don't want
or need to know how all this plays out, and it seems unlikely that
even Lerner could explain entirely what he was trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear Day'' suggests an older man's half-formed, coded
response to elements of the so-called youthquake of the mid-1960s:
mind-altering experiences and mysticism; a revolt against suburban
conformity, here represented by Daisy's starchy fiancee (Roger
Bart), and a heady sense of sexual license, embodied in the show by
Melinda's tales of erotic depravity in the age of Hogarth.
</P>
<P>
   The production numbers afforded by this two-tiered historical
approach were always, apparently, labored. John Carrafa, the
choreographer for the Encores! version, responds with a couple of
unimaginative era-defining dance sequences: one with lots of
frugging and another an erotic ballet in a London brothel.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Clear Day'' also allows its star to execute virtuoso
shifts between her current and former selves, somewhat reminiscent
of the two sides of Lerner's best-known heroine, Eliza Dolittle.
Chenoweth does this with admirable clarity and with a minimum of
showoff self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   This young star has already mastered the exaggerated character
technique that conventional musicals demand (her long mini-skirted
legs are as expressive as semaphore flags) while still conveying
absolute emotional conviction about whatever she's doing.
</P>
<P>
   She is also in excellent voice, or rather voices: gaminish brass
for Daisy and elegant silver for Melinda. She brings surgical
exactitude to her first split-personality number, ``Tosy and
Cosh,'' and a conversational spontaneity to the terrific, quirky
torch song ``What Did I Have That I Don't Have.''
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, Chenoweth is equaled by only one other performer. Brent
Barrett, who was excellent as the oily lawyer in the current
``Chicago'' revival, here plays another kind of cad, the roue
portrait painter beloved of Melinda, and invests the role with
matinee-idol presence and a glorious tenor that does full justice
to the exquisite ballad ``She Wasn't You.'' And there are vivid,
enjoyable character numbers by Bart (Snoopy to Chenoweth's Sally in
``Charlie Brown'') and Louis Zorich, as a Greek tycoon interested
in reincarnation for pecuniary reasons all his own.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who has shone in New York productions of ``Ragtime''
and ``The Loman Family Picnic,'' offers curiously little intensity
in the Svengali role first played on Broadway by John Cullum. He
comes across here as a likable, relaxed fellow with a pleasant
voice, but relaxation isn't really what's asked for in an
imperative 11 o'clock number like ``Come Back to Me.'' And you're
less aware than usual at Encores! of distinctively defined
presences among the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, begins to extinguish Chenoweth's hypnotic
flame. She seems so utterly at home up there, stepping into center
stage as if it were a pair of old bedroom slippers, that your heart
quakes a bit at the news that she is developing a television pilot.
Musical cultists still mourn the absence of Harris, who did only
one Broadway musical, ``The Apple Tree,'' after ``Clear Day.'' We
can only hope that Chenoweth keeps returning to a world of theater
she was so clearly made for.

<P>
   PILOT MOUNTAIN, N.C. _ For all the cargo capacity of the 2000
Ford Excursion, it enters the market carrying almost more baggage
than it can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's introduction last year of its uber-utility provoked
protests and galvanized a coalition of sport utility haters _ from
environmentalists to intimidated drivers of small cars _ for whom
the 7,000-pound Excursion was a big, fat bete noire.
</P>
<P>
   There, its critics said, behold what lies at the bottom of
America's slippery-slope love affair with huge SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, perhaps not. Certainly there are heavy-hauling types
like ranchers and boaters who can actually use its bulk, its muscle
and its five-ton towing capacity; Ford insists that it is serving
this market.
</P>
<P>
   For those outside that demographic, the Excursion may pass a
threshold of practicality. At almost 19 feet long and 80 inches
wide, it cannot gain entry to may garages and car washes. It hangs
out of an ordinary parking space like a fat man in a Speedo.
Considering the urban aggravation factor, you might as well commute
in a Zamboni.
</P>
<P>
   If dimestore cowboys and urban poseurs buy the Excursion just to
make a larger-than-thou statement, they will be getting what they
deserve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, General Motors, which builds what had previously been
the largest sport utility, the Suburban, will not try to out-gross
its new rival. Indeed, it has called the redesigned Suburban, with
an almost straight face, ``the sensible SUV.''
</P>
<P>
   Built on Ford's Super Duty pickup platform, the Excursion is
available with three engines: a 5.4-liter, 255-horsepower V-8,
which is standard with two-wheel drive; a 6.8-liter, 310-horse
V-10, standard on 4-by-4s; and a 7.3-liter, 235-horsepower diesel
V-8 that generates a globe-turning 500 foot-pounds of torque. With
the larger engines, maximum towing capacity is 10,000 pounds, plus
almost a ton of cargo in the truck. Like all of Ford's sport
utilities, the Excursion meets federal low-emission standards.
</P>
<P>
   My test vehicle was a loden-green Excursion Limited 4-by-4 with
the V-10, which offers a shade less towing (9,600 pounds) and cargo
capacity (1,710 pounds) than two-wheel-drive models. This
configuration, at $41,665, is likely to be the bedrock of the line.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to testing this behemoth, it was clear that the
ordinary drive over hill and dale would not suffice. We would have
to tow something _ something big. We found it in a 30-foot, 3-axle
Airstream travel trailer, the descendent of those capsule-shaped
aluminum campers made famous in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in at more than 7,500 pounds and costing $57,133
(loaded with everything plus a kitchen sink, this one of Corian),
the Airstream is just the kind of Paul Bunyan load the Excursion
was designed to transport.
</P>
<P>
   On the appointed Friday, my wife and I and another couple piled
a weekend's worth of gear, plus a high-strung Weimaraner, into the
capacious interior and headed for Jameokee campground.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first things you notice are the outsized doors, any
one of which would do justice to the abbey at Rouen. The three
cargo doors (an upper liftgate and two lower doors) swing fully out
of the way for unobstructed access to the hold. We removed the
third-row bench, which is on rollers, to create a warehouse of 100
cubic feet. This space was so large that we could dispense with
packing altogether and just shovel in our belongings, and the dog,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Full-length running boards are standard, to aid in the almost
two-foot climb up into the cabin. Once seated, the driver has a
view that is panoramic, in the sense that guides at Niagara Falls
use the word. You simply tower over other traffic, coming nearly
eye-to-eye with long-haul truckers.
</P>
<P>
   The front doors have cut-downs in the window sills so the driver
can have a better view of the oversized and heated outside mirrors.
Even so, it's easy to lose sight of smaller fry, like Cadillacs,
swimming alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Suburban, the Excursion interior feels more
refined. The seats were amply cushioned and upholstered with supple
leather. Ford used lots of sound-deadening material, and it ended
up with a vast volume of amniotic quiet.
</P>
<P>
   All of Ford's experience at creating comfy SUVs has been brought
to bear. There are 10 strategically situated cup holders and many
shrewdly placed cubbyholes. The second row of seats not only
recline, they also fold forward to create a flat-bed cargo area
measuring 146.4 cubic feet. It looks like a carpeted squash court.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the unladen Excursion drives like the gigantic
truck it started life as, jouncing merrily on heavy-duty leaf
springs. Nothing could improve the ride so much as a quarter-ton of
sandbags. The steering is light and reasonably direct. But the
brakes _ four discs with an antilock system _ seemed inadequate to
haul the 7,190-pound vehicle down from 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever vices the Excursion may have as a passenger wagon
become virtues when you attach a big trailer. As a matter of simple
leverage, a vehicle with a long wheelbase is more stable when
towing. Likewise, sheer physics mean that the heavier the towing
vehicle, relative to what is being towed, the more stable and
secure the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, you can't simply plug an Airstream into the
Excursion's Class IV hitch and drive off. In the interests of
safety, Airstream Inc. insisted that we use a dual sway-bar rig, a
spidery steel apparatus that helps to prevent the trailer from
weaving.
</P>
<P>
   We also required an adjustable towing head as well as an
auxiliary brake-control module. This device, wired under the dash,
connects the truck's brakes to the trailer's. Without it, the
trailer would tend to push even the Excursion off the road.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of installation, Grady Kilby, owner of
Out-of-Doors Mart in Kernersville, N.C., pronounced the Excursion
fit to travel. ``The biggest mistake people make in trailering is
having too small a tow vehicle,'' he said. No danger of that here.
</P>
<P>
   For casual users, the 425 foot-pounds of torque is wasted. Given
the weight and gearing, that power cannot make the truck hustle any
quicker to 60 mph (10.6 seconds, according to Automobile magazine).
Where torque comes in handy is under load. Leaving Out-of-Doors
Mart, the Excursion accelerated as smoothly and crisply as ever, as
if it were pulling nothing at all. At highway speeds, the engine
relaxed into an effortless hum. Only on uphill grades of 4 percent
or more did the truck begin to exert.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the load-leveling hitch is to distribute the
trailer's weight evenly on the truck's chassis, so that the front
end doesn't rise off the ground. Even so, the Excursion felt light
and the steering was a little vague, though not so much as to
affect control.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the really difficult part of the trailering experience
was the touchiness of the brakes. If I even breathed on the pedal,
the auxiliary controller seized the trailer's drum brakes, jerking
the truck back alarmingly. I learned to use engine braking to slow
down, and to plan well ahead when stopping.
</P>
<P>
   Our experiment in heavy trailering was, alas, not without
incident. Backing down an incline of wet grass, trying to angle
toward the dump station _ the mysteries of gray water and brown
water are just as well unplumbed, as far as I'm concerned _ I
pressed the brakes too hard. Both vehicles' brakes locked, and I
folded the rig like a pocketknife, putting a nasty dent in the
Airstream and an unsightly scratch on the Excursion. What an awful
sound!
</P>
<P>
   We returned the Airstream to the dealership and sighed in relief
that more damage had not been done. Meanwhile, our calculations
showed that the Excursion's fuel economy was, oddly, about the same
with and without the trailer: 10 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like that infuriate Excursion critics and no doubt cause
chagrin for Ford's chairman, William C. Ford Jr., who is trying to
put a green face on the company. At the Detroit auto show last
month, as Ford announced its new Think division of environmentally
friendly bikes, carts and electric cars, it was hard not view the
effort as an attempt to atone for the Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with more than 36,000 already sold, demand is likely to
outstrip the production limit of 60,000 a year. With Ford pocketing
an estimated $15,000 to $20,000 of profit on each sale, the
Excursion may turn out to be one of the most successful public
relations disasters in corporate history.

BROADCAST TV BUSINESS SHOWS SIGNS OF DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, February 13, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   What does the sudden explosion of television quiz shows, news
magazines, wrestling extravaganzas and soon-to-come ``reality
dramas'' say about life in America in 2000? Not as much as you
might think.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, indicate something worth knowing about
television. Money is migrating out of broadcast TV and into other
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate beneficiaries are likely to be cable television
channels and video rental chains. In the longer run, Internet
service providers, new intermediaries and a host of new programmers
will occupy the heights.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast TV business, for 50 years one of the brightest
jewels of the crown of the entertainment industry, is in the early
stages of a commercial collapse, similar to the technological
demotion that happened to radio in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The key thing to understand about television's new programming
is that it costs only about half as much to produce as sitcoms and
dramas that are prime-time television's normal fare. Its adoption
is a sign, not so much of some new wrinkle in tastes, but of
distress.
</P>
<P>
   TV won't vanish. It gradually will accept a more subsidiary and
differentiated role, much as has radio. Radio remains ubiquitous,
reaching into millions of homes and autos on a daily basis. Radio
stations are prosperous businesses.
</P>
<P>
   No longer, however, do great radio networks command the national
audiences that they did in the years before television. Nor do they
participate in the choicer cuts of advertising. Nor does their
lobbying organization wield as much clout as before. The rise of
ABC's thrice-weekly quiz show, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
to the status of top show in the nation is one of the most striking
events of the broadcast year. The show was licensed from a British
production company as a summer replacement.
</P>
<P>
   When it became popular it was moved to the regular broadcast
season. Some 28 million people now watch the program _ enough to
catapult ABC from third in network ratings to a likely first place.
(In contrast, an episode of ``The Sopranos'' now has about 15
million viewers on HBO.) Eight hours of game show programming can
be found in prime-time now, compared to none before
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two other European imports known as ``reality shows''
are on their way this summer. ``Survivor,'' from Sweden, situates
16 persons on a jungle island and eliminates the least inventive
each week by vote of the cast and viewers until only one is left.
That person wins $1 million _ financed in part by product
placements (the survivors wear Reebok shoes, for example.)
</P>
<P>
   And ``Big Brother,'' a Dutch soap opera in which 10 persons are
confined to a house and photographed continually, even in the
shower, is expected to run for 100 consecutive nights in prime time
_ possibly with a Web site permitting viewers to track their
characters around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer sovereignty? Perhaps. But cutting the quality of
evening television is a also sure-fire way to show higher profits,
at least for a time. With few writers and no stars, the new shows
cost as little as $750,000 per episode to produce _ compared with a
$1.2 million price tag or more for an hourlong police thriller or a
hospital drama.
</P>
<P>
   But such economies come at a price. Even though their novelty
may initially attract a good audience, their logic may be hard to
escape. As Joseph P. Kahn demonstrated in The Boston Globe last
week, the content of the new quiz shows represents a decided
dumbing-down compared with the 1950s, when an earlier quiz-show
mania was at its peak and the networks commanded a genuinely
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   With CBS, NBC, ABC, and Fox moving decisively toward the cheaper
fare _ and with Warner Bros., United Paramount, and public
broadcasting networks chipping away at their audience _ the risk is
that prime-time television broadcasting will become segmented as a
market for poor people, even while becoming more of a commodity
world, with one channel's programming resembling every other more
and more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the new programming is a vicious circle with respect to
revenues, since there exists no significant market for reruns of
game shows and news magazines. Dramas and sitcoms can be syndicated
and sold around the world for years at a time, but not the new
programs. With less and less income from prime-time slots, networks
will have difficulty finding money to return to their old
quality-programming ways.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, new technology threatens to undermine the advertising
game on which commercial broadcasting ultimately rests. The new
digital video recorders just coming on to the market store programs
on a computer hard drive instead of tape _ and make it easier than
ever to zap commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the new broadcast medium? The replacement for television
is not yet in sight, except that it is clear that it will involve
the Internet. Video ``streaming'' is still in its early stages, but
once standards are worked out and bandwidth increases, Web-based
television will distribute online virtually everything that now is
being broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this context that Ford Motor Co. recently gave each of
its 350,000 employees a personal computer, printer, and unlimited
Internet access for $5 a month. (It was in 1914 that Ford sparked
the age of mass consumption with a similiar decision to pay its
production workers the then-unhead-of sum of $5 a day.) The company
believes that the Internet will be the equivalent of the moving
assembly line of the 21st century. And so it will. But it will also
replace the electronic hearth.
</P>
<P>
   For a while longer TV will command the really big audiences, the
Super Bowl, the Academy Awards, the late-night talk shows. The new
supernetworks are still some years away. But eventually, the
vaunted convergence between cable and fiber-optic ``pipeline''
companies and content providers and all of the intermediaries in
between will occur. Then, the barriers between networks will come
down and you'll be able to watch anything you want, with
advertising or pay-per-view. That's where the big audiences _ and
the big bucks _ will be.

promise of an end to the British province's polarized political
life and took years of negotiations to set up, came to a halt
Friday after only 10 weeks in operation. Britain's Northern Ireland

   ``We have a saying in this band: Once we get into the world of
Ellingtonia, we stay there awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic understatement, guitarist and educator Kenny
Burrell introduced several tunes associated with the Duke at
Catalina Bar &AMP; Grill on Wednesday, the second of six nights at the
intimate jazz room.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a foremost authority on Ellington, Burrell has taught
a course he created, called Ellingtonia, at UCLA for 18 years. The
appreciation was mutual _ Ellington said Burrell was his favorite
guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Fronting a flexible ensemble that included pianist Gerald
Wiggins, drummer Sherman Ferguson, saxophonist Herman Riley and
bassist Roberto Miranda, Burrell, 68, made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran bandleader ended the first set with one of his
signature tunes, a cooking modal blues that could have come from
any number of classic Blue Note sessions of the late '50s or '60s.

   JERUSALEM _ Just after headlines here pronounced an easing of
this week's heightened violence in southern Lebanon, an attack by
Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli soldier Friday and
Israeli warplanes responded swiftly with airstrikes at suspected
guerrilla targets.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed attacks disrupted a five-country meeting in Naqoura,
Lebanon, which had been convened in an effort to calm tensions
after the worst week of fighting in southern Lebanon since last
June. The meeting of a committee that monitors the conflict ended
before it officially began when Israel's representatives were
ordered by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister and Defense Minister Barak today instructed
Israeli representatives to stop the deliberations and return for
consultations,'' a statement from Barak's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said that guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Party of God, or Hezbollah, violated the four-year-old rules of the
conflict Friday by firing rocket and mortar shells from inside a
civilian village, Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas fired on an Israeli outpost near a Crusades-era
castle just across the Lebanese border from Metullah, Israel. In
less than three weeks, they have killed seven Israeli soldiers,
including the one killed Friday, and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
   Seven soldiers from the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army have
also been killed by guerrillas since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of the guerrilla attack Friday, Israeli jets
struck southern Lebanon, apparently sweeping the Nabatiyeh valley
in a search for the guerrillas who had fired.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors of the conflict fear that the violence could continue
to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very optimistic that the future will be very rosy
here,'' Timor Goeskl, a spokesman for the U.N. Interim Forces in
Lebanon, said in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Israelis would respond further by
bombing civilian targets, as they did earlier this week when they
struck power stations throughout Lebanon in reaction to Hezbollah
killings of their soldiers. The bombing wounded about 20 Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will respond at the time and place and in the way that we
choose,'' Barak said in an interview on Israeli television Friday
night. ``And as was proven this week, our response is not just
limited to south Lebanon. And our responses are very painful to the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israel bombed civilian targets in Lebanon only
after the guerrillas lobbed rockets over the border into Israel.
But this week, changing the terms of the 18-year-old conflict, the
Israeli army for the first time shelled civilian targets in
retaliation for attacks on its soldiers in the war zone. Since
Israel occupied the zone, a nine-mile-deep swath of southern
Lebanon, to protect its northern border from attack, guerrillas
have been seeking to oust its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief of staff,
said on Thursday that Israel would no longer tolerate attacks on
its forces and would respond harshly. If Hezbollah fires from
civilian villages, the Israelis will target guerrillas in those
villages, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Mofaz said
the army was working on ``a method for hitting those who fire at us
from civilian buildings, to deter the local populations from giving
them cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to hit innocent civilians,'' he said, ``and
we'll act only when the conditions are right for a surgical strike
at the shooters. But we won't allow Hezbollah to exploit that fact
that we cannot hit the civilian populations.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials defended Israel and blamed
Hezbollah for using violence to disrupt the meeting in Naqoura. The
Americans ``interpret this action as a deliberate attempt by
Hezbollah to wreck the prospects for peace in the meeting,'' said
James P. Rubin, spokesman for the State Department. ``Hezbollah's
action is particularly egregious in the context of Israel's
repeated commitment to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the middle
of this year.'' Barak has pledged to pull out of southern Lebanon
by July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is entering its very final stages,'' Barak said
Friday night. ``What I'm telling you is that I'm determined to end
the tragedy that is Lebanon, which has gone on for 18 long years.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had hoped to withdraw troops in the context of a peace
agreement with Syria. But the hopes for renewing peace talks with
Syria, suspended last month, may have grown dimmer in the face of
this week's violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rubin said the violence did not help the peace
effort. ``It was difficult enough in a calm environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also said that the United States had asked Syria to
``exercise its influence'' over Hezbollah to get them to restrain
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's monitoring committee meeting, gathering delegates from
the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, was to have
addressed violations of the rules of engagement in the conflict.
The rules, set in 1996 after an Israeli bombardment killed some 200
Lebanese, hold that civilians should not be involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even before news of the soldier's killing reached the delegates
in Naqoura, the meeting was endangered. Lebanese officials said
that U.S. and French monitors had spent four hours trying
unsuccessfully to get the Israelis to sit down with the Lebanese
and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the first official meeting between Israel and
Syria since peace talks broke off last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief lull between casualties, the Israelis had been
debating whether the fighting had calmed because Syria acted to
restrain the Hezbollah forces. Contrary to the Israelis'
expectations, the guerrillas did not respond to the bombing by
firing rockets at northern Israeli villages. Then there were two
days without any soldiers being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Polls published Friday showed that three-quarters of Israelis
surveyed supported the bombings, and that more than half thought
they should have been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians here have said that if Israel renounced the
four-year-old rules of engagement and if Hezbollah knew that the
Israelis would respond severely to every attack, the war would be
over. Some said that Hezbollah takes advantage of Israeli
hand-wringing over the futility of its presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Television interviewers grilled Barak Friday night about whether
the bombardment was sufficient reaction. They also asked Barak, a
former general and life-long military man, if he could put himself
in the shoes of the soldiers serving in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a soldier long enough to understand,'' he said,
``and I know what all the soldiers want _ to be home in peace.''

 &HT;    S.C. to again play a major role for GOP politics
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. - Watching television in the 1960s, Columbia
native Mark Carman was shocked by the black-and-white footage of
state police and their snarling dogs attacking civil rights
marchers in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says the unflattering national spotlight has turned on
South Carolina, its image tattered by the prolonged, angry fight
over the Confederate flag, as Republicans descend for Saturday's
pivotal presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing how ugly we are, and it is tough,'' said Carman,
39, manager of Capital Newstand on Main Street, less than a block
from America's last state capitol to fly the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is shaping up to be the real loser in the
bruising, neck-and-neck primary between front runners George W.
Bush and John McCain. With Steve Forbes dropping out of the race
last week, Alan Keyes is expected to finish a distant third _ but
with a public image well ahead of the Palmetto State, still
fighting 135 years after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a controversy where we are tearing each other apart
in this state,'' state Sen. Ernie Passailaigue (D-Charleston) said
last week, urging warring colleagues to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, says Walter Edgar, a history professor at the
University of South Carolina, the unfavorable national covarage
could spark some needed changes by showing ``people in South
Carolina that the outside world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature raised the Confederate flag in 1962 as
part of a Civil War centennial. Recently, Gov. Jim Hodges, several
former governors, the NAACP, the state chamber of commerce and
numerous other groups have called for the flag's removal. But the
legislature has failed to act, torn by the flag's clashing
symbolism _ heritage to Confederate ancestors and slavery to civil
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the growing frustration over the political stalemate,
University of South Carolina economist Doug Woodward joked that
U.S. Army soldiers from nearby Fort Jackson ought to march over and
take down the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said bad publicity from the flag could cost the state
more than the estimated few million dollars going into Republican
primary ads and accommodations for campaign staffs and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unfortunate that we are having this primary now while
this flag debate goes on,'' Woodward said. ''It does not reflect
well on the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did last month's Republican candidates' debate in
Columbia, staged in an old home improvement store where the
national broadcast picked up catcalls by apparently drunken people
in the audience. A second televised debate is planned for Tuesday.
Alcohol will not be available to the general audience this time,
said Dana Mishoe, spokeswoman for debate sponsor, the Business and
Industry Political Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce Republican campaigning has brought excitement to
South Carolina, not to mention unexpected advertising revenue to
radio and television stations. Through Friday, Bush and McCain had
purchased $380,000 worth of air time on NBC affiliate WIS-TV in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are expecting more dollars,'' said WIS-TV sales manager
Debbie Johnson, explaining that the close race is forcing Bush and
McCain to spend heavily.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by stinging comments last week on national programs
such as ''Larry King Live,'' C-Span's ''Washington Journal'' and
National Public Radio, the flag fight has overshadowed South
Carolina's achievements, such as attracting last year more than $5
billion in capital investments, a record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner the flag issue is resolved, the better,''
Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said. ''It has the potential to
incorrectly and unfairly portray our state.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina peacefully integrated its public colleges, said
Riley, also noting that retiring state Supreme Court chief justice,
Ernest Finney, is black.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rancor over the flag has dredged up ugliness from the
past, some of which, fortunately for South Carolina's reputation,
hasn't yet drawn national attention.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state without a permanent, paid
holiday to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King' Jr.'s birthday. A
state House committee last week endorsed such a holiday, but not
before a Charleston Republican attacked the slain civil rights
leader's character.
</P>
<P>
   King was ''an enthusiastic serial adulterer who wandered through
life in adulterous relationships,'' state Rep. John Graham Altman
told the House Judiciary Committee. ''Perception has overtaken the
reality of the life he led.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian
said he regretted Altman's slap, though it made Republicans look
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes (South Carolinians) look like a bunch of ignorant
rednecks who can't deal with one another with any degree of common
civility,'' Harpootlian said.
</P>
<P>
   For certain, the flag fight has unleashed hostilities, including
a racist handwritten death threat last week against one of the
flag's most vocal opponents, state Sen. Darrell Jackson
(D-Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   The letter, being investigated by state police, told Jackson he
didn't have ''the right or the class to shine Arthur Ravenel's
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravenel is a Republican senator from Charleston who refused to
apologize to the NAACP after telling a Confederate heritage rally
last month that the group stands for ''National Association for the
Mentally Retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   From South Carolina's rancor, the Confederate flag has suddenly
emerged as a lightning rod in America's uneasy debate over race. It
has dogged the Republican presidential candidates since last
month's debate in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain said South Carolinians ought to decide the
flag's fate, a position that Democratic presidential contender Bill
Bradley last week, during a Columbia stop, denounced as ignoring
''a hateful and shameful past.''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce campaigning has dredged up another skirmish. Visiting
Columbia last week, Democratic presidential contender Bill Bradley
criticized Bush for kicking off his South Carolina campaign with a
speech at Bob Jones University. In 1984, the fundamental Christian
college in Greenville lost its federal tax exempt status for
banning interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am afraid the primary is getting a little more press than we
would like,'' said Tom Sponseller, president of the Hospitality
Association of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group represents 1,500 hotels, restaurants and other
tourism businesses, increasingly worried about the NAACP's economic
boycott of South Carolina until the flag is removed.
</P>
<P>
   At least 96 groups have canceled plans for conventions and
meetings in South Carolina in response to the boycott, Sponseller
said. Those cancelations total more than $80 million in lost
revenue to businesses, according to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Columbia, the flag fight has hurt Capital Newstand's
business.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mark Carman said sales of magazines such as ''Ebony''
and ''Jet'' and of books by black authors have fallen by a third
since the NAACP announced its tourism boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Black people, he said, ''are not going to support a white-owned
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman is even more fearful of the possibility that the
Confederate flag would be relocated from atop the Statehouse to the
Confederate soldiers' monument, a short distance from the newstand.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were at eye level, I'd hear about it five times as
much,'' he said.

FREED AFGHAN HOSTAGES CREATE HEADACHE FOR BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A jet chartered to fly home Afghan hostages arrived in
Britain Friday. But the British government said it still did not
know how many people from this week's hijacking wanted to fly back
and how many would ask to stay in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the hijacking in the early hours of Friday created a
huge political headache for Prime Minister Tony Blair when about
half the people aboard the Ariana Airlines plane quickly said they
wanted to be given asylum. Those requests fly in the face of the
national mood, stoked by some newspapers, which is largely
anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Home Office said Friday night that only 37
of the 150 or so passengers who were aboard the plane definitely
wanted to go home. Those people _ and anyone who decides to join
them _ are to fly to Kandahar, Afghanistan, over the weekend on a
jet of Kampuchean Airlines of Cambodia, chartered by the
International Organization for Migration. The plane is standing by
at a Royal Air Force base near Oxford. Kandahar is a bastion of the
Taliban militia, which rules Afghanistan's repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   Of the others aboard the flight that landed at Stansted airport,
22 have been arrested and taken into custody, where they are to be
charged under British terrorism and hijacking laws. And at least 74
_ 60 men and 14 dependents _ have claimed political asylum, and
will be moved on Saturday to an emergency center at the Fire
Service College in Moreton-in-the-Marsh, Gloucestershire, where
they will remain until the immigration service decides whether they
qualify for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   How to decide who should be arrested is particularly difficult
because some passengers apparently claimed to be hijackers,
mistakenly believing that they would have a better chance of
gaining asylum. Originally, there were believed to be only five to
10 hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many Afghans still do not know what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were rested overnight, the interviews are continuing
this morning, and people aren't ready to make up their minds,'' a
spokesman for the Home Office said early Friday. ``They've ended up
in this extraordinary situation after a four-day traumatic
experience, and some of them are feeling very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   But the home secretary, Jack Straw, has made it clear that he
does not particularly care whether the Afghans are confused or why
they came to Britain. He has pledged to evaluate all their requests
for asylum personally, with the view to ejecting them from Britain
as soon as possible.
   Bound by a U.N. treaty on refugees, Britain is obligated to
consider each case on its merits. Even if the home secretary
accelerates the process, the Afghan cases probably will take months
to wend their way through the system. There are already more than
100,000 refugees in Britain waiting for decisions on whether they
can stay.
</P>
<P>
   The government's hard line is consistent with the unwelcoming
national mood. Some newspapers have relentlessly portrayed the
Afghans as opportunistic economic immigrants taking advantage of
British generosity.
</P>
<P>
   It has not helped the Afghans' popularity that the police have
been housing them in a four-star airport hotel, where rooms cost
over $300 a night and the amenities include a swimming pool,
Jacuzzi and health club.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Afghans are reportedly being confined to their
rooms and to a makeshift dining area. ``Thousands of miles from
their impoverished homeland, the Afghan hostages landed in the lap
of luxury yesterday,'' was how the Daily Mail described the
situation, calling the hotel ``Home suite home.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an editorial, the right-leaning paper inveighed against
what it called ``a cynical attempt to exploit Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The home secretary must forgive this paper's skepticism,'' the
editorial said of Straw's promise to deal with the asylum issue
quickly. ``We'll wager that most `victims' of the Stansted hijack
are still enjoying life on benefits in Britain, five years hence.''

BREAKTHROUGHS IN GENETICS OFFER HOPE FOR ENDANGERED ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category ``e'')

 By ALEXANDER STILLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a laboratory at Columbia University, biologists are studying
the DNA of black-headed lion tamarin monkeys, using the latest
genetics technology in order to accomplish a seemingly
old-fashioned goal: matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   It is computerized dating with a mission. There are only some
1,200 black-headed lion tamarin monkeys, all of them in the
Atlantic forest of eastern Brazil. Moreover, because of human
development the monkeys are scattered among nine different patches,
with some groups having only a few dozen members. Animals who would
normally roam in order to find a mate are limited to a small
selection of candidates, most of whom are close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of genetic diversity is one of the biggest causes of
extinction,'' said Don Melnick, a professor of biology and
anthropology at Columbia and the head of the laboratory known as
CERC, Center for Environmental Research and Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   When the genetic make-up of a small population of animals
becomes too homogeneous, the entire group may be wiped out by a
single epidemic. Furthermore, potentially lethal genetic defects
that are normally recessive in a larger population begin cropping
up with increased frequency as animals mate with close relatives,
creating a negative spiral from which it may not recover.
</P>
<P>
   Melnick's approach is one of the many strategies of an important
new field, conservation genetics, which uses genetic information in
an effort to preserve endangered species. During an era in which
the large, wild spaces where many species evolved are being broken
up by human development into smaller and smaller fragments, it is
becoming an increasingly urgent remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conservation, we've learned that it's not enough to protect
an area in order to save a species,'' Melnick said. ``If a
population has lost its genetic diversity, you can build a wall
around its habitat and the species will still die off.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious even for species whose absolute numbers
are reasonably good. There are, for example, some 55,000 Asian
elephants _ a viable number for long-term survival _ but they are
divided up into hundreds of groups in dozens of different Asian
countries, severely reducing their genetic diversity.
``Realistically, since we are not going to get back a lot of
forest, we have to fool nature by creating the same genetic
diversity as if the animals were moving around in one large,
continuous space,'' Melnick said.
</P>
<P>
   But the uses of genetic information are hardly limited to the
mating of animals. A few years ago, scientists at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York started something called the
``caviar project'': they began testing various kinds of caviar for
sale in New York to see whether the roe came from endangered
species of sturgeon, which are supposed to be off-limits to
commercial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking samples from premium food stores like Balducci's,
Citarella and Petrossian, they found that about 25 percent of the
caviar was mislabeled. The import companies appeared to be either
passing off less exalted kinds of fish eggs as fancy beluga caviar
or selling the eggs of species that are supposed to be protected.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service then adopted its own
method of genetic fingerprinting of caviar and began banning
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The method is not universally accepted by scientists, however,
and at least one lawsuit has been filed by caviar suppliers who
insist they have been unfairly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, genetic gumshoes in New York and other large cities are
scouring Chinatown apothecary shops to test medicinal powders that
may contain rhino horns, seal penises, or bear gall bladder from
endangered species whose body parts are greatly prized by
traditional oriental medicine. The Fish and Wildlife Service has a
forensic laboratory in Oregon and the New York State Environmental
Conservation task force has one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar fashion, researchers from the Center for
Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics at Harvard University make
an annual pilgrimage to the sushi markets of Tokyo to see whether
the Japanese are selling the meat of whales protected by
international whaling conventions. Since it is illegal to take
whale meat or whale DNA out of Japan, the biologists must
discreetly set up a small genetic laboratory in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, they found all sorts of things _ dolphin,
porpoise and even goat meat _ being sold as highly expensive whale
flesh at $50 to $100 a pound. About 30 percent of the whale for
sale was from protected species, said Steve Palumbi, the director
of the Harvard Center and a professor of evolutionary biology. In
the six years since the program started, he said, that fraction has
dropped to about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of tests have been made possible by a series of
technological breakthroughs of the last 10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the biggest single innovation is a procedure
called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. It was devised in the
early 1980s by Kary Mullis, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1993 for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis figured out how to quickly replicate large amounts of DNA
from tiny amounts of organic material, using an enzyme present in a
micro-organism that lives in the hot geysers of Yellowstone
National Park. Mullis' P.C.R. machine allowed scientists to take a
tiny fragment of DNA and produce enough genetic material for a
detailed study of a species or an individual. It is the basis of
the genetic profiling including those used in the O.J. Simpson
murder trial and the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   ``For molecular biologists, history is divided into the world
before P.C.R. and the world after P.C.R.,'' said George Amato, the
director of the Joint Conservation Genetics Program, which is
co-sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the American
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, P.C.R. machines were cheap enough for use in
most major laboratories and by the mid-1990s were portable enough
to use in a Tokyo hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The other big breakthrough was the invention of the automated
DNA sequencer, a machine that combines laser and computer
technology to read the precise sequence of thousands of nucleotides
in a strand of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people used to do for their entire Ph.D. dissertation
over two years, I can have an undergraduate do in a week,''
Melnick, of Columbia, said. These DNA sequences can then be used to
create the genetic trees of an entire species. In the CERC
laboratory at Columbia, one of Melnick's graduate students has
assembled the entire evolutionary history of the Macaque monkeys of
southeastern Asia on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary breakthroughs in P.C.R. machines and automated
genetic sequencing has opened up the field of what is known as
``Jurassic Park'' research: reconstructing the DNA of long dead or
even extinct species. Researchers at the Natural History Museum in
Sydney, Australia, for example, are attempting to revive the
extinct Tasmanian tiger from the DNA of a tiger cub that has been
preserved in a jar since the 19th century.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although few scientists expect this to happen anytime soon,
others are already using DNA from museum specimens to help conserve
endangered species. Howard Rosenbaum at the Museum of Natural
History in New York, for example, has compared the DNA of living
examples of the Atlantic right whale, a nearly extinct species of
whale that lives off the coast of the northeastern United States,
and the DNA of whales that were caught and hunted hundreds of years
ago. Since the whales were prized as trophies and museum objects as
far back as the 17th century, there is a rich data base of genetic
material.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the changes in the DNA over time, the scientists are
hoping to compare the genetic diversity within the species at a
time when there were millions of the whales to that of today, when
there are only about 300 left. Although the study is not complete,
preliminary research indicates that the genetic diversity of the
species dropped significantly until the early 20th century but that
it has remained fairly stable since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moratorium right in the middle of the big whale
slaughter in the 1930s,'' Rob De Salle of the natural history
museum said. ``The fact that the genetic variablity appears to have
been preserved since that time tells us that whaling moratoriums
and conservation efforts are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the leading laboratories for genetic conservation are
concentrated in the United States, Canada and Europe, a large
number of countries are becoming aware of the conservation
potential of genetics. Palumbi, of Harvard, for example, is working
with the government of Indonesia, which is looking to set up 30 to
40 marine parks, areas that are designed to protect marine
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Palumbi is trying to create a genetic map of various underwater
populations, so that the Indonesian government can make intelligent
decisions about which are more or less important to preserve.
``Sometimes the boundaries in the sea are difficult to see,''
Palumbi said. ``Once we have that genetic map, we can match it with
the park map.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the government of Venezuela contacted the Wildlife
Conservation Society after it had confiscated some rare parrot
chicks from poachers who were trying to export them for sale.
Officials wanted to know whether they should release the parrots
into the population of a bird sanctuary on Marguerite Island. ``We
determined that they did not belong to a separate subspecies, and I
thought there were very compelling reasons to add greater diversity
to the protected birds in the reserve,'' Amato, of the conservation
society, said.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on application of genetics to conservation has helped
create a new hybrid type of scientist: it brings field biologists
into the laboratory and sends molecular biologists out into the
field. Amato was trained at Yale in evolutionary biology but
recently found himself on a boat off the coast of Madagascar
shooting a cross-bow at whales to get small amounts of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to a colleague of mine about what we should call
ourselves,'' Amato said. He did his Ph.D in genetics, while his
colleague, a wildlife biologist, has worked mostly out in the
field. ``I'm a wildlife biologist, too. He looks at rhinos through
binoculars, and I look at these molecules of the DNA. But I still
see a rhino. We are interested in the same things: Why is life the
way it is? Why do the animals do what they do and how do they do
it?''

   When the genetic make-up of a small population of animals
becomes too homogeneous, the entire group may be wiped out by a
single epidemic. Furthermore, potentially lethal genetic defects
that are normally recessive in a larger population begin cropping
up with increased frequency as animals mate with close relatives,
creating a negative spiral from which it may not recover.
</P>
<P>
   Melnick's approach is one of the many strategies of an important
new field, conservation genetics, which uses genetic information in
an effort to preserve endangered species. During an era in which
the large, wild spaces where many species evolved are being broken
up by human development into smaller and smaller fragments, it is
becoming an increasingly urgent remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conservation, we've learned that it's not enough to protect
an area in order to save a species,'' Melnick said. ``If a
population has lost its genetic diversity, you can build a wall
around its habitat and the species will still die off.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious even for species whose absolute numbers
are reasonably good. There are, for example, some 55,000 Asian
elephants _ a viable number for long-term survival _ but they are
divided up into hundreds of groups in dozens of different Asian
countries, severely reducing their genetic diversity.
``Realistically, since we are not going to get back a lot of
forest, we have to fool nature by creating the same genetic
diversity as if the animals were moving around in one large,
continuous space,'' Melnick said.
</P>
<P>
   But the uses of genetic information are hardly limited to the
mating of animals. A few years ago, scientists at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York started something called the
``caviar project'': they began testing various kinds of caviar for
sale in New York to see whether the roe came from endangered
species of sturgeon, which are supposed to be off-limits to
commercial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking samples from premium food stores like Balducci's,
Citarella and Petrossian, they found that about 25 percent of the
caviar was mislabeled. The import companies appeared to be either
passing off less exalted kinds of fish eggs as fancy beluga caviar
or selling the eggs of species that are supposed to be protected.
The United States Fish and Wildlife Service then adopted its own
method of genetic fingerprinting of caviar and began banning
shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The method is not universally accepted by scientists, however,
and at least one lawsuit has been filed by caviar suppliers who
insist they have been unfairly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, genetic gumshoes in New York and other large cities are
scouring Chinatown apothecary shops to test medicinal powders that
may contain rhino horns, seal penises, or bear gall bladder from
endangered species whose body parts are greatly prized by
traditional oriental medicine. The Fish and Wildlife Service has a
forensic laboratory in Oregon and the New York State Environmental
Conservation task force has one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar fashion, researchers from the Center for
Conservation and Evolutionary Genetics at Harvard University make
an annual pilgrimage to the sushi markets of Tokyo to see whether
the Japanese are selling the meat of whales protected by
international whaling conventions. Since it is illegal to take
whale meat or whale DNA out of Japan, the biologists must
discreetly set up a small genetic laboratory in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, they found all sorts of things _ dolphin,
porpoise and even goat meat _ being sold as highly expensive whale
flesh at $50 to $100 a pound. About 30 percent of the whale for
sale was from protected species, said Steve Palumbi, the director
of the Harvard Center and a professor of evolutionary biology. In
the six years since the program started, he said, that fraction has
dropped to about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of tests have been made possible by a series of
technological breakthroughs of the last 10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the biggest single innovation is a procedure
called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. It was devised in the
early 1980s by Kary Mullis, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1993 for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Mullis figured out how to quickly replicate large amounts of DNA
from tiny amounts of organic material, using an enzyme present in a
micro-organism that lives in the hot geysers of Yellowstone
National Park. Mullis' P.C.R. machine allowed scientists to take a
tiny fragment of DNA and produce enough genetic material for a
detailed study of a species or an individual. It is the basis of
the genetic profiling including those used in the O.J. Simpson
murder trial and the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
   ``For molecular biologists, history is divided into the world
before P.C.R. and the world after P.C.R.,'' said George Amato, the
director of the Joint Conservation Genetics Program, which is
co-sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the American
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, P.C.R. machines were cheap enough for use in
most major laboratories and by the mid-1990s were portable enough
to use in a Tokyo hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The other big breakthrough was the invention of the automated
DNA sequencer, a machine that combines laser and computer
technology to read the precise sequence of thousands of nucleotides
in a strand of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people used to do for their entire Ph.D. dissertation
over two years, I can have an undergraduate do in a week,''
Melnick, of Columbia, said. These DNA sequences can then be used to
create the genetic trees of an entire species. In the CERC
laboratory at Columbia, one of Melnick's graduate students has
assembled the entire evolutionary history of the Macaque monkeys of
southeastern Asia on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary breakthroughs in P.C.R. machines and automated
genetic sequencing has opened up the field of what is known as
``Jurassic Park'' research: reconstructing the DNA of long dead or
even extinct species. Researchers at the Natural History Museum in
Sydney, Australia, for example, are attempting to revive the
extinct Tasmanian tiger from the DNA of a tiger cub that has been
preserved in a jar since the 19th century.
</P>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although few scientists expect this to happen anytime soon,
others are already using DNA from museum specimens to help conserve
endangered species. Howard Rosenbaum at the Museum of Natural
History in New York, for example, has compared the DNA of living
examples of the Atlantic right whale, a nearly extinct species of
whale that lives off the coast of the northeastern United States,
and the DNA of whales that were caught and hunted hundreds of years
ago. Since the whales were prized as trophies and museum objects as
far back as the 17th century, there is a rich data base of genetic
material.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the changes in the DNA over time, the scientists are
hoping to compare the genetic diversity within the species at a
time when there were millions of the whales to that of today, when
there are only about 300 left. Although the study is not complete,
preliminary research indicates that the genetic diversity of the
species dropped significantly until the early 20th century but that
it has remained fairly stable since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a moratorium right in the middle of the big whale
slaughter in the 1930s,'' Rob De Salle of the natural history
museum said. ``The fact that the genetic variablity appears to have
been preserved since that time tells us that whaling moratoriums
and conservation efforts are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the leading laboratories for genetic conservation are
concentrated in the United States, Canada and Europe, a large
number of countries are becoming aware of the conservation
potential of genetics. Palumbi, of Harvard, for example, is working
with the government of Indonesia, which is looking to set up 30 to
40 marine parks, areas that are designed to protect marine
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Palumbi is trying to create a genetic map of various underwater
populations, so that the Indonesian government can make intelligent
decisions about which are more or less important to preserve.
``Sometimes the boundaries in the sea are difficult to see,''
Palumbi said. ``Once we have that genetic map, we can match it with
the park map.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the government of Venezuela contacted the Wildlife
Conservation Society after it had confiscated some rare parrot
chicks from poachers who were trying to export them for sale.
Officials wanted to know whether they should release the parrots
into the population of a bird sanctuary on Marguerite Island. ``We
determined that they did not belong to a separate subspecies, and I
thought there were very compelling reasons to add greater diversity
to the protected birds in the reserve,'' Amato, of the conservation
society, said.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on application of genetics to conservation has helped
create a new hybrid type of scientist: it brings field biologists
into the laboratory and sends molecular biologists out into the
field. Amato was trained at Yale in evolutionary biology but
recently found himself on a boat off the coast of Madagascar
shooting a cross-bow at whales to get small amounts of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to a colleague of mine about what we should call
ourselves,'' Amato said. He did his Ph.D in genetics, while his
colleague, a wildlife biologist, has worked mostly out in the
field. ``I'm a wildlife biologist, too. He looks at rhinos through
binoculars, and I look at these molecules of the DNA. But I still
see a rhino. We are interested in the same things: Why is life the
way it is? Why do the animals do what they do and how do they do
it?''

GARRY SOUTH, THE CALIFORNIA CARVILLE, PLANS TO DELIVER THE STATE TO
GORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mont., Mo., Texas, Ohio)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1991, Garry South arrived here with no job, few
contacts and $16,000 from cashing out his pension after three years
as communications director for the embattled Democratic governor of
Ohio, Richard F. Celeste. To keep busy, he freelanced features for
The Glendale News-Press, a local weekly. At $60 a pop, he wrote
about subjects like a 50-year-old turtle, and a Girl Scout troop
that marched in the Tournament of Roses Parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not high-toned stuff,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Garry South is perhaps the most influential political
adviser in California, the gray eminence behind Gov. Gray Davis and
the man being charged with the task of helping deliver the nation's
most populous state to Al Gore, first in the Democratic primary
against Bill Bradley next month, and then in the general election
next fall.
</P>
<P>
   This week South rushed from an inspection tour of the new
Staples Arena, where the Democratic National Convention will be
held this summer, to the state Democratic Convention in San Jose,
where Gore and Bradley are to speak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's down below the horizon,'' South said, echoing the
polls. ``Nobody cares, nobody's interested in what he has to say,
nobody's listening to him, not even getting into the fact that he
started this campaign as Professor Jekyll and is now behaving like
Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when almost nobody listened to South. Four
years as chief of staff in the lieutenant governor's office for
Davis, a notoriously difficult boss. A 1998 campaign for governor
that no one thought Davis could win, including 14 senior aides who
defected before the candidate could afford to run his first
television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a surprising victory in the Democratic primary and a
stunning 20-point victory that November made Davis the first
Democrat to lead California in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But not before South, the campaign manager, collapsed with a
bleeding ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed 54 fingers to keep my fingers in the dikes,'' South
said in an interview in the old Davis headquarters here, where he
now works as the governor's chief political honcho, paid by the
state Democratic Party. ``There were literally days when it was
just him and me, plus a couple of people to answer the phones.''
</P>
<P>
   South's given name is a near anagram of his boss', and he has
become an alter ego something like James Carville, a tireless
defender, advocate and occasional bomb-thrower. ``In fact,'' South
said, ``Gray has said to me, `I want you to be like that bald guy
that Clinton has,' because he can't remember his name.''
</P>
<P>
   South, 48, has a full head of bushy hair, a basketball player's
6-foot-4-inch frame and the undiminished enthusiasm of Miles City,
Mont., where he grew up the son of a carpenter who served on the
city council and a mother ``who cleaned the houses of rich people
from Texas.'' He speaks in paragraphs, and his pace is intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe him as a nice pit bull,'' said Vicky Rideout,
who hired South to be communications director for the unsuccessful
1993 Los Angeles mayoral campaign of City Councilman Mike Woo, when
South first caught Davis' eye. ``If you get him on the phone,''
Rideout said, ``you've got to make sure you clear your calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics fills his family tree, back to his
great-great-grandfather, who was a justice of the peace in
Nishnabotna Township, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a genetic defect, not an epiphany,'' he says. His
brother won a seat in the Montana State Legislature in a campaign
South managed in 1974. Two years later, South was Montana state
coordinator for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the inaugural invitation list for the state, and then I
loaded up my car and went to the bank and lied and said I had a
big-paying job in Washington,'' South recalled. ``I got a $2,000
loan, replaced two of the four bald tires on my car and set out in
a blinding snowstorm to move to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Political jobs followed: Midwest regional finance director for
the Democratic National Committee, manager of a Democratic Senate
campaign in Illinois, chief advance man for Secretary of
Agriculture Bob Bergland, vice president of political communication
for the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, South was drawn to California by, what else, ``the
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the governor's most trusted adviser, and spends much of
his time interpreting Davis' wishes for aides in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But no more government work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for state government in three different states, plus
the federal government,'' he said. That's enough for one lifetime.
I have over 10 years of experience as a government employee but I
was never at any one of those places long enough to vest, so I have
no government pension whatsoever.'' He supplements his pay with
work as a consultant, for the public relations giant
Burson-Marsteller and others. That has raised the eyebrows of some
good-government types, who complain that instead of moving through
the usual revolving door of politics and private sector, South is
stuck in it.
</P>
<P>
   He says he turns down any client that could embarrass the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent seven years of my life helping Gray get where he is
today,'' he said. ``Why would I endanger that by going out and
shilling for somebody on a dubious matter?''

DISCONTENT AS NATION VOTES ON NEW CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe _ Every day Mackenzie Moyo joins a crowd of
men standing outside the Dunlop tire factory on the edge of town. A
rubber technologist, he has been jobless for a year. He has had
enough: ``I live hand to mouth. I want change.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey James sells cement. There is no fuel for his trucks. He,
too, has had enough: ``We struggle daily to find diesel. If I can't
supply the small construction guy, he can't build.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayisa Ndiweni is a rural chief. Villagers beg him for a place
to graze their goats, but he has no land. He has had enough: ``My
people are so hungry. Hungry for jobs, hungry for food. The
government won't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Captive of the whims of its longtime president, the autocratic
Robert Mugabe, one of Africa's more stable nations may be reaching
a breaking point just as voters go to the polls this weekend to
vote on a new constitution drawn up by the Mugabe government.
</P>
<P>
   Across Zimbabwe, people are reeling from the worst economic
crisis in at least a decade. Corruption is rife. Food prices are
climbing. Hospitals are closing for lack of resources. Jobs are
scarce.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's referendum offers Zimbabweans an opportunity to
express their discontent, but in a country long ruled by
intimidation, the question is whether voters are frustrated enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe argues the constitution would free the country from the
last ties to its former colonial master, Britain. But critics say
it is a naked grab for even greater power.
</P>
<P>
   Coming a few months before parliamentary elections, and at a
time when a nascent opposition movement is gathering strength, the
two-day polling that began Saturday has become a bitter clash
between the ruling party and its first serious political rival in
two decades. A defeat for the constitution, observers say, would be
the first victory for a new democratic era.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the level of anger has overcome the level of fear, there
will finally be a change,'' said David Coltart, a human-rights
lawyer in Bulawayo. ``This referendum is in fact an opinion poll.
Our sense is that the people are angry.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front, is far from defenseless, however.
</P>
<P>
   Though impoverished, neglected, and denied title to land, rural
peasants give Mugabe a solid base of support. They fear losing
access to government seed and communal plots if they vote against
him, political observers say.
</P>
<P>
   And Mugabe frequently reminds voters that his party came into
power by force _ through a guerrilla war against white-ruled
Rhodesia _ and is prepared to retain power by force. In the
mid-1980s, special army forces massacred Mugabe's ethnic rivals,
and violence has marred every election since independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the run-up to the referendum, rallies of the new opposition,
the Movement for Democratic Change, have been disrupted by brick
throwing and fist fights. Journalists have been intimidated by
police. After each clash, high-profile members of the ruling party
appear on state-run television to condemn the opposition and blame
it for the outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those political parties bent on violence must be made to
understand that talking peace and acting otherwise is really an
archaic political tactic which will never work,'' warned Augustine
Chihuri, commissioner of police, on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition denies advocating violence, and few seem to
believe the government's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, however, that intimidation may no longer be the
political weapon it once was. Sharp hikes in food prices two years
ago triggered riots, a rare outburst of discontent. Morgan
Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, walks
through the streets of Harare without bodyguards, even though he
has been brutally attacked and imprisoned for criticizing the
government in the past. People talk openly about wanting change.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the economic crisis helps explain the shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are dissatisfied with high inflation and high
unemployment,'' said Eric Bloch, an economist in Bulawayo. ``The
president has focused on absolving himself and his party from blame
. . . but he won't succeed. People aren't that stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Inflation roars at 70 percent. Unemployment tops 50 percent. The
currency is in free fall, and the country has no foreign currency
reserves to back up its banks. It can't afford to buy diesel to
keep trucks on the roads and tractors in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, argues Bloch, is not entirely to blame. The country was
hit by successive droughts and low international prices for
tobacco, gold, and nickel, just as it started to restructure its
economy to meet requirements set by the International Monetary
Fund. But fiscal mismanagement, Mugabe's 18-month military
engagement in war-torn Congo, and his arrogance toward Western
financiers have exhausted recent influxes of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing that it may be vulnerable, the ruling party has
turned to the emotional issues of land and race. Since the colonial
era, the most fertile lands have been held by a small minority of
white commercial farmers. The war for liberation was waged against
the white farmers, and land remains a volatile issue as
impoverished black masses crowd terrain unsuitable for grazing and
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government lacks the resources to divide and develop
large farms into smaller plots _ 5.2 million acres previously
seized by the government have not been redistributed _ Mugabe has
repeatedly threatened to confiscate still more land. Britain and
the IMF have objected to the scheme, but the new constitution would
enshrine in law such uncompensated seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including human-rights lawyers, trade unionists, and
women's groups, say the proposed constitution ignores the public's
wishes. In 1997, several prominent lawyers and civil-society
organizations established a National Constitutional Assembly to
begin an inclusive process of drafting a new legal foundation for
the country, but that effort was eclipsed last year by Mugabe, who
established his own constitutional commission made up of senior
members of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks of public consultations, the panel hastily
produced its proposed constitution last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing people all over the country said they wanted was
a ceremonial president and a prime minister accountable to
Parliament,'' said Mike Auret, a founder of the Constitutional
Assembly. ``The draft leaves total power in the executive
president'' and makes the prime minister's post ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe's backers say their proposal is more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a president elected by the people,'' said Richard
Nyandoro, a member of Parliament who sat on the Constitutional
Commission. ``You can't run away from that.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they they won't bother to vote, believing that Mugabe's
party will rig the count to ensure victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't vote,'' said Petso Moedi, an unemployed man waiting
outside the Dunlop factory in Bulawayo, hoping for a job. ``The
draft is bogus.''

INVESTORS BEGIN TO HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT RUSSIAN UTILITY RUN BY
CHUBAIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After years of share dilutions, lock-outs from annual
meetings and the occasional outright expropriation, foreign
investors understand that most Russian companies care little for
shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   But investors have held out hope for, and put their money
behind, a select few corporations _ including Unified Energy
Systems, the operator of Russia's national power grid. UES, one of
the largest utilities in the world, is a natural pick: in an
emerging market where most companies are closely held, its shares
are widely available. Last year, the stock price tripled, to 11.8
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of $5.7 billion, UES is greatly
undervalued but has the potential to improve. Nearly as important,
the company is run by Anatoly B. Chubais, who engineered nearly a
decade of market changes under former President Boris Yeltsin and
whom many foreigners regard as a champion of free markets and
shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many UES shareholdebs fear that such trust was
misplaced, as they sift through several murky privatizations that
involve Chubais and that could significantly transform the company.
</P>
<P>
   The path to these privatizations illustrates how in Russia _
even in the most progressive companies _ the line between politics
and business is still blurry.
</P>
<P>
   UES has begun a restructuring program that involves the sale or
merger of subsidiaries and that, by official accounts, would bring
much-needed efficiency to the utilities industry. If the deals go
through by August as scheduled, they will diminish UES generation
and distribution capacities by 20 percent each, industry analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off the units is supposed to be a transparent process,
with independent appraisals of the properties for sale and
competitive tenders. Instead, UES shareholders, board members and
industry analysts have received only meager information about
projects that appear to benefit executives and politicians close to
Chubais. The first privatization completed under the plan and
awaiting federal approval, for example, turns a hydroelectric plant
over to a metals magnate who was a big financial backer of Chubais'
political party in recent parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Russian companies, which openly flout shareholder
rights, UES has shown regard for investors. Its top management
meets with analysts quarterly. Representatives of domestic and
foreign shareholders, who together hold 41 percent of UES, are on
its board.
</P>
<P>
   But those measures apparently cannot protect shareholders fully.
``In Russia, shareholders today are not capable of controlling the
behavior of management; the board of directors is not capable of
controlling the actions of management,'' said Ivan Lazarko, one of
two shareholder representatives to the 15-member UES board and the
chairman of the board of directors at Naufor, the national
association of securities dealers. ``We just don't get the full
picture. So everything turns on faith _ fairly blind faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where legal and regulatory systems are still
nascent, that faith is placed in individuals, like Chubais, who at
various times during the Yeltsin administration has served in the
cabinet and the Kremlin in posts including first deputy prime
minister and chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The regard many foreigners have for him contrasts sharply with
the disdain a lot of his countrymen feel. Many Russians hold him
largely responsible for the catastrophic decline of the economy and
the crony capitalism that has emerged in place of the promised free
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite scandals that erupted while he held his government
posts, many foreigners have stood by him, in part because the
alternatives _ unreconstructed Communists and hostile nationalists
_ seem far worse. As a result, after Yeltsin appointed Chubais
chief executive of UES in 1998, private-sector shareholders agreed
to amend company bylaws to make it hard to oust him, thereby
protecting him from the whims of the government, which owns 53
percent of the utility. (The remaining 6 percent is held by current
and former employees and management; Chubais holds no equity.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards of a company led by Chubais are higher than
those for a company led by anyone else,'' said Matthias Westman,
director of Prosperity Capital Management, asset managers in Moscow
with about $40 million invested in UES ``So it's even more
upsetting when someone who is supposed to be on your side does
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chubais declined to be interviewed for this article. But
Valentin Zavadnikov, deputy chairman of the executive board at UES,
said, ``All activities are done for economic reasons and economic
reasons alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would dispute that Chubais is turning the company around.
Just two years ago, only about 15 percent of bills owed to UES were
paid in cash; the rest were settled through barter or just sank
into arrears. Now, 48 percent are in cash.
</P>
<P>
   But while running UES, Chubais has remained active in big-league
Russian politics. Those loyalties now appear to be in conflict as
UES begins restructuring. Chubais, for instance, remained close to
the Kremlin inner circle. And last summer, he pulled together a
pro-capitalist electoral bloc called the Union of Right Forces to
participate in the Dec. 19 parliamentary vote. Dismissed at first
as politically irrelevant, the bloc managed to grab a good share of
seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most sizable financial supporters of the Union of
Right Forces, political analysts say, was Oleg Deripaska, the
ambitious 32-year-old owner of OKSA, an aluminum conglomerate that
stretches thousands of miles from the Volga River to the Russian
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Chubais and Deripaska were doing the political bloc work, the
two men were also negotiating a business deal. Under the UES
restructuring plan, they decided to merge the Sayano-Shushenskoye
Hydroelectric plant, a UES subsidiary, with OKSA.
</P>
<P>
   Deripaska's aluminum mill in Sayansk _ one of the biggest in
Russia and the linchpin of the OKSA conglomerate _ is the
Sayano-Shushenskoye hydroelectric plant's main consumer. UES
maintains that the plant needs at least $80 million in capital
investments over the next few years, which the corporation cannot
provide or borrow, given Russia's high interest rates. OKSA,
however, sells its aluminum on world markets and has the cash to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the promised investment, the merger would turn
control of Sayano-Shushenskoye over to OKSA. The aluminum company
could then buy electricity at cost, which would make its metal even
cheaper and more competitive, UES argues. The new company formed
out of the merger, Energo-Metal Amalgamation, would get a hefty
chunk of the metals sales, and UES, as a 33 percent shareholder in
the new entity, would see its own earnings increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``UES wins 100 percent through this deal,'' said Zavadnikov.
``We get a percentage of the metal that is sold in real cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say UES shareholders, is that they have little
information about the deal, which they contend is moving alarmingly
quickly. ``There's no sense of how the estimate of the value of the
companies was made,'' said Alexei Volkov, the utilities analyst for
the Russian brokerage house Nikoil. ``What were the underlying
assumptions the valuations were based on? Who did them?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Zavadnikov, the deal was reviewed by an independent
Russian appraiser called NP Consult. But critics wanted an
appraiser of international repute.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, shareholders say they do not understand how the
Sayano-Shushenskoye merger and other planned deals fit into UES'
long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Management has said that it will issue a strategy statement in
March but that the Sayano-Shushenskoye deal will go forward
nonetheless when the expected federal approval comes through.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, a partner in the United Financial Group, a
Moscow brokerage firm, and a UES board member, said, ``Maybe this
could be good, but it is done with such haste and with so little
information that management seems to be doing things that are far
from the interests of the company and a large number of
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   What information UES has provided has met with substantial
skepticism. For example, the pitch for the merger guarantees UES
$35 million in dividends this year and shareholders 80 percent of
after-tax earnings, a sum industry analysts believe is wildly
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   UES also maintains that its agreement with OKSA guarantees
capital investments into the hydroelectric plant, but shareholders
say they have yet to see the contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects UES is considering only deepen the concern. One
involves the dismantling of Samaraenergo, the main utility in the
Volga River region of Samara. The way shareholders understand the
project, Samaraenergo's generating plants would be spun off and
then merged with some key factories in the region, including a few
belonging to Deripaska. Other factories involved in the deal are
thought to have close ties to the governor of the Samara region,
Konstantin A. Titov, a leading figure in the Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Deripaska did not respond to requests for interviews.
But Konstantin Remchukov, economic adviser to Deripaska and a
parliamentarian from the Union of Right Forces, said the
industrialist would have supported Chubais' political agenda even
if he had not been awarded the hydroelectric plant. Still,
Remchukov conceded that in Russia right now, it is hard to avoid
the blurring between political loyalties and business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he and some other Russian observers maintain, the
goal of developing Russian business rapidly may justify using less
than perfect means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only large Russian companies can be competitive with the West,
and one of the few ways is through things such as the energy-metals
mergers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal doesn't, of course, look Western or ideal,''
Remchukov added. And while major investors from outside Russia
might take a long time evaluating the prospects of working with
UES, he said, ``someone like Oleg Deripaska will invest.''

NORTHWEST AIRLINES ELIMINATES SATURDAY STAY FOR DISCOUNTED
TICKETS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines is offering a new type of air fare intended
to make business travel less onerous.
</P>
<P>
   The fare, announced earlier this week, eliminates the overnight
Saturday stay required by the airline's _ and in general, the
entire industry's _discounted, 14-day advance purchase tariff. In
recent years, the advance purchase fare has increasingly become the
fare of choice for those executives who were willing to travel over
the weekend and incur additional hotel and meal expenses in
exchange for a cheaper plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The new Northwest fare, available only on U.S. and Canadian
routes, features a 40 percent discount off the full coach tariff;
nonrefundable, it requires a 10-day advance purchase, a minimum
stay of one night and a $75 fee for changes. Northwest's 14-day
advance purchase fares are discounted about 50 percent from
full-fare coach; also nonrefundable, they require an overnight
Saturday stay and a $75 fee for changes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bach, Northwest's vice president of pricing and yield
management, said the carrier had introduced the new fares because
``business travelers were contorting their schedules to stay
overnight Saturday and qualify for fares with leisure travel
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, according to Bach, half of Northwest's business
travelers bought full coach fares, while the rest bought some sort
of discounted ticket. He said the airline, a unit of NWA Inc.,
expected that about 40 percent of its business travelers would now
buy full coach fares, 20 percent would buy the new fares and 40
percent will purchase another type of discount ticket. He also said
Northwest anticipated that 6 percent of all its passengers would
buy the new fares.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bach said Northwest expected that the new fare
would actually increase its revenue by about $50 million annually
by winning over travelers who formerly bought cheaper advance
purchase fares and by stimulating new business from individuals who
would not have traveled otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Northwest expected revenue generated by the traffic
to exceed revenue lost when travelers who previously bought more
expensive coach tickets switched to the new fare.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears the logic of Northwest's initiative has not
totally won over its competitors. Delta Air Lines, United and
USAirways matched Northwest only where they compete with the
airline on nonstop routes out of Northwest's hub cities.
</P>
<P>
   America West matched Northwest selectively, and American
Airlines AMR matched Northwest on four routes out of Minneapolis
and Detroit, while Continental said it was studying the initiative.
Only Trans World Airlines matched Northwest's prices everywhere on
its system.
</P>
<P>
   The move also got mixed reviews on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brian Harris, aviation analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney, ``the thing that's hurt airline revenues the most recently
is the phenomenon of business travelers buying down, still flying
but using less expensive fares. Northwest is attempting to create a
new category to stanch this flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort, Harris suggested, ``is more likely to work than
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, who follows the airline industry for Paine Webber,
said that although the fares ``are well-crafted to fill a gaping
hole in the price lineup, it's very doubtful the initiative will
enhance profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick also pointed out that the limited response by
Northwest's competitors indicated that they also feared lower
revenue would result.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bach said Northwest would stand by its new price
policy. ``We expect we'll be fully matched,'' he said. ``But if
we're not, we don't care. We'll see a lot of passengers shift their
business to us and it will be a huge revenue win. But in the end,
we think they'll match.'' &QL;

GORE EXPLAINS HOW HE `WRESTLED' WITH ABORTION ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Seeking to defuse fresh attacks Friday from
Bill Bradley that Al Gore had waffled on abortion, the vice
president acknowledged that he had ``wrestled'' with the issue
before reaching his unequivocal support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore explained his evolving position on abortion to pre-empt
what his advisers anticipated would be another attack on his
evolving abortion rights stands by Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   On a swing through California, which took him from Los Angeles
to the the Silicon Valley, Gore has been attempting to shore up
support among key constituencies that include women voters, gays,
union members and high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore received the support of the Human Rights
Campaign, the largest gay rights group in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president addressed the abortion issue Thursday evening
at a Beverly Hills fundraiser of Democratic women, whom he
pointedly told, ``I do not need a lecture from Bill Bradley about
how to protect a woman's right to chose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, appearing in Seattle with abortion rights activists,
renewed his call Friday for Gore to explain himself on the issue of
abortion rights and circulated a three-page flier of Gore's quotes
titled, ``Al Gore on Abortion: Anti-choice, Pro-choice or Multiple
choice?``
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pointed out, as he has several times in the past few
weeks, that Gore once wrote to a Tennessee constituent saying he
opposed federal funding for abortions for poor women because it is
``arguably the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that when Gore served as a congressman from
Tennessee, anti-abortion activists gave him an 84 percent rating in
his support for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's changed his position. Well, I know, I respect that he
can change his position, but I think that he shows a lack of
respect for women by refraining from explaining the evolution of
his views,'' Bradley said, adding that the vice president has
``tried to twist his record rather than explain his convictions.``
</P>
<P>
   ``His record is clear. His reasoning and evolution are very
muddy,'' he said. ``He has said he's always supported Roe v. Wade,
but that's not true. He has said he's always been pro-choice, but
that's not true.``
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during a New Hampshire debate when Gore insisted he had
always been solidly behind abortion rights, he conceded that early
in his congressional career he had not always backed Medicaid
funding for poor women seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes I wrestled with the role that government should play in
the question of abortion. Should it play a role at all?'' Gore told
the largely female crowd gathered at the home of Daphna and Richard
Zyman. ``But since then I have come to believe that because poor
women deserve the same constitutional right to a safe legal
abortion that more affluent have, they need Medicaid funding so
they can make that decision for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then launched into his familiar attack on Bradley, claiming
that the former New Jersey senator bailed out on the Democrats
after the 1994 takeover of Congress by Republicans, many of whom
oppose abortion rights. Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the anti-choice Republicans took over Congress, Sen.
Bradley walked away,'' he said. ``I stayed and fought against the
ideologues when they attempted to deny the women the opportunity to
choose, when they tried to ban late-term abortions, even when
women's lives were in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that George W. Bush ``represents and governs the state
of Texas that is the most anti-choice state in the union.
Ninety-three percent of all counties in Texas have no choice
available to women.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no abortion clinics and no doctors willing to perform
the procedure in those areas, according to the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Gore added that Bush ``says he would throw doctors in jail for
performing abortions.'' Gore aides cited a Jan. 30 Bush interview
on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' where Bush said he agreed with
Arizona Sen. John McCain's position that if abortions were illegal
he would hold doctors criminally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Good Morning America'' recently, Bush was asked if abortion
were illegal would he be in favor of criminal prosecution of
abortion providers. Bush said, ``If abortion were illegal, yes, but
that's a big if.``
</P>
<P>
   The state's Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who is backing the vice
president, said Gore's earlier opposition to federal funding for
abortion was understandable considering the fact that he
represented a conservative region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human
Rights Campaign, praised Bradley for his ``laudable'' stands on gay
issues but said Gore ``had a tangible record of action and has
championed our quest for freedom both in word and deed.''

ROGER VADIM, DIRECTOR WHO PROPELLED BARDOT TO STARDOM, DIES AT 72  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Roger Vadim, the French film director who turned
Brigitte Bardot into an overnight star and potent sex symbol in his
first movie, ``And God Created Woman,'' died Friday in a Paris
hospital. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said he had died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   During a 40-year career in which he directed some 25 movies,
Vadim never became an art house favorite. But his 1956 debut earned
him a permanent place in postwar French cinema because of Bardot's
daring performance as a young married woman in search of sexual
freedom and the protests over the film's explicit sensuality.
</P>
<P>
   One scene in which Bardot danced barefoot on a table like a wild
Carmen is often cited as a breakthrough in what was considered
permissible to show on screen. ``There was really nothing shocking
in what Brigitte did,'' the director said three decades later.
``What was provocative was her natural sensuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Vadim's subsequent films were also erotic, but he
remained in the limelight as much because of his amorous ties to a
succession of beautiful young actresses whose careers he promoted
and whose lives he temporarily shared, among them Annette
Stroyberg, Catherine Deneuve and Jane Fonda as well as Bardot.
Angie Dickinson, Jeanne Moreau and Susan Sarandon also appeared in
his films.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best-known films are `No Sun in Venice'' (1958) with
Francoise Arnoul and an original score by the Modern Jazz Quartet;
``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' (1961) starring Stroyberg; ``Blood and
Roses'' (1960) with Stroyberg; ``Vice and Virtue'' (1962) with
Deneuve; and ``Barbarella'' (1968) with Fonda. In 1972 he made
``Don Juan 73,'' in which a woman ( Bardot) played the famous
seducer. His last feature film, in 1988, was a remake of ``And God
Created Woman'' starring Rebecca DeMornay.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France said Friday of Vadim: ``Apart
from an original and important body of work, which sometimes rocked
minds, he was more than anyone else, the filmmaker of life, of
passion for life, of liberty. He hatched new talents and knew how
to create myths, aided by some of the greatest actresses of the
past few decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris on Jan. 26, 1928, Roger Vladimir Plemiannikov
first aspired to become an actor, entering drama school alongside
Marcel Marceau. He then tried his hand as a journalist before
working as an assistant director on several movies. At the age of
21, he met Bardot, a schoolgirl of striking beauty who was six
years his junior. In 1952 when he was 24 and Bardot was 18, they
married.
</P>
<P>
   Bardot had appeared in several small films when Vadim directed
her in ``And God Created Woman,'' in which she played a young woman
who marries to escape life in an orphanage only to fall for her
husband's younger brother, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant. ``I
wanted to show a normal young girl whose only difference was that
she behaved in the way a boy might, without any sense of guilt on a
moral or sexual level,'' Vadim once said.
</P>
<P>
   After his marriage to Bardot fell apart in 1957, he married
Stroyberg, with whom he had his first child, Nathalie. After that
marriage failed, Vadim lived with Deneuve, with whom he had a son,
Christian, now also an actor. In 1967 the director married Fonda,
for whom he made the avant-garde science-fiction movie
``Barbarella.'' They had a daughter, Vanessa. Vadim's fourth
marriage, to Catherine Schneider, came eight years later; they had
a daughter, Vania. In 1990 he married the actress Marie-Christine
Barrault, who survives him along with his four children.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s Vadim dedicated himself principally to
made-for-television mini-series. He also wrote a book of memoirs,
``D'une Etoile a l'Autre,'' or ``From One Star to the Next,'' in
which he recounted his playboy life and his marriages and spoke of
his difficulty remaining faithful to his partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps as much for his gossip-magazine lifestyle as his
discovery of Bardot that he may be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the laziness of this otherwise intelligent
director, Vadim's life's work creates an impression of
superficiality, if not actual mediocrity,'' a French cinema
dictionary noted. But, it added, his talent in discovering women
stars cannot be denied.

life and took years of negotiations to set up, came to a halt
Friday after only 10 weeks in operation. By Warren Hoge.

capture Grozny. They obliterated it. Apartment houses along Lenin
Prospect have been pulverized. Minutka Square, a once-bustling

single structure in the city center that has not been wrecked by a

   WEB-ATTACK-HACKERS (Undated) _ The computer industry has a long
tradition of hiring so-called Tiger Teams of professional hackers
who attack a computer system to determine how secure it is. Over
the years, that hacker tradition has grown to embrace unauthorized
attacks in which programmers find a way to invade or cripple a
system, then publish the details of the vulnerability _ and often
the software code they used to exploit the weaknesses they
discovered. While the wisdom and ethics of these practices have
long been debated, this week's attacks on popular Web sites have
fueled the controversy because the siege was accomplished in part
using a technique and software published last year on the Internet
by a hacker who calls himself Mixter. By Katie Hafner.

   CENSUS-RACE (Undated) _ Acknowledging the country's increasing
diversity, the U.S. Census will no longer instruct people to
``select one'' race to describe themselves when it begins mailing
out forms in April. Instead, it will tell them to mark one or more
of 14 boxes representing six races _ white, black, American Indian
or Alaska Native, Asian, Indian, and Pacific Islander _ that apply,
or to mark ``some other race.'' But many, indeed most, people who
could claim several races are not expected to do so, according to
demographers and Census officials. By Diana Jean Schemo.

<P>
   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (HELPFUL 500-WORD SIDEBAR FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

 &HT;    Problems steal bit of Karan thunder
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aside from technical glitches that marred her show,
Donna Karan may have presented the most awe-inspiring collection
exhibited during Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her men's and women's garb was shown in bold blacks and
ravishing reds. She showed nothing in fur, but her leathers were
luxurious. And there was enough diversity of styles to fit people
of nearly all shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday show's production problems ranged from minor to
major. One model in a frilly, sheer olive party dress set everyone
on edge when she nearly took a tumble on the runway. The sound
system blaring tribal chants shut down, leaving the lip-syncing,
tambourine-shaking, conga-thumping band to fend for itself. And
just as the show was starting, most of the fashion photographers
staged a walkout in protest of the cramped conditions inside
Karan's suffocating showroom on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from this collection could easily finance a showroom
expansion, since these clothes looked anything but cheap. Items
that could be deemed priceless included impeccably pleated
knee-length leather skirts; elegantly assertive crocodile tank
tops; spotlight-snaring velvet dresses and gowns that looked as if
their sequins were slithering.
</P>
<P>
   The menswear was unmistakably masculine _ stiff leathers,
strong-shouldered suits and Cuban-heeled shoes, all in black.
</P>
<P>
   Karan's coats for women couldn't have been more streamlined,
with their pencil-straight silhouettes, concealed closures and
buckleless belts.
</P>
<P>
   This collection made a soup-to-nuts wardrobing statement. And
the normally shy Karan came out to take a well-deserved bow
afterward _ though there were few shutterbugs around to capture it.
</P>
<P>
   BARTLETT'S TWEED-HEAVY HAND TIPS COLLECTION
</P>
<P>
   How do you make an ultra-thin runway model look pear-shaped?
Simply dress her in one of designer John Bartlett's oversize, tweed
print skirts. With the women's wear preview he staged Thursday
night, Bartlett seemed to lose touch with a sense of proportion:
His collection was overloaded with clothes in black, gray and tan;
and the statement he tried to make with gargantuan tweed patterns
overwhelmed the fine tailoring.
</P>
<P>
   Courageously, and at times effectively,
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett mixed sturdy fabrics like camel hair with delicate ones
like chiffon. It was unfortunate, however, that the last two
outfits Bartlett showed _ stunningly chic, ski-inspired cashmere
catsuits in black and white _ didn't serve more as the collection's
basis.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER THIS NAME
</P>
<P>
   As Friday's Moet &AMP; Chandon-sponsored ``Designer Debut'' show
proved, there's always new talent bubbling to the surface. Chief
among the three given exposure to the worldwide press was
up-and-comer Thomas Steinbruck, who showed a vibrant series of
bias-cut evening gowns in glossy moss, flesh-toned cashmere and
orange sequins. Steinbruck's eveningwear flashed the bare back, and
skirts showcased the leg as well with dual slits up the front.

COMMENTARY: FAT, HAPPY AND STILL DISSATISFIED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There is a curious thing about the John McCain
phenomenon. Populist campaigns usually arise from adversity. In
this time of unprecedented prosperity, one would expect voters to
be fat and happy, contented with the status quo. Why, then, are so
many turning to an iconoclast, a candidate who promises to shake
things up?
</P>
<P>
   The answer must be that a good many Americans, however full
their pockets, are discontented with something. The something is
evident: the political system. Fewer and fewer people vote: in
1996, under half of those of voting age. Why vote when you feel
that policy is shaped not by your votes but by money? One observer
summarizes it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic boom of the '90s has masked a looming national
crisis: a corrupt political system that auctions off public policy
to the highest bidder and leaves the overwhelming majority of
Americans feeling alienated from their own government.''
</P>
<P>
   That quotation is from a new book by Arianna Huffington, ``How
to Overthrow the Government.'' Yes, the same Arianna Huffington who
has so pungently argued conservative views. Her rhetoric is still
pungent, but her viewpoint seems to have undergone a sea change.
</P>
<P>
   The book is devastating on the flood of money into our politics.
There is a certain irony in that: Her former husband, Michael,
spent $28 million of his family fortune in an unsuccessful race for
the Senate in 1994. She notes wryly that Al Checchi spent $40
million trying to be governor of California in 1998 _ ``thankfully,
for those of us named Huffington, replacing Michael Huffington as
the poster child of campaign profligacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying is another of her targets. She describes Dwayne
Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, as `` Special
Interest'' for his success in getting federal subsidies for
ethanol. He and ADM have given more than $3 million to the parties
in soft money, and they get $300 million a year in ethanol
subsidies. ``How this differs from Al Capone buying off judges in
Chicago is a topic worthy of debate in civics class,'' Huffington
writes.
</P>
<P>
   But the book is not only about money in politics. Huffington
attacks what she calls ``the culture of greed'' that makes the rich
much richer while ``more children are homeless than at any time
since the Great Depression.'' She savages Republican attempts to
abolish the estate tax for the sake of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to Arianna Huffington?
</P>
<P>
   I asked her that question when she was here in Boston the other
day. Writing a column about politics as she does, she said, brought
her ``face to face with distorted priorities, the abuse of
language, the neglect of poverty as a social issue. I couldn't bear
to hear them going on about our prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking thing in the book, for me, is Huffington's
discussion of what she calls the two greatest crime problems, ``the
exploding prison population and the failure of the war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The priorities of the drug war, emphasizing criminal prosecution
and attempts to cut off drug supplies, are all wrong, she argues.
Supplies and use have increased, and will not go down until the
priority is shifted to education and treatment of addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the excesses of the drug war is the policy of
mandatory minimum prison sentences for even trivial drug offenses.
The policy is not only inhumane, she says, but has created an
enormous social problem: two million Americans in prison, where
they are being brutalized.
</P>
<P>
   The drug war and long prison sentences are indeed a disaster for
our country. Yet it seems impossible to do anything about them.
Politicians are afraid to do anything that would make them
vulnerable to charges of being ``soft on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the problem that Huffington's book underlines. We have a
democratic system of government, but it seems unable to respond to
urgent needs. The power of money prevents economic and political
reform. In California the prison guards' union is so powerful that
even the most sensible criminal law reform is blocked _ because the
union wants more prisons and more prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   What will break us out of the stalemate?
</P>
<P>
   In a democracy the answer is leadership. I have no idea whether
McCain would look at the drug war or poverty or health care and say
it is time for a change. But people are looking for someone who
might have the courage to challenge the profound flaws in the
status quo.

COMMENTARY: WHY PICK A WINNER WHEN THERE'S BOY GEORGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As news of John McCain's New Hampshire landslide hit the
networks, I was in Beverly Hills interviewing Warren Beatty on a
subject other than his unconsummated political striptease of last
fall. But Beatty can't stop talking about politics, and while he
has yet to endorse a candidate, he couldn't contain his ebullience
about McCain, whom he regards as a friend. Yes, the Arizona senator
(like the other candidates of both parties) is well to the right of
Bulworth _ even on his signature issue of campaign finance reform.
But still, Beatty avows: ``John is a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Back East a day later, I found that as goes 90210 so goes 10021
and less glossy strongholds of the not-so-vast liberal conspiracy.
It isn't easy to find a Democrat who will say an unkind word about
McCain. Is this because of the media's infatuation with him, a love
affair so outrageously syrupy it threatens to toss the entire
nation into insulin shock? Or is it merely a mandate for his
war-hero past and Trumanesque public persona? Or do liberals,
disappointed by Bill Bradley's fumbled insurgency and fatigued by
Al Gore's hyperventilating rhetoric, feel that secretly that McCain
is one of them?
</P>
<P>
   On the last point, the answer should be definitively no. As one
of McCain's closest advisers, former Sen. Warren Rudman, put it
somewhat overzealously on the Imus show this week, to call McCain a
liberal is ``like accusing Hitler of founding the B'nai B'rith.''
McCain's legislative record has at times earned him single-digit
ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and zero from the
conservation league. He was for all the planks in the Contract With
America and each article of impeachment. He has always voted
against abortion rights, and as recently as a Wednesday night town
meeting, said ``I don't think abortion should be legal'' and that
Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. He continues to vacillate about
the symbolic meaning of the Confederate flag, and he's no fan of
gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats from Massachusetts to California are flocking to
vote for him in Republican primaries, and surely not just out of a
desire to make mischief for the rival party. Were McCain actually
to get the Republican nomination, the greater mischief would be
inflicted on the Democrats. McCain is the GOP candidate who has a
serious shot at ending the era of Clinton-Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just because Mr. Straight Talk Express is, in the
character department, the archetypal un-Clinton. Nor is it just
because he tilts at lobbyists and big money and champions campaign
finance reform (an also-ran issue in polls of voters' priorities).
The other, subtle weapon in McCain's political arsenal is that, in
a brilliant coup of triangulation, he is as much the un-Kenneth
Starr/un-Henry Hyde as he is the un-Clinton. He's the first major
GOP presidential candidate in years who is not running as a pious
moral scold in hock to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of proselytizing for his own religion to get votes,
McCain has described his faith as ``something that's between me and
my family.'' He was the sole GOP candidate who declined an
invitation to kowtow to the Christian Coalition at last fall's Road
to Victory conference, and yet he did meet with the gay Log Cabin
Republicans and spoke of being ``proud'' to have their support. He
was the first Republican candidate with the guts to urge his party
to show Pat Buchanan the exit.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in McCain's rejection of supply-side tax cuts and you
don't have a liberal, but you do have a conservative who won't
scare away the moderates who decide elections. He alone has
positioned himself to deflect the inevitable Gore attack that a
Republican president will throw the monkey wrench of voodoo
economics into a booming economy. Nor do swing voters have to worry
that McCain will owe Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell a say in public
policy or that he'll be policing anyone's sex life. (Indeed, McCain
has readily owned up to the tomcatting in his own past.)
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator has thrown in just enough pro-choice
rhetoric to beguile voters for whom abortion is a secondary issue
into believing that he's not Draconian on Roe _ and, taking the
bait, the National Right to Life Committee is running commercials
attacking him. McCain's avowed GOP enemies _ hard-core
right-to-lifers, Tom DeLay, Trent Lott _ may be more valuable in a
national election than most GOP friends.
</P>
<P>
   Tough as it is to believe now, George W. Bush, the former
``compassionate conservative,'' was initially programmed to be the
candidate that McCain is _ a moderate who might appeal to
independents and independent-minded Democrats who were turned off
by Bill Clinton yet found the puritanical perpetrators of the Starr
report even more egregious (and frightening). But Bush, falling
right into the same traps as Bob Dole in '96, never got beyond his
kinder, gentler slogan and is already fatally stuck to the flypaper
of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just as Dole returned a Log Cabin contribution early in that
race, making himself look intolerant and petty, so the Texas
governor refused to meet with Log Cabin this time, telling Tim
Russert of NBC that such an encounter would be ``a political
nightmare.'' (It is a nightmare _ for Bush _ and it cost him one of
the country's foremost thinkers on education reform, Diane Ravitch,
who resigned from his campaign on principle after he spurned Log
Cabin.)
</P>
<P>
   Eager to please social conservatives, Bush failed to stand up to
Buchanan's Jew-baiting and then marketed his own sectarian
religious beliefs. Like Dole in '96, he has also backed into
endorsing a hard-line Human Life Amendment. As a piece de
resistance this week, the tone-deaf Bush campaign fielded Ralph
Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, as its
spokesman on ``Larry King Live.'' There Reed had to defend the
governor's appearance at Bob Jones University, a school that
forbids interracial dating, ridicules Catholicism on its Web site
and threatened gay alumni with arrest for trespassing should they
show up on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Bush's campaign move so far to the right? It's the
same thinking _ that you can pander to a right-wing base and hope
centrist voters suffer amnesia on Election Day _ that led the GOP
to defeats not only in '96 but in '98. Even at the height of
impeachment and even in the South, religious-right-embracing
incumbents were thrown out _ including South Carolina's governor,
David Beasley, North Carolina's Sen. Lauch Faircloth and Alabama's
governor, Fob James. Pandering to the far right in 2000 _ a time
when gay couples can embrace on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
without prompting complaints to ABC _ would seem to be more ill
advised than ever, including in the increasingly globalized
demographics of states like South Carolina, let alone California.
Bush's campaign also seems not to recognize that in primary season
2000 _ unlike primary season '96 _ there are three, not one,
all-news networks, as well as a more pervasive Internet, amplifying
and codifying his every last pander.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, McCain would have little such baggage _ even as he
possesses a biography that makes Bush look just like what his
father called him, Boy George. But Democrats who are worrying about
the prospect of a race against McCain shouldn't lose sleep yet. The
same GOP minds that blew it in '96 and '98 are doing everything
possible to shore up Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of their prescient thinking was the conservative pundit
Bob Novak's Dec. 30 column promising that Bush's public touting of
Jesus ``actually enhances prospects of his wrapping up the
Republican nomination by early February.'' On The Wall Street
Journal's conservative editorial page, McCain is thrashed
repeatedly as a ``crank,'' a ``Clintonian,'' a perpetrator of an
agenda with ``more holes than a Harold Ickes deposition,'' a faux
creation of his ``idolators in the media.'' One of its sages has
called McCain's tax policy a probable ``fatal mistake'' (even
though a Time/CNN poll shows that 72 percent of Republicans in
South Carolina echo McCain, not Bush, on tax cuts) and just Friday
desperately (and patronizingly) trumpeted Bush as having ``a softer
personality'' that would appeal to women.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't softer mean weak? Well, never mind. Kamikaze thinking
like this should make Gore partisans jubilant, for once again the
hard right is in full froth, busily transforming a potential
Republican victory into a lost cause.

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

   &UR; (HELPFUL 500-WORD SIDEBAR FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL;

   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL;

   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes

that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.

   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.

   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.

ARKANSAS LEGAL PANEL CONSIDERS WHETHER TO PENALIZE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly a year of unexplained delays, the
committee of lawyers in Arkansas that had been asked to investigate
whether to discipline President Clinton by removing or suspending
his law license has begun to move forward, Arkansas lawyers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct
asked Clinton and his lawyers this week to respond within 30 days
to complaints filed by a federal judge and a conservative legal
group asking the committee to consider some kind of punishment for
what they asserted was his dishonesty about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee imposes sanctions on as many as 100 people a year
who are licensed to practice law in Arkansas, as Clinton is.
Typically, the seven-member committee recommends disbarment, the
most severe sanction, only in cases in which a lawyer has stolen
money from a client. Lesser punishments may include suspension of a
license for up to two years or a public reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Howard Brill at the law school of the University of
Arkansas at Fayetteville said the state Supreme Court to which the
disciplinary committee reports has grown increasingly stern in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Brill, an authority on lawyer discipline in Arkansas, said that
it was difficult to predict what may happen because ``I have not
found any cases that are really identical to that of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, an examination of the files of the bar committee
turned up some cases that had features that resembled Clinton's. In
most of those cases, the lawyer had been given a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In one similar case last year, the committee ordered a reprimand
for a lawyer who had ``knowingly made a false statement to a
tribunal.'' Another lawyer was reprimanded for knowingly engaging
in conduct that wasted the time of a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, the Supreme Court, which must ratify a
disbarment decision, withheld a law license from a lawyer who had
committed insurance fraud, saying: ``There is simply no place in
the law for a man or woman who will not tell the truth even when
his interest is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate, is still licensed to
practice law in Arkansas although he has spent most of his adult
life in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The president faces two complaints, one filed by the
Southeastern Legal Foundation based in Atlanta and another by Judge
Susan Webber Wright, the federal judge who presided over a case in
which Paula Jones charged Clinton with sexual misconduct. It was
during a deposition in that case that Clinton testified under oath
that he had not engaged in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has continued to insist that his answer was
``legally accurate,'' Wright disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12 of last year, she held Clinton in contempt for his
answers about his relationship with Lewinsky. She said that the
president's actions had subverted the rule of law and violated
Jones' right to information relevant to her case.
</P>
<P>
   Wright referred the case to the Arkansas bar committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the case apparently remained dormant until lawyers for the
Southeastern Legal Foundation filed a motion with the state Supreme
Court in December asking it to order the disciplinary committee to
begin consideration of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, the president of the foundation, said, ``We
think they were stonewalling for months on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported this week that several of
the members of the disciplinary committee have donated to Clinton's
political campaigns. James A. Neal, the executive director of the
committee, declined comment Friday, as did the White House and
David E. Kendall, Clinton's personal attorney.

PARENTS OF SLAIN OFFICER SEEK INDEPENDENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Frustrated by the pace of the probe into their
son's death, the parents of police Sergeant Cornel Young Jr. on
Friday asked the Rhode Island attorney general to authorize an
independent investigation into the shooting of their son by two
fellow officers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Major Cornel Young Sr. _ the highest ranking black on the
Providence police force _ and his ex-wife Leisa, said they want an
independent panel to look into the shooting because they feel the
current investigation being handled by Rhode Island Attorney
General Sheldon Whitehouse is ``starting to flounder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the death of my son, the family and community has been
torn apart,'' said Young, struggling to hold back tears during an
afternoon news conference called by the Rhode Island Ministerial
Alliance at Allen AME Church. ``I know my son would not want this.
The community and the city government are tearing at each other and
I demand that an independent counsel be established.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, members of the Young family have said they would
welcome outside help in determining responsibility for their son's
death. On Monday, the FBI announced that it has begun a
``preliminary inquiry'' into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here today to request that the independent counsel be
created, not for any ulterior motives, or anyone's agenda, but to
have truth come out,'' said Leisa Young. ``I know all of us want
what is right, just and fair and that is why I again plead for an
independent counsel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse refused to comment on the Young family's plea. In a
written statement released by his office, Whitehouse said the
investigation ``is now well on its way, and will continue. . . . I
have the greatest respect for Major Cornel Young Sr. and that
respect continues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministerial Alliance has said it will put political pressure
on Whitehouse to honor the Youngs's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be moved from our position, until (Whitehouse)
moves from his position,'' said the Rev. Marlow Washington, pastor
of Allen AME Church and a member of the Alliance. ``If the attorney
general doesen't want to listen to us regarding appointing an
outside investigator, he should listen to Sergeant Young's two
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Young, who was off-duty and in plainclothes, was shot
three times on Jan. 28 as he rushed to help two officers
confronting an allegedly armed man outside an all-night diner.
</P>
<P>
   Minority activists have questioned whether the officers, Carlos
A. Saraiva and Michael Solitro III, assumed Young was a suspect
because he was black. Police have not identified the races of
Saraiva or Solitro, but Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., has said that
Saraiva is Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The call for an outside investigation by the Young family Friday
came as lawyers for Aldrian Diaz, 30, were in court hoping to get
felony murder charges against their client dropped. Diaz is alleged
to have drawn a gun during a dispute outside Fidas Restaurant the
night Young was shot.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Cunha Jr., Diaz's attorney, filed motions to delay his
client's initial arraignment saying, ``The attorney general is
looking for a scapegoat to exonerate the Providence Police
Department for its mistake in this terrible tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, Mr. Diaz did not kill Sergeant Young, nor was he
responsible for the loss of this fine police officer. . . . To
indict (him) for murder would be a miscarriage of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   About 75 protesters stood outside Superior Court chanting
slogans and holding signs that read: ``No Justice, No Peace, No
Racist Police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out here to demand justice for my brother,'' said Angela
Diaz, 33. ``He should not be held responsible for Sergeant Young's
death because he wasn't the one who shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Diaz said that in recent conversations with her brother
he told her that Young repeatedly identified himself to the two
armed police officers before they opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aldrian told me that Sergeant Young kept telling them, `I'm a
police officer, I'm a police officer.' They shot anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, a black
Muslim group headed by Louis Farrakhan, was on hand to lend support
to Diaz's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect time for us to get organized,'' said
Muhammad. ``This issue of police force is something that concerns
us all. If it can happen to this officer, it can happen to any of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Several rallies, prayer vigils, and protests are planned next
week in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit idly by and do nothing,'' said the Rev. Theodore
Wilson II, of the Ministerial Alliance's Task Force for
Reconciliation. ``There are some hurricane winds flying across the
Ocean State and we need to bring about justice,'' he added.

POSITIVE GOP CAMPAIGN IS STARTING TO LOOK A BIT NEGATIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In all his campaigns in Texas, Gov. George W.
Bush has expressed disdain for negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   So when he embarked on his run for the White House, it surprised
no one in the Lone Star state that Bush promised a positive
campaign that ``appeals to our better angels, not our darker
impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Bush lost the New Hampshire primary to Arizona Sen.
John McCain, things have suddenly grown dark in the battle for the
GOP nomination as negative attacks hit the airwaves in South
Carolina. And those who know Bush in his home state say he is being
cast in an unfamiliar role.
</P>
<P>
   ``For George Bush, negative campaigning is certainly something
he's never done before,'' said Bill Miller, an Austin consultant
with Democratic and Republican clients. ``It's uncharted
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, McCain declared he would pull all his negative
advertisements in South Carolina, but Bush _ who has recently
gained ground there in opinion polls _ has not agreed to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an old Washington trick. It's a bait-and-switch trick.
He runs ads for 18 days defining me for something I'm not, and then
all of a sudden says, `OK, let's all be quiet.' I'm going to make
sure that the people understand exactly what I believe and exactly
where I stand,'' Bush told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1994 race against Gov. Ann Richards, Bush won in part
because he wisely avoided attacking the governor personally _ even
when she referred to him as ``some jerk,'' experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Bush was running so far ahead of his opponent,
Democrat Garry Mauro, that he hardly ever mentioned him. Bush won
re-election with 69 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the closest comparison to the slugfest in which the
governor now finds himself is his 1978 run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, recalls running radio
ads saying Bush _ born in Connecticut and educated at Yale and
Harvard _ ``wasn't one of us.'' In exchange, he said the Bush
campaign ran ads warning Hance might become a ``puppet'' of then
House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept them on radio,'' said Hance, now a Republican and Bush
supporter and fund raiser. ``The TV ads were all positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as their race came to a close that year, Bush was targeted
in a mass-mailing advertisement to churchgoers by a Hance
associate. It attacked Bush for offering free beer to college
students to drum up support for his candidacy at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pointed out that the ``Bush Bash'' had been promoted
without his approval, but he decided against running a counter ad
pointing out that Hance leased property to the owner of ``Fat
Dawgs,'' a local beer joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have attacked him, but I thought it would backfire,''
Bush said in an interview last year. ``I was a little naive. I had
more faith in the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Hance said the mailer made no difference in the
outcome of the race, which he won. But some analysts say the risk
of not responding to negative ads is greater than the threat of a
backlash from voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are not dumb,'' said Allan Lichtman, a
presidential historian at American University. ``Negative ads would
not be so ubiquitous if they were the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on Michael Dukakis in 1988, for example, were seen as
largely successful. Likewise, Vice President Al Gore's relentless
pummeling of opponent Bill Bradley in the Democratic contest was
credited with stopping Bradley's rise. Bradley finally fought back,
but some analysts said the damage had been done.
</P>
<P>
   As they unleashed their recent attacks on each other, Bush and
McCain cited the need to reverse the damage that could be inflicted
by not responding in kind to negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of sitting back, smiling and watching Senator McCain
define me are over,'' Bush fumed Monday, a week after McCain
trounced him in the New Hampshire primary. ``I got defined in New
Hampshire. ... I just let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain _ a former fighter pilot who spent 5 1/2
years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam _ warned that he would use an
old tactic he learned in the military when faced with negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called a liar, a hypocrite,'' said McCain. ``We're
going to fire back, and every time he does it we're going to fire
back doubly.''
</P>
<P>
   Each blames the other for starting the negative attacks, not an
unfamiliar claim in politics. Bush cites an ad McCain ran in New
Hampshire saying he was the only candidate who wouldn't take
``every last dime of the surplus and spend it on tax cuts that
mostly benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was clearly aimed at Bush, who called it a distortion
because his plan would reserve a separate surplus contained within
the Social Security Trust Fund to shore up the retirement program.
McCain said he was talking about the non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush complained loudly to reporters about McCain's ad,
he did not run any counter ads.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Rath, a Bush adviser in New Hampshire, the
governor made it clear that ``he never wanted to start sort of a
downward spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath also said the Bush campaign had been more concerned about
negative ads from millionaire publisher Steve Forbes _ now out of
the race _ who had used them against eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared to go quickly to respond to negative attacks
if Forbes did them in the manner that he did to Dole in '96,'' Rath
said. ``We took McCain at his word when he said he wasn't going to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his 18-point loss in New Hampshire, Bush promised to
hit back. And on Monday he released an ad saying McCain's tax cut
proposal was ``smaller than Clinton's'' and ``echoes Washington
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his vow, McCain fired back even more harshly, saying
Bush had broken his promise not to use attack ads. In the ad,
McCain asks voters: `` Do we really want another politician in the
White House America can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters called the ad comparing Bush to Bill Clinton
``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two have continued to swap charges on the
campaign trail and in advertisements, with sporadic calls for cease
fires but no end in sight to the mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Texas, observers say they have seen Bush get hot under
the collar in private, but rarely in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember seeing him publicly aggressive and testy
before,'' said Rep. Steve Wolens, a Dallas Democrat who has
generally praised Bush's outreach to members of both parties.
``I've never seen him as a public slugger.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mike Hellon, former chair of the Arizona Republican
Party, McCain is also in uncharted waters. His past campaigns have
been mild by comparision, Hellon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how many times you've run before, or what
you've run for,'' said Hellon, a McCain supporter. ``Presidential
politics takes on a whole life of its own. I think that's what
these two guys are starting to experience.''

ETHNIC EXPULSIONS CONTINUE IN KOSOVO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Kosovo _ Despite the presence of several hundred
additional peacekeeping troops, Serbs are continuing to threaten
ethnic Albanians who live among them on the northern side of this
town. The Serbs are forcing the Kosovars to leave their houses and
take refuge in the Albanian half of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of Albanians, carrying bags of clothes, were seen
crossing the bridge to the south part of town on Friday. Three
middle-age couples said that they had received telephoned threats
through the night and that by morning people people were banging on
their doors. The couples said they believed that the United Nations
police could offer little hope of protection and left.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,500 Albanians are still living on the north side
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Serbs rampaged through the northern part of town,
killing eight Albanians and forcing 120 to flee, the exodus
continues, perhaps more quietly, but at a similar pace of 120 to
150 a day. The Serbs, outraged at a rocket attack on a Serbian bus
that killed two people and a grenade attack on a cafe that injured
15, said the rampage was a moment of anger.
</P>
<P>
   But international observers and police said the violence
possessed a certain method and organization. Ensuing actions show a
similar pattern. Apartment buildings have been made targets, and
the resident Albanian families have been persuaded, ordered or
frightened to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing expulsions came as the commissioner for refugees
warned in a new report on minority communities in Kosovo that the
situation was deteriorating. ``Overall, with some limited
exceptions, the situation has not improved since the last report
was issued (in November) and in many instances deteriorating
conditions were noted,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the cases of attacks on minorities are now
committed by Albanians on Serbs, Roma, Muslim Slavs, Turks and
others, many of whom now live in protected enclaves. Only in
Mitrovica are Albanians still suffering persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Albanians appear determined to hang on, the
continued Albanian movement southward, even if temporarily, bodes
ill for coexistence here. Residents voice the belief that the plan
of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has all along been to
partition Kosovo and retain the northern part, along with its
minerals and mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``His end game was to carve out a region in the north where
Serbs could predominate,'' said David L Phillips of Columbia
University's International Conflict Resolution program. ``It now
looks like he is succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 820 Albanians, a third of those living in the north
side of the city, have fled their homes since the violence erupted
a week ago, said Claire Bourgeois, who heads the office of the
United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Mitrovica. Only a
few families have ventured back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped it would stop,'' Bourgeois said of the exodus.
``But people are still under threat, and it is starting to be too
much for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the commission on refugees, Dennis McNamara, made an
impassioned plea for more Western aid and resources to combat
crime. He also called for more moral commitment from the West, in
particular to use political pressure on local Albanian and Serb
leaders to use their influence to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois said some of the families visited were pleased with
the presence of extra peacekeepers and felt safer. Several hundred
extra troops have been brought in to reinforce the French troops
who are in command of the town. British troops were guarding the
town's main bridge on Friday. Yet there was not an overwhelming
troop presence on the streets in the north.
</P>
<P>
   One pair of French soldiers standing at a main intersection said
they had no idea if there were Albanian families in the area. ``I'm
not really sure why we are here,'' one admitted.
</P>
<P>
   A school teacher, Elvane Kachanika, and her husband, Muhedin, a
couple in their 50s, walked over the main bridge that divides the
town just before dusk, carrying their belongings in several bags.
``They called last night by telephone,'' she said of the Serbs.
``They said: `Are you still there?' I don't even try to argue, I
just hung up. Then today they came banging on the apartment door.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Albanians still living in the northern half of the
city are old and vulnerable, according to commissioner on refugees.
``There are a lot of elderly people. They are staying because they
are attached to their belongings,'' Bourgeois said.

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL;

   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

NATWEST BOARD YIELDS TO BUYOUT BY ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After a bruising, four-month battle for control of
National Westminster Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland emerged the
winner Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NatWest, Britain's third-largest bank, which is twice the size
of the Royal Bank, conceded defeat at a board meeting Friday
morning, deciding to formally recommend Royal Bank's bid of 22.8
billion pounds ($36.3 billion) to NatWest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We congratulate Royal Bank and look forward to helping them
ensure the success of the new organization,'' Sir David Rowland,
chairman of NatWest, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of London-based NatWest increased 26 pence to close at
1,173 pence on the London Stock Exchange. Shares of Royal Bank fell
4 pence to 871 pence.
</P>
<P>
   While Royal Bank was widely expected to win control of NatWest
by Monday, the last day shareholders can tender their shares,
NatWest's board had heated debates about whether the board would
formally endorse the bid. NatWest had been under attack with
hostile bids by both Royal Bank and its crosstown rival in
Edinburgh, the Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, NatWest had argued publicly that it would be
better off alone and that the savings that both Scottish banks
claimed they could achieve from a tie-up were illusory.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why it reversed its stance, NatWest said that while
its board had advised shareholders to reject both bids, ``it has
subsequently become clear that the majority of NatWest's
institutional shareholders intend to support the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board considers that it would not be in shareholders'
interests to remain as a minority in a company that was no longer
independent, the NatWest statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Formal announcement of the merger is expected to take place
Monday. The combined company will have a total of 15 million
customers and 2,379 branches throughout Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now that the battle for NatWest is over, analysts said a rash of
pan-European bank consolidations could be in the offing. At the
very least, the analysts said, banks will be forced to find the
same kind of savings all three banks pledged they could achieve
during the takeover battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank said it plans to increase profit by squeezing out
savings of 1.18 billion pounds ($1.87 billion) through cutting
18,000 jobs. The Royal Bank also plans to sell Gartmore, NatWest's
fund management unit. It said it would keep Ulster Bank, NatWest's
Northern Ireland-based bank, and Greenwich NatWest, the debt
markets unit, both of which would have been sold off under the Bank
of Scotland's plan.
</P>
<P>
   NatWest's rival, Lloyds TSB Group, said Friday it plans to cut
3,000 jobs, in part because its second-quarter earnings fell short
of analysts' expectations. Analysts said that Lloyds TSB would now
face the same scrutiny as the combined NatWest-Royal Bank. Lloyds
shares fell 60.5 pence Friday, to 626 pence, in London.
</P>
<P>
   Viscount Younger, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, said
in a statement: ``We look forward to working with the people at
NatWest to create a new force in U.K. banking. Together we will
build the pre-eminent U.K. financial institution to the benefit of
staff, customers and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank's offer calls for it to pay 0.968 share of its
stock plus 4 pounds ($6.36) in cash for each NatWest share. Banco
Santander Central Hispano SA of Spain, which holds a 10 percent
stake in the Royal Bank, and CGU PLC, a British insurer, are
expected to help finance the cash component of the offer. The Bank
of Scotland's offer was for 1.75 of its shares and 3.56 pounds
($5.66) in cash for each NatWest share.
</P>
<P>
   Sir George R. Mathewson, chief executive officer of Royal Bank,
is expected to run the combined company from Edinburgh. The name of
the new company and details about its structure have not been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Royal Bank was the right choice for NatWest.
``NatWest failed twice to get its act together and RBOS should have
a chance to try to fix it,'' said Jonathan Tyce, an analyst at SG
Securities in London. He seemed skeptical, though, about the
savings Royal Bank hopes to achieve. ``It'll all get lost in the
wash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the Bank of Scotland may now become a
takeover target. ``A lot of guys are going to try to pull their
trousers down and take their business,'' Tyce said. Bank of
Scotland shares closed at 614 pence, down 63 pence, in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank was advised by Merrill Lynch International,
Goldman Sachs International and Noble Grossart. NatWest's advisers
were J.P. Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. The Bank of
Scotland was being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston Europe and
Morgan Stanley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first guide to the identification of the world's sea horses
has been drawn up as part of a research project into these
increasingly vulnerable creatures.
</P>
<P>
   The guide has been produced by Project Sea Horse, a partnership
between London Zoo and McGill University, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The project is working to counter the threat to sea horses from
habitat destruction, exploitation as curios and, in particular,
overfishing for traditional Chinese medicine. It describes the 32
world species so far identified, although there may be more.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from fingernail to hand-sized, they include two found
off southwest Britain: the short-snouted sea horse, Hippocampus
hippocampus, and the long-snouted, Hippocampus guttulatus, which
are found from Cornwall to Dorset and may breed there; they almost
certainly breed off Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of the world sea horses are increasingly at risk,
most of all from fishing to supply the trade in traditional Chinese
medicine. Millions of dead sea horses pass every year through Hong
Kong, the main trading center.
</P>
<P>
   Project Sea Horse, run by Dr. Amanda Vincent, a professor at
McGill, and Dr. Heather Hall, London Zoo's curator of lower
vertebrates, is trying to make the trade sustainable while learning
more about the sea horse's curious biology.
</P>
<P>
   They are helping coastal communities in the Philippines, the
center of sea horse fishing, and other tropical countries learn how
not to overexploit the sea horse populations and, in some cases,
suggesting alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sea horses are fish, related to sticklebacks. They display a
rare natural trait _ it is the male who gets pregnant. The female
deposits her eggs inside the male, who nurtures them until giving
birth, complete with labor agonies.
</P>
<P>
   Sea horses pair for life, and greet each other every morning
with a ritual swimming dance, linking tails and promenading through
the sea-grass beds in which they live.
</P>
<P>
   The guide has been funded by Guylian, a Belgian chocolate
company, which at London Zoo this week announced a (pounds
sterling)500,000 ($850,000) grant to Project Sea Horse to allow it
to expand its work.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes chocolates in the shapes of seashells and
creatures, including a sea horse, and will be carrying details of
the project's work and Web site on its chocolate boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Project Sea Horse's Web site is: www.projectseahorse.com. &QL;

 &HT;    Texas paper mill purchased for $4.9 billion
 &HT;    By Jerry Jordan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Donohue Inc. officials announced early Friday
that the company was being purchased by Abitibi Consolidated, the
world's largest newsprint producer, in a $7.1 billion Canadian
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the exchange rate at the time markets closed Friday,
the deal is worth about $4.9 billion in U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
   All boards of directors overseeing the companies have approved
the buyout. Pending a vote by shareholders and approval by
regulatory agencies, the merger of the two companies should be
complete in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, Donohue will cease to exist,'' said Debbie
Johnston, manager of communications and community relations for the
company's Lufkin paper mill.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a buyout of all Donohue holdings, including
seven newsprint operations, 18 saw mills and all of the company's
sales and marketing offices.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said there was no indication of any pending reductions
in Lufkin, or of any changes in the company's $300 million
modernization project here.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, we don't anticipate any changes here,''
she said. ``There should be no interruptions with the modernization
project. We were told the transaction would be final in the next
couple of months. We will operate as Donohue until that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said local company officials were excited to become
part of the top producer of newsprint in the world. During a
conference call with corporate officials, she said, Abitibi
executives said they were in favor of the Lufkin mill's
modernization project.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Leclerc, manager of public affairs for Abitibi
Consolidated in Montreal, Quebec, told The Lufkin Daily News that
members of the merged companies will meet and look over records
before making a decision about the overall future of any particular
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ink is not dry yet on the paper,'' Leclerc said. ``They
will have to sit down and go through the portfolio of the new
company and evaluate possibilities. Only after that can we look at
anything. To do so before is really premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Leclerc said he is not personally aware of all the issues
affecting each Donohue facility and could not comment on such
things as the Lufkin modernization project.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Desbians, president and CEO of Donohue, will become the
chairman of the board for Abitibi, according to a press release
issued by Abitibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very supportive of Abitibi Consolidated's bid and are
recommending that our shareholders accept the offer for the strong
value the new entity will return to them,'' Desbians stated in the
release. ``This will be a great company.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Abitibi control of 35 percent of the world's
newsprint operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this combination is far and away the best
consolidation opportunity in our industry,'' John Weaver, president
and CEO of Abitibi consolidated, said. ``It will transform Abitibi
Consolidated into a global low-cost producer. It was a rare and
fortuitous opportunity brought on by Quebecor's decision to divest
its interest in Donohue and we were ready to act. Donohue is a
company we greatly admired and have studied closely for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wellborn, president of the Angelina County Economic
Development Partnership, said he was informed of the merger early
Friday and was told that no changes are expected at the Lufkin
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what the outcome for the community will be,''
Wellborn said. ``I was told that local expansion and modernization
would be proceeding full speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spoke will local plant manager Carl Wright and came
away with a good feeling about the future of the facility in
Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Carl feels pretty good about it, then I feel pretty good
about it,'' Wellborn said. ``This had been rumored in Canada for a
couple of weeks. We knew when Champion put the Lufkin facility up
for sale that Abitibi was a potential buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellborn said the facility here has a history of being
high-performing with low production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue purchased the Lufkin paper mill from Champion in early
1998. When Donohue's parent company, Quebecor, announced it would
possibly put it up for sale, Wellborn said, a number of suitors got
in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facility is considered a plum,'' he said. ``Our feeling
right now is that on the face of it, it appears to be good for
Lufkin and Angelina County.''

SCHOOL BOARD ACTS TO BLOCK FORMATION OF MORE GAY-RELATED GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Already ordered by a federal judge to allow
meetings of a gay tolerance club at a high school, the Orange
County Board of Education voted Thursday night to restrict clubs at
elementary and middle schools to those related to studies in an
effort to block similar organizations at lower grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   The board stopped short of taking such action at its high
schools, instead proposing to tighten rules on noncurricular clubs.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials described the move, which came one day
after the Gay-Straight Alliance at El Modena High School held its
first meeting under a court order, as a ``pre-emptive strike.'' The
officials noted that local activists had said they would assist
students wanting to start similar groups in other high schools or
in middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would require students to obtain written consent
from their parents to participate in a club, maintain a 2.0 grade
average and refrain from discussions of a sexual nature. The board
will discuss the proposed changes with its lawyer, and may vote on
them at its next regularly scheduled meeting on Feb. 24. The
changes, if passed, would not go into effect until July 1, after
the current school year ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to put safeguards in place while they
make a decision about how and whether to go forward in court,''
said Judith Frutig, director of communications for the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over the issue continued at El Modena High School on
Friday, officials said. In the morning, about 200 students staged a
walkout, and 50 of them scaled a fence at the school and left.
While some students said they were demonstrating support for gay
alliance members, others said they opposed the group. Still others
said they were showing support for teachers in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tensions on campus are right on the surface,'' Frutig
said, noting that the school district had a holiday coming up on
Monday. ``It's been a long week. I think everyone is looking
forward to the three-day holiday as a cooling-off time.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which in December denied the Gay-Straight Alliance's
application to meet at school, is being sued by club organizers
under the Equal Access Act, a federal law passed in 1984 that
prohibits schools from selectively denying noncurricular clubs on
the basis of content. The suit also contends that the students are
being denied their constitutional rights to free speech and equal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Judge David O. Carter of U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles found merit in the club's arguments and issued a
preliminary injunction ordering the district to allow students to
meet as the case progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberty groups representing the club's organizers in their
lawsuit against the district said they were examining the board's
proposed policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal to have a parental consent requirement is
discriminatory both in its intent and its effect,'' said Judith E.
Schaeffer, deputy legal director with People for the American Way
Foundation, one group involved in the suit. ``I think it's common
sense to know that a high school student who wants to join the
chess club won't have any problem asking her parents to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``There are many gay and lesbian students who
need the safe haven of a gay-straight alliance who will have
difficulty discussing that with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer noted that in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles,
school officials considered a similar action four years ago when
confronted with an application for a gay and lesbian students club.
In that case, lawyers persuaded the board to adopt a policy of
notifying parents about what clubs met at school and leaving it to
them to discuss any concerns with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said lawyers were still examining the issue of the 2.0
grade average requirement. While it might be wise for some
students, she said, for others who are struggling with their
grades, peer support can be a way of staying engaged in school. She
also noted that the students in the alliance said from the
beginning that they would not discuss sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with this club,'' she said. ``The
board's obligation now is to abide by the court's decision and
return to the business of educating the school district's
students.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A rise in the legal age of marriage from 15 to 18; polygamy only
with the express permission of a man's first wife; an equal right
to divorce, and a fair division of assets between the separating
parties. What could sound more reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   In Morocco, however, these very notions are enough to have wise
men warning of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The end of January 2000 will go down as when the new Moroccan
revolution was obliged to wake up to reality.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Islamic activists shouted down ministers at meetings
in the capital, Rabat. And when a government plan to haul the
treatment of women from the Middle Ages to somewhere near the 21st
century became the litmus test of King Mohammed VI's ambitions for
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, one of the most stable Arab countries has become the
latest battleground between modernizers and the forces of
conservative Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Little was expected from a shy and untested crown prince,
Mohammed, when he succeeded Hassan II last July. But in the few
months since, ``M-6'' has transformed the mood of his country.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed the return from exile of Abraham Serfaty, the
country's most prominent dissident and erstwhile political
prisoner, and then sacked his father's dreaded interior minister,
Drissi Basri.
</P>
<P>
   He has twice already travelled to the desperately poor Rif
region, the largest source of cannabis for Europe where 90 percent
of the population is illiterate _ and where Hassan II never deigned
to set foot in his 38 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   On the Western Sahara dispute, which has weighed on Moroccan
international relations for a quarter of a century, the king hints
at a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Unprecedented in the Arab world, he has launched a commission to
probe human-rights abuses, above all the disappearance without
trial of hundreds of political dissidents into Basri's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Long muzzled, the Moroccan press is enjoying a previously
unknown freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the 36-year-old king has governed by dramatic gesture
_ none more dramatic than last November's sacking of Basri, ``the
top cop of the kingdom'' who for 20 years had been Hassan II's iron
fist.
</P>
<P>
   But the clash with militant Islam over women's emancipation will
be a first, perhaps decisive challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails,'' Prime Minister Abderrahman Youssoufi recently
warned a visitor, ``the whole reform project fails.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, mercifully, is not Algeria. A different history,
culture, and ethnic composition make any rerun of the ghastly civil
war which has engulfed its neighbor unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But if Morocco's Islamists are a minority, they are a determined
one. They have the backing of conservatives in Youssoufi's
eight-party coalition, and a natural recruiting ground in the
mosques and universities. And Morocco's dire economic problems give
them ammunition galore.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients which have stoked Islamic movements elsewhere in
the Arab world are only too visible here also: massive
unemployment, $19 billion of foreign debt whose mere servicing
consumes a third of the annual budget, rampant corruption and vast
disparities between a tiny, super-wealthy elite and masses who live
in grinding poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The overall illiteracy rate is 50 percent; as many live on
(pounds sterling)1 ($1.60) a day or less. Among women in the
countryside, deprived of schooling, jobs and basic legal rights,
those figures rise to 80 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   This is the background of the battle over Morocco's women, and
the family code, the moudawana, which enchains them.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamists are claiming for all they are worth that
emancipation of women as envisaged would lead to the collapse of
the family, the destruction of Islamic values, and debauchery of
every sort.
</P>
<P>
   And the government is by no means sure of victory. Hamstrung by
differences within its own ranks, it has not dared to challenge the
Islamists head-on.
</P>
<P>
   And, as one former provincial governor wondered, ``Who do the
peasantry more easily identify with _ the religious parties, or a
Westernized governing elite which has scant experience of how they
actually live?''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, all roads lead back to the king, change's best
guarantee. The youth of Mohammed VI and his closest aides could be
a vital asset in a country 50 percent of whose population is under
25.
</P>
<P>
   But not only does he wield vast temporal powers in his
semi-feudal kingdom. He is also Morocco's supreme religious
authority: the Commander of the Faithful, the Sword of the Lord on
Earth, directly descended from the Prophet, and such a man
religious activists will take on at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   To show his commitment to Islam, the king has grown a beard
since he ascended the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father who survived at least two attempted military
coups against him, the king so far has the full loyalty of the army
and the police: without it, he could never last.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan to help women will be his sternest test. ``I am not
exaggerating,'' insists Serfaty, ``this is capable of leading us
into civil war.'' &QL;

UES has been viewed as greatly undervalued but with the potential

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When are a woman's breasts politically correct,
and when are they just downright offensive?
</P>
<P>
   The question has been blowing up a fair storm in San Francisco,
a city whose billboards are plastered with the usual array of
oversized mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
   But one specific billboard, for a particularly graphic
advertising campaign promoting breast-cancer awareness, has run the
gauntlet of controversy, censorship and a much-ballyhooed outcry
over civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, sponsored by a local group called The Breast
Cancer Fund, set out to be deliberately shocking by superimposing
images of mastectomy scars on the chests of glamour models.
</P>
<P>
   One is made to look like the cover of Cosmopolitan, with the
word ``Mastectomy'' written in place of the magazine title.
</P>
<P>
   Another sends up the ad for the Calvin Klein perfume Obsession,
with the words ``Obsessed With Breasts'' replacing the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the ads started appearing at bus stations
in the suburban communities to the east and south of San Francisco
and were intended to be introduced into the city as well. But then
the furor broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by a handful of complaints from the public, transport
companies and billboard firms removed the posters on the grounds
not only that they were offensive but that they risked causing
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in San Francisco, the company that had volunteered to
distribute them for free suddenly got cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it _ a four-by-six-foot picture of a woman's
torso and you see these two bare red scars, I mean, to see a
woman's terribly, terribly scarred body _ it's just not for public
consumption,'' said Lew Lillian, head of the billboard firm Outdoor
Systems. ``It's too shocking. Too upsetting. Too provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ads have proven to be nowhere near as provocative as the
attempt to suppress them. Lillian's decision provoked a torrent of
protest, from the local media and the San Francisco branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Martin, the founder of The Breast Cancer Fund whose own
mastectomy scars are the ones featured in the ads, decried what she
called an attempt ``to hide fundamental aspects of this disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how you can have boobs pictured all over
the place, pardon the expression, and not show one very real side
of breast cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple of days ago, a rival billboard firm called Eller
Media stepped in and volunteered to post the images in Lillian's
place. They will be going up on about five billboards as soon as
space becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet victory for the voice of liberal justice in a city
virtually built on such sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to protect the residents of San Francisco from a
shocking sight on the streets is kind of like protecting the folks
in Los Angeles from smog,'' commented local columnist Ken Garcia.
``You can try. You will fail.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ When are a woman's breasts politically correct,
and when are they just downright offensive?
</P>
<P>
   The question has been blowing up a fair storm in San Francisco,
a city whose billboards are plastered with the usual array of
oversized mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
   But one specific billboard, for a particularly graphic
advertising campaign promoting breast-cancer awareness, has run the
gauntlet of controversy, censorship and a much-ballyhooed outcry
over civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, sponsored by a local group called The Breast
Cancer Fund, set out to be deliberately shocking by superimposing
images of mastectomy scars on the chests of glamour models.
</P>
<P>
   One is made to look like the cover of Cosmopolitan, with the
word ``Mastectomy'' written in place of the magazine title.
</P>
<P>
   Another sends up the ad for the Calvin Klein perfume Obsession,
with the words ``Obsessed With Breasts'' replacing the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the ads started appearing at bus stations
in the suburban communities to the east and south of San Francisco
and were intended to be introduced into the city as well. But then
the furor broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by a handful of complaints from the public, transport
companies and billboard firms removed the posters on the grounds
not only that they were offensive but that they risked causing
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in San Francisco, the company that had volunteered to
distribute them for free suddenly got cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it _ a four-by-six-foot picture of a woman's
torso and you see these two bare red scars, I mean, to see a
woman's terribly, terribly scarred body _ it's just not for public
consumption,'' said Lew Lillian, head of the billboard firm Outdoor
Systems. ``It's too shocking. Too upsetting. Too provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ads have proven to be nowhere near as provocative as the
attempt to suppress them. Lillian's decision provoked a torrent of
protest, from the local media and the San Francisco branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Martin, the founder of The Breast Cancer Fund whose own
mastectomy scars are the ones featured in the ads, decried what she
called an attempt ``to hide fundamental aspects of this disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how you can have boobs pictured all over
the place, pardon the expression, and not show one very real side
of breast cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple of days ago, a rival billboard firm called Eller
Media stepped in and volunteered to post the images in Lillian's
place. They will be going up on about five billboards as soon as
space becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet victory for the voice of liberal justice in a city
virtually built on such sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to protect the residents of San Francisco from a
shocking sight on the streets is kind of like protecting the folks
in Los Angeles from smog,'' commented local columnist Ken Garcia.
``You can try. You will fail.'' &QL;

IN MOSCOW, DUCK SCULPTURES   TAKE FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Mrs. Mallard, Lack, and Mack vanished without a trace.
The befuddled local cops haven't a clue in the case. Jack, Kack,
Nack, Ouack, and Pack stand orphaned in the snow. And in
Novodevichy Park, that's just about all they know.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever said life in Moscow is for the faint of heart, but
Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings have had a particularly rough time
in Russia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the victims of malicious nocturnal visitors bearing
power saws, the Mallard family probably wishes it had never come.
Of the nine Mallards that landed here nearly a decade ago _ a gift
from former first lady Barbara Bush to Moscow's children and the
late Raisa Gorbachev _ just five remain.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures, inspired by Robert McCloskey's ``Make Way for
Ducklings,'' are replicas of the beloved bronze figures created for
Boston's Public Garden by Massachusetts sculptor Nancy Schon.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, as five times before in Boston, a
Make-Off-With-Ducklings phenomenon appears to have set in. But
while Boston thieves have scored five separate duckling abductions
over 12 years, Moscow's duck abductors snatched three Mallards in a
single night.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, it happened sometime last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cover of the darkness, the ducknappers pilfered the
200-pound Mrs. Mallard, sawing her off at the ankles. All that
remains are her large webbed feet. The criminals completed the job
by snatching Lack and Mack. Quack, the smallest of the Mallard
clan, disappeared shortly after the sculptures were unveiled in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Relics of a time when Washington and Moscow exchanged something
other than barbs, the sculptures were presented in by Barbara Bush
during a superpower summit.
</P>
<P>
   Raisa Gorbachev, who was the Soviet Union's first lady at the
time, and about 100 children attended the unveiling. A plaque in
front of the ducks reads: ``This sculpture was given in love and
friendship to the children of the Soviet Union on behalf of the
children of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Located in a park across the street from the 16th century
Novodevichy Monastery, the ducklings quickly became a favorite for
Moscow's toddlers and pre-teens, as they are in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and children, long fond of climbing on the ducklings _
and particularly the much-larger-than-life Mrs. Mallard _ said they
were stunned by the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children loved the ducks so much. Some cried when they
discovered that they were gone,'' said a woman who gave only her
first name, Nadya. ``This is terrible, we hope they can be replaced
somehow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Tatyana, called the theft ``barbaric.'' Her
4-year-old daughter, Katerina, nodded in agreement and repeated
after her mother: ``barbaric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children were very worried about the ducks and began
searching for them,'' Tatyana said. ``This is not only bad for the
children but it shows disrespect. Those ducks were a gift to us
from your country. Gifts should always be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   In McCloskey's book, Boston police help shepherd the Mallards
safely from an island in the Charles River to the Public Garden.
Who can forget officer Michael stopping traffic on Storrow Drive,
or Clancy at headquarters sending patrol cars to clear Beacon
Street?
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's real-life finest appeared less attentive to the ducks'
well-being. A beat cop patrolling the park would say little about
the crime Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating,'' he said. He declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zubkov, a spokesman for the Moscow police, said only
that he was ``ashamed of the crime,'' which was ``probably
committed by some idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schon, who created both the Boston and Moscow ducks and traveled
to Russia to help present them, said she was devastated by the
latest theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mean, cruel and rotten. I'm so upset that I don't even
know what to do,'' Schon said. ``And the thought that they would
take Mrs. Mallard is just the worst.''

   LONDON _ Assuming you manage to get out of Heathrow Airport
(``chaotic and overcrowded'') in one piece, the next hazard for the
unwary tourist arriving in London is White Van Man, who is just
waiting to ``punch your lights out,'' before you are ripped off at
a hotel which, wherever it is, ``is going to take a great wad out
of your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of the ``Lonely Planet: London'' travel guide
has been published, and it pulls no punches.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Pat Yale, a Londoner who has retreated to Bristol,
and Steve Fallon, an American, have taken a long, hard look at the
so-called coolest city in the world and found it and its
inhabitants rather wanting.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners' good manners are ``going the way of the dodo'' and
their driving is aggressive in the extreme, the book warns.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, the authors find, is a common occurrence and
motorcycle couriers and bicycles ``can be even more of a menace
than pickpockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists should not even try to befriend the natives, or
``litterbugs'' as it prefers to style them, who are far ``too
absorbed in their own world of workmates, schoolfriends and
family,'' although on the plus side the guide does concede that
they are unfazed by outrageous dress and are quite unshockable.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Street ``can be a great disappointment,'' the streets are
dreadfully polluted and the Tube (subway) resembles the Black Hole
of Calcutta, the guide adds.
</P>
<P>
   But in one area it has ventured a positive opinion where none
has been ventured before.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Dome, according to the authors, is ``everything
modern architecture should be: innovative, complementary and
startlingly beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cox, of the Lonely Planet Guide Books, was unrepentant
this week. ``I challenge anyone to say that they don't recognize
the picture we are painting,'' she said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely true that London is a dirty city and the
streets are strewn with rubbish, it is also very polluted and
Londoners are so reserved that they do come across as aggressive _
especially if you go up the wrong side of the escalator on the
Tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is not at all harsh. A guide book that only talks
about the positive or only mentions the negatives is no good.
Tourists need to be able to see both sides and decide whether they
want to go somewhere,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give the character of the place as well, and London
is a big, congested, polluted city whose inhabitants are
notoriously reserved and quite aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The London Tourist Board was reluctant to weigh in, noting only
that all guide books are subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonely Planet has identified some negative aspects of
London but it still recognizes that it is one of the world's great
cities,'' said a spokesman, Alex Brannen.
</P>
<P>
   ``London compares well with its European counterparts and I
would totally refute the claim that it is an unfriendly place. We
do an annual survey of visitors to the capital and last summer 78
percent of them said they found Londoners either fairly or
extremely friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``With reference to air pollution and traffic hazards, these are
experienced by all cities with high car usage.''
</P>
<P>
   With tourists reading all that negative propaganda before they
even arrive, it's just as well that Londoners are so ``amazingly
tolerant'' _ otherwise the aggression levels might rise even
further. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ For dog lovers in New York City, it is tough to top
the hospitality of Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   There are wide-open meadows, liberal rules for letting dogs run
free and special doggie water fountains installed at ground level.
It has a large, well-organized group of dog owners _ they call
themselves FIDO _ who hold seminars on first aid for dogs and
monthly ``Coffee Bark'' socials, and even offer conflict resolution
for dogs and owners who just cannot get along. At Christmas, there
is something called dog caroling.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, all this dog love has a downside.
</P>
<P>
   Prospect Park has quietly become a popular dumping ground for
dogs. Scores of desperate dog owners are slinking into the park _
often picking spots popular with dog walkers _ waiting until the
coast is clear, then tying up their pets and walking off. Only the
careless ones forget to take the tags.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McInerney, the president of FIDO, an acronym for Fellowship
for the Interests of Dogs and their Owners, found a young,
emaciated Rottweiler tied to a tree in July, a crumpled note tucked
in the dog's collar. ``Please take care of my best friend Rocky,''
the note read. ``He was a present to me for my 16th birthday, and I
can't afford to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupper W. Thomas, the administrator of Prospect Park and the
president of the Prospect Park Alliance, rescued a worm-ridden,
epileptic beagle tied to a fence post a few years ago. The owner
had left the tag, so Thomas called him. ``I don't want my dog,'' he
told her, without a note of chagrin. ``That's why he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne A. Shaffer, director of Lefferts Homestead, a museum in
the park, came across a shivering shepherd mix abandoned in the
pouring rain one morning. ``My first response,'' she said, ``was
that I can't get emotional over every one of these dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Records from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation show
that park rangers alone picked up 30 abandoned dogs in Prospect
Park last year, more than they handled in all the other parks in
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx combined. In all
of Queens, half as many were picked up.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney, however, said the total number of dogs abandoned in
Prospect Park is actually far higher. Rangers are usually called in
as a last resort, she said, and many dogs are adopted on the spot
by those who find them. Based on e-mails and other reports she
gathers from the 500 people on FIDO's mailing list, she estimated
that at least 100 dogs a year are abandoned in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many dogs that get dumped _ just get dumped! _ in
the park,'' McInerney said. ``This happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials and dog owners believe there is a simple logic
behind the trend, a logic that springs from the dog-friendly
reputation of Prospect Park and neighboring Park Slope, where some
cafe owners do not blink an eye when a dog settles in under a
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go right there because they know that in that community
they love their dogs,'' said Jude Lassow-Sunden, director of
Muffin's Pet Connection, a Brooklyn organization that assists in
pet adoptions. ``The word gets out _ go to the park, go to the
park. And the people who pick up the dogs, they're all loaded and
they have big hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, himself a dog owner, agreed.
``It's like the old custom of leaving babies in front of hospitals
or orphanages in hopes that the nuns will take care of them,'' he
said, calling the practice ``a weird aspect of metropolitan life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't approve of it,'' he added, ``but we understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned dogs fall into three categories, old and sick,
young and scared, and pit bulls. The odd pure-breed shows up, as do
puppies like Cherub, a floppy-eared mutt rescued two years ago by
Audrey Kindred and her partner, Annie Lanzillotto. ``People are so
good to dogs in this neighborhood,'' Kindred said. ``I almost hate
to say this because you don't want to encourage it, but it's
probably the best place a person could leave their dog.''
</P>
<P>
   On a warm weekend morning, it is not unusual to find hundreds of
dogs romping free in the park as their owners mingle, chat, flirt,
read or romp themselves. Couples have met and married because their
dogs touched noses. Lonely hearts have been known to get dogs just
to join the scene.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this community is FIDO, a group formed 18
months ago to keep the peace between dog owners and everyone else
who uses the park. This has meant making accommodations with bird
lovers, buying extra garbage cans for the park and gently reminding
dog owners of the rules for when and where dogs must be on a leash
during the day. The group, which has a Web site,
www.offleash.com/fido.html, has recently formed a rescue committee
that is drafting a pamphlet on dealing with abandoned dogs. Some
FIDO members hope eventually to form an informal network of foster
families.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It may be, Stern and several FIDO members said, that those who
choose to leave their dogs at Prospect Park do so because they
figure that their pets stand a better chance of survival there than
at the city's pound, the Center for Animal Care and Control, or as
Stern calls it, ``the stop before dog heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the dogs left at Prospect Park, there is a happy
ending. McInerney spent weeks nursing Rocky back to health and
finding him a home. Thomas took the epileptic beagle home, named
him Jammin' _ ``My daughter was very into reggae at the time,'' she
explained _ and soon enough fell in love. ``He's the sweetest
dog,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer was not quite sure what to do with that dripping wet
shepherd. He looked so mean and ugly, she said, and when she
brought him home, her husband's response was, ``Have you lost your
mind?'' At first they called him Sid, as in Sid Vicious, but her
son christened him Wolfie, and they have come to appreciate
Wolfie's charms, although the dog seems to carry some emotional
baggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like going to the park at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many dogs are not as lucky. Some end up at the city's Center
for Animal Care and Control, which euthanized almost 40,000 of the
61,000 dogs, cats and other animals brought to its shelters across
the city last year. Other dogs are hit by cars. Some starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people tell themselves a nice story about what might
happen if they leave their dog in Prospect Park, and sometimes the
story comes true,'' said Jolanta Benal, a free-lance copy editor
who heads FIDO's rescue committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often,'' she said, ``I'm afraid it doesn't come true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Blohm, executive director of the Center for Animal Care
and Control, said it is more humane to bring an unwanted pet to her
agency than to tie a dog to a tree and simply hope for the best.
The center, she noted, placed 14,200 animals last year in other
shelters or homes. And it is much easier to evaluate a dog's health
and temperament if the owner brings it in.
</P>
<P>
   FIDO urges frazzled dog owners to seek help from family,
friends, private rescue groups _ just about anything other than
abandoning their pets in Prospect Park or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately what we'd like people to do is take responsibility
for their dog,'' McInerney said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing worse, she said, than the sight of a shaking,
shivering dog, bewildered and alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very traumatic on these animals. Usually when you
find them, they're panic-stricken, to the point of hysteria. I
mean, wouldn't you be? The only person you've ever trusted, and
they've left you?''

 McCAIN COURTS `REAGAN DEMOCRATS'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ To Lanny Wiles, the scenario seems eerily
familiar. A well-financed Texan, backed by the political
establishment, expects to ride a South Carolina win to the White
House. But here the Texan faces a self-proclaimed outsider, who has
few congressional endorsements but a magnetic style that wins over
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wiles now is seeing this story play out for a second time.
Twenty years ago, he helped guide Ronald Reagan to victory here
against former Texas Governor John Connally. Today, Wiles is a
senior aide by the side of Senator John McCain, helping to run a
Reagan-like strategy against Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very reminiscent of 1980,'' Wiles said, referring to
McCain's reception here. ``I see the same looks in people's faces,
the same quiver of their lips.''
</P>
<P>
   In his message, his story-telling and appeal beyond the
Republican Party, McCain is trying, in many ways, to run as Reagan
redux. McCain's most frequent theme is that he is trying to ``build
bridges'' much the way the former president and California governor
did. Just as Reagan won the presidency with the votes of ``Reagan
Democrats'' and independents, McCain is trying to win here by
taking advantage of rules that allow Democrats and independents to
vote in the GOP primary. McCain is doing all of this with the help
of a cadre of Reaganites that includes the former president's chief
of staff, his California strategist and numerous others.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nearly every Republican invokes Reagan. Bush, the son
of Reagan's vice president, spent much of last week trying to paint
McCain as anything but Reaganesque. The Texas governor, now running
as a ``reformer with results,'' said ``Chairman McCain'' is a
Washington insider who bears a greater resemblance to the two
Democratic candidates for president, Vice President Al Gore and
former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Reagan, John McCain has a long pattern of saying one
thing and doing another,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said. It's
Bush who is like Reagan, Fleischer said, ``when it comes to policy,
when it comes to his vision of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain does have a strong, personal tie to Reagan _ one
that he rarely talks about. When McCain was a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, Reagan, then the governor of California, became one of his
most outspoken advocates. With McCain being one of the best-known
POWs, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, became friendly with McCain's
first wife, Carol, inviting her to dinner and consoling her about
John McCain's absence. When McCain was released in 1973, he and
Carol went to several dinners with the Reagans, where McCain got
some of his inspiration to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain divorced Carol, Nancy Reagan remained close with
her and eventually hired her as director of the White House
visitor's office. Today, while Nancy Reagan is neutral in the
presidential contest, a significant number of Reaganites are
sprinkled through the McCain campaign, especially in South
Carolina, where Reagan made a crucial breakthrough 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is very similar,'' said Richard Quinn, who
worked on the Reagan effort here in tandem with the late Lee
Atwater and now is McCain's chief consultant. ``Absolutely
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins this state's primary, it will likely be because
of the Reaganesque strategy on display at events such as one that
took place last Wednesday night, when McCain appeared before an
audience of 800 people at Clemson University for a taping of
MSNBC-TV's ``Hardball'' show. His aura seemed to transcend policy
differences: He told a pro-abortion rights independent that he was
``pro-life,'' and she said she would support him. He told a
Democratic backer of affirmative action that he opposed the
program, and he said he would vote for McCain because he didn't
support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Molinari, a Massachusetts native who recently registered
to vote in the South Carolina primary, explained in an interview
that she will back McCain even though she told the senator during
the ``Hardball'' show that she was disappointed with his stance on
abortion. Such is her admiration for the former Vietnam prisoner of
war's character and his life story.
</P>
<P>
   This, perhaps more than anything else, is the Reagan in McCain.
His campaign is benefiting, as Reagan did, from voters who
``project'' onto him what they want to see, while looking past the
flaws or the positions they disagree with.
</P>
<P>
   But if moderate voters are assuming that McCain isn't as
conservative as he says he is, they may be in for a surprise. When
a reporter suggested to McCain that many voters seem to assume that
he won't implement some of his most conservative proposals, he got
visibly angry during a bus ride on his ``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If so, we have undermined the basic premise and principle of
what we view as the success of this campaign, which is straight
talk and straight answers,'' McCain said. ``If someone wants to
say, `Gee, he really doesn't mean it,' that's okay with me. I'm
sorry I have given that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, for example, McCain said that if he were governor,
he would seek to ban the practice, ``but I'm not running for
governor.'' McCain was then asked whether that wasn't having it
both ways _ opposing abortion while saying it was up to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that to be viewed as a warm and fuzzy message, frankly
that flies in the face of our experience,'' McCain said, growing
angrier. ``I think the states should decide. For you to distort
that into some other kind of interpretation, very frankly, is a
fanciful kind of attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, while clearly winning over some moderates and liberals
simply with his call for campaign finance overhaul and tobacco
regulation, actually is one of the most conservative members of the
Senate on most other issues. McCain's appeal, however, is more
subtle, something that old Reaganites see: it is the way he hides
his natural loner style with a sunniness, the way he rattles off
one-liners and the way he frames his language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan was very good with people even though he was known as a
loner. McCain is the same way,'' said Ken Duberstein, the former
Reagan chief of staff who is now a top McCain adviser. ``One of the
reasons why I was attracted to John McCain is that I saw a lot of
Reagan in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Khachigian, Reagan's chief speechwriter in 1980 and now
McCain's top California strategist, said Reagan and McCain both
benefit from their celebrity status, Reagan as an actor and
governor, McCain as a POW and senator. ``It's an accident of
history'' that the similarities exist, Khachigian said. ``But in my
own mind, it's constantly there.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is there in McCain's central campaign theme and
imagery _ when he inveighs against the ``Iron Triangle'' of
Washington big money, special interests and legislation he seems
almost to echo Reagan's thunder against the ``buddy system'' in
Washington of lobbyists and big business.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's ``theme,'' Khachigian said, ``is very much the same as
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, to be sure, has plenty of Reagan hands on board, including
former Secretary of State George Schultz. But some key Reaganites
have remained neutral, including Colin Powell, the national
security adviser under Reagan and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff under former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to suggest that McCain is a Reagan clone. Reagan
promoted huge tax cuts that may be more similar to the Bush plan
than McCain, who decries any plan that cuts taxes too much for the
wealthy. McCain's biggest challenge may be that the times are
different; Reagan ran during economic turmoil, while McCain is
campaigning amidst prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the end, the GOP race may hinge less on which candidate
is more like Reagan than which one has the better sense of South
Carolina political history _ and Reagan's place in it.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the Bush campaign has recited the story of how
former President Bush in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 relied on South
Carolina as an establishment-built ``firewall'' that would protect
them from a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary. But such theorizing ignores the 1980 race, when the
establishment was turned on its head by Reagan. It is this strategy
that McCain is following.
</P>
<P>
   Connally, with $10 million of his own money, was so
well-financed when he launched his campaign that many thought him
unbeatable, just as Bush's $70 million warchest once made him seem
invincible. Connally had many endorsements, including the backing
of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who now supports Bush.
Reagan, meanwhile, came to South Carolina fresh from a stunning New
Hampshire victory, just like McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Many forget, Wiles said, ``that Reagan was endorsed by only 14
members of Congress. We were the outsiders, we ran the insurgency
campaign.'' Indeed, Wiles notes, the strategy was partly designed
to defeat not just Connolly but Bush's father, a symbol of the
establishment who lost his 1980 race to Reagan. Now, Wiles and the
other old Reagan hands hope, the same strategy can work once
against another Bush.

SPAIN'S IMMIGRANT WORKERS, BOTH NEEDED AND RESENTED, ARE NOW
ATTACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALAGA, Spain _ The sun-drenched shores of southern Spain have
long been overrun by foreigners. But seldom, until a few days ago,
has the line been so sharply drawn between those who are welcome
and those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   This week, this region better known for its sparkling white
villages and beaches and lineup of hotels became the site of modern
Spain's ugliest anti-immigrant violence.
</P>
<P>
   For almost three days, several southeastern towns were
overwhelmed by mobs of residents chasing Moroccan and other African
immigrants through the streets, shouting racist slogans, wielding
bars and sticks, and trashing foreign laborers' cars and shops. By
the time the riot police stopped the rampage, Moroccan farm workers
said, hundreds of them had been beaten by angry Spaniards and seen
scores of their shanties set afire. Many immigrants fled to nearby
hills.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst, though unusual here, abruptly added this corner of
Spain to the list of European regions where new and large-scale
immigration is fueling resentment and xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish politicians across the spectrum immediately condemned
the incidents. Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, describing them
as racist, said they were ``a total and absolute embarrassment''
for Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence has also underscored a more intractable issue:
as Spain's economy prospers, its demand for unskilled labor is
rising apace with resistance to integrating the laborers, most of
them North African.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must think about how we need to change in a pluralist
society where every day we will need more immigrants to take our
country forward,'' Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said on state
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Such a comment was once unthinkable in a country that, far from
pluralist, has been highly homogenous since it expelled its Jews
and Arabs in the late Middle Ages. Since then Spain has mostly
exported its own people, first to its Latin American colonies and,
this century, to northern Europe. That trend was reversed only two
decades ago, as Spain joined the European Union and its economy
began to boom. But even now, only 2 percent of Spain's population
is foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Costa del Sol, the villages hit by violence this
week are in effect an anomaly. Much of this coast is studded with
villas, apartments and hotel chains used by well-to-do northern
Europeans. But east of Malaga, the flatlands around Almeria have
grown rich from intensive agriculture _ made possible by increasing
numbers of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 hothouses have sprung up to supply much of
Europe with winter fruits and vegetables. A floating population of
perhaps as many as 100,000 laborers, most Moroccan, pick the
tomatoes, strawberries and eggplants or move with the seasons to
harvest olives and oranges around Andalusia. Many have crossed the
Mediterranean in rickety boats to make about $25 a day. The wage
may be miserable in Europe, but it is about four times what the
farmhands can make at home.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in some of the Almeria villages, as many as 25
percent of the people are now poor foreign migrant workers, the
highest concentration anywhere in Spain. Many are clandestine
migrants who live in hovels, without light or water.
</P>
<P>
   For example in El Ejido, the center of the violence, more than
10,000 of the 45,000 residents are legal and illegal foreign
workers, city officials say. According to an official report
released this week, almost 60 percent of El Ejido's immigrant
population live in slum conditions, more than half without running
water.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began here last Saturday, after the funeral of a
Spanish woman who had been robbed and murdered. A Moroccan
immigrant was arrested in the case, and unrest quickly spread
throughout the farming district, whose residents were already angry
about the killings of two Spanish workers two weeks earlier,
allegedly in a fight with Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, who had evidently planned their revenge, blocked off
roads with barricades of burning tires to delay police officers and
television crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came with sticks and bars,'' said Kamal Rajmuni, a
Moroccan community organizer in El Ejido. ``They always treat us
like dirt, but this time they behaved like Nazis. Many people had
to run for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said bands of Spanish men, many of them young,
screamed, ``Out with the Moors!'' as they threw stones at the
foreigners. Several Moroccan teahouses and two makeshift mosques
were destroyed, and firebombs were thrown at immigrant shanties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was resentment, but we had never seen this much
hatred,'' said Abdel Hamid Beyuki, who heads the Moroccan Workers
Association. ``We are all very shaken. Some people are still hiding
in the hills. A lot of us aren't sleeping at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence shocked many Spaniards as well. People in this
country had long been used to reports of terrorist acts by Basque
separatists in the north. But they had never before seen television
images of immigrant hovels burning or small stores destroyed in
Andalusia.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and human rights groups in Madrid have demanded to
know why it took the reinforcements of 600 riot police officers
almost three days to stop the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Blame has been passed around. Officials in El Ejido say young
men from other towns arrived on the day of the funeral, supposedly
mobilized by a neo-Nazi Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Barbera, a landowner near Roquetas de Mar, says
politicians are largely to blame for the growing tensions because
of lax immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' he said, ``around here we have work for
15,000 foreign pickers, but we have almost 30,000 and they have no
place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidents this week, which have led to the arrest of 55
people, has intensified the debate in Madrid over a new immigration
law approved by Parliament late last month. The law will allow more
than 70,000 illegal immigrants in Spain to become eligible for
residence permits and to bring their dependents over.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right government says that if it wins a majority in
the general elections in March, it will tighten the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Around Almeria this week, many farmers said they were losing
tens of thousands of dollars as vegetables go unpicked. Many
Moroccan laborers have gone on strike, and large numbers of illegal
workers are still said to be in hiding for fear of being expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Beyuki, one of the strike leaders, said the workers were
demanding equal labor rights, adequate housing, and compensation
for ruined cars and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he said, ``we want the Spanish labor unions to take
up our cause. As far as Moroccan workers are concerned, the unions
here seem to be in a coma.''

<P>
   Some 35 years after the era of free love, we're awash in sexual
imagery. But instead of being liberated, we seem at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Drop into any bookstore and look at its Valentine Day's exhibit.
There will be the usual books on how to have a romantic getaway or
dinner, but probably more than half will have titles like ``How to
Give Her Absolute Pleasure,'' ``101 Nights of Grrreat Sex,''
``Extraordinary Togetherness: A Woman's Guide to Love, Sex and
Intimacy,'' ``Complete Guide to Sexual Fulfillment,'' ``The Magic
of Sex,'' ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Amazing Sex,'' ``Great
Sex Guide'' ``The Ultimate Sex Book'' ...
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture _ and literally, since many of these books
are filled with real models posed in sexual positions and fairly
explicit illustrations. But does a culture where sex sells
everything (including Uncle Ben's rice) really need an idiot-proof
guide to the art and science of lovemaking in the same terms as
tiling the floor?
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the fact every generation learns about sex, thinks
it's comfortable with it and believes it is going to transmit that
comfort to its children, it never quite works that way,'' said Anne
Hooper, a British sex therapist and prolific author of sex books,
including the pocket-size ``Great Sex Guide'' (DK Publishing;
$14.95). ``Each generation has to discover what happens or doesn't
happen during sex for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you think this is some aberration, there is even a
``Reader's Digest Guide to Love &AMP; Sex,'' complete with graphic
illustrations, shots of sex toys, models posed in fantasy positions
_ including bondage _ and a sex and technology chapter. Call it the
Farmer's Almanac of sex books. &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   A bus bench beckons, ``Sit here and get lucky.'' No, there isn't
any special device involved (we don't think). It's just a teasing
way to market Lucky Brand jeans, which are shown on the sign with
the fly provocatively unbuttoned. Lane Bryant, a store for
plus-size women, has a large photo in its window of a model in a
pink lace bra. ``Sexy intimates,'' it says, ``sensual, lacy, pink,
seductive, erotic, arousing.'' &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sex, we're bombarded with mixed messages.
Listen to a pro football game (that macho sport). Recent radio
broadcasts had ads that illustrated these contradictions. One
condom commercial has a businessman whose rendezvous with a
co-worker who wants to check out his ``laptop'' is made a success
with the aid of Trojan Man. The other features a self-confident
businessman who wilts when his wife calls to suggest an intimate
evening. An announcer then comes on to assure him that there is
help for his sexual dysfunction problems. So we're either hot to
trot or paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Couple this with the fact that movies, television and other mass
media further feed a sexual inferiority complex by perpetuating
stereotypes that men and women must be large in certain areas,
small in others and, always, beautiful to have fantastic sex. Aside
from Dennis Franz, who bared his doughy behind on ABC's ``NYPD
Blue,'' there's very little flab, back hair, pimples, awkward
movements or anything even remotely unattractive in mass-media sex.
</P>
<P>
   That fuels a sexual grass-is-greener syndrome in many couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking for more,'' said Linda Fazio, a professor
and expert in sexual dysfunction at the University of Southern
California. ``I think most people aren't very happy with their
results. They believe even if they are having a satisfying
relationship, someone else is having something better.'' &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   When Bob Dole, senator and presidential candidate, retired from
public office, he did his first commercial endorsement. What did he
choose to sell? Viagra. Four words: Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue. Female athletes have been baring it all to promote
themselves and their sports outside their usual fan base, from nude
calendars and print ads to boxer Mia St. John's well-publicized
Playboy appearance. Most people agree that when U.S. women's soccer
star Brandy Chastain ripped off her jersey after the winning point
it was a spontaneous act, but it nevertheless made her famous. She
has since appeared in a TV commercial showing her beating two men
at a game of foosball, and they wait for her to celebrate in the
same way. &QL; 
_____
</P>
<P>
   Couple all this with a collective cultural cold shower courtesy
of unprecedented stress in modern life, and it's little wonder the
Western world's birthrate is in decline. We've lost that lovin'
feelin'.

BOBBY VALENTINE'S MAGICAL RIDE IN '99 MIGHT BE HIS LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The wonder, as Bobby Valentine convenes the
New York Mets for spring training Monday, is that nobody will be
hollering out the traditional warning that accompanies a condemned
man on the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead man walking!''
</P>
<P>
   If ever a major-league manager was being set up to be fired,
Valentine is that man. He will start the 2000 season without a
contract beyond this year. This, despite the fact that he not only
ushered the Mets into the playoffs as the wild-card team last year,
but his team easily played the most entertaining games of
postseason play before bowing out in a thrilling six-game series
with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we saw Valentine, you might recall, he was
standing on the top step of the visiting dugout at Turner Field
last October, mouthing the words, ``Oh no!'' as Kenny Rogers forced
home the losing run with a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the
11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd played all year with our defense as one of our real
strengths,'' Valentine said the other morning over coffee, just the
20th day he had spent at home in Texas in the entire off-season
``when that whole inning started to develop, and now we've got the
bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th with one out. I just wanted
the ball to be hit. If the ball is hit, we do something cool,
something good would happen. I just felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what `Oh no!' was about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also about a magical ride finally coming to an end. No
team played on the brink more than the Mets did for a month from
the middle of September to the middle of October.
</P>
<P>
   In their final two weeks of the 1999 season, seven times the
Mets took the field knowing that a loss would send them home. Six
times they won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fabulous season, but it was distorted,'' Valentine
said. ``Things went well in that season more than any season I've
ever experienced except for 14 games. And those were two seven-game
losing streaks. The rest of the time, we were like 35 games over
.500.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but those two losing streaks were killers. The first came at
the end of May and cost Valentine three of his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 48 games of the season, we were maybe the best
team in baseball,'' Valentine noted. ``Then we lose five in a row
heading into the Yankees' series, which is whole 'nother world, not
to be confused with anything else in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose the first one to the Yankees to make it six, and the
second to make it seven. That dropped us to a game under .500. We
snapped out of it and pretty much had it in cruise control the rest
of the season. Well, almost the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by that time, Valentine had personally revived the
funny-nose-and-glasses industry. In one of the most bizarre moments
of the season, Valentine was ejected from a game and then was
caught on camera when he reappeared in the dugout wearing a fake
mustache, sunglasses and a non-Mets cap.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Valentine was ejected after the home-plate
umpire called catcher's interference on Mike Piazza. On a pitchout.
When the batter didn't swing.
</P>
<P>
   Calmly leaving the field, Valentine sees that the players in the
dugout and in the clubhouse sitting around with the glassy,
zombie-like stare that managers know all too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, managers all know when everyone has that blank stare,
you've got to do something to get the blank stare out. Sometimes
it's yelling, throwing, that stuff. I walked into the trainer's
room and they have the eye-patch stuff and I'm wondering what I'm
going to do, so I grab some of it and put it on, like a mustache,
and I turned around and Robin Ventura looked at it and says, `I
like it,' and smiled. `You should grow one.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I straightened it up a little and said, `I'm going out to the
dugout to see what the guys think.' He says, `Before you go out,
put these on,' and he gives me the glasses and the hat. So, I put
them on and stroll out to the dugout, and John Olerud sees me and
laughs. I'm thinking, `That's what the doctor ordered,' and our
guys come into the dugout that inning and score a run and we win.
And like an idiot, I run out onto the field with the stuff on.''
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. The umps and players giggled, but when the clip of
a disguised Valentine showed up on ESPN late that night, Bobby knew
he was in trouble. Again, he narrowly missed being fired for the
second time in a week. The National League suspended him for two
games and fined him $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were fortunate that they didn't give him the ax. The
team straightened out and played well until, with 13 games
remaining in the season, the second seven-game losing streak hit
and the Mets went from having a lock on a playoff spot to fighting
for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With three games to play, the Mets trailed the Reds by two, but
New York won two of its last three while Cincinnati was losing two
of three, forcing a one-game wild-card playoff. The Mets won.
</P>
<P>
   They upset Arizona in the first round of the playoffs before
losing three consecutive to the Braves to start the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Then they won Game 4 in New York and in one of the most dramatic
postseason games in baseball history, beat the Braves and John
Rocker to also capture Game 5, setting up ``Oh no!'' in Atlanta in
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   In that one, Mets starter Al Leiter gave up five runs before
there was a single out in the first inning, but again they came
back, only to watch their two best relievers, John Franco and
Armando Benitez, cough up one-run leads in the eighth and 10th
innings, and Rogers walk home the winning run in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Mets had become lovable again. In Valentine's
three years in New York, he has helped the franchise develop
talent, establish a fan base, regain credibility, battle the
crosstown Yankees for headlines and make the playoffs. Yet, he
remains unappreciated by Mets ownership, which declined to offer
him a contract extension after last season. Let another seven-game
losing streak come along early this season and he's probably gone.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Why does an energetic, successful
businessman like Valentine _ he'll launch his own Internet company
within a few weeks _ put up with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a love of the game,'' Valentine said, ``but I also feel
that I'm very good at it and that's why I continue to do it. People
always gravitate to the thing they do best and enjoy doing. It's
comfortable, even though it's not a comfortable job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those things where you drive home at night and
forget about it and be glad that bread's on the table. It's
constantly churning and eating at you, and after three years in New
York and going through what we've done, there's still a question in
my mind: What's going on? Why am I doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   He is driven, of course. To win a World Series, to prove the
critics wrong, to show the world that he is, after all, a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of it happening with the Mets, however, are remote
at best.
</P>
<P>
   He might as well show up for the first day of spring training
workouts with a sign around his neck:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with funny-nose-and-glasses, of course.

   GROZNY, Russia _ Russian soldiers did not capture Grozny. They
obliterated it.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment houses along Lenin Prospekt have been pulverized.
Minutka Square, once a bustling plaza, has been blasted beyond
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find a single structure in the city center that
has not been wrecked by a bomb, damaged by artillery or raked by
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russian forces seized the city last week, a steady trickle
of refugees has returned to Grozny to try to rebuild their lives.
But the damage is so forbidding that some have thrown up their
hands in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is left,'' said Aminat Gazimagomedova, who returned to
Chechnya on Friday from Dagestan, a neighboring Russian republic.
After inspecting her damaged home, the 45-year-old Grozny native
turned away and began to trudge out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny is now Chechnya's capital in name only. Russia's acting
president, Vladimir Putin, announced with fanfare on Sunday that
Russian forces had finally taken the city from rebels. What he did
not say was what the government planned to do with the ruined city
and traumatized population.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers here say there is not much to decide. The city,
they say, is simply beyond repair. ``It would be better to build a
new city,'' said Col. Nikolai Zaitsev, an Interior Ministry officer
who oversees many of the numerous checkpoints here.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny was one of the largest cities in the north Caucasus, with
300,000 people living here at the end of the 1980s. The city
endured the previous war, of 1994-96, and somehow life went on.
</P>
<P>
   When Russian troops and secessionist militants went to war again
last year, many of the elderly, especially ethnic Russians, stayed
in the city because they were afraid to lose their homes, which
were nearly all the property many of them had.
</P>
<P>
   But the pummeling of the city over several months was worse than
even the hardiest residents expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a war,'' said Nadezhda Shchelchkova, 73, who
lived in a basement in the Zavodskoi district for months, Russian
soldiers and Chechen rebels battled overhead. ``It was like some
sort of strange tornado came and wiped everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   Grozny can now be described in terms of military weaponry, not
architecture. The gaping holes in apartment complexes are classic
signs of artillery. Mounds of rubble are remnants of large
buildings collapsed by bombs. Gashes in the city streets, which
have disemboweled the city's underground utilities and pushed
severed gas and water pipes toward the sky, seem to be the work of
surface-to-surface missiles. Monuments have been blown off their
pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny looks more like Stalingrad after World War II or Guernica
after the Spanish Civil War. There are hardly any residents on the
streets, but Russian officials say that thousands, perhaps tens of
thousands, remain.
</P>
<P>
   Zavodskoi, a large industrial district, was an eerie wasteland
on Friday. The Interior Ministry colonel who administers the area
and who gave his name only as Alexander, said tens of thousands of
people used to live here. Only 150 residents have registered with
the Russian authorities since they occupied the district a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of residents is considerably higher. Many men
are afraid to leave their basements, fearing that the Russians will
suspect them of being rebels and throw them into detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be reason for their concern. The jail at
Chernokozovo in northern Chechnya is packed with 1,000 prisoners,
local residents said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian armored personnel carriers rumbled through Zavodskoi's
streets carrying triumphant soldiers who pumped their fists in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Zavodskoi is still not quiet. Several shots rang out Friday
afternoon, prompting Alexander to usher a small group of reporters
away from the street. He estimated that 20 snipers and rebels with
machine-guns were still active in this part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Shchelchkova trudged through the streets anyway. She had to. She
was out of water, and the pipe near the militia office is the only
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``My apartment house was bombed about a month ago,'' she said.
``The entire district was burned down. Now 26 of us live in the
cellar with the rats. We melted snow to get water, and I won't tell
what we eat. The militants searched all our apartments, took all of
my money and stole all of our food.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been glad when the Russian troops finally
arrived in her neighborhood in the middle of last week. But she
plans to leave Grozny as soon as she finds a way to join her son, a
television repairman living in another part of southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The situation near Minutka Square was even worse. In Soviet
times, it was a busy crossroads with a bus station and train stop
and a traffic circle. But the plaza became a symbol of rebel
resistance in recent weeks. Russian forces battled their way to
Minutka Square block by block and sometimes yard by yard.
</P>
<P>
   A glance around the square indicates how the Russians won. They
leveled all the surrounding buildings that snipers were using and
turned the square into a dusty void.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday two young Russian soldiers idly monitored the square
that dozens, if not hundreds, had died for. A few women sold
bottles of syrupy soft drinks. A trickle of residents wandered by.
Some had come to pick through the ruins of their homes and salvage
what they could. Judging from the small sacks they were carrying,
it was not much.
</P>
<P>
   Khalimat, 45, was in tears. She was prowling the streets trying
to find her 27-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away, Bakhurtdin Dagiyalov, 42, was debating what
to do. He is blind and used to live in a house for the visually
impaired just a few blocks from Minutka Square.
</P>
<P>
   As the fighting escalated, he left in November for his sister's
home in Dagestan. It is not the most hospitable place for refugees
from Chechnya, and Dagiyalov and his sister arrived in Grozny on
Friday to learn whether the house for the blind was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   It was, and Dagiyalov listened patiently as his sister described
the ravaged neighborhood before he agreed to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war,'' he said softly, ``was much more horrible than the
first one.''

ZIMBABWE CONSTITUTION VOTE IS SHOWDOWN FOR MUGABE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Citizens in this economically struggling
nation go the polls this weekend for what is in fact, if not in
name, a referendum on the only leader Zimbabwe has known, President
Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the 5 million voters projected to go to the polls
will be voting on a new constitution, and the government has been
pushing hard for a ``yes'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say the document would only solidify the
president's power and, with its provisions for seizing white
farmers' land without compensation, erode Zimbabwe's already
diminished standing in eyes of foreign investors and donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need now is a much better image abroad to encourage
investment and confidence in our country,'' said Jerry Grant,
deputy director of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents
4,000 farmers, most of them white.
</P>
<P>
   Even the National Constitutional Assembly, a civic organization
started a few years ago by people who wanted the country to replace
the constitution adopted just before independence from Britain in
1980, is urging rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown occurs at a crucial time for Mugabe and his
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, which holds
all but a few seats in Parliament but is most likely to face a
fierce challenge from a new opposition party when parliamentary
elections are held in April.
</P>
<P>
   The new party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has been
attracting support across much of the country. A strong turnout
against the constitution this weekend could propel the party to a
strong showing in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a vote of confidence or no confidence in
Mugabe and in the government,'' the party president, Morgan
Tsvangirai, said. ``If a lot of people turn out and vote no, it's
an indication of things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the economy has been staggering toward a total
collapse. Inflation has soared to more to more than 60 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe dollar has declined dramatically against the U.S.
dollar, from 12.11 in 1997 to 38.2 at the end of 1999. Fuel and
electricity shortages have plagued the country for weeks, set off
by mounting back bills to suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   And the International Monetary Fund has cut off its credit after
it had found Zimbabwe was underreporting its considerable
contributions to the war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents say they are most angered by what they call the
blatant disregard for the opinions of the many citizens who were
consulted by the constitutional commission that came up with the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal does nothing to limit the powers of the presidency,
a change that was widely advocated by many who said they favored
making the presidency a ceremonial post, with a prime minister
answerable to an elected parliament as the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the proposal change the parliamentary voting system,
which opponents say makes it all but impossible for new parties to
crack the grip of the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   What it would do _ and what has outraged the small but vocal
white minority _ is give the government the right to seize
white-owned farmland without paying for it. Added to the draft a
few weeks ago, the provision is widely seen a crude bit of racial
politicking in a country where land reform has been a painful and
persistent issue since independence.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa told voters on state
television Friday that if they approved the constitutional
revisions they would be more likely to receive land, The Associated
Press reported. Mnangagwa said the transfer of white-owned land to
landless blacks had been hindered by guarantees in the old
constitution that handovers involved compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Constitutional Assembly is hoping its campaign can
keep that clause and the rest of the proposed constitution from
taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the assembly headquarters Friday, volunteers wearing ``Vote
No'' T-shirts hurried about, unpacking fliers and handbills and
scrambling to assemble teams to monitor polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a frantic, chaotic effort, and not entirely by
choice, opponents of the new constitution said. Only Friday
morning, they pointed out, the government published an official
list of polling stations. Only then could the assembly apply for
accreditation for its observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy with the process,'' Lovemore Madhuku, a
lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe and the vice chairman of the
assembly, said. ``Everything has been completely upside down.''

ALASKA AIRLINES CANCELS 12 FLIGHTS TO INSPECT PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alaska Airlines canceled 12 flights Friday to
complete additional inspections of the mechanism that moves the
horizontal stabilizer on Boeing MD-80 series jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the airline, a unit
of the Alaska Air Group in Seattle, and other domestic airlines to
inspect a variety of components in the stabilizer's assembly,
including the jackscrew, on MD-80 and similar jets.
</P>
<P>
   Metal shavings were found on the jackscrew of an Alaska Airlines
MD-83 that crashed last week and on two other Alaska jets. The crew
of the MD-83 had reported a stabilizer problem before the plane
crashed off California, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   No other airlines reported finding any obvious damage with the
parts in the inspections completed by this evening, and no other
schedule disruptions were necessary, airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said it had canceled a total of 13 flights
Wednesday and Thursday while it completed voluntary inspections and
an additional 12 flights Friday for the mandated inspections.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways has completed inspections on 38 of 65 MD-80 and DC-9
aircraft, and has found no problems with the tail assemblies, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Checks of 106 MD-80 jets by American Airlines found ``no
discrepancies'' in components of the stabilizer motor assembly, the
airline said.

BRITAIN REASSERTS DIRECT RULE ON NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Despite a last-minute pledge by the IRA to eventually
put its weapons ``beyond use,'' Britain on Friday suspended the
power-sharing government here, just 72 days after it was
inaugurated as the foundation of a new, egalitarian and peaceful
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   British Secretary of State Peter Mandelson said he reluctantly
signed the papers which restored direct rule from London because
the Irish Republican Army had not committed itself to disarming. He
said he wanted to avert a walkout by Ulster Unionists over the
weapons stalemate that would have collapsed the Belfast assembly
and made it more difficult to start up again.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandelson's decision touched off a political firestorm, as
Irish nationalists of all persuasions, and even some Irish
government officials, accused him of acting precipitously.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government, Britain's partner in the peace process,
was opposed to the suspension, according to senior officials in
Dublin, believing that the IRA's commitment given Friday to the
international commission in charge of overseeing disarmament was
enough to break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain,
Friday night said the IRA's commitment ``holds out the real
prospect of an agreement which would enable it to fulfill the
substance of its mandate,'' meaning that it would rid itself of
weapons by May.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's representative to the commission, which sources
identify as Brian Keenan, a member of the IRA's seven-member ruling
Army Council, met with the commission Friday afternoon in a
last-ditch effort to avoid the government's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The representative indicated to us today the context in which
the IRA will initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond
use, in a manner as to ensure maximum public confidence,'' the
commission said in a report delivered Friday night to the British
and Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
   It was telling that Irish officials were leaking the report
before their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose party is close to the IRA,
accused Mandelson of ignoring the last-minute offer by the IRA to
``set out the context in which it will deal with the issue of
arms.'' Adams said Mandelson had needlessly thrown the peace
process into crisis by caving into threats by the Ulster Unionists
that they would pull out of the assembly unless it was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson, however, insisted none of the 11th-hour diplomacy by
the British or Irish governments, nor the phone calls to all the
parties made by President Clinton, had produced the kind of
breakthrough which Adams said was at hand. Mandelson also
questioned the timing of the IRA pledge, saying it came after the
republican movement knew he had to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no alternative,'' Mandelson said. ``I could not allow
this to stagger on. Confidence in the executive and the
institutions ran out. A line had to be drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson acknowledged there had been progress by the IRA, but
not enough to avert the suspension that puts the local government,
and cross-border authorities that give the Irish government a say
in the affairs of Northern Ireland, into mothballs. While the
political institutions are put on hold, the release of paramilitary
prisoners and the reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was furious with Mandelson, accusing him of snubbing the
IRA's concession. Adams said he did not know if the IRA offer would
now remain on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which created the political
institutions that were suspended Friday, called on paramilitary
groups to disarm by this May, but set no date for when that process
should begin.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ulster Unionists were demanding an actual handover of
weapons, the British and Irish governments were willing to accept a
public statement from the IRA committing itself to disarming at
some stage. But while the IRA had said it was committed to
resolving the dispute over weapons, it would not do so on terms set
unilaterally by the unionists or British government. Friday's
pledge suggested the IRA would not turn over weapons, but destroy
them or provide evidence of them being put ``beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of Mandelson's action is to strip away from
locally elected politicians the power to run schools and hospitals
and set policy for agriculture and industry, and return the
responsibilities for governing Northern Ireland to unelected
British bureaucrats who have administered local government, with
one brief hiatus, since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes, even hardline unionists opposed to
the power-sharing assembly because of Sinn Fein's inclusion, had
enthusiastically taken back the reins of power, throwing themselves
into the mundane day-to-day business of governing. But that sense
of empowerment, and the optimism it had generated here and
internationally, was not enough to bridge the yawning gap between
Protestant unionists and Catholic republicans over what to do with
the IRA's hidden arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said the suspension of the
local government he heads was unfortunate but inevitable in the
absence of a commitment from the IRA to disarm. He had persuaded
his party to drop its refusal to sit in a Cabinet that included two
Sinn Fein ministers with the expectation that the IRA would make a
gesture on arms by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take any pleasure from this. I'm sad that it's been
necessary to suspend. But peace and private armies cannot
co-exist,'' said Trimble, whose ruling party council was to meet
Saturday. It was that meeting, and the prospect of Trimble
resigning, that led Mandelson to act Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said he was hopeful the suspension would be brief, even
shorter than the nearly five months it took George Mitchell, the
former senator from Maine, to choreograph an elaborate compromise
last November which put the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
   There will be another review while the power-sharing government
is put in mothballs, but Mitchell has ruled himself out as being
the mediator again to save the Good Friday Agreement which he
presided over in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Britain believes that if Trimble resigns, he will be replaced by
more hardline unionist elements who are more reluctant to share
power with Catholic nationalists or countenance the cross-border
authorities that give the Irish government a say in the affairs of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government, however, believes Britain's siding with
the unionists on ordering the suspension will make the IRA less
likely to disarm, and falls outside the terms of the Good Friday
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, where most of the 3,600 victims of the 30-year
conflict have died, ordinary people were less despondent than the
politicians, hoping that the suspension of the power-sharing
government will prove to be just another of the temporary setbacks
to befall the peace process since the IRA called the first of two
cease-fires in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, but I'm used to it by now,'' said Barry
McHugh, 44, a restaurant manager. ``There's been crisis after
crisis, and they've always found a way to move forward. I just hope
they can do so again.''

CANADA'S 2 TOP NEWSPRINT PRODUCERS AGREE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's largest
newsprint producer, announced Friday that it was merging with
Donohue Inc., its biggest Canadian rival, creating a company that
can supply more than a third of North American demand.
</P>
<P>
   In a transaction worth 5.8 billion Canadian dollars (about $4
billion), Abitibi will pay 42 Canadian dollars in cash and stock
for each Donohue share, with about a quarter of the price in cash.
Quebecor of Montreal, which is the world's largest commercial
printing company and has media holdings in Canada, has agreed to
sell its 63 percent stake in Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Donohue, the smaller but more successful of the
two newsprint producers, will own 55 percent of the merged venture.
Donohue is based in Quebec City and Abitibi in Montreal, where the
company's head office will be.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Abitibi, which has been losing money, has done
well to hook up with North America's lowest-cost producer. With the
further elimination of Abitibi's high-cost mills, and merger
savings estimated at 250 million Canadian dollars a year, the new
company will be ``the low-cost global producer of newsprint,'' said
Abitibi's president and chief executive, John Weaver, at a press
conference in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver will be chief executive of the company, and Michel
Desbiens, president and chief executive of Donohue, will be
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the merger will be a heavy load of debt. The ratio
of debt to total capital will be about 63 percent for the new
company, compared to 44 percent for Abitibi now, said Dominion Bond
Rating Service of Toronto. ``That leverage is fairly high for a
company in a mature industry,'' said Catherine Payne, a DBRS
analyst.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Donohue shares rose over the last 10 days on rumors of a merger,
and traded at a 52-week high of 37.50 Canadian dollars on the
Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday. Abitibi's shares were also
active Thursday, gaining 95 Canadian cents to 17.95 dollars, before
the exchange halted trading in both stocks pending an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   When trading resumed after news of the merger Friday, Donohue
lost 1.55 dollars to close at 35.75 dollars, and Abitibi was down 3
dollars to 14.95 dollars. Class B shares of Quebecor gained 25
Canadian cents to close at 58 dollars, as investors expect the
company to sell its Abitibi stock and get better returns investing
in electronic and print media.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in Quebecor's objectives brought the two newsprint
companies together. Under its founder, Pierre Peladeau, Quebecor
was vertically integrated _ from making paper to commercial
printing and publishing. After his death in 1997, his two sons,
Pierre Karl and Erik, bought the Sun Media newspaper chain, along
with its popular Canoe Web site, and have been looking for ways to
raise money for more media acquisitions. The Toronto Sun is the
chain's flagship.
</P>
<P>
   Although Abitibi ranks as the world's largest producer of
newsprint, it has been unprofitable, losing 65 million dollars on
sales of 4 billion dollars last year. Donohue has efficiently
integrated lumber and paper operations. In the first nine months of
1999, it made a profit of 131 million dollars on sales of 1.8
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have a capacity of 6.4 million metric
tons of newsprint a year in 25 mills in Canada, the United States,
Britain and Asia. Two Scandinavian competitors have about 4 million
tons of capacity, followed by Bowater of Greenville, S.C., with
about three million tons.
</P>
<P>
   Abitibi has been cutting costs, mainly by shutting down
high-cost mills and raising newsprint prices, trying to get into
the black. After eliminating 450,000 tons of capacity last year, it
will shed another 515,000 tons _ 8 percent _ over the next 18
months. Industry analysts said other producers, notably Bowater,
will also have to cut capacity if price increases initiated by
Abitibi are to stick.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, the company said it would raise prices on
April l by $50 _ almost 10 percent _ to $565 a metric ton. That
follows a comparable increase last October to $515 a metric ton,
though large newspaper chains in the United States and Canada have
been buying at slightly lower prices in recent months. Newsprint
sold for as much as $760 a metric ton in 1995 before declining in
the economic downturn in Asia.

STOCK PRICES GO MORE THAN 11 PERCENT BELOW THEIR PEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average falling more than 200 points as technology
stocks _ which had been setting records _ joined in a decline that
had been affecting most other industries for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which was down 218.42 points, or 2.1 percent, to
10,425.21, has now fallen 11.1 percent since it set a record of
11,722.98 on Jan. 14. That is the fastest 10 percent correction
from a peak for the market's most widely followed indicator since
1955. The index was down 4.9 percent for the week, its worst weekly
performance since last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology
stocks that until Friday had been rising rapidly, also fell 2
percent Friday, or 90.18 points, to 4,395.45. Microsoft fell $6.06,
to $99.94, on worries that its Windows 2000 operating system, which
is to begin shipping next week, will not sell well. The Nasdaq
composite had set a new high on Thursday, and ended the week with a
3.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which has more technology
stocks than the Dow but fewer than the Nasdaq, was down 2.6 percent
for the week after dropping 2.1 percent Friday, or 29.71 points, to
1,387.12.
</P>
<P>
   The price decline Friday followed a government report that
retail sales in January were up only 0.3 percent from December's
torrid pace, and were down if automobile sales are excluded. That
could be evidence that the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the
economy through higher interest rates are beginning to have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's drop came after the Gartner Group, a research
organization, warned that corporations should delay buying Windows
2000 because some existing software is incompatible with it and
after Michael Dell, the chairman of Dell Computer Corp., said he
had seen limited interest in the product from Dell's corporate
customers. Dell, which reported a small gain in profits after the
market closed Thursday, was down $1.92, to $36.875.
</P>
<P>
   While technology stocks have been very strong until Friday, many
economically sensitive stocks have been weak, and that continued
Friday. An index of such stocks, the Morgan Stanley cyclical index,
fell 2.7 percent Friday and is now down 20.3 percent since early
January. Big losers included Caterpillar, off $2.31, to $35.75, and
CSX, a major railroad, down $1.50, to $21.50.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm,
said that Friday's falls were not caused by heavy selling pressure,
but that ``there was a lack of buying interest'' in most stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market advanced, with interest rates falling as some
investors sought out the relative safety of Treasury securities.
The yield on 30-year Treasuries fell to 6.26 percent from 6.32
percent on Thursday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose
24/32, to 99 26/32.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the decline in many technology stocks, the
market for initial public offerings remained very hot. WebMethods,
a writer of software for Internet applications, soared to $212.625,
more than six times its initial offering price of $35.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 19 trading sessions for the Dow to fall from a peak
to a 10 percent decline, the traditional definition of a market
correction. That is the second-fastest fall from a peak ever,
Birinyi said. In 1955, it took just 12 trading days for a
correction that was set off when President Dwight D. Eisenhower
suffered a heart attack. He recovered, and so did the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted
that long-term interest rates have declined since Jan. 14, even
while the Dow was suffering its correction. Falling rates are
normally good for stocks, he noted, saying that the decline was
evidence that stock prices had been very high before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which spent most of the 1990s rising steadily,
went from 1991 to 1997 without a 10 percent correction in the Dow.
But since then the market has become much more volatile, and the
Dow took just 29 trading sessions to fall from a peak to a 10
percent decline in 1998, and just 36 trading days to do it again
last year. In 1998, there were fears brought on by the collapse of
the Russian economy, and last year there were concerns over rising
interest rates. In each case, the market recovered.

MCCAIN SAYS HE   WILL PULL NEGATIVE ADS; BUSH DECLINES TO JOIN
HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Senator John McCain, who launched an
aggressive advertising blitz here after his overwhelming victory in
the New Hampshire primary, announced Friday that he would yank all
unfavorable advertising about his opponent and asked Governor
George W. Bush to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined. He defended his ads as crucial to rebutting
allegations made by McCain and said that unlike McCain's ads, his
were not really negative. Bush's refusal all but guaranteed a new
phase in the debate in the South Carolina primary: which candidate
is saying more negative things about the other?
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said he arrived at the decision after hearing from
a local woman whose 14-year-old son received a ``push poll,'' in
which someone masquerading as a pollster said derogatory things
about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put up positive ads. We will run no attack, response
or any other kind of negative advertising for the rest of this
campaign,'' McCain said while campaigning in New York City. ``I'd
like to encourage Governor Bush to do the same thing. I hope that
he will recognize the damage that this kind of thing does to the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has run several ads pointing out policy differences with
Bush, but by far his most controversial was the so-called
``handshake'' ad, which challenged the Texas governor's integrity
and compared him to President Clinton, asking, ``do we really want
another politician in the White House we can't trust?''
</P>
<P>
   That ad, as well as another McCain ad rebutting a Bush ad, ended
Friday, leaving only one McCain ad, ``Courage,'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose television and radio spots mention McCain in subtler
terms, refused to commit to pulling his own ads. And he called
McCain's announcement an ``old Washington trick,'' one that allowed
McCain to run the ad for weeks and still claim goodwill by yanking
it at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bait and switch trick,'' Bush said. ``He runs ads for
18 days defining me as something I'm not, and then, all the sudden,
says, `okay, let's all quit.' I'm going to make sure that people
understand exactly what I believe and where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Friday released a new ad called ``Integrity,'' in which he
rebuts the ad McCain pulled from the air Friday. In the new ad,
Bush accuses McCain of reckless campaigning with the earlier ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is tough, but when John McCain compared me to Bill
Clinton and said I was untrustworthy, that's over the line,'' Bush
says in the 30-second spot. ``Disagree with me, fine, but do not
challenge my integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own ads _ which include one showing a clip from the
Wall Street Journal that says the McCain campaign is ``crawling
with lobbyists'' _ Bush insisted he had everything to gain by
leaving them on the air. ``My ads aren't negative,'' Bush said.
``My ads are to make sure that I clarify exactly who I am and what
I believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides also expressed skepticism at McCain's expressed
reason for the decision. ``I think it's entirely possible Senator
McCain's ads boomeranged back and hurt him,'' Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising back and forth, which became the focal point of
the Republican primary in recent days as the cross-state debate
over issues fell by the wayside, was matched by new allegations
from the Bush campaign about McCain's record.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth day in a row, Bush rolled out a new charge.
McCain, he said, had ``passed the plate'' to special interest
lobbyists at a fund-raiser in New York the night before, wiping out
his claim as the reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just hear him now: Give 'em hell, and pass the hors
d'oeuvres,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky responded: ``I call it the
attack du jour. Governor Bush's special-interest and
lobbyist-powered campaign can easily spot Washington insiders
because they have all been hosts to his campaign events and make up
his $100,000 Pioneer Club.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoffrey Ernest Maurice de Ste. Croix, a Marxist historian of
ancient Greece and Rome whose erudition and sweeping, passionate
style won the admiration of colleagues even when they disagreed
with his conclusions, died Feb. 5 at a hospital in Oxford, England.
He was three days short of his 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   De Ste. Croix, whose name reflected his family's French Huguenot
origins, taught at Oxford from 1953 until his retirement in 1977.
He came late to ancient scholarship after practicing law and
serving during World War II in the Royal Air Force. His two most
praised books did not appear until he was in his 60s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 de Ste. Croix published ``The Origins of the
Peloponnesian War,'' which challenged the view that the war was
provoked by Athens. Instead, he lauded Athenian democracy for
offering the poor some respite from oppression by the rich and
pinned responsibility for the long conflict firmly on the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He revived the pro-Athenian, pro-democratic stance of earlier
scholars like George Grote,'' said Victor Bers, a professor of
classics at Yale, referring to the noted 19th-century British
historian of ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later de Ste. Croix published his best-known work,
``The Class Struggle in the Ancient World, From the Archaic Age to
the Arab Conquests,'' an enormous book that swept over the entire
course of ancient Greek and Roman civilization, identifying slavery
and oppression as central weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   De Ste. Croix wrote that the history of antiquity could be seen
as a class struggle between workers, primarily slaves, and property
owners. He maintained that reliance on slave labor prevented the
ancient world from modernizing and in the end undermined the Roman
Empire as the supply of new slaves diminished and the exploited
lower orders had little reason to resist the advancing barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have been chastised with scorpions may hope for
something better if they think they will be chastised only with
whips,'' he wrote in the book's concluding sentence.
</P>
<P>
   John Matthews, chairman of the Yale classics department, said,
``For de Ste. Croix, the empire was weakened as the supply of new
slaves dried up and Romans lost their liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not the moral change blamed by Gibbon,'' he said of
the 18th-century British historian Edward Gibbon, who theorized
that Christianity had accelerated the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``The Class Struggle in the Ancient World'' in 1982,
Robin Lane Fox, another noted Oxford classicist, wrote, ``This
remarkable book has a passion, a personal style and a breadth of
interest, based on exact detail, which have not surfaced in British
history writing on such a scale for very many years.'' Fox went on
to disagree with almost everything de Ste. Croix had said.
</P>
<P>
   This was typical of the mixture of awe and dissent with which
many historians greeted his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few living scholars can rival his range, and none who is
competent to judge can challenge the exactitude of his
scholarship,'' wrote P.A. Blunt, a former Camden professor of
ancient history at Oxford, in a book of essays presented to de Ste.
Croix on his 75th birthday. Still, Blunt called his conclusions
``highly controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Bowersock, a professor of ancient history at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton, said: ``He was a controversialist
who brought a breath of fresh air to ancient scholarship. Almost
everything he said was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   De Ste. Croix was born in the Portuguese colony of Macau on Feb.
8, 1910. His father worked for the Chinese customs office there and
his mother was a missionary's daughter, a member of an obscure
fundamentalist Christian sect called the British Israelites. The
sect believed that the date of Armageddon could be calculated from
the dimensions of the great pyramid. One of his aunts had known the
Chinese Christian Gen. Feng Yu-hsiang, who baptized whole regiments
with a hose-pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey's father died when he was 4, and the family returned to
England. Geoffrey was introduced to the classics at Clifton
College, a private boys' school near Bristol. But he became a
lawyer and practiced in Worthing and London.
</P>
<P>
   His political views became increasingly radical during the
1930s, when he embraced Marxism, but he broke with the British
Communist Party in 1939. His interest in the ancient world was
aroused during the war when he served as an Royal Air Force officer
in the Middle East converting radar tracks into intelligible
aircraft flight paths.
</P>
<P>
   Entering London University at the age of 37 in 1947 to study
classics, he fell under the influence of A.H.M. Jones, one of the
greatest ancient historians of his generation. Master and pupil
inspired each other, but as Lane Fox wrote, de Ste. Croix's writing
came to exhibit ``a fire and an explicitness which Jones' books had
somehow lacked.''
</P>
<P>
   After teaching at the London School of Economics, de Ste. Croix
was elected a fellow of New College in 1953, at 43, becoming only
the second member of the ancient history faculty at Oxford to have
been educated at another university. He was elected a fellow of the
British Academy in 1972 and awarded a doctorate by Oxford. He
became an emeritus fellow of New College in 1977 and an honorary
fellow in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A large man, de Ste. Croix had been a distinguished tennis
player in his youth, good enough to play the center court at
Wimbledon in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage ended in divorce, and in 1959 he married
Margaret Knight. She survives him, along with two sons.
</P>
<P>
   De Ste. Croix also wrote about aspects of the ancient world
almost totally neglected by other historians, including accounting
standards and attitudes toward debt and credit.
</P>
<P>
   He disliked Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church, which he
felt had been a source of intolerance and cruelty since the days of
Constantine, the first Roman emperor to convert.
</P>
<P>
   This led him to explore various aspects of the early Christian
church from a critical point of view, especially its attitudes
toward women. It also led to his refusal to enter New College
Chapel and to his scandalizing believing students by denouncing
God, whom he usually referred to by the Hebrew name Yahweh.

NORTHERN IRELAND REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suspension of the Northern Ireland assembly may be the pause
that refreshes the peace process. The Irish Republican Army has
come up with a new position that _ in the words of a neutral
commission _ holds out the prospect that the IRA ``will initiate a
comprehensive process to put arms beyond use . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the ``decommissioning'' long sought by the Ulster
Unionist Party, whose governing council holds a meeting Saturday.
David Trimble, the Unionist leader and first minister of the new
government, had promised to resign if the IRA had not begun to
decommission.
</P>
<P>
   He need not quit a government that has ceased to exist. The
British decision to suspend it means everyone in Northern Ireland
will have a chance to assess the latest IRA offer without the
pressure of an immediate decision on Trimble's fate. If the IRA
initiative is acceptable to Unionists, the British can revive the
government instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland peace process has always made progress only
after a crisis left the antagonists at a precipice, contemplating a
future of continuing conflict. The latest offer will not be
completely to Unionists' liking, but they need to consider whether
it is better than political deadlock and violence. As for the IRA,
decommissioning may seem to go against long established practices,
but the IRA also says it seeks ``a just and lasting peace.'' For
that to happen, an unambiguous gesture of reconciliation is
essential.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments, together with President
Clinton, worked hard to bridge differences between the IRA and
Unionists when it seemed that decommissioning was out of the
question. They understand that a political system is necessary to
contain the violent impulses endemic in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The government suspended by Britain Friday is the central
element in a new, pluralistic political structure for Northern
Ireland. If the IRA offer has any substance, it should be accepted
by the Unionists so that the government can resume operations.
Politics, not guns, will lead to a better future for Northern
Ireland.

IRAQ'S GROWING THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein's continuing defiance of United Nations
resolutions mandating inspection and dismantling of his weapons of
mass destruction represents the most flagrant and protracted
failure of President Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   This was illuminated Thursday when Baghdad refused to accept
even a diluted UN inspection commission 14 months after Saddam
kicked out the original UNSCOM team under the conscientious
Australian diplomat Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Saddam has rebuilt facilities for his biological and
chemical weapons programs as well as missile sites. Specialists
suspect he has renewed production of anthrax, botulinum toxin and
aflatoxin, and the organism that produces plague. Weapons
inspectors and intelligence officials also have reason to fear that
Iraq is working on even more sophisticated programs to develop
viral agents for use as biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In seven years, Clinton has tried to ignore, obscure, and
misrepresent the threat from Saddam. Clinton's so-called
containment policy has done nothing more than deter Saddam from
invading his neighbors again. But that policy has not obliged the
Iraqi despot to honor the UN's disarmament resolutions, has not
protected the Iraqi people from the dictator's killers and
torturers, and has not defended Americans against terrorists who
may be acting with the veiled and deniable support of a vengeful
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton clings to his futile containment policy, seeking
to avoid difficult decisions between now and the first Tuesday in
November, the threat grows. Saddam's regime enriches itself with
smuggling operations and by diverting money from the $10 billion in
yearly oil sales allowed under the UN's oil-for-food program. And
the common people of Iraq continue to suffer unspeakably from both
sanctions and the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam must be forced to permit weapons inspections or be
removed from power. The failure to contain him should be a central
issue in the current presidential campaign.

 &HT;    `Cater to the female mindset' is trend among manufacturers
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At this year's Super Show, a growing contingent of
manufacturers is looking beyond the scantily-clad women modeling
Spandex and working out on athletic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that those businesspeople are
women who are making a name for themselves in the highly
competitive sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, products geared toward women are creeping up at
the Super Show, the sporting goods industry's largest annual expo,
which ends Sunday. The event, which is not open to the public, is
being held at the Georgia World Congress Center and Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   In the overwhelmingly male-dominated sporting goods industry,
women are making progress, said Traci Mondella, chief executive
officer and president of Henri-James, an apparel manufacturer based
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the sporting goods business still comes with its challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Mondella says that when she shows up at business meetings with
partner Henri-James Tieleman, she's usually taken for a secretary.
``We still have an uphill battle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another female entrepreneur, Beth Marcus of Massachusetts-based
Glow Dog Inc., said many women still face a glass ceiling in moving
up the corporate ladder, despite the fact that they are among the
executives behind new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go figure,'' Marcus quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who show up at the Super Show may be mostly male, but,
like it or not, female consumers are the ones with the buying
power, making most of the purchases for their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 80 percent of all sports apparel purchases are made
by women,'' said Mike May, spokesman for the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association, which sponsors the show. ``With that in
mind, companies are gearing their products to cater to the female
mindset because that's who you have to convince.''
</P>
<P>
   Big sporting goods companies _ including Wilson, Nike, Champion
and Puma _ are also changing their merchandise so it's more
marketable to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are constantly looking to upgrade, improve and
expand the number of women-specific pieces of equipment, footwear,
and apparel,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   At Henri-James, for example, a bra strap holder is sewn on the
inside of sleeveless golf and tennis shirts to prevent the strap
from slipping down during play.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Savage, co-founder of Sutton, Mass.-based Savage Fitness
Inc., found an emerging market in sporting equipment for women. Her
company is pushing its line of strength-training equipment, called
Go Figure. The weight bench Go Figure is a strength-training system
designed in bright colors (not black or gray), with a special
snap-on locking system. The company calls it ``testosterone free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In stores, the size, height and look of the equipment is big,
bulky and is geared toward men,'' Savage said of most workout
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She has discovered that the popularity of free weights among
women is exploding, with growth of 123 percent in eight years. In
1990, just 8.3 million women used free weights, compared with 18.5
million in 1998, according to a study by American Sports Data and
the Fitness Products Council.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Savage said, is to sell her products to sporting
goods buyers, who are mostly males.
</P>
<P>
   ``One buyer (a male) came over and said, `Don't even try to sell
me anything,''' said Shannon Rae, a Savage Fitness employee, adding
that the bright colors might have scared him away.
</P>
<P>
   Active Apparel Group Inc., licensees of Everlast activewear, is
trying to buck the show's trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use fighters, not the very pretty, foo foo models,'' said
Steven Oshatz, a vice president of sales with the New York-based
company. ``People are looking to see the real people wearing the
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Oshatz said he's seen the industry evolve in the 18 years he's
been in the business. Now he finds that to his benefit, retailers
are increasing the amount of floor real estate for women's sports
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, they're seeing that it's a growing business,'' Oshatz
said of retailers.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After years of share dilutions, lock-outs from annual
meetings and the occasional outright expropriation, foreign
investors understand that most Russian companies care little for
shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   But investors have held out hope for, and put their money
behind, a select few corporations _ including Unified Energy
Systems, the operator of Russia's national power grid. UES, one of
the largest utilities in the world, is a natural pick: in an
emerging market where most companies are closely held, its shares
are widely available. Last year, the stock price tripled, to 11.8
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of $5.7 billion, UES is greatly
undervalued but has the potential to improve. Nearly as important,
the company is run by Anatoly B. Chubais, who engineered nearly a
decade of market changes under former President Boris Yeltsin and
whom many foreigners regard as a champion of free markets and
shareholder rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many UES shareholders fear that such trust was
misplaced, as they sift through several murky privatizations that
involve Chubais and that could significantly transform the company.
</P>
<P>
   The path to these privatizations illustrates how in Russia _
even in the most progressive companies _ the line between politics
and business is still blurry.
</P>
<P>
   UES has begun a restructuring program that involves the sale or
merger of subsidiaries and that, by official accounts, would bring
much-needed efficiency to the utilities industry. If the deals go
through by August as scheduled, they will diminish UES generation
and distribution capacities by 20 percent each, industry analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off the units is supposed to be a transparent process,
with independent appraisals of the properties for sale and
competitive tenders. Instead, UES shareholders, board members and
industry analysts have received only meager information about
projects that appear to benefit executives and politicians close to
Chubais. The first privatization completed under the plan and
awaiting federal approval, for example, turns a hydroelectric plant
over to a metals magnate who was a big financial backer of Chubais'
political party in recent parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Russian companies, which openly flout shareholder
rights, UES has shown regard for investors. Its top management
meets with analysts quarterly. Representatives of domestic and
foreign shareholders, who together hold 41 percent of UES, are on
its board.
</P>
<P>
   But those measures apparently cannot protect shareholders fully.
``In Russia, shareholders today are not capable of controlling the
behavior of management; the board of directors is not capable of
controlling the actions of management,'' said Ivan Lazarko, one of
two shareholder representatives to the 15-member UES board and the
chairman of the board of directors at Naufor, the national
association of securities dealers. ``We just don't get the full
picture. So everything turns on faith _ fairly blind faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where legal and regulatory systems are still
nascent, that faith is placed in individuals, like Chubais, who at
various times during the Yeltsin administration has served in the
cabinet and the Kremlin in posts including first deputy prime
minister and chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The regard many foreigners have for him contrasts sharply with
the disdain a lot of his countrymen feel. Many Russians hold him
largely responsible for the catastrophic decline of the economy and
the crony capitalism that has emerged in place of the promised free
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite scandals that erupted while he held his government
posts, many foreigners have stood by him, in part because the
alternatives _ unreconstructed Communists and hostile nationalists
_ seem far worse. As a result, after Yeltsin appointed Chubais
chief executive of UES in 1998, private-sector shareholders agreed
to amend company bylaws to make it hard to oust him, thereby
protecting him from the whims of the government, which owns 53
percent of the utility. (The remaining 6 percent is held by current
and former employees and management; Chubais holds no equity.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards of a company led by Chubais are higher than
those for a company led by anyone else,'' said Matthias Westman,
director of Prosperity Capital Management, asset managers in Moscow
with about $40 million invested in UES ``So it's even more
upsetting when someone who is supposed to be on your side does
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chubais declined to be interviewed for this article. But
Valentin Zavadnikov, deputy chairman of the executive board at UES,
said, ``All activities are done for economic reasons and economic
reasons alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would dispute that Chubais is turning the company around.
Just two years ago, only about 15 percent of bills owed to UES were
paid in cash; the rest were settled through barter or just sank
into arrears. Now, 48 percent are in cash.
</P>
<P>
   But while running UES, Chubais has remained active in big-league
Russian politics. Those loyalties now appear to be in conflict as
UES begins restructuring. Chubais, for instance, remained close to
the Kremlin inner circle. And last summer, he pulled together a
pro-capitalist electoral bloc called the Union of Right Forces to
participate in the Dec. 19 parliamentary vote. Dismissed at first
as politically irrelevant, the bloc managed to grab a good share of
seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most sizable financial supporters of the Union of
Right Forces, political analysts say, was Oleg Deripaska, the
ambitious 32-year-old owner of OKSA, an aluminum conglomerate that
stretches thousands of miles from the Volga River to the Russian
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Chubais and Deripaska were doing the political bloc work, the
two men were also negotiating a business deal. Under the UES
restructuring plan, they decided to merge the Sayano-Shushenskoye
Hydroelectric plant, a UES subsidiary, with OKSA.
</P>
<P>
   Deripaska's aluminum mill in Sayansk _ one of the biggest in
Russia and the linchpin of the OKSA conglomerate _ is the
Sayano-Shushenskoye hydroelectric plant's main consumer. UES
maintains that the plant needs at least $80 million in capital
investments over the next few years, which the corporation cannot
provide or borrow, given Russia's high interest rates. OKSA,
however, sells its aluminum on world markets and has the cash to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the promised investment, the merger would turn
control of Sayano-Shushenskoye over to OKSA. The aluminum company
could then buy electricity at cost, which would make its metal even
cheaper and more competitive, UES argues. The new company formed
out of the merger, Energo-Metal Amalgamation, would get a hefty
chunk of the metals sales, and UES, as a 33 percent shareholder in
the new entity, would see its own earnings increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``UES wins 100 percent through this deal,'' said Zavadnikov.
``We get a percentage of the metal that is sold in real cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say UES shareholders, is that they have little
information about the deal, which they contend is moving alarmingly
quickly. ``There's no sense of how the estimate of the value of the
companies was made,'' said Alexei Volkov, the utilities analyst for
the Russian brokerage house Nikoil. ``What were the underlying
assumptions the valuations were based on? Who did them?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Zavadnikov, the deal was reviewed by an independent
Russian appraiser called NP Consult. But critics wanted an
appraiser of international repute.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, shareholders say they do not understand how the
Sayano-Shushenskoye merger and other planned deals fit into UES'
long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Management has said that it will issue a strategy statement in
March but that the Sayano-Shushenskoye deal will go forward
nonetheless when the expected federal approval comes through.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, a partner in the United Financial Group, a
Moscow brokerage firm, and a UES board member, said, ``Maybe this
could be good, but it is done with such haste and with so little
information that management seems to be doing things that are far
from the interests of the company and a large number of
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   What information UES has provided has met with substantial
skepticism. For example, the pitch for the merger guarantees UES
$35 million in dividends this year and shareholders 80 percent of
after-tax earnings, a sum industry analysts believe is wildly
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   UES also maintains that its agreement with OKSA guarantees
capital investments into the hydroelectric plant, but shareholders
say they have yet to see the contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects UES is considering only deepen the concern. One
involves the dismantling of Samaraenergo, the main utility in the
Volga River region of Samara. The way shareholders understand the
project, Samaraenergo's generating plants would be spun off and
then merged with some key factories in the region, including a few
belonging to Deripaska. Other factories involved in the deal are
thought to have close ties to the governor of the Samara region,
Konstantin A. Titov, a leading figure in the Union of Right Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Deripaska did not respond to requests for interviews.
But Konstantin Remchukov, economic adviser to Deripaska and a
parliamentarian from the Union of Right Forces, said the
industrialist would have supported Chubais' political agenda even
if he had not been awarded the hydroelectric plant. Still,
Remchukov conceded that in Russia right now, it is hard to avoid
the blurring between political loyalties and business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he and some other Russian observers maintain, the
goal of developing Russian business rapidly may justify using less
than perfect means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only large Russian companies can be competitive with the West,
and one of the few ways is through things such as the energy-metals
mergers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal doesn't, of course, look Western or ideal,''
Remchukov added. And while major investors from outside Russia
might take a long time evaluating the prospects of working with
UES, he said, ``someone like Oleg Deripaska will invest.''

   Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, and Hank Greenberg were all discarded at
the end of legendary careers. Hence it should not come as a shock
that the Patriots have cut two of their all-time greatest players,
Ben Coates and Bruce Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is something new about the sums of money
involved in such transactions and their frequency. At the same time
that Coates and Armstrong were being released, the Miami Dolphins
cut loose the incomparable Dan Marino for salary cap reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Saddened as a fan might be at the spectacle of such heroes
limping off to exile in places like Tampa Bay or Cleveland, one's

deferred payments, restructured contracts _ these nuances of an era
shaped by free agency and salary caps have become as crucial to a
team's success as the feats performed between the white lines.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has come a long way since Babe Ruth answered a
question about making more money than the president by reminding
the inquiring scribes that he had had a better year. The Bambino
was jesting, acting like a medieval Lord of Misrule who is entitled
to invert the proper order of things on feast days. Today the
inversion is an everyday reality. Ken Griffey Jr. is lauded for
going home to Cincinnati at the cut-rate salary of $13 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes, who were once exploited by owners, deserve every penny
the market allows them to earn, but there is a high price for their
free agency. Players today ride on a carousel, with much changing
of uniforms every time the music stops. Fans can no longer identify
with the hometown team as they did in a less mercenary time. The
fan has become a mere consumer, the player a temp worker earning
millions, the games a glorified billboard for other products and
services.

ETHICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, February 14, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in the past 10 years, medical research has both quickened
its pace and become much more commercialized. With each advance in
understanding of the causes of diseases come fresh opportunities
for biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to offer a new
diagnostic test, a new imaging system, a new device to keep blood
vessels unclogged, or a new prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   This sea change in the way science moves from the laboratory to
the market has offered hope for patients and profits for companies.
For the researchers, it has brought tempting chances to do well at
the same time they are doing good. Now, Harvard Medical School is
exploring whether its ground rules to make sure that the ``doing
well'' part does not get in the way of doing good are outdated, a
hindrance to recruiting and keeping the top researchers. Harvard
should be cautious about across-the-board changes.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the rules, among the most strict in the
country, are behind the times. For example, researchers may not
hold more than $20,000 worth of stock in companies for which they
are doing research. The limit is designed to ensure that a
scientist not be in a position to profit unduly from, for instance,
pushing a new medicine on patients who are research subjects before
it is fully tested. But while that $20,000 could safely be
increased, a guiding principle in revising the rules should be to
do more, not less, to avoid interest conflicts by doctors working
directly with patients.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise Harvard is going through raises the question of why
there should be a gap between the stringency of its rules and their
enforcement and those of other medical schools. ``The real issue is
what the rules should be for everyone, not just for Harvard,'' says
George Annas, professor of health law at the Boston University
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal government would step forward and lead in
establishment of a set of rigorously enforced national
conflict-of-interest rules, Harvard would not have to be concerned
about competing for researchers. But any national rules should be
closer to Harvard's than to the more loosely enforced ones that
prevail elsewhere.

 &HT;    Strip club owner arrested in arsons plot, police say
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal authorities arrested the owner of two Atlanta
strip clubs Friday on charges he hired someone to burn the
businesses of four competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Childs was arrested at one of his bars, the Gentlemen's
Club, at mid-afternoon Friday and was brought in wearing shorts and
a T-shirt to U.S. District Court to face a magistrate. There was no
testimony and no plea entered. Childs was informed of his
constitutional protections.
</P>
<P>
   Childs will be held in jail until Thursday, when U.S. Magistrate
Christopher Hagey will hold a preliminary hearing that also will
include the question of bond.
</P>
<P>
   Childs _ the nephew by marriage of former Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young _ also owns Nikki VIP, located on the same street where three
of the four businesses he allegedly wanted torched are located.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's allegations of criminal activity involving Atlanta
strip clubs came on the heels of 97-page federal racketeering
indictment returned last November against the owner of another
adult entertainment bar, the Gold Club, and 15 other suspects.
Prosecutors alleged Gold Club owner Steve Kaplan was tied to the
Gambino organized crime family, overbilled patrons and bribed
Atlanta police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Childs said nothing in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer told Hagey that he usually only represented Childs in
his personal business, so he was trying to find a criminal defense
attorney to take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Alan Begner, who has represented Childs' clubs in
licensing matters before the city, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal complaint and the attached affidavit,
Childs paid an arsonist to torch the Body Tap, which burned to the
ground Sept. 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Using a middleman, Childs then allegedly ordered that Pleaser's
be burned. The Molotov cocktail that started the fire at Pleaser's
on Dec. 22, 1997, caused only limited damage, so Childs allegedly
wouldn't pay until the unnamed arsonist burned a third, nearby
competitor, Club Oasis. Childs allegedly paid for both fires after
the Oasis burned April 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then starting Jan. 19, according to the affidavit, Childs asked
the unnamed middleman, who became an informant for federal
investigators, to hire the arsonist again; this time to burn Magic
City for $50,000. Childs allegedly paid $5,000 in advance, but that
fire was never set.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said federal investigators caught Childs on tape
several times, talking about his role in the fires at the Body Tap
and Club Oasis and his plans to have Magic City burned to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Childs has faced problems at his businesses over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Angry neighborhood activists tried unsuccessfully last year to
have the liquor license for Nikki VIP pulled because of allegations
of drug dealing and prostitution at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, police were called to the club more than 70 times and
that year ended with a fatal shooting on New Year's Eve at the
club. There also was a fatal shooting five months later at Childs'
other adult entertainment bar, the Gentlemen's Club. In 1998,
Childs was convicted as part of a plea bargain agreement for
failing to display a liquor or business license.

AS MERGERS MULTIPLY, SO DOES THE DANGER  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mergers today are something to behold. The big ones are four or
five times pricier than the biggest in the 1980s, and the number
keeps climbing like an airliner gaining altitude. Giant companies
on different continents come together as easily as neighborhood
stores, and hardly a week goes by without another huge deal.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to stop gawking at this spectacle and to
figure out what is happening to so many of the corporations that
shape our lives.
</P>
<P>
   We read with amazement that America Online is buying Time Warner
to get material to transmit over the Internet. Daimler and Chrysler
have merged to gain greater access to each other's markets,
creating a giant that is neither European nor American. And just
last week, Pfizer said it would buy another pharmaceutical
powerhouse, Warner Lambert, in part to get hold of Lipitor, a
hot-selling anti-cholesterol drug.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom since the late 19th century, when corporate trusts
dominated oil, steel, copper and railroads in the United States,
has there been such a march toward concentration, this time on a
global scale. And the process is gathering speed.
</P>
<P>
   Companies around the world agreed last year to pay $3.4 trillion
to acquire other companies, Thomson Securities Data reports. The
total has skyrocketed from less than $1 trillion in 1995, when the
current merger wave took off.
</P>
<P>
   The action was very different in the 1980s, when leveraged
buyouts prevailed. Companies were bought, typically with borrowed
money, and broken into pieces thought to be worth more apart than
together. Today, companies are merging to multiply their size.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that two or three huge corporations will come to
dominate each industry and gain the power to shove up prices. As
effective competition disappears, so will the innovation and
striving for quality that it fosters.
</P>
<P>
   The American auto industry fell into that state after World War
II, until Japan broke the Big Three's dominance in the 1970s. If
the merger wave now unfolding across the globe goes too far, who
will be the spoilers?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is pressure to make very diverse industries less
diverse,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI. ``That is because in nearly every country today, it is hard
for more than two or three companies in any industry to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentration is the natural drift in a market system, but it
lay dormant or was held in check through most of the last century.
Now it is unchained again, for a laundry list of reasons. One is
the booming stock market: AOL's surging stock price allowed it to
swallow the much bigger Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation also plays a big role: Not long ago, the joining of
Citibank, Travelers and Salomon Smith Barney, for example, would
have been illegal. So would many of the mergers in
telecommunications, before Congress changed the rules in 1996. And
there are fewer obstacles to cross-border combinations today.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is both a means and a motive. New information
networks allow managers to oversee bigger operations than before.
Breakthroughs in delivering phone calls, TV signals and Internet
data over a single line have companies scrambling for position
through mergers. And e-commerce is not likely to be very profitable
until a few companies emerge in dominant positions.
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity pushes mergers in established industries, to
eliminate duplication and achieve economies of scale. Even the
Asian financial crisis has played a role. United Technologies, for
example, which makes Otis elevators among other products, acquired
control last month of a big South Korean elevator maker, extending
United's reach into that lively market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have done that just a few years ago,'' said Ruth
Harkin, United's senior vice president for international affairs
and government relations. ``The foreign investment rules would not
have been favorable to us. And prior to the Asian crisis, there
would not have been a willingness in Korea to let us merge.''
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of corporate power is still in a very early
stage. Nothing like the trusts that dominated American industry a
century ago have emerged in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Roosevelt's spirit is not forgotten. The antitrust
structure survives and lately has been pointedly invoked, as when
the Justice Department challenged BP Amoco's proposed acquisition
of Atlantic Richfield. There is also talk of coordinating antitrust
rules globally.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, as economists put it, is an optimal balance in which
some concentration is allowed, but government steps in before
price-fixing develops and innovation is killed off. That's not an
easy balance to strike when the pressure is on to make government
smaller while mergers make industry ever more concentrated.

 &HT;    McCain pulls negative ads; Bush declines to follow suit
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a case of unilateral disarmament, Arizona
Sen. John McCain on Friday killed off his negative TV ads and
invited opponent Gov. George W. Bush to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, still steamed about a McCain ad that said he ``twists the
truth like Clinton,'' declined. He began airing a new ad accusing
McCain of having gone ``over the line'' by linking him to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, as the critical Feb. 19 South Carolina presidential
primary approaches, Bush and McCain continued to spar over
allegations that the Texas governor's campaign has used so-called
``push polling'' to spread lies about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said his decision to stop running negative ads was
sparked by a South Carolina woman who told him Thursday that her
14-year-old Boy Scout son, who has adopted McCain as a hero, was
shaken by a Bush pollster who said McCain was dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it,'' said McCain at a Friday news conference
in New York. ``And called in my staff and said we can't be involved
in this kind of campaign activities _ no matter what, we are
pulling our response ad off the airwaves. We will put up positive
ads.'' ``Push polls'' are fake public opinion surveys designed to
spread negative, and often inaccurate, information about a
candidate. The goal is to ``push'' people away from the candidate,
not gather information.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday denied using the technique, and his campaign
released a phone script that is critical of McCain but falls short
of being a push poll. McCain aides say Bush callers are using
another script that crosses the line by inaccurately portraying
McCain's positions on taxing charitable contributions and the
public financing of elections. ``Push polling is a campaign of
whispers,'' said South Carolina U.S. Rep. Lindsey Graham, a McCain
supporter. ``It is a tactic that destroys the political process and
leaves young voters feeling disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign doesn't deny paying for calls based on the
second script, but it says only 300 people got them, far too few
for the effort to be called a push poll.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Democratic pollster Peter Hart said the Bush
campaign's argument is legitimate. ``In order to push voters, you
have to call thousands and thousands of them,'' Hart said. ``You
can hardly move the electorate with 300 phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart also noted that competent pollsters wouldn't waste time
interviewing 14-year-old boys, who can't vote. Either Bush needs to
hire a better firm or there's something fishy about the story of
the Boy Scout, he said. In his call for an end to the negative ads,
McCain said he hoped Bush ``would recognize the damage that this
kind of thing does to the electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's newest ad, called ``Courage,'' touts his Vietnam War
and Washington records.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bush said he has no plans to alter his TV
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is his ads trying to link me to Bill Clinton
didn't work. People of this state don't appreciate it and neither
do I,'' he said, adding, ``He runs an ad for 18 days defining me
for something I'm not, then all of a sudden says, `OK, let's all
quit.' I'm going to make sure people understand exactly what I
believe, exactly where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, Bush was running a new TV ad in which he tells
South Carolina voters, ``Politics is tough, but when John McCain
compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was untrustworthy, that's
over the line. Disagree with me, fine, but do not challenge my
integrity.''

JEFFERSON JOINS FALCONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ After losing Ben Coates and Bruce Armstrong, the
Patriots have lost wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, who on Friday
agreed to a five-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons worth about $18
million, with a $4.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Coates and Armstrong both received phone calls from Cleveland
coach Chris Palmer, and it appears the ball is rolling for the two
deposed Patriots to surface in another uniform soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who spent four seasons with the Patriots, was being
courted by the Browns, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Falcons. He will
be introduced to the Atlanta media Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Troy Brown, also an unrestricted free agent, has been
receiving interest from the Jaguars, Cowboys, Saints, and Browns.
The Patriots have raised their offer to $2.5 million per year, but
the deal is backloaded and not acceptable to the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Patriots haven't been able to define a proper
salary structure for Brown, who had been offered a five-year deal
that averages $1.2 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said he warned the Patriots through his agent, Gary
Uberstine, that ``I was going to make a quick decision. I had an
idea of what I wanted and the first team that came close to doing
it I was going to go with. We told the Patriots a while ago not to
wait until free agency to get a deal done, but they didn't seem
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, I really wanted to come back to the Patriots, but
after what I saw they did to Bruce (Armstrong) and Ben (Coates),
I'm glad I have a chance to go to a place like Atlanta. They had a
tough year last year, but adding some people and getting their
injured players like Jamal (Anderson) back should put us right back
where we were a couple of years ago. I think it's going to be a
great situation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was considered a team leader. With Armstrong and
Coates also gone, the Patriots have taken a huge hit in the locker
room as well as on the offense, which is losing players at an
alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Belichick said he didn't think the Patriots would be
able to sign any free agents within the next 24-48 hours as they
continue to assess their needs. He said he was interested in
signing all of the team's unrestricted free agents, but it doesn't
appear the Patriots will have the funds to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the team had begun ``shopping down every aisle''
for free agents, including one with a ``higher profile and in the
middle range.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick emphasized that he hoped both Coates and Armstrong
would take lesser deals to stay in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players we'd like to keep and we explored
all options with Ben and Bruce,'' he said. ``Having been here in
1996, I know how important they are to this team and this
organization, but we tried to structure their deals in a way that
would give us cap relief. With younger players you can take the
money and push it into the future, but with older players, you'll
be paying and they won't be sitting there at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said the Patriots are about $1 million under the cap,
but it appears to be more than that. The Patriots were able to save
$2.1 million by restructuring Ted Johnson's contract. They also
restructured Willie McGinest's deal.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said the Patriots have several months to fill the
team's voids.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a chance the left tackle spot could be manned
in house, but it appears the Patriots will attempt to bring in
offensive linemen either through free agency or via the draft.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer industry has a long, respected tradition of hiring
so-called tiger teams of professional hackers who attack a computer
system to determine how secure it is. The idea is that only by
waging a full-scale siege on a system with an authorized break-in
can its true level of vulnerability be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, that hacker tradition has grown to embrace
unauthorized attacks in which programmers find a way to invade or
cripple a system, then publish the details of the vulnerability _
often accompanied by software that exploits the weaknesses they
discover.
</P>
<P>
   While the wisdom and ethics of these practices have long been
debated, the attacks that blocked access to several prominent Web
sites this week have fueled the controversy because the siege was
accomplished in part using a technique and software published last
year on the Internet by a hacker who calls himself Mixter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Mixter's motive, to law enforcement officials and many
security experts his posting of the attack software was akin to
leaving a loaded gun in the middle of a room full of children.
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail exchange Friday, Mixter, like other
self-appointed monitors of computer security, defended his actions
as a sort of wake-up call for complacent network administrators.
Mixter said he considered himself a responsible hacker, and he
tried to distance himself from this week's ``senseless'' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers themselves are deeply divided over which actions are
responsible and which reckless, but there is general agreement that
the line between good guys and bad guys is somewhat blurry,
shifting and permeable.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the terms ``white hats,'' ``black hats'' and even
``gray hats'' are used to label hackers. Each hews to a unique, if
occasionally inscrutable, set of limits.
</P>
<P>
   But this splitting of ethical hairs is quickly losing its charm
for law enforcement officials and security experts alike, and there
is a growing sentiment that enough is enough. Earlier this week,
following the Web-site attacks, the Justice Department announced
that tougher penalties might be necessary to prevent more serious
attacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a hacker ethos, and even the bad guys have
thought there are some things you can do and some things that are
off limits,'' said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is
now a vice president at Global Integrity, a computer-security
consulting firm in Reston, Va. ``I think we've reached a point
where this kind of activity is almost universally decried as being
off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   White-hat hackers grew out of the concept of tiger teams. Since
the 1970s, a number of government laboratories and even some
corporations have deployed special groups of employees who test
computer security by trying to compromise a system or bring it down
in a sort of digital war game.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Palmer, manager of network security and cryptography at
IBM Research, leads a squad of white hats who are paid by companies
to attack their computer systems to test how well they can stand up
to an assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``A white hat does it when asked, under contract, with a
get-out-of-jail-free card,'' said Palmer. ``We'll do the job,
evaluate it, and tell the customer what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Black-hat hackers, on the other hand, adhere to the basic
philosophy that information should be free _ including information
about security weaknesses. For these people, ``breaking into a
system or exposing a system's weaknesses in literal terms, is a
good thing because truth and knowledge should win out in the long
run,'' said Dan Farmer, a network security specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gray-hat hackers, who straddle both worlds,
sometimes acting like malicious hackers, but in pursuit of some
greater good, whether real or imagined. Such is the case with a
group of hackers in Cambridge, Mass., who call themselves L0pht
(pronounced ``loft''). They recently joined forces with (AT)Stake,
a computer security consulting firm in Cambridge with $10 million
in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   When L0pht detected a vulnerability, the group published an
advisory on its Web site. But the description of the security flaw
was usually detailed enough for other, perhaps more malicious,
hackers to use in carrying out an attack. At the same time, the
group published a solution that told network administrators how to
close the hole.
</P>
<P>
   L0pht members have appeared before the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs and have generally received praise.
</P>
<P>
   Mixter, who identifies himself only as a 20-year-old German from
the Hannover area, says he was a gray-hat hacker who recently
turned white hat. In an e-mail interview Friday, he said the
conversion came when he crossed a few ``legal borders'' in 1998 and
1999 and ran afoul of German law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Mixter, ``I am a white hat, the definition meaning
that I am trying to contribute to improving security by doing what
I do, and completely acting within the law and hacking ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixter defended what he did, saying that his intention in
posting the attack software, known as Tribal Flood Network, was to
alert security sites to vulnerabilities, not to provide vandals
with cyberweapons.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, was that Tribal Flood Network was
adopted as a weapon by vandals before security experts had
succeeded in creating a reliable defense. Even so, Mixter said,
other, similar tools had been available on the Net longer than his.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Rasch, the former federal prosecutor: ``That's
like saying, `I've come up with a better bomb, but I'm not the one
who came up with the idea of bombing people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, even if Mixter had intended that attackers use
what he posted, ``it's wrong, but probably not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer of IBM agreed: ``If he's doing it to educate, I respect
it. But the fact of the matter is, it can be misused, and if he's
not real careful about how he posts it, it can fall into the hands
of people who want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mixter said he was ``not trying to play down the negative
aspects and dangers of this decision,'' he called this week's
attacks ``an inevitable price to pay to be able to develop
countermeasures and fixes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The security sites are making the tools and the source code
public so that everyone has an equal chance of informing himself
about them and coming up with countermeasures,'' he said of public
postings. ``It would be unfair to provide them to just a small
circle of security experts who would possibly only consult some few
elected companies. The only fair way is getting the information out
to everyone, because generally, everyone on the Net can be affected
by security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral ambiguity is most pronounced when hackers offer
commentary about one another. A member of the hacker group Cult of
the Dead Cow who goes by the handle Death Veggie condemned the
week's attacks as ``not hacking'' but ``digital vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take any skill, and it's purely destructive,''
Death Veggie said. ``Once a hacker starts becoming really
destructive, they stop being a hacker and become a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Cult of the Dead Cow produced and distributes a program
called Back Orifice, which enables a hacker to control another
computer from a remote location.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Palmer consorts with such groups but refuses to recruit
from their ranks, even if they claim to have gone straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hire reformed hackers because let's just say I've
never really found one,'' he said. ``It's like hiring an arsonist
to be your fire marshall. They know all about the stuff and they
know how to be good at it, but can you ever really sleep at
night?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Palmer occasionally attends Defcon, an annual
three-day hacker gathering in Las Vegas. Palmer said he often mixes
with hackers of all stripes at the hotel bar between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said that what he does _ inventing ways to defend against
attacks like this week's _ is both ``harder'' than malicious
hacking and ``a huge high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasch, who was the lead prosecutor in a high-profile computer
crime case in 1989, said he did not entirely agree with his former
bosses at the Justice Department who are calling for stiffer
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a single case that we can point to and say, `If
only the penalties were greater, the person would not have done
this.''' he said.

OSCAR RACE IS WIDE OPEN THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Fixes day of announcement in lead)  
 By WILLIAN ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the nominations for the 72nd annual Academy Awards are
announced Tuesday, at the indecent hour of 5:30 a.m., experts
predict the coveted list will include an unusually wide-open field
of hopefuls and a big surprise or two.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most movie years of the '90s, this past one has contained
no overwhelming favorite _ no ``Dances With Wolves, ``Schindler's
List,'' ``Forrest Gump,'' ``The English Patient'' or ``Titanic'' _
or even, like last year, two competing favorites such as
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, 1999 was a rare year in which the critics groups _ the
major Oscar indicators _ split on their best picture choices: the
New York critics went for ``Topsy-Turvy,'' the Los Angeles critics
liked ``The Insider,'' the National Board of Review picked
``American Beauty'' and the Boston critics chose ``Three Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also, as several pundits have pointed out, the
``millennium factor'': the sense Oscar voters may take this last
race of the Old Era to break tradition and make a statement by
voting a best picture nomination to the kind of film that is
generally considered non-Oscar fare: a computer-animated film such
as ``Toy Story 2,'' an absurdist farce such as ``Bowfinger'' or a
foreign-language sex comedy such as ``All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The year's three big critical favorites _ Mike Leigh's
celebration of the joys of Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan, ``Topsy-Turvy'';
Michael Mann's devastating warning on the perils of a corporate-run
world, ``The Insider,'' and Sam Mendes' zeitgeist-capturing look at
suburban angst, ``American Beauty'' _ all appear to be a sure thing
for one of the five best picture nominations.
</P>
<P>
   But the other two slots could go to any of a dozen candidates,
including the Gulf War adventure-satire ``Three Kings''; the edgy
omnibus drama ``Magnolia''; the neo-film noir ``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''; the gutsy adaptation of John Irving's ``The Cider House
Rules''; the irresistible comedy ``Being John Malkovich''; the
popular occult thriller ``The Sixth Sense''; or even Jim Carrey's
acclaimed box office dud, ``Man on the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   With this wide a divergence of opinion about what's great, you
can also expect Oscar '99 to be one of those unusual races with
more than one difference between the best picture and best director
lists _ a path Oscar voters traditionally take when there are just
too many worthy choices for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the directors who could be honored _ even if their films
are not _ are England's Anthony Minghella (``The Talented Mr.
Ripley''), Spain's Pedro Almodovar (``All About My Mother''),
American-indie auteur David O. Russell (``Three Kings''),
Oscar-favorite Milos Forman (``Man on the Moon''), old-pro Norman
Jewison (``The Hurricane'') and boy-wonder M. Night Shyamalan
(``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   In the best actor race, the stars of the year's three critical
darlings _ Russell Crowe (``The Insider''), Jim Broadbent
(``Topsy-Turvy'') and ``Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty'') _ would
each seem to have a lock, with the two other slots likely to go to
Richard Farnsworth (``The Straight Story'') and Denzel Washington
(``The Hurricane'').
</P>
<P>
   But not to be counted out in this crowded field are Terence
Stamp (``The Limey''), Bob Hoskins (``Felicia's Journey''), Jim
Carrey (``Man on the Moon''), Matthew Broderick (``Election''),
Matt Damon (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'') and _ long shots with a
breath of a chance _ either Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin for their
inspired comedy turns in ``Bowfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the male actor category, three sure things dominate the
best actress field: Hilary Swank, who swept most of the pre-Oscar
awards for her gender-bending turn in ``Boys Don't Cry''; Annette
Bening, as Spacey's long-suffering wife in ``American Beauty''; and
Julianne Moore, as two very different kinds of women in ``The End
of the Affair'' and ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Other actresses getting a lot of buzz are England's Janet McTeer
(``Tumbleweeds'') and Kate Winslet (``Holy Smoke''), France's
Cannes multi-winner Elodie Bouchez (``The Dreamlife of Angels''),
perpetual Oscar-nominee Meryl Streep (``Music of the Heart''), and,
less likely, but not inconceivable, Sigourney Weaver (``A Map of
the World'') and Reese Witherspoon (``Election'').
</P>
<P>
   For best supporting actor, the front-runners are Christopher
Plummer (as TV's Mike Wallace in ``The Insider''), Philip Seymour
Hoffman (for both ``Magnolia'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''),
Tom Cruise (``Magnolia''), Michael Caine (``The Cider House
Rules'') and Haley Joel Osment (the tormented kid of ``The Sixth
Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders are Peter Fonda (``The Limey''), Max von Sydow
(``Snow Falling on Cedars''), Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley (both
for ``American Beauty''), Philip Baker Hall (``Magnolia''), Jude
Law (``The Talented Mr. Ripley''), Michael Clarke Duncan (``The
Green Mile''), and John Malkovich for _ expect to hear this joke a
lot _ being John Malkovich in ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   For best supporting actress, the list seems sure to include
Golden Globe winner Angelina Jolie (``Girl, Interrupted''),
Samantha Morton (``Sweet and Lowdown''), Chloe Sevigny (``Boys
Don't Cry''), and either Catherine Keener or Cameron Diaz (both for
``Being John Malkovich'').
</P>
<P>
   Also in running are Natalie Portman (``Anywhere But Here''),
Thora Birch (``American Beauty''), Cherry Jones (``Cradle Will
Rock''), Jean Smart (``Guinevere''), Jean Hamilton (``Holy
Smoke''), and Toni Collette (``The Sixth Sense'').
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar ceremony will be held Sunday, March 26, with Billy
Crystal as host.

VENTURA QUITS REFORM PARTY, SAYING LEADERSHIP IS FRACTURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's highest-ranking
elected official, said Friday that he was resigning from the party
over his growing dissatisfaction with its fractured leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking outside the governor's residence in St. Paul, Ventura
described party leaders as ``hopelessly dysfunctional'' and said he
could not support a political organization that might have Pat
Buchanan, a former conservative commentator, as its presidential
candidate and David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, as a
party member.
</P>
<P>
   It was yet another odd moment for the party that was founded
eight years ago by Texas billionaire Ross Perot, that has been
flirting with Donald Trump, the casino owner from New York, as a
presidential candidate and that until Friday could count Ventura, a
former professional wrestler, as its biggest success. And the move
appeared to leave Perot once again the party's most important
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the national party is going in directions that
are not conducive to what we believe here in Minnesota and what we
want the party to be,'' Ventura said, wearing a black and yellow
Rolling Stones jacket in 10-degree weather. ``And so that's the
move I'm making, that I'm disaffiliating with any of the national
Reform Party anymore. There comes a time when you have to cut bait
and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's announcement comes at a critical time for the Reform
Party in two respects. One, it could influence whether Trump,
Ventura's choice for the party's presidential nomination, decides
to run. Trump said Friday that he intended to announce his decision
on Monday in New York and left open the possibility that he might
follow Ventura out of the party and run as an independent, with
Ventura's support.
</P>
<P>
   And two, the decision comes as the party's national committee is
planning to vote on Saturday in Nashville, Tenn., on whether to
remove the newly elected party chairman, Jack Gargan, an ally of
Ventura's, over questions about his leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, a retired financial consultant from Cedar Key, Fla.,
took over last month, succeeding Russell Verney, a close associate
of Perot's.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura cited the Nashville meeting as a major reason for his
departure, saying the efforts to oust Gargan and return control of
the party to forces loyal to Perot violated party rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a small group of power brokers in this party that
won't allow it to grow nationally,'' Ventura said, referring to the
Perot supporters. He mentioned Verney specifically, calling him
Russell Varmint and Russell Vermin.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Nashville, Gargan said his opponents
were ``trying to take my head on a platter, but I don't think they
have the votes.'' He described Ventura's resignation as ``quite a
loss for the party,'' adding: ``There are ramifications in many
different ways. I haven't sorted out where they affect us. They'll
certainly hit us in a lot of planes, none of them positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney laughed at Ventura's references to him, saying he was
using ``a few of my wrestling names.'' In more serious tones, he
said Ventura's departure would have only ``minimal impact'' on the
party, allowing it to proceed with the selection of a presidential
nominee and to refocus party efforts on policies rather than
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Gargan's leadership style as autocratic but said
the vote to remove him could be canceled if Gargan demonstrated his
willingness ``to work as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders had hoped to turn their movement into a viable
third party. But both of Perot's presidential runs proved only a
boon to Democrats, as his support, 19 percent of the vote in 1992
and 8 percent in 1996, came largely at the expense of the
Republican nominees, President George Bush and former Sen. Bob
Dole, each of whom lost to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura's departure opens the door for Perot once again,
either as a candidate for a third presidential campaign _ he has
not ruled it out, Verney said _ or as the force behind Buchanan,
who left the Republican Party last year complaining that a race
toward the political center by Republicans and Democrats had made
themselves virtually indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has declined all recent requests for comments regarding
the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the party nomination is eligible for $12.6 million
in federal campaign funds, as a result of Perot's finish in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Trump called Ventura's decision ``a
devastating blow'' to the party: adding, ``Jesse was their star.
But there is great disunity in the party, and the loss of Jesse
creates a big liability for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to answer any questions about his own political
future, other than to say that his forthcoming announcement ``might
surprise you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own political future, Ventura said he was returning
to his roots as a nominal member of the Independence Party of
Minnesota, which officially changed its name in 1996 to the Reform
Party. In his remarks, he urged other Reform Party members in
Minnesota to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Ventura's move disappointed other party members in his
state, many of whom signed on only because of his growing
popularity two years ago, when he came from nowhere in the polls to
defeat two mainstream opponents, Norm Coleman, a Republican and
former mayor of St. Paul, and Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state
attorney general and son of the former vice president and
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Ventura became an instant
celebrity, raising money for the state party by marketing action
dolls of himself, videos of his past exploits and all manner of
other tchotchkes bearing his likeness. He also served as a beacon
for other would-be Reform candidates, including Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Paul Larsen, a party precinct chairman, said sadly:
``It sends a bad message to the Reform Party people who have been
working really hard. A lot of work has been wasted.''

AFTER LONG DELAY, RUSSIA SETS DATE FOR SPACE STATION MODULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The next component of the International Space
Station, the long-delayed Russian crew module, will be launched in
July, NASA and the Russian Space Agency announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings this week near Moscow to review progress of the
$60 billion project, the agencies agreed that Russia would launch
its Zvezda service module between July 8 and 18 from the Baikonur
space center in Kazakhstan. Zvezda, meaning ``star'' in Russian, is
to join the station's first two segments, one Russian and one
American, which have been in orbit since the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a firm date to launch the service module, which is
already two years late, comes a week after NASA's administrator,
Daniel S. Goldin, announced plans to substitute a U.S.-made backup
module for the Russian unit if there were further delays. Goldin,
saying he was ``frustrated and disappointed'' by repeated Russian
delays and promises, said the United States and 14 other partner
nations could no longer allow Russia to stall construction of the
station, one of the most ambitious engineering projects ever
undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   The 42,000-pound Zvezda segment, which is to provide the station
with living quarters, propulsion and flight control, and some
laboratory space during its early construction stages, must be in
place before crews take up residence on the orbiting outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman, said the Zvezda module was
complete and ready to go. ``This is the first time we have picked a
launch time frame when the module itself is ready to fly,'' Herring
said, ``and that is the cause of some optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Herring said that setting Zvezda's launching date would not
change plans to ready the substitute American unit, called the
interim control module, which Goldin said could fly as early as
December if the Russian component was not launched on time. If the
service module is further delayed, or lost in a launching accident,
the U.S. unit could fly by the end of this year or early in 2001,
Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   While the smaller interim control module contains no living
quarters or laboratory space like Zvezda, it can stabilize the
space station and reboost it to counteract orbital decay. If the
U.S. unit is not needed to substitute for the Russian module, NASA
officials said, it will be sent to the space station anyway at the
end of next year to give the outpost added propulsion ability.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in launching the service module were initially caused by
the Russian Space Agency's not having enough money to finish it.
But the latest problems have been with the Proton rocket that is
supposed to boost Zvezda into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Two Proton rockets suffered explosive launching failures last
July and October, and further flights were delayed while the
accidents were investigated and parts of the rocket's upper stages
were redesigned. Four slightly modified Protons are scheduled to be
flown before a model with more revisions is tested. NASA officials
said the service module was to fly on the third flight of the
more-modified rocket.

   WASHINGTON _ The unpredictable governor of Minnesota, Jesse
Ventura, announced Friday that he is taking his state's Reform
Party out of the national organization to protest against the
infighting that has plagued it in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a former professional wrestler who swept to the
governorship in 1998 on a wave of anti-establishment feeling, thus
formalized a split that had long been on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura and the Reform Party's founder, Ross Perot, the Texan
billionaire, have sparred for months over every aspect of the
party's activity, from its future direction to its presidential
candidate, and even the venue of its next convention.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's gathering descended into open warfare when Ventura
capitalized on his advantage of actually having won high electoral
office to secure his choice of national chairman, Jack Gargan of
Florida. He then set about vying for the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   But with the party headquarters about to move to Florida and out
of his purview, Perot fought back. He encouraged Pat Buchanan, a
former Reaganite and television presenter, to compete for the
party's presidential nomination, and even hinted that he might
consider another run himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 1992 campaign that put the Reform Party on the map
and indirectly allowed President Bill Clinton to win.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, meanwhile, backs Donald Trump, the New York property
tycoon, for this year's nomination, while not excluding the idea
that he might run himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the party so comprehensively split, Perot called a crisis
meeting in Nashville for Saturday to discuss the crisis. Ventura's
announcement Friday was his way of explaining why he would not be
turning up.
</P>
<P>
   Perot is now expected to take back control of the national
organization, and Ventura could use his party's base in Minnesota
to form a new party of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Reform Party now, though, is not just the
aftermath of the rivalry between two big personalities.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of the party's platform _ disgust with the system
and reform of political funding _ has been hijacked while the
Reform Party squabbled.
</P>
<P>
   Overhauling the system is now associated not with Perot, or even
Ventura, but with the Republican challenger, Senator John McCain,
and the Democrat, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   With the reason for its existence in question, the Reform Party
is hemorrhaging support by the day. Mostly, it is going to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Perotists will be hard put to get it back; the Venturans may
have jumped ship just in time. &QL;

   Winding Down, in Any Language
</P>
<P>
   British executives are far more likely than other Western
European executives to raise a glass after a stressful day at work,
according to a new survey, while Italian executives are most likely
to burn off stress with after-work exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, of about 1,500 executives at large European
companies, is conducted annually for United Parcel Service by TNS
Harris. Most of the questions concern the business climate, hiring
plans and such subjects; a few get to more human-scale topics, like
what to do after a hard day at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Big majorities across the board said that was the time to
socialize, but British executives were 20 times as likely as their
Spanish peers to mention having an alcoholic drink.
</P>
<P>
   French executives were most likely to say they go out for a
meal; the Dutch were most likely to say they cook or eat at home.
Only in Belgium did a substantial number _ 11 percent _ say they
cap a tough day by working into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the results simply record the persistence of national
stereotypes. Year after year, respondents rate German executives
the hardest-working, Italians the slowest to make decisions, Dutch
the most internationally minded and so on. Yet Spanish executives,
whom few respondents called the hardest working, turn out to be the
ones who stay in closest touch with the office while on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As for which economies in Western Europe will grow fastest over
the next three years, respondents looked to Spain, with Germany and
France distant runners-up. But their forecasting record has been
less than stellar: in 1997, fewer than 1 in 14 picked either
Ireland or Greece, whose growth rates have since been nearly triple
those of the rest of the field. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ When are a woman's breasts politically correct,
and when are they just downright offensive?
</P>
<P>
   The question has been blowing up a fair storm in San Francisco,
a city whose billboards are plastered with the usual array of
oversized mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
   But one specific billboard, for a particularly graphic
advertising campaign promoting breast-cancer awareness, has run the
gauntlet of controversy, censorship and a much-ballyhooed outcry
over civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, sponsored by a local group called The Breast
Cancer Fund, set out to be deliberately shocking by superimposing
images of mastectomy scars on the chests of glamour models.
</P>
<P>
   One is made to look like the cover of Cosmopolitan, with the
word ``Mastectomy'' written in place of the magazine title.
</P>
<P>
   Another sends up the ad for the Calvin Klein perfume Obsession,
with the words ``Obsessed With Breasts'' replacing the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, the ads started appearing at bus stations
in the suburban communities to the east and south of San Francisco
and were intended to be introduced into the city as well. But then
the furor broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by a handful of complaints from the public, transport
companies and billboard firms removed the posters on the grounds
not only that they were offensive but that they risked causing
traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in San Francisco, the company that had volunteered to
distribute them for free suddenly got cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see it _ a four-by-six-foot picture of a woman's
torso and you see these two bare red scars, I mean, to see a
woman's terribly, terribly scarred body _ it's just not for public
consumption,'' said Lew Lillian, head of the billboard firm Outdoor
Systems. ``It's too shocking. Too upsetting. Too provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ads have proven to be nowhere near as provocative as the
attempt to suppress them. Lillian's decision provoked a torrent of
protest, from the local media and the San Francisco branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Martin, the founder of The Breast Cancer Fund whose own
mastectomy scars are the ones featured in the ads, decried what she
called an attempt ``to hide fundamental aspects of this disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't understand how you can have boobs pictured all over
the place, pardon the expression, and not show one very real side
of breast cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a couple of days ago, a rival billboard firm called Eller
Media stepped in and volunteered to post the images in Lillian's
place. They will be going up on about five billboards as soon as
space becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet victory for the voice of liberal justice in a city
virtually built on such sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to protect the residents of San Francisco from a
shocking sight on the streets is kind of like protecting the folks
in Los Angeles from smog,'' commented local columnist Ken Garcia.
``You can try. You will fail.'' &QL;

FOR LOVE OF THE GAME OF YORE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once we get past the All-Star Wheelchair
Basketball Clinic, the All-Star Park Dedication Ceremony, the
Retired Players Association Banquet, the AT&AMP;T Legends Shootout, the
TeamUp Celebration, the Nestle Crunch Celebrity Slam Dunk Contest,
the Mascot Slam Dunk Contest _ What? No Team Trainers, Ball Boys,
or Dance Team Slam Dunk contests? _ the Fleer Celebrity Half-Court
Hustle, the Sony All-Star 2Ball, the Million Dollar Shot, the
Schick Rookie Challenge, the AT&AMP;T Shootout, and the NBA.com Slam
Dunk Contest, they have actually scheduled the 49th NBA All-Star
Game, which takes place shortly after 6:30 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the innocent days of yore, and not just the very first
All-Star Game in Boston 49 years ago, which was played before more
than 3,000 empty seats as part of a Boston Garden tripleheader. My
first such affair was in 1970, and I flew down to Philadelphia the
morning of the game with, among others, John Havlicek, Boston's
only representative. There may or may not have been a luncheon (if
there was, I wasn't invited), and the pregame highlight was a
surprise snow squall that tied up Philly traffic and caused the
entire West team (save Dick Van Arsdale, who had arrived by himself
for some reason) to arrive less than an hour before tap-off. Van
Arsdale will not remember this, but we conversed at some length in
an otherwise empty room. (Given that I was a 23-year-old rookie on
the beat, it was an event of some consequence for me.)
</P>
<P>
   The game? Not bad. The East won it, 142-135. Willis Reed (21
points, 11 rebounds) was the MVP. Havlicek had his usual 17.
Perhaps the most memorable thing about the evening was Wilt
Chamberlain's truly indescribable coat, but it was still a pretty
good show.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it was all about the game, and only the game. Pretty
naive, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all about sponsors and glitz and alleged fan
participation, and maybe that's OK for some, but it speaks quite
loudly to the general state of affairs in a league that is in an
interesting transition phase. We are deep into a post-Magic and
post-Larry era and we are just starting to negotiate our way
through a post-Michael experience. TV ratings are hurting, tickets,
even those already bought and paid for in many instances, are being
used as kindling, and there is a general feeling of disorientation
as the NBA tries to position itself in a brave new world of
changing sports tastes and limited attention spans (X-Games,
anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   How oddly appropriate that this particular game is being held in
the Bay Area, the Golden State Warriors being a franchise whose
most relevant historical analogy would be the Ottoman Empire of the
early 20th century, forever dubbed in historical circles as the
``Sick Man of Europe.'' This is a disabled franchise, all right,
decades (plural) removed from its last glory phase, a run in the
'70s that culminated in the 1975 championship. The Warriors aren't
the handy reference point for ineptitude that the Clippers are,
simply because there is only one Donald T. Sterling. They aren't
funny-bad, just bad-bad, and they barely register on the local
sports radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   It may tell you all you need to know about the franchise and the
league that the team is practically apoplectic about the fact that
Antawn Jamison, its nice second-year player and the closest thing
to a marquee performer in its employ, has a bad knee and may not be
able to participate in either the Slam Dunk Contest, or the Rookie
Challenge that matches up last year's best new players against this
year's, the idea being that there wasn't an All-Star Game last year
due to that nasty labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   How pathetic is that? But these are the kind of peripheral
issues that occupy the thoughts of those in power these days,
except that such matters aren't secondary at all. They are primary.
</P>
<P>
   We keep hearing about how the league desperately needs to
develop a new crop of stars. In that case, the Trail Blazers had
better not expect many good calls if they wind up playing the
Lakers in the playoffs. What a fascinating contrast, these two. The
Blazers are an ensemble cast, depending on overall offense-defense
balance and depth not seen since the '80s. Rasheed Wallace is here
to represent them, but he doesn't have to be. No one would have
complained had Sharif Abdur-Rahim taken his place. The Lakers, of
course, are all about Shaq, Kobe, and 10 character actors. They may
be a team to Phil Jackson, but not to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA can no longer help itself. It is what it is, a
convenient way to make money on an international scale. Is anyone
talking in terms of ``Hey, let's have a really good game, maybe an
overtime or two?'' Uh-uh. But they're only too glad to let you know
that the game will be broadcast in 205 countries in 42 languages.
</P>
<P>
   A good NBA All-Star Game is not necessarily oxymoronic. There
have been some glorious demonstrations of the product in the past,
and that's what the NBA needs Sunday, not the Fleer Celebrity
Half-Court Hustle, or a dunk contest that lost its cachet when
Michael and Dominique sat down, or even a 3-point shot contest that
will never be the same without Larry Bird's personality, even if
someone comes along and makes 50 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, that's my curse. I care about the game, not how
many T-shirts the league can sell in Marseille or what goodies are
available on NBA.com. I refuse to apologize for that.
</P>

 BEAU JACK, 78, LIGHTWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION IN 1940s  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beau Jack, a former Georgia shoeshine boy who became the world
lightweight champion and Madison Square Garden's biggest boxing
draw of the 1940s, then toiled again at a bootblack's stand when
the cheering stopped, died Feb. 9 at a nursing home in Miami. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when the old Garden at Eighth Avenue and 50th
Street was boxing's mecca, crowds of 18,000 and more roared for a
young man from Augusta, Ga., who wasn't especially powerful or
superbly skillful. What enthralled the fight fans was his sheer
energy, the flurries of punches he threw from the opening bell to
the final round.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Sidney Walker in Augusta, Ga., but a grandmother who
raised him called him Beau Jack, and he found fame _ if not fortune
_ fighting all the great lightweights of his era. He was a
main-event attraction at the Garden 21 times, more than any other
fighter, he won and lost the lightweight (135-pound) title twice,
and he drew what is evidently the biggest gate in boxing history _
almost $35.9 million in War Bond purchases _ fighting at the Garden
as an Army private in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to want to see you fight,'' Beau Jack said years
later. ``When they learned about this little boy from Georgia named
Beau Jack, they loved me, because they found out that I would fight
every second of every round and never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, wealthy white men in the South amused
themselves by placing a group of perhaps 6 to 10 young men, usually
blacks, blindfolded inside a ring for a ``battle royal.'' The young
men would slug away until only one was standing, and then the coins
would shower down. After Beau Jack, who had shined shoes at the
Augusta National Golf Club, showed his prowess in one such battle,
club members _ including the renowned golfer Bobby Jones _
bankrolled his entry into pro boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Jack made his pro debut in May 1940 and fought most of his
early bouts in Holyoke, Mass., while managed by Chick Wergeles, a
New York City publicity man, who would take him to the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He captured the vacant lightweight title in December 1942 when
he knocked out Tippy Larkin in three rounds at the Garden, the site
of all his title bouts. He lost the title to Bob Montgomery in May
1943, won it back the following November, then lost it in March
1944, all three bouts with Montgomery going 15 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Jack fought in bouts drawing the five largest crowds of
1943 at the Garden, among them victories over the former champions
Henry Armstrong, who had once tutored him, and Fritzie Zivic.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, 1944, two days after Beau Jack and Montgomery were
inducted into the Army, they fought at the Garden _ without purses
_ to raise money for the war effort. The admission fee was purchase
of War Bonds from $25 to $100,000, bringing the record receipts, as
Beau Jack won a nontitle decision.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Jack returned to the ring in December 1945 and had one more
shot at the lightweight title, losing to the champion, Ike
Williams, on a sixth-round knockout in July 1948. By then, he was
hampered by a bad knee, having broken his left kneecap when his
foot caught in the canvas and he went down for the first time in
his career in his fight with Tony Janiro in February 1947. Beau
Jack had kept fighting, though he could hardly stand, until the
bout was stopped in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1951, then came back for four fights in 1955
before leaving professional boxing for good. He won 83 fights (40
by knockouts) and lost 24 with 5 draws. And he showed remarkable
stamina, fighting three main events in one month _ a 15-round loss
to Montgomery and 10-round decisions over Al Davis and Juan Zurita
in March 1944.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much money Beau Jack made and lost. When he
left the ring, he was said to have had 15 children to support. Five
survive him _ his sons Michael Walker and Gregory Walker and three
daughters, Chonita Walker, Chauneille Sykes and Georgiana
McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Jack returned to Georgia when he left the ring, tended to a
small farm, then went back to shining shoes. For more than 25
years, he had a stand at the Fontainebleau and Doral hotels in
Miami Beach, and he also washed dishes there. But he reprised his
ring years at the old Fifth Street gymnasium in Miami Beach, where
he tutored fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be having no pity for me,'' he once said. ``I've been to
the top of the mountain. I was champion of the world. I've worked
hard all my life, and I'm happy doing what I'm doing. It's an
honest job and a good living _ and I met a lot of nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports columnist Jimmy Cannon visited Beau Jack one day in
1964 at the Fontainebleau and would recall the courage Beau Jack
showed fighting Janiro with a broken kneecap. ``Some of his
customers still call him the Champ,'' Cannon wrote in The New York
Journal-American. ``But many address him as boy. They couldn't have
seen him fight because there was never more of a man.''

   The unpredictable governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura,
announced Friday that he is taking his state's Reform Party out of
the national organization to protest against the infighting that
has plagued it in recent months. The problem for the Reform Party
now, though, is not just the fallout from the rivalry between its
two big personalities, Ventura and founder Ross Perot. While they
squabbled, the party's platform has been hijacked by challengers
John McCain and Bill Bradley. &QL;

BRANDIE TAKES A SNIFF AT LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ One year away from golf and the LPGA tour
has given Brandie Burton perspective.
</P>
<P>
   While recovering from two shoulder surgeries, the 28-year-old
Rialto resident got the opportunity to enjoy the luxury of chasing
after her 7-year-old nephew rather than the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   Another passion, fishing, was more difficult to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cast very well with my left arm,''joked Burton, who
netted a big catch on Friday, a 3-under par 69 in the opening round
of the Los Angeles Women's Championship at Wood Ranch Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Though not having picked up a golf club _ let alone played in a
tournament _ for seven months prior to two weeks ago, Burton was
just one shot off the early pace set by co-leaders Moira Dunn and
Laura Philo.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of approximately 30 family members and friends
from the Inland Empire, Burton birdied five holes to give her some
much-needed confidence following her hiatus from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who has won two majors (the 1993 and 1998 du Maurier
Classics) in a career that began in 1991, missed all of last year's
tour while recovering from her operations.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's shoulder was ailing through much of 1998, though her du
Maurier title helped her finish seventh in money winnings
($652,084).
</P>
<P>
   She tried to come back last March in Tucson following her first
arthroscopic surgery, experienced more pain and underwent another
procedure that shut her down for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just plain tired of playing in pain. It was just time to
fix it,'' Burton said. ``But we're fixed now and we're able to hit
some shots that we couldn't hit before.''
</P>
<P>
   She missed the cut in her first event at of the year in Naples,
Fla. two weeks ago. She considered herself a rookie again that
weekend. Florida tournaments have never equated with success for
Burton, and though she doesn't remember the circumstances, she did
play a round at Wood Ranch as a junior golfer.
</P>
<P>
   However, Burton knows one good round isn't enough to deem her
ready for a return to her old form. In Florida, for example, she
had opening rounds of 74-74 before falling to a 78.
</P>
<P>
   Since turning professional in 1991, Burton has been named to all
four United States' teams in the Solheim Cup, women's golf's
equivalent to the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Her injury could put that streak in jeopardy for 2000, but she
figures a good year could earn at least one of two captain's picks
in addition to the 10 members who play their way onto the team for
their performance over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Her setback of last season proved to be a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize there's life after golf,'' she said. ``(But) I'm
pretty excited to be able to hit that little white ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's once tireless work ethic needs to be altered as her
repaired shoulder is unable to take the strain of 18 holes and the
usual postround practicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that I have to change. I can't sit out there
and bang balls like I used to,'' Burton said. ``That's probably
what I'm trying to figure out right now in the next month or so.
How much can I practice?''
</P>
<P>
   Burton figures she will find other ways to keep busy off the
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can do a little more fishing now.''

BABBITT SUGGESTS REVIEWS OF FEDERAL DAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ANGELES, Wash. _ All federal dams should undergo the same
periodic full-scale review of operations, benefits and
environmental impacts that privately owned dams are subject to,
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal came as he celebrated a milestone in the drive to
remove two privately owned dams from the Elwha River on the Olympic
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these dams were federal projects, there would have been no
legal opportunity to review their license and we wouldn't be in the
process of restoring salmon to this river,'' Babbitt said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that privately owned dams be relicensed through
the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency was a key vehicle for
beginning the process of removing the two aging dams from the
Elwha.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists, sportsmen and Indian tribes argued that the
Elwha dams provided few benefits while blocking salmon migration
and destroying runs that once totaled hundreds of thousands of fish
in the Olympic Peninsula's greatest river system.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government owns many of the major dams in the West,
including six on the Columbia River and four controversial dams on
the lower Snake River in eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Only one federal project, Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River
in Utah, has been forced to change its operations due to damage it
was causing to the rivershore, sand bars and aquatic life
downstream in Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Any review of federal dams should include ``a complete
environmental impact statement,'' Babbitt said. He said he is not
making a formal recommendation, but is discussing the idea ``after
the tremendous success we've had on privately owned projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt was in Olympic National Park to mark the imminent
federal acquisition of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams. Congress
has appropriated money to buy the dams and begin the process of
dismantling the Elwha Dam.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has argued that there is
agreement only to remove one dam, Babbitt said Friday that ``a
divide has been crossed'' and both dams are certain to be taken
down. He described the process as one of restoring the ``biological
heart'' to Olympic National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial issue of dam removal yielded to good feelings
as Port Angeles officials, leaders of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe
and members of Congress celebrated the fact that salmon will be
returning to the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be an area where pink salmon spawn in mass.
Thousands of pinks will be right in front of us,'' Brian Winter,
Elwha project coordinator with the National Park Service, said to
Babbitt and Reps. Norm Dicks and Jay Inslee, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it take for the salmon runs to restore
themselves?'' asked Dicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've calculated 30 years,'' Winter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks asked how many salmon will return to the river with
removal of just the Elwha Dam. ``If you just take out the lower
one, you just have 30,000 fish,'' Winter replied. It would
represent an eight-fold increase over the river's current fishery.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the biggest bang,'' he said, would come if the Glines
Canyon Dam is taken down. It blocks off 70 miles of the Elwha River
and tributary streams from spawning salmon. If all 10 runs came
back to pre-dam numbers, nearly 400,000 salmon and steelhead would
return to the river over their two-to-four year spawning cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see both dams come out, one after the
other,'' Frances Charles, vice chairwoman of the Lower Elwha
Klallam Tribe, told Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   The Elwha dams were built more than 70 years ago without fish
ladders. The Glines Canyon Dam sits within Olympic National Park,
having been built more than 20 years before President Franklin D.
Roosevelt toured the Olympic Peninsula in 1937 and pressed Congress
to create the park.
</P>
<P>
   Kept in a pristine state, the upper Elwha will be ``a fully
functional salmon watershed'' if the Glines Canyon Dam comes down,
Olympic National Park Superintendent David Morris said in
introducing Babbitt. ``We here in the park are thrilled to be part
of this grand endeavor,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to remove the Elwha dams has lasted nearly 20
years. The idea was first advanced in the early 1980s in Bruce
Brown's book ``Mountain in the Clouds,'' which said the dams were
built in violation of a state law that required fish ladders.
</P>
<P>
   The Elwha tribe has pressed tirelessly to restore the river. The
dam's owner, the Ft. James Corp. and Daishowa America Corp. _ whose
mill in Port Angeles receives power from the projects _ have worked
to find alternative sources of electricity. ``Over the years our
interests have differed but today we are together,'' said David
Tamaki, president of Daishowa America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Congress passed legislation authorizing removal of the
dams. A prime mover was New Jersey's then-Sen. Bill Bradley, who
came out alone to the Olympic Peninsula to inspect the dams and
their surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has undergone a radical change in
thinking. In 1990, then-Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan was angered
when he read a news story in which Maureen Finnerty, then the park
superintendent, made the case for restoring the river. But Babbitt
has backed river restoration since he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has presided at ceremonies from Maine to Oregon marking
the removal of fish-blocking dams. ``As we restore this river, we
are putting together a model of what can happen across the United
States,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But a few moments earlier, Port Angeles Mayor Larry Doyle read a
letter from Gorton. Its message: Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   In a jocular warning, Gorton told Babbitt not to ``cross the
mountains'' with his dam removal ideas. Gorton has vowed to block
any consideration of removing federal projects from the Columbia
River system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Barrick Gold, the most successful hedger in the mining
business, curtails the practice, that's news. And when the same
company gives up some of its locked-in gains to make a bet that
gold will rally, something has changed in this precious-metal
market.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Barrick up to? Barrick, based in Toronto, says it is
trying to satisfy its shareholders, some of whom think hedging is a
sin, although the practice allowed Barrick to produce record
earnings last year as the price of gold first hit a 20-year low and
then finished 1999 up just 40 cents an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for the benefit of our shareholders,'' said Randall
Oliphant, Barricks' president. They need it. At $18.31 on Friday,
the stock is off 24 percent from September, when gold prices surged
on the news that 15 European central banks would restrict their
gold sales. A gold rally would also help company employees with
stock options. More than half of Oliphant's 825,000 stock options
are still out of the money.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrick is also falling into line with the more militant
gold producers, money managers and investors who argue that to get
gold prices higher, producers have to support the price of gold
themselves. ``We want to be clear about the need for the industry
to show leadership and confidence in gold,'' said Jay Taylor, the
president of Placer Dome, as the company announced its own hedging
pause, on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is expressed by not hedging, which among gold's true
believers is just as dirty as betting directly against the price of
gold. Gold producers hedge by selling borrowed gold to lock in the
current price and then enhance that by investing the proceeds in
government securities. If gold doesn't rise faster than the rate of
interest they are earning, the producers come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in producer hedging, the argument goes, would stop
the selling of borrowed gold to lock in prices. In 1999, a net 4.3
million ounces of gold were sold by producers to hedge, equaling
about 10 percent of the total gold supply, according to Philip
Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services, a
precious-metals research firm based in London.
</P>
<P>
   He now believes that, over all, producers will do no net selling
of gold for hedging purposes in the first half of this year. Placer
Dome, for example, will forgo its plans to sell two million ounces
of gold for hedging this year.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is how much Barrick's and Placer Dome's
reductions in hedging _ and those of other producers _ will change
the outlook for gold. Will this concerted effort only get the metal
safely above $300 an ounce or can it push the price even higher?
</P>
<P>
   That is important. If gold, which was at $313.50 an ounce in the
futures market on Friday, doesn't rise much more, Barrick's gold
bet may not look so good.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging each year's production _ especially at prices that are
well above the going rate for the metal _ seems as if it would
satisfy investors. Indeed, Barrick has netted $66 an ounce more
than the annual average spot price of gold for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But gold investors want something different, as some of them
made clear in a survey taken by Barrick last year. They want a
company's earnings to respond quickly to a rise in the gold price,
although they often seem to forget that this means it would respond
just as quickly to a decline.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, they can effectively bet on the price of gold. And
they hope they can get an even bigger boost through the stock
price, because a dollar increase in gold typically goes directly to
the earnings of a company.
</P>
<P>
   This investor preference is seen in a comparison of the recent
performance of Newmont Mining, which is not a hedger, and Barrick.
Since the gold rally began in August, Newmont stock is up 24.4
percent. Barrick, which had a guaranteed price of $370 an ounce
this year, is down 1.7 percent. (Barrick, however, has trounced
Newmont over the last decade.)
</P>
<P>
   So Barrick moved to please its investors by betting directly on
gold through call options. Barrick will get a dollar-for-dollar
jolt to earnings if the gold price moves above $319 an ounce after
March 1 this year and $335 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Barrick paid for these options by giving up some of the
guaranteed returns that had been locked in through its hedging. The
options cost $6 an ounce for 2000 and $12 an ounce for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the price of gold has to rise over $325 an ounce
this year and $347 an ounce next year before the company will make
more than it would have without the options.
</P>
<P>
   Barrick's investors, Oliphant, explained, ``want a certain
amount of assurance _ and a lottery ticket.''

LEGISLATORS CONFRONT HIGH COST OF DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Legislators from the six New England states and New
York gathered Friday at the Massachusetts State House to explore
how they might work together to provide affordable prescription
drug prices and improved pharmaceutical access to the elderly and
the poor living in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this whole group, now with New York going with
us, has made other states watch us and helped create a snowball
effect on the importance of bringing down drug prices,'' said Mass.
state Senator Mark C. Montigny, a Democrat, who led the meeting.
``We're sending a clear message to Congress that this health care
issue won't go away and makes it one of the key agenda items on all
congressional races as well as the presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Massachusetts approved legislation that provides $72
million in pharmaceutical aid to hold down prices for state
employees and retirees, Medicaid recipients, individuals subsidized
by the state, and the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Other states such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York
said they have comparable programs while New Hampshire is just
beginning to grapple with ways to lower prescription drug costs for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot rely on the pharmaceutical industry to control drug
costs, so the consumer needs the help of their government, and in
this case I think we, the states, can be more effective if we work
together,'' said Robert Gottfried, a New York assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   One way to bring down drug prices is by aggregating the 13.5
million people in New England and the 18 million in New York into a
collective buying pool to gain steep discounts and rebates _ akin
to the significant price breaks given to Medicaid programs and
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is for each state to legislate pharmaceutical
discounts _ a move that members estimated would slash prices by 20
percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the states, have economic power, and we ought to think
about using it,'' said G. Steven Rowe, speaker of the Maine House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, members of the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries were highly critical of the New England
legislators efforts, particularly price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price controls will wreak havoc on the biotech industry's
ability to raise private capital to support innovative drug
developments and to bring life-saving medicines to patients,'' said
Carl B. Feldbaum, president of Biotechnology Industry Organization,
a trade group whose second-largest membership base is from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we adopt the Canadian-style of price controls we cease to
be the innovative leader of new pharmaceuticals,'' said Jeffrey
Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, which represents the nation's biggest
drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group were highly critical of the pharmaceutical
industry for requiring Americans to pay the highest prices for
drugs compared to nearly every other major industrialized country.
The 11-member Vermont delegation _ by far the largest of the seven
states represented at the meeting _ presented a comparison chart
that showed how residents can save an average of 45 percent buying
some of the most prescribed drugs in Canada rather than Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The chart showed that a 30-pill bottle of Claritin, the popular
antihistamine from Schering-Plough Corp., costs $24.10 in US
dollars in Canada compared to $74.29 from a Vermont pharmacist and
$55.80 for the same prescription over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Poirier, chairman of Vermont's House Committee on Health
and Welfare, said he wants to formalize the border relationship so
that any Vermont physican can routinely fax a prescription to a
Canadian pharmacy, which then ships the lower-priced drugs to the
patient.

BUSH AND McCAIN IN AIR WAR, TO THE DELIGHT OF DEMOCRATS 
 (rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Dick Harpootlian, the chairman of the South
Carolina Democratic Party, sounded as giddy as a lottery winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an electronic charnel house,'' Harpootlian said gleefully
of the attack ads with which the leading Republican presidential
candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, have been bludgeoning each other on the airwaves here all
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush and McCain have not only taken the gloves off,'' he said,
``they've put the brass knuckles on. I am one happy camper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader is witness to a primary election media
campaign unlike any this state has seen. After observing the
niceties in New Hampshire, Bush and McCain have for a week been
accusing each other on television and radio of hypocrisy,
untrustworthiness and being in the pocket of lobbyists and other
Washington guardians of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   One even compared the other to President Clinton, which most
Republicans would consider the foulest of all possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Harpootlian may be getting more of a kick out of it
than most people. ``In one Bush ad, they refer to McCain as a pawn
of the left-wing labor bosses,'' he said. ``I had such a hysterical
giggling jag I had to pull the car over.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics with a bite is not unknown in South Carolina, the state
that was home to one of the masters of negative campaigning, the
Republican strategist Lee Atwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say South Carolinians invented hardball politics,
but they're certainly used to them,'' said Blease Graham, a
political scientist at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   And even as McCain sought Friday to end the barrages, vowing in
a New York news conference to pull all his attack ads in South
Carolina, and calling on Bush to do the same, the two camps
continued to trade accusations over who had done more harm to the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both sides had new commercials on the air Thursday that
portrayed each as the victim of the other's viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
not trustworthy, that's over the line,'' Bush says in his new TV
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The new McCain advertisement, called ``Courage,'' depicts the
senator as a hero taking enemy fire. ``Now they're coming after him
here in South Carolina because John McCain will take the government
away from the special interests and give it back to you,'' the
announcer says.
</P>
<P>
   As the crucial Feb. 19 primary here approaches, the shrillness
of the cycle of attack-and-response has all but drowned everything
else out. The two camps have already poured at least $5 million
into television and radio in the state, the heaviest media blanket
anyone can recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we had budgeted for January and February, we
have exceeded that,'' said Debbie Johnson, sales manager for
political advertising for WIS in Columbia, one of the state's
largest television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, too, has been a conduit for attack. Bush has been running
three attack-style commercials on radio, including the spot that
had Harpootlian cackling, in which the state attorney general,
Charlie Condon, says that ``big labor comes out a big winner'' in
McCain's proposals for revamping campaign finance, because the
proposals ``would give union bosses and the liberal media more
control over elections.''
</P>
<P>
   And right-to-life groups have initiated an assault on McCain. A
spot running frequently on the radio has a man and a woman
discussing the horrors that might befall the U.S. Supreme Court if
former Sen. Warren Rudman, a ``very pro-abortion'' New Hampshire
Republican who serves as McCain's campaign chairman, was to be
named attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want someone like that helping pick Supreme Court
judges,'' the woman says. ``I'm pro-life!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then don't vote for John McCain,'' the man advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't. I'm voting for George Bush,'' the woman replies.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of the confrontation may make the race rawer and more
compelling _ ``Lee Atwater had a famous statement; he called it
`taking the bark off,''' Graham said _ but it's beginning to make
Republicans nervous. As in any pitched battle, there is the worry
of collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for Democrats,'' Harpootlian observed, ``is that
when these guys get done with each other, there is not going to be
much left.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is what Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican
Leadership Council, says has him dismayed. The centrist group,
based in Washington, helped head off a bruising television war in
New Hampshire by putting on a series of commercials there warning
Steve Forbes not to engage in the type of negative advertising that
he had done in 1996 against Bob Dole. Dole's campaign never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja vu in Charleston and Spartanburg and Beaufort. ``We
wish they would both stick to their positive agendas,'' Miller
said. ``We don't want a damaged nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina may have turned nasty for the Republicans, said
Graham, because the candidates suddenly had to differentiate
themselves in a hurry. McCain, for instance, had spent months
meeting voters in more than 100 town hall meetings across New
Hampshire. ``We don't have a tradition of town meetings, and we are
three times the size of New Hampshire,'' Graham said. ``It requires
much more of a reliance on media and impersonal contacts; these
candidates were making up for lost time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood may also be the result of the split in two
intensively competitive factions of South Carolina Republicanism.
Former Gov. Carroll Campbell is backing Bush, while Rep. Lindsay
Graham is a frequent presence in television and radio spots for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outside South Carolina say privately that the media
strategies being employed in the state could come back to haunt the
eventual nominee. In particular, they say, they worry that the
introduction of anti-abortion groups into the fight could, for
instance, force Bush to move too far to the right and risk
alienating middle of the road and independent voters, who are
likely to be decisive in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, McCain's media consultant, said that the senator
had made his point in answering Bush's attacks. ``You couldn't not
respond,'' he declared, adding that now the campaign would move on.
``The fact is that's run its course, that's done its job,'' he said
of McCain's recent spots.
</P>
<P>
   But even if McCain's call for a truce leads to a lasting peace,
the bad taste left by the commercials may take time to dissipate.
``Since the New Hampshire primary, Bush's campaign has turned
completely negative, with a hatchet job du jour from the governor
and his attack dogs,'' Howard Opinsky, a McCain campaign spokesman
said Friday. And this was after his candidate pledged in New York
to adopt a more positive campaign posture. .
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush, who was said to have been stung by the accusation
that he was like the president in untrustworthiness, were not
sounding particularly conciliatory either. ``That's one of the
oldest tricks in the book,'' Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush,
said of McCain's renunciation of attack ads. ``Just because it is
not up on the air doesn't mean voters have forgotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever ends up on television in the next week, Harpootlian
intends to enjoy the show. He is a bit incredulous, in fact, that
he gets to watch the battering from the sidelines. ``Usually,'' he
said, ``they save it for us.''

OF CREDIT BUREAUS AND BUSY SIGNALS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13)

   The three major credit bureaus agreed in January to settle
Federal Trade Commission charges that they violated the Fair Credit
Reporting Act by failing to answer phone inquiries from consumers
in a timely way. Two of them, Trans Union and Experian Information
Solutions, agreed to pay $1 million each, and Equifax Credit
Information Services agreed to pay $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC contended that millions of calls from consumers who
wanted to discuss their credit reports, and possible errors, met
with busy signals or long waits on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers never got the access to the agencies that the law
guarantees,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the commission's
Bureau of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement marks the first time that the FTC has collected
monetary settlements since changes to the credit law took effect
three years ago. The credit bureaus, which admitted no wrongdoing,
agreed to answer 90 percent of their calls with an average wait of
no more than 3.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   D. Barry Connelly, president of Associated Credit Bureaus Inc.
in Washington, said the industry's major members had established
toll-free numbers years before 1996. ``Equifax, Experian and Trans
Union entered into voluntary agreements with the FTC, to
standardize telephone practices for consumers who have received a
copy of their report,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the Public
Interest Research Group in Washington, a watchdog group, said the
settlement proved that complaints about the credit bureaus were
valid. ``People aren't being served nor treated like customers,''
he said. He called the $2.5 million a minimal amount for the
bureaus to pay. But, he added ``it's a step forward.''

IRA SUBMITS DISARMAMENT PLAN AFTER NEW GOVERNMENT IS SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m.)

<P>
   LONDON _ The government of Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland that held out the tantalizing promise of an end to the
British province's dangerously polarized political life came to a
halt Friday after only ten weeks in operation.
</P>
<P>
   But in a promising late development, the Irish Republican Army
come up with a long-awaited plan for dismantling its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, cited the
conflict over paramilitary arms as the reason for suspending the
power-sharing administration in Belfast and reimposing rule from
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has dogged the process, it has sapped confidence in the
institutions and we really have got to resolve it once and for
all,'' he said of the weapons issue.
</P>
<P>
   But in a last-minute surprise, the head of the independent panel
on disarmament, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, reported to the
British and Irish governments that IRA contacts had presented him
with a broad outline that he said showed ``the real prospect of
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was far different in tone and content from the
panel's conclusions of two weeks ago that reported no signs of any
IRA cooperation in beginning to disarm and led to Britain's action
shutting down the government.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said Friday night that the
government welcomed the disclosure as a ``development of real
significance'' and that it ``will form the basis of our continuing
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson was acting under legislation enabling Britain to take
back direct rule of Ulster; it was rushed through Parliament during
the week and became law Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The event represented the gravest threat to the unaccustomed
political stability that Ulster has experienced since the signing
of the April 1998 peace settlement, but officials tried to dampen
fears over the consequences for the longer term and to play up the
importance of the IRA offer.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and the
education minister in the new government, said his party would not
walk away from the pact because it believed it was still ``the only
show in town.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the first minister of the Northern Ireland
Assembly, cautioned people against judging Friday's development a
``terminal crisis. It is not that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the difficulties we might have,'' Trimble said,
``no one should regard that as being the end of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he had taken his decision with reluctance but saw
it as the only way of preserving fragile political structures in
Belfast for future revival. Suspending the government Friday, he
claimed, was the only way to spare it being threatened with total
collapse when Trimble meets with members of his party council in
Belfast on Saturday.

THE ONE AND ONLY SAY BELONGS TO BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick will call all the shots on Patriot players, not
Bobby Grier. Belichick was given the authority by owner Bob Kraft,
even though he was not awarded the title of general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick made the decisions to let veterans Bruce Armstrong and
Ben Coates go this week, and he has the full blessing of Kraft to
do whatever he has to do to rebuild the team into a Super Bowl
winner.
</P>
<P>
   When Kraft hired Belichick, he told him to focus on the long
term, and not to panic over any decisions he has to make. Belichick
will take the names off the board on draft day, a luxury Pete
Carroll was not afforded in his three years as head coach. When
Bill Parcells reigned in Foxborough, the scouting staff and
coaching staff worked together in scouting college talent. When
Parcells left, that method changed. Carroll and his staff were kept
out of the draft, with Grier and his scouts taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick won't use his assistant coaches scouting this year as
much as he might like, because he wants them to concentrate on
preparing for mini-camps, training camp, and next season. Then,
when his new staff has settled in for a year and has worked
together for a full season, he will get them out in the field to
spend more time scouting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Coates were two of the better players in franchise
history, but they weren't very smart going out the door. Both were
offered deals and told the team to shove them. Armstrong, due to
make $3.6 million this year, was asked to take a cut to $2 million.
With incentives, he could have taken that back up to $2.5 million.
He said no way and left town. Coates was due to make $2.7 million
and wouldn't listen to any kind of pay cut. The Patriots would have
offered him $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   So now Armstrong and Coates have nothing except their egos,
which now have them unemployed. Coates retired two years ago but
didn't tell anyone. He has completely lost his speed as a pass
catcher and couldn't get open. Bledsoe threw more interceptions
trying to get the ball to Coates this year than to any other
receiver because he tried to force the ball to Ben. Armstrong, if
Stats Inc. is correct, gave up more quarterback sacks than any
other lineman in the league in 1999. However, it should be noted
that he played half a season with a bad knee injury, and his
movement was limited. Nevertheless, Coates and Armstrong will be
extremely lucky, at their ages and with the way they have played
the last two years, to better the offers from New England. History
shows they will likely end up playing for the league minimum
($440,000) with incentive-laden contracts, and never make the money
they turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the Parcells era, the Patriots had a running back named
Leroy Thompson who helped them get to the playoffs. He was making
around $350,000 a year. Parcells offered him $900,000 a year for
three years, or $2.7 million. Thompson said that wasn't enough,
claiming that he was a $1.5 million-per-year back. The Patriots let
him go. The Chiefs signed him just before the season for the
minimum (then less than $300,000), and cut him when the season was
over. Ego.
</P>
<P>
   There are three teams in the league with money to spend in free
agency _ Cleveland, Cincinnati, Philadelphia. The Bengals and
Eagles will not spend to the cap. The Browns will. Once Cleveland
can't spend any more, any player not signed by the Browns is
basically stuck. There's going to be a whole pool of free agents
out of work June 1, when the teams have to cut back even further on
the salary cap to make room for signing their draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Belichick seems to indicate the Patriots are going
to make a serious effort to run the ball. Coates and Armstrong have
been mainstays on the offensive line for most of the past decade,
and the Patriots could never run the ball during that time. Coates
was never interested in blocking, and less so during the last two
seasons. Armstrong was a fine pass blocker most of his career, but
never a good run blocker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Capitals did the Bruins a favor when they picked
up Joe Murphy on waivers Thursday. The Bruins felt certain they
would be facing an arbitration hearing for suspending Murphy
indefinitely for his beef with coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the confrontation between Murphy and Burns had been
building for a couple of weeks before it exploded during the game
at Ottawa. Prior to signing Murphy, the Bruins wondered why San
Jose let him go last year, after he was their leading scorer with
25 goals.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, they soon learned he was a little ``off the
wall'' so to speak, and had a lot to say. When Burns wouldn't put
Murphy out on the ice for a power play in the Ottawa game, Murphy
dropped a few expletives on him, and Burns responded in kind. He
also kept Murphy glued to the bench the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Between periods, Murphy started in on Burns again in the middle
of the locker room, in front of the entire team. When the words
grew stronger, and Murphy and Burns came nose to nose, assistant
coach Ken Baumgartner interceded and cut off any possibility of
punches being thrown. Contrary to a report published elsewhere, the
players did not side with Murphy. They sided with Burns, feeling
that if Murphy had a beef with the coach, he should have handled it
privately and not tried to show up the coach in front of the entire
team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker's troubles will open the door even wider for
Malden's Kevin McGlinchey. McGlinchey, a rookie last season and
generally believed to possess the best arm of all the Atlanta
pitchers, will move into the No. 1 short relief spot if Rocker's
suspension is upheld. McGlinchey had a surprising jump from the
lower minors to the big club last year and was working himself into
the No. 1 relief spot when Rocker roared past him with some
brilliant performances to save the Braves down the stretch . . .
Rams general manager Charley Armey says Lawyer Milloy would have
been the most sought-after player in free agency if the Patriots
did not re-sign him. Charley also had an interesting slant on his
team's Super Bowl victory over Tennessee. ``Our quarterback Kurt
Warner was hurt from the second period on, but he sucked it up and
continued to play. This kid (Josh) Evans really nailed Warner on a
pass rush, getting him in the ribs and jamming his left shoulder
into the ground. Kurt had trouble from that hit the rest of the
game. There was some talk around that if we had to go to overtime
to win the game, he wouldn't have been able to play, because he
took another tremendous hit throwing our last touchdown pass. But I
think he would have been able to play in overtime. Although he got
hit hard again, that one didn't have the same impact the one he got
in the second period had.''

   The New York lawyers whom Donna Harris-Lewis hired to represent
her in her first trial against the doctors who treated her husband,
the late Reggie Lewis, have gone out of business and she has hired
the Boston law firm of Rossman &AMP; Rossman to represent her in the
re-trial, scheduled for April . . . What's going on with Bill
Russell? He's invisible around here for 30 years since his
retirement, and now he is selling himself all over the place. He
has a full-page ad in a national memorabilia publication, selling
everything but his sweat socks. The same issue also has him making
appearances in Worcester and Roslyn Heights, N.Y. It says in the
magazine that Russell has hired Hollywood Collectibles to be his
exclusive agent. Of all the junk being offered, here's my favorite.
For $100, you can purchase ``Promo Bear'' which is ``exclusively
produced by Reggie Jackson's ``Mr. Octobears.'' It is green and has
a basketball logo on the front, and Russell on the back. And here's
the clincher: It has a card signed by Russell.

LOOKING AT A COMPANY FOR THE STOCKS IT OWNS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Value isn't necessarily an oxymoron in the highflying technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point may be Seagate Technology of Scotts Valley,
Calif., the largest independent maker of disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   For several quarters, the disk drive business has been mired in
one of its periodic spells of brutal price competition. Prices in
Seagate's markets fell an average of 9 percent for the fiscal year
ended June 1999, even as unit sales rose. But Seagate bulls,
including many analysts, say the $6.8 billion company, with its
diverse product mix, technological edge and strong balance sheet,
should weather the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best long-term position in the industry,'' said
Ann Miletti, an analyst with Strong Investments of Menomonee Falls,
Wis., which owns the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Seagate's current appeal has little to do with its disk
drive business. The company has acquired equity stakes in three
publicly traded companies as part of a strategy to forge
relationships with businesses that possess technologies related to
disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   These stakes have skyrocketed in value and are now worth a total
of $75.1958 per share of Seagate. Because Seagate now trades at
just $46.4375 a share, analysts view the company as an asset play.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the math: Seagate owns 30 percent of Veritas Software, a
producer of software used in storage area networks; the stake is
worth the equivalent of $70.499 for each Seagate share. Seagate's
15.8 percent stake in the SanDisk Corp., a maker of memory data
storage products, is worth $3.6548 for each share, and its 19.9
percent stake in Gadzoox Networks, a maker of products that connect
computer systems to data storage devices, is worth $1.042 for each
Seagate share.
</P>
<P>
   The market may be coming around: Seagate shares have surged from
a 52-week low of $25.125 in July, though they are still below their
high of $48.8125, reached in December.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for analysts to value Seagate's
investments conservatively. First, the market often discounts the
value of stakes in public companies because of the tax bite the
owner would face after selling them. Moreover, such large positions
can be difficult to liquidate, and technology shares _ often
volatile _ are prone to sudden sell-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some analysts say Seagate is not getting nearly enough
credit. Miletti, for one, values Seagate's disk drive and smaller
tape drive and software businesses at $17 a share. After applying a
theoretical tax rate of 35 percent to the market value of the three
public holdings, she values them at $48.87727 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.54 billion in cash and equivalents on Seagate's balance
sheet as of Dec. 31, means an additional $7.40 a share. That adds
up to $73.27727, or 58 percent more than the shares' current price.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, analysts say, investors are getting the disk drive
business free, along with Seagate's 35 percent stake in privately
held Dragon Systems, a maker of voice recognition software.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the stock trade below what experts say it is worth?
``Wall Street doesn't like the disk drive business,'' says Alec C.
Cutler, a managing director at Brandywine Asset Management, who
thinks Seagate is worth $85 a share. He began buying shares two
years ago at $25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lewis, an analyst at Chase H &AMP; Q who rates Seagate a market
performer, said he was ``extremely cautious'' about the industry,
which he said was in major structural change. He pointed to the
sector's increased capacity, the growing number of suppliers and
the consolidating customer base. And he worries about competition
from integrated producers like IBM and Fujitsu, as well as other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, by contrast, said the bottom of the vicious pricing
cycle was in sight, adding that Seagate's lean cost structure
should translate into increased profits once prices pick up.
``Management,'' he said, ``is the best in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Seagate has been buying back its stock. The
company has reduced shares outstanding by 19 percent, to 215
million, in 1999, and has authorized the repurchase of an
additional 25 million shares.

 BUSH AND McCAIN BATTLE TO CLAIM THE HIGH GROUND  
 (previously budgeted as BUSH-REFORM)  
 (See also SC-TV-BLITZ)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Capping a week of ceaseless attacks in the
Republican presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush on Friday recited
a litany of what he said were contradictions between Sen. John
McCain's words and actions, while McCain pledged to end television
advertisements that belittle Bush's character.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning and raising money in New York City, said he
wanted a truce because he was so dismayed by the negative turn the
contest had taken. He challenged Bush to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will run no attack, response or any kind of negative
advertising for the rest of this campaign,'' McCain said at a news
conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   McCain released two television commercials early this week that
compared Bush's level of honesty to that of President Clinton and
that signaled an increasingly bitter air war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush implied that he would not change his strategy, saying he
had not run any truly negative commercials comparable with
McCain's. He also dismissed McCain's gesture as a political ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old Washington trick, the bait-and-switch trick,''
Bush said. ``He runs an ad for 18 days defining me for something
I'm not, then all of a sudden says, `OK, let's all quit.' I'm going
to make sure people understand exactly what I believe, exactly
where I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's charges and countercharges reflected the importance of
the Feb. 19 primary in South Carolina to both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the exchanges also demonstrated each candidate's desire to
grab hold of the news coverage of the campaign, portray himself as
the person of greater integrity and muffle his opponent's words
with an even stronger, more aggrieved voice.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's vow came as he released a commercial that highlighted
his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and Bush released a
commercial that lambasted McCain's campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is tough,'' Bush says in the advertisement, ``but
when John McCain compared me to Bill Clinton and said I was
untrustworthy, that's over the line.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's pledge also came as one new poll suggested that his
unfavorable ratings among South Carolina voters had grown since he
began likening Bush with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past week, the two men have traded accusations,
including insinuations in a Bush commercial that McCain accepted
favors from people who wanted his help in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Kiawah Island on Friday morning, Bush
summarized his case and made cutting mention of a McCain
fund-raiser in Washington on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, he passed the plate amongst the lobbyists and the
special interests that he rails against,'' Bush said. ``I can just
hear him now, `Give 'em hell and pass the hors d'oeuvres.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that several newspapers had reported McCain's
opposition to donations from political action committees, but that
McCain had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of such
contributions. Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for McCain, said that
those newspaper reports had mischaracterized McCain's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man that stood up and said, `I'm the only one who
can stand next to Al Gore on a stage and talk about campaign
funding reform,''' Bush said on Kiawah Island. ``What I'm reminding
people of is that he isn't the only one. I'm better suited to
campaign against Al Gore on campaign funding reform because I
haven't said one thing and done another.''

WEIGHING THE VALUE OF CORPORATE LARGESS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the traditional bonds between employees and
companies are loosening and a growing share of the economy's work
is done by freelance, part-time and temporary workers, Ford Motor
Co. took a giant step in the other direction when it announced that
it would offer each of its 350,000 employees a computer, printer
and unlimited Internet access for $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines followed with a similar though less heavily
subsidized plan for its 80,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Ford's stated goal of increasing computer literacy, the
computers-for-everyone policy may have deeper ramifications. Here
are three perspectives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HARLEY SHAIKEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Professor of social and cultural studies at the University of
California, specializing in labor issues. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This will link up employees in some new, unexplored ways. The
home page is designed by Ford, so the company can get its message
out on a host of issues it thinks are important. It has new access
to its workers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it gets into uncharted territory, because the same
technology that allows you to buy a Ford Explorer on the Internet
also allows you to organize demonstrations in Seattle. Ford workers
in Sao Paulo can talk to Ford workers in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   This brings the possibility of worker interaction in a very
far-reaching, electronic way. How this powerful tool will be used
is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Ford obviously wants to underscore the connection between the
$5-a-month charge for the computer and Henry Ford's doubling of
assembly-line wages in 1913 _ to $5 a day. Originally, that money
came with a heavy dose of paternalism: Ford judged your moral worth
to get that wage.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Ford is saying that is not the intent, and
employees will be able to use the computers as they see fit. It
would be disastrous public relations to break that promise, so it
is likely Ford won't do anything heavy-handed. But that's Ford _
what about the next company?
</P>
<P>
   As we move into the Internet age more forcefully, all these
kinds of issues will be there, whether it's putting up with
advertising or corporate propaganda to get a free computer, or
having companies track your every move on the Net. There is going
to be a new mix between what is job-related and what relates to

<P>
   As long as employees have a voice in how these kinds of benefits
are utilized _ and by that I mean a positive but independent voice
_ it will serve everyone's interest. If employers approach it in a
paternalistic or a self-interested fashion, then it could turn into
an intrusion and backfire.
</P>
<P>
   I think Ford has got the right institutional setting to make
this work. Auto workers know how to take care of their own time and
guard their personal and family responsibilities. They
traditionally have negotiated for more time off.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of positive relationship that Ford and the UAW have
will help them find the right balance between the advantages in
this opportunity and the intrusion on personal time.
</P>
<P>
   The key lesson from research on family benefits is that when
employees have a voice in shaping how they are administered day to
day, then the benefits are utilized effectively, and it serves
everyone well. But when they are announced from the top down, and
there isn't a workplace culture that helps employees control the
use of these services, there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   To employees, it clearly sends a strong message that lifelong
learning is important, for all workers and their families. Perhaps
a broader cross-section of the work force will be now able to
benefit from the new economy and make educational resources
available to their children. &QL;

<P>
   For most Americans now, access to the Internet allows us to be
good citizens, to participate in society and to know what's going
on. Children are coming home from school with assignments that can
only be completed on the Internet. It's crucial.
</P>
<P>
   One worry is that, given modern technology, communications is a
more important component of all jobs today. If you can shift that
communication from work to home, you've got people working more.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be the case here. But I worry that the company will
start presuming that all employees have Internet access, and people
will be required to be on the Internet to get important
information. That's a danger even if it is not the official policy,
because supervisors will assume that people have access. That could
potentially be a problem.

fines of as much as $25 million looming, it may have little option
but to seek to raise money from Kohl and other party officials who

ASBESTOS INDUSTRY FOUGHT HARD AGAINST REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH and ANDREW SCHNEIDER   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as W.R. Grace Co. knew that asbestos was killing workers at
its Libby, Mont., vermiculite mine, the company was fighting the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to keep the agency
from imposing stricter safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   It is a classic example of the asbestos industry's strategy to
derail government efforts to protect workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry's tactic was to, first, deny the problem exists.
Second, once the problem is exposed, to (downplay) the danger. And
thirdly, to use delay tactics,'' said Anthony Mazzocchi, a former
legislative director for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union
who spent more than two decades fighting for stricter asbestos
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the industry fought so hard against regulation? In a
word, money. Delay tactics preserve profits, by deferring the costs
of safety improvements to workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1976 analysis, Grace concluded that it would cost the
company more than $14 million to comply with OSHA's proposed
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general industry strategy was always, take each case, draw
it out as long as it could. And even if they lost in the long run,
the delay, so they thought, saved them money on their investment.
They could keep plants open that they might otherwise not be able
to,'' said Anthony Robbins, professor and chairman of the
department of family medicine and community health at Tufts Medical
School and former director of the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can buy a lot of lawyers and a lot of engineers and a lot
of expert witnesses _ delay is relatively cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Delay tactics commonly used by industry groups included
lobbying, lawsuits and stalling when it came to filing requested
information, Mazzocchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it took more than two decades for OSHA to set the
``permissible exposure level'' for asbestos in the workplace at 0.1
fiber per cubic centimeter over an eight-hour period, a level that
NIOSH first recommended in 1976. The asbestos standard was the
first one ever undertaken by OSHA, and it took the longest to reach
its final form.
</P>
<P>
   Documents obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer show how
the industry blocked continued attempts by OSHA to establish the
standard _ a ``firestorm of backlash,'' according to one former
official with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, for example, the same year NIOSH first recommended that
exposure levels be set at the lowest detectable levels, Grace
representatives argued that tremolite, the form of asbestos that
contaminates the Libby ore, wasn't a ``commercial asbestos form''
and therefore should be treated differently than other types of
asbestos in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Grace had good reason by then to know what tremolite was doing
to the miners. The P-I's investigation of the Libby mine showed
that:
</P>
<P>
   _Twenty years earlier, in 1956, Montana health authorities had
warned the previous owner of the mine that ``asbestos dust in the
air is of considerable toxicity.''
</P>
<P>
   _In 1964, a year after Grace bought the mine, chest X-rays
showed ``a great deal of lung abnormalities among the employees.''
</P>
<P>
   _An internal report, directed to the desk of company President
Peter Grace in 1969, warned that ``tremolite is definitely a health
hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace refused to respond directly to questions about its
activities related to the regulation of asbestos. In a letter to
the P-I, Grace referred questions about OSHA and NIOSH ``to those
agencies directly for their response.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace wasn't the only company fighting OSHA on asbestos levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one of the toughest battles was over what the
warning should be. OSHA wanted to require warning labels (for
workers), and Johns Manville Corp. (one of the first companies to
fight asbestos regulations) didn't want to alarm workers by using
too strong language,'' said Steven Wodka, a plaintiff's attorney in
Little Silver, N.J., who represents workers exposed to toxic
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The industry tactics grated on OSHA regulators and labor
activists concerned that existing standards would lead to needless
cancer deaths in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating to us, working on this stuff and getting it
thrown out (because of industry lawsuits),'' said John Martonik,
former deputy director of health standards program for OSHA, who
worked on the standards from the 1970s through the early 1990s.
OSHA and members of NIOSH believed there was a significant risk of
asbestos-related disease at exposure levels even lower than the
standards they were trying to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Industry often argued that there was insufficient evidence for
adverse health effects and cited the cost and feasibility of trying
to reduce asbestos levels in their plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, workers were being exposed to levels that were
likely to claim lives decades later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded (in 1976) that because of its carcinogenic
effect, asbestos should be treated as if there is no safe level and
therefore in setting their standards, we recommended it be set at
the lowest measurable amount,'' said Robbins, who was then NIOSH
director.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I's investigation documented the deaths of more than 200
people caused by asbestos from the Grace mine, both in Libby and
among workers in processing plants nationwide. More than 400 people
who are still living have been diagnosed with fatal
asbestos-related disease from the ore.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's actions, combined with pressure from other mining
companies and trade organizations representing asbestos producers,
resulted in multiple delays in implementing safer standards, said
Mazzocchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lethal substance,'' he said. ``You don't send
someone into a chamber with cyanide.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry continued to argue that it wasn't economically feasible
to reduce asbestos levels in its plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's whose cost and whose benefit?'' he asked. ``The cost
is to the workers. The benefit is to the employers.''
</P>
<P>
   The feasibility issue surfaced repeatedly in documents filed by
the asbestos industry. It was the industry's main weapon in the
fight against regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the standards were appealed,'' said Barry Castleman, a
chemical engineer and environmental consultant who was involved in
the fight for asbestos standards. ``Every one of them. And that was
the basis for the appeal _ it costs too much.''
</P>
<P>
   NIOSH, which was established in 1970 as an independent agency to
advise OSHA on health risks, could make recommendations based
purely on safety, said Richard Fairfax, director of compliance
programs at OSHA. But OSHA was charged by the government to also
consider economic and technological feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Grace argued that ``disruption of Grace's vermiculite
business, which employs 1,300 people at locations in over 20
states, with an annual payroll of approximately $19 million, also
would affect jobs in areas such as the construction industry where
vermiculite products are used.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1994, after millions were spent on all sides,
that the standard was finally set at the level originally
recommended by NIOSH, a level limited only by the technology
available to detect the fibers.
</P>
<P>
   It frustrates Mazzocchi, the labor leader, that nearly three
decades after he first began battling over asbestos standards,
people are still dying of asbestos-related cancers and lung
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't lose your indignation,'' he said. ``Am I indignant?
Am I angry? Of course. This (the deaths associated with the
vermiculite mine in Libby) is the validation of all the claims we
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always called hysterical, but this is one issue I wish
I were 100 percent wrong on. If I were, there would be a lot of
people alive today.''

 &HT;    Krzyzewski tries to tame expectations about his overachieving
Blue Devils
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mike Krzyzewski wouldn't say it publicly, but the
coach probably knew in his gut that Duke's basketball team was due
for a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   A team on which freshmen account for 46 percent of the scoring
and 44 percent of the rebounding is not supposed to be 9-0 in the
ACC with an 18-game winning streak and a No. 3 national ranking. To
their credit, the Blue Devils had won all the close ones, including
four in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tribute to your toughness, but it doesn't mean that
you're great,'' said Krzyzewski, whose Blue Devils play at Georgia
Tech today.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not a total shock when No. 23 Maryland went into
Cameron Indoor Stadium on Wednesday night and left with a 98-87
victory. The Terps snapped Duke's winning streaks of 46 games at
home and 31 in the ACC. Krzyzewski and some of the Duke veterans
saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a great basketball team; we're a good basketball
that has been playing well,'' said Krzyzewski, in his 20th season
at Duke. ``There have been a lot of pressures on this team, because
once you start winning, people relate it to previous Duke teams,
like last year's. People say it's the same. Well, it's not the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke was a great basketball team in 1999, rolling to a 37-2
record but losing to Connecticut in the national championship game.
With only one senior, Trajan Langdon, on that team and the nation's
best recruiting class coming in, the Blue Devils were a cinch as
the preseason No. 1 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But then Krzyzewski's program took an unprecedented hit in the
NBA draft. Along with Langdon, sophomore center Elton Brand,
freshman forward Corey Maggette and sophomore guard William Avery
all went in the first 14 picks. Disgruntled center Chris Burgess
transferred to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go from being better than we were last year to all of a
sudden we have one of the youngest teams in the country with the
reputation of having to win big,'' Krzyzewski said. ``That was the
reality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With two of those freshmen _ point guard Jason Williams and
center Carlos Boozer _ in the starting lineup and a third, forward
Mike Dunleavy, as the first man off the bench, Duke began the
season with close losses to Stanford (80-79 in overtime) and
Connecticut (71-66). The Blue Devils were 0-2 for the first time
since the 1958-59 season.
</P>
<P>
   After victories against overmatched Army and Columbia, Duke
faced the first moment of truth in its young season _ a stretch
against Southern California, Illinois, DePaul and Michigan. Only
one, DePaul, was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, with this team, I thought we could play pretty
well and be 2-6,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I really did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duke won all four games, including a three-point victory
over Illinois (72-69) and an overtime victory over DePaul (84-83).
That would serve as a the springboard to the 18-game winning streak
that finally ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers of the Duke basketball program point to three
reasons why this team has overachieved:
</P>
<P>
   _ The freshmen aren't playing like freshmen. Williams is
sometimes erratic, as he was Wednesday with seven turnovers against
Maryland. But playing point guard in the ACC as a freshman isn't
easy, and he has handled it well. Boozer's progress was delayed
while he recovered from a foot injury, but against Virginia last
Saturday he had 25 points and nine rebounds. Dunleavy, son of the
Portland Trailblazers' coach, has been the biggest surprise with
his court savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're growing up by the day,'' said Williams, from
Plainfield, N.J. ``I think we're getting better and better every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier, role players on the 1999
team, have become the primary scorers and leaders. Carrawell, a
senior from St. Louis, has led the ACC in scoring (21.8 ppg in
conference games) and is getting a lot of support for ACC player of
the year. Battier continues to amaze with his versatility. The
national defensive player of the year in 1999, Battier had 28
points against Maryland, including six 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Krzyzewski, who has won two national championships and taken
Duke to eight Final Fours, has done a masterful job of shaping and
motivating a team with essentially a six-man rotation that includes
three freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that this is the best coaching job
Mike has ever done,'' said Bob Harris, Duke's longtime radio voice.
</P>
<P>
   What Krzyzewski is trying to guard against now is his young team
hitting the physical and mental wall that inevitably rises during
the February stretch drive. Duke showed some troubling signs
against Maryland. It had come off an overtime victory over North
Carolina the previous Thursday and was brilliant two days later
against Virginia, racing to a 65-33 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After the Virginia game, Carrawell conceded, ``I hit the wall
today.'' He looked tired Wednesday when

   That's Alan, With an A, The Guy Who Sets Rates
</P>
<P>
   As interest rates creep up, it is only natural for investors to
keep a sharp eye on Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   An online financial planning service, WealthHound.com, wants to
help them do just that. It has started a page dedicated to
Greenspan news, intended to help Fed watchers track the chairman's
every move and provide them with a growing archive of articles
about Greenspan, culled from financial news wires.
</P>
<P>
   On its Feb. 1 debut, however, the Web page furnished more
Greenspans than some visitors had bargained for. During its opening
week, it included articles that mentioned Bud Greenspan, chairman
of the entertainment portal eUniverse; Ron Greenspan, webmaster for
GoCancun.com, a travel site, and Sharon Greenspan, a spokeswoman
for Amazon.com, the online retailer.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, none about Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch was corrected in a late-night programming session,
according to Scott Mager, a WealthHound.com principal. ``We are
just adding his first name to the search,'' he said. ``It will only
find news if it says `Alan' and `Greenspan.'''

   A Golf Tour Plays the Internet
</P>
<P>
   Professional golfers can be gamblers at heart: they risk a lot
of money if they miss a putt in a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that the PGA Tour, the organization that
runs many of those tournaments, was willing to take a flier on
Buy.com, an unprofitable Internet superstore that went public last
week. Last year, Buy.com signed on as the sponsor of a PGA event, a
series of minor league tournaments that had been known as the Nike
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to paying for its five-year sponsorship, Buy.com
wanted to conserve cash. So the company agreed to pitch in $8.5
million of proceeds from the stock sale and 1.13 million shares of
the stock. When Buy.com's stock took flight last week like a blast
off Tiger Woods' driver, PGA's bet looked like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The stock nearly doubled in its first day of trading, sending
the value of the PGA Tour's stake to $28.3 million. By the end of
the week, it had rolled back to about $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock stays at such levels until the PGA Tour cashes out,
the deal may well be declared a hole in one. But if Buy.com's stock
follows the trajectory of some offerings, and really tanks, tour
executives could find themselves in something of a hole.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buy.com's filings, the company agreed to pay $8.5
million annually to get its name on the tour and all 30 of its
events for five years. But the PGA Tour's take rests on the
viability of Buy.com, which lost $130 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tim Benton, a PGA executive, said the organization would
not be paying tournament winners in shares of Buy.com stock. The
title sponsorship covers much of the cost of staging tournaments
from Scranton to Salt Lake City, he said. But, he added, ``In no
way do they fund the entire tour.''

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Democratic and independent voters are
changing their party affiliation in several key states to vote for
John McCain in upcoming Republican presidential primaries.

   The shift in registration appears to be coming mainly at the
expense of Democratic candidate Bill Bradley, whose campaign also
has tried to draw independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is sucking all the oxygen out of the room,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic consultant based in Los Angeles. ``Bradley
has moved off the front page to the inside. He's not news
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement is especially pronounced in California, crucial to
McCain's chances in the Republican nominating process, and in
Massachusetts, where McCain ran more than $1 million in television
ads to reach voters in neighboring New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anecdotally, from meetings with city and town clerks, it's
basically Democrats going for McCain,'' Massachusetts Secretary of
State William F. Galvin, a Democrat, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, which votes March 7, allows independent, or
unenrolled, voters to choose either party's primary. The deadline
for changing registration is Wednesday, and Galvin said his office
has fielded ``literally thousands of calls a day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's ability to attract more than traditional Republican
voters contributed to his win over George W. Bush in the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has intensified that effort in the past two weeks.
``We've got to get away from the notion that it's bad for
independents and like-minded conservative Democrats to come over to
our side,'' Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), a McCain supporter, told
an audience in Charleston's historic district Thursday. ``We need
those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation in California, the mother lode of convention
delegates, is more complicated. The state's March 7 primary is
technically open, meaning that registered voters may opt for any
candidate regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   But for purposes of allotting convention delegates, only the
votes of each party's registered voters will count. The winner of
the Republican vote gets all 162 delegates, more than 10 percent of
what is needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, with a shoestring operation in the state, set a goal of
re-registering 30,000 Democrats and independents as Republicans
before last Monday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While that number represents what probably will be 2 percent to
3 percent of the total Republican vote, it could be important in a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Simpson, one of McCain's two paid staffers in California,
said Friday the campaign would be happy if they succeeded in
convincing 10,000 to 20,000 voters to switch their registration.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's California adviser Ken Khachigian was more
optimistic, saying they probably met or even exceeded the 30,000
goal.
</P>
<P>
   California state election officials are still tallying the
numbers. But analysts said voters appeared to be registering
Republican in disproportionate numbers, a sign that they see the
McCain-Bush contest as being more vibrant than the Bradley-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't room for both Bradley and McCain to be both
serious outside challengers,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. ``The drumbeat
has been all McCain. The mantle of the insurgent reformer has
devolved on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign dismisses any suggestion that McCain poses a
threat to the former New Jersey senator, saying that both
candidates are reaching out to independent voters upset with the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more these types of voters get in the mix, the better it
is for us and him, too,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, the Massachusetts official, said that when he met with
other secretaries of state this week, most of the talk was about
McCain and his appeal to crossover voters.
</P>
<P>
   In some states with primaries next month, including Georgia,
Michigan and South Carolina, there is no party registration.
Consequently, voters may participate in either primary.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is especially promising for McCain in South
Carolina and Michigan because Democrats will choose their
convention delegates at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaigned in Michigan this week and made a special
appeal to so-called Reagan Democrats _ blue-collar, unionized
workers who shed their Democratic tradition to vote for Ronald
Reagan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina situation has allowed Gretchen Barbatsis of
Charleston to throw her support to McCain in the primary. ``Bush is
just not a good choice,'' said Barbatsis, who recently moved from
Michigan. ``That doesn't mean I'll vote for McCain in the general
election. He's probably too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence of McCain's surge among people who
traditionally do not vote in Republican primaries comes amid
indications that anti-McCain forces are trying to suppress turnout
among those voters in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a McCain supporter, said the
campaign has received three or four reports from voters who said
telephone callers told them independents and Democrats may not vote
in the Feb. 19 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's true, that's a violation of federal election laws.
This is an open primary where anybody can vote. We have had
anecdotal evidence presented. They've indicated they were told this
is a Republican primary, you can't participate,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, interviews with people at McCain rallies
turned up a number of longtime Democrats who are preparing to do
what they once considered unthinkable: vote in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   S.J. Tarrant of Columbia initially did not even want to talk to
a reporter at a McCain rally out of ``almost a sense of shame,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cousins who are yellow-dog Democrats and even they are
saying they're going to vote for McCain. But I still wouldn't want
some of my colleagues and friends to know,'' she said.

DOCTOR SAYS HARM TO CHILDREN IS UNLIKELY IN QUESTIONED STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Pa., Texas) (rk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with questions about whether more than two
dozen childhood brain cancer patients may have been exposed to the
viruses that cause AIDS and hepatitis C during a gene therapy
experiment, the scientist conducting the study said Friday that the
chance that any children were actually harmed was ``infinitesimally
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura C. Bowman, a pediatric oncologist at St. Jude
Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said that if the
therapy the children received was tainted, it was probably
contaminated by genetic snippets of virus, not whole virus
particles that could cause an infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doubt very much that it was really virus,'' Bowman said.
``But obviously we are pursuing it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Food and Drug Administration official said Friday that it may
take as long as two weeks for agency laboratories to determine
whether the therapy was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers first learned of the possible problem in the fall
but did not report it to agency until Feb. 4 and are only now
notifying families. In an interview, Bowman said she had been
waiting for conclusive evidence about whether the therapy was
tainted. She said that she did not want to needlessly worry
patients and that the Institutional Review Board at her hospital
concurred with that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the researchers' behavior was improper, or in violation
of federal rules, the agency official said: ``We're in the middle
of an investigation. We can't say at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry is likely to intensify questions about gene therapy
research, which has been under scrutiny since an 18-year-old
patient at the University of Pennsylvania died in September. Last
month, the FDA shut down all gene therapy experiments at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The brain cancer experiment took place at St. Jude and Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. A total of 25 patients were
enrolled, beginning in 1995. Of these, Bowman said, all but eight
have died of their underlying disease, a type of childhood brain
cancer that is universally fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the patients were treated at St. Jude and ranged
in age from 4 to 17. The FDA has ordered both institutions not to
enroll any more patients in the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In gene therapy, scientists try to use healthy genes to prevent
or cure a variety of illnesses, from rare inherited disorders to
heart disease and cancer. The brain cancer experiment involved a
``tumor vaccine'' that was made by inserting a tumor-suppressing
gene into a weakened cold virus, adenovirus. This cocktail, called
a vector, was injected under the skin of the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said she treated her last patient in March. Last fall,
she said, St. Jude began an effort to build ``a very stringent
quality assurance program.'' As part of that effort, a quality
control specialist learned that two patients had been given a tumor
vaccine that was inadvertently manufactured from adenovirus taken
directly from a master batch.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent in-house investigation found that neither the St.
Jude laboratory nor the industry laboratory that provided the
master batch had screened it for the viruses that cause AIDS and
hepatitis C, Bowman said. Such screening is required by the FDA.
Samples from the batch tested ``weakly positive,'' Bowman said. But
such tests are extremely sensitive and often give ``false
positive'' results, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is real,'' said Dr. Savio Woo, president of
the American Society for Gene Therapy, which represents
researchers. ``But of course, we are going to have to wait for the
tests.''

WHEN IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT YOUR OWN  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Del.)  (af) 
 By SUSAN J. WELLS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 15 last year, Philip Tsitseklis, a Greek tourist
shopping for sunglasses at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, reported
noticing a clerk swipe his credit card twice _ once through the
cash register and once through a hand-held scanning device she had
taken from her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held device, a magnetic strip reader attached to a
palmtop computer, was used to collect and store credit card
numbers, according to local prosecutors. The clerk, quickly
arrested after the tourist notified a store manager, has been
charged with four felonies, and investigators are looking to see
whether other shoppers had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   As technology advances, criminals are finding new ways to steal
and exploit personal information _ identity fraud, as the practice
is known. Such crime claims at least 400,000 victims a year in the
United States _ and new laws, enforcement efforts and insurance
coverage are being used to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   (Bloomingdale's says the clerk was not an employee but a
representative of a company with which the chain does business.)
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one is immune to identity fraud, not even John M.
Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
whose Social Security number was snatched from a Web site last
fall, according to a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it's a growing problem,'' said Jim
Bauer, assistant director of the Secret Service office of
investigations. ``It's the modern-day crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization in
San Diego, estimates that there will be 400,000 to 500,000 new
cases of identity fraud this year.
</P>
<P>
   But identity fraud remains difficult to track, tough to quantify
and challenging to prosecute. It can range from unauthorized use of
a credit card to the takeover of a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Federal Trade Commission began offering a
toll-free number for consumers to report identity fraud
(877-IDTHEFT) and to receive help and advice. The line receives an
average of 400 calls a week, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   As part of legislation that took effect in 1998, making identity
fraud a federal felony, the FTC is developing a new databank of
consumer complaints that will be shared with law enforcement
agencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Treasury Department will gather federal, state
and local officials, corporate representatives, consumer advocates
and identity theft victims to examine other ways to curb the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Identity fraud has long occurred through the stealing of mail,
purses and wallets or copies of credit reports. But thieves now
have many more means.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomingdale's case was the first in New York to involve
credit card readers, according to Robert M. Morgenthau, the
Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about credit card fraud,'' Morgenthau
said. ``What's new is the type of technology being used to commit
the crime. The lesson is that people have to be ever more vigilant
and protective. They'd be better off never to let their card out of
their sight.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Shalikashvili, his Social Security number, and those of
many other military officers, were published in the Congressional
Record in the mid-1990s, in connection with Senate approval of
their promotions. Afterwards, more than 4,900 names and numbers,
including those of many admirals and generals, were posted on a Web
site run by a group whose aim, prosecutors say, was to prove how
readily available these records are.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the Web site was used by at least three people
to open 273 credit card accounts in the names of the officers,
including Shalikashvili, and to establish 30 separate credit
accounts with Gateway Inc., the computer maker, according to
prosecutors who refused to be cited by name. Together, these
accounts were used to charge $200,000, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that there may be others doing the same thing with
this information,'' said Beth Moskow-Schnoll, an assistant United
States attorney in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   A new type of insurance, now offered in 25 states by the
Travelers Property Casualty Corp. in Hartford, covers some of the
expenses incurred by victims of identity fraud. The coverage, which
can be added to existing Travelers homeowners or renters policies
for $25 a year, provides reimbursement of up to $15,000 for each
instance of fraud, minus a $100 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Covered expenses include lost wages of up to $500 a week for
four weeks, for taking time off from work to deal with the fraud;
legal fees; certain mailing costs; loan re-application fees; and
phone charges. The coverage includes identity fraud resulting from
Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at victims in real cases to see what the
circumstances were where people had to open up their wallets to
deal with this problem,'' said Robert Nighan, vice president of
Travelers Property Casualty. While the Fair Credit Billing Act
generally limits a consumer's liability for unauthorized credit
card charges to $50 a card, Nighan said the costs of undoing the
damage could be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, although acknowledging that the coverage may
provide peace of mind, otherwise question whether it should be
necessary. ``I don't think you should have to pay for your own
privacy or pay for your own identity theft protection,'' said Ed
Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the Public Interest
Research Group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the rise in such cases is that financial
institutions grant credit too readily, he said, adding, ``To me,
your bank or credit bureau should pay for it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The initial public offering of Palm Inc., scheduled for Feb. 28,
promises to be the next hot deal unavailable to most individual
investors. But there's a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Because Palm is being spun out of the 3Com Corp., which will
still own 80 percent of the company after the offering, buying 3Com
today means owning Palm tomorrow and sharing in the potential
upside.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm deal has almost everything an investor could want in a
new issue. First, there is strong brand: Palm has a 70 percent
share of the market for hand-held computing devices, despite the
best efforts of Microsoft and all the hardware companies that
license its Windows CE operating system; more than 5.5 million Palm
Pilots have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   There is also that emerging Internet platform, as Palm strikes
deals with America Online, Motorola and Nokia. And, finally, Palm
has a new star chief executive in Carl J. Yankowski, the man who
sold America the Sony Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a valuation standpoint, you've got to like it,'' said
William F.K. Schaff, manager of the Berger Information Technology
fund, who owns 3Com and will be seeking to buy Palm at the
offering. He expects an immediate pop in palm stock. ``I have no
doubt that it will rise 50 to 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investors think it can go far higher.
</P>
<P>
   So if your broker owes you any favors, beg and plead and maybe
you can get 100 shares at the offering price, which is expected to
be in the $14-to-$16 range. On the other hand, you can buy all the
shares of 3Com that you can afford _ the stock now trades at
$62.3125 _ and own four-fifths of whatever market value the market
assigns Palm, plus the underlying 3Com business.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and
Technology fund, said he expected Palm's offering to sizzle _ and
to give 3Com a nice bump in the process. His fund owns four million
3Com shares. ``What usually happens is the spun-off unit does
extremely well,'' he said. ``And I think that will happen with
Palm, because it does have 70 percent market share in spite of
having to compete with everybody else selling Windows CE-based
devices _ and it also drags the parent along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents. ``The best proxy is HNC Software,'' he
said, referring to the San Diego company that spun off its Retek
unit last November. ``It just puttered along for a while and when
the spin happened the thing took off like a scalded dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he expected Palm, which earned $29.6 million last
year, to have about $1.2 billion in 2000 revenue. He predicted that
shares would trade at 20 to 30 times sales, giving the company a
market capitalization of $25 billion to $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's going to be worth, in our estimation, $70 to $100 per
share,'' he said. Meanwhile, he noted, 3Com will still have its
existing networking business and what he calculates to be about $10
per share in cash, in addition to its interest in Palm. ``So you
carve it all up,'' he said, and can get a 3Com stock price ``north
of $100, with the stock at about $60 today.''
</P>
<P>
   A little history may be in order. Founded in 1992, Palm
originally sold a program called Graffiti, which allowed users to
enter text with a pen on devices like Apple Computer's Newton and
other personal digital assistants, known as PDAs, of the day.
</P>
<P>
   When that market tanked, Palm ran out of money and was acquired
by U.S. Robotics, the modem maker, which gave it the resources to
develop the Palm OS operating system and the Palm Pilot. 3Com, of
Santa Clara, Calif., bought U.S. Robotics in 1997, only to watch
the imploding modem business drag its earnings to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in its history, 3Com had a clear shot at being the
dominant company in computer networking. But it lost ground early
on to Novell Inc., which emphasized software over hardware, and
more recently to Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   When it became clear that Palm was the shining star in 3Com's
firmament, the Palm founders, Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky,
began urging that the unit be spun out. Stymied by Eric Benhamou,
3Com's chief executive, the pair left and founded Handspring, a
Palm licensee, which now produces a competing hand-held device.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Palm offering, Ms. Dubinsky's opinion seems to be, better
late than never. ``I thought it was the right thing to do when I
recommended it 18 months ago,'' she said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another way to view Palm's potential is to look at the number of
devices projected to soon be connected to the Internet, and to
estimate how many are likely to be hand-held and run Palm OS.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 435 million PCs in the world, but Intel is saying
that by the end of 2001 there will be one billion devices connected
to the Internet,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of the California
Technology Stock Letter. ``There are only going to be 600 million
PCs by then, so that leaves 400 million other things, and a lot of
those will be hand-held devices. Everybody except Microsoft doesn't
want Windows CE to own the world, so they've consolidated around
Palm in a remarkable way.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Moore, president of Chasm Group, a consulting firm,
called Palm ``the gorilla in the PDA category of nonwireless
extensions to Windows PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says major institutional investors have been waiting for
the Palm offering. ``The big institutions want a direct way to play
this,'' he said. ``They don't want to own 3Com because they see it
as a weak No. 2 to Cisco.'' He has been recommending 3Com since it
was in the low $20s, last April, but thinks that it is now about
fully valued. Indeed, he thinks the company will put itself up for
sale after the spinoff is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot left in the stock after Palm, but it is a
legitimate way for individual investors to get Palm at the offering
price,'' he said. ``And if Palm takes off like a rocket, it will
pull 3Com up.''

   From K-Cars to E-Business, Iacocca Generates Traffic
</P>
<P>
   Lee A. Iacocca stresses that, in deciding to become a board
member and pitchman for the Online Asset Exchange, a
business-to-business Web site, he wasn't about to join just any
e-business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been getting about one offer a week,'' he said last
week. ``Everybody has a concept out there. But these people are
just so damn good, so I let them use my mug.''
</P>
<P>
   After the site (onlineassetexchange.com) went into operation
Monday, Iacocca's mug was about all many visitors got. Unable to
handle 15,000 hits a minute, the exchange displayed only a smug
Iacocca leaning back in his office chair, his arms folded behind
his head, for much of its first three days. By the end of the week,
the site was up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Iacocca calls the site ``an industrial-strength eBay.'' It
amounts to a perpetual corporate yard sale of metalworking, power
generation and aircraft equipment and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to go public this summer, with apparent
benefits for Iacocca and the stock options (he won't say how many)
he was given to join. ``I won't be just a figurehead in anything
that I do,'' he said. ``I thought it was time to get baptized in
the e-commerce world.''

   Instead of a Pink Slip, Pure Gold
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser may be losing the title of chief executive and the
independence of his company, Mannesmann AG, but his paycheck won't
be like that of some pink-slipped employee. Esser, who gave in to
Vodafone Airtouch's $183 billion hostile offer a week ago, stands
to earn $29 million in salary and bonuses this year. He is expected
to leave the company this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann plans to pay Esser now what he would have received
over the coming four years. As what Mannesmann calls an
``appreciation bonus,'' perhaps for all those emergency conference
calls with advisers at 2 a.m., the company will pay him an
additional $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though nominally the loser in the takeover battle, Esser held
out so long that Vodafone's price was worth $77 billion more than
its initial offer.

   Cashing In Gets Tougher at Tyco

practices and a big stock drop, L. Dennis Kozlowski, the head of
Tyco International, announced that Tyco would have to hit
impressive financial targets for executives to exercise future
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The company took the step of tying options not only to Tyco's
stock price but also to its earnings. ``That's very unusual,'' said
Ira T. Kay, the director of the executive compensation practice at
Watson Wyatt &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed aggressive: for Kozlowski and other senior
managers to exercise any of their new options, Tyco's stock price
must reach at least $53 _ or $75 to exercise them all _ up from
$39.25 on Friday, according to preliminary plans. Earnings per
share and cash flow also must double over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco hopes that these clauses will rebut accusations, first made
by an investment newsletter, that the company used misleading
bookkeeping. As a result, Tyco stock lost nearly half its value
late last year. Now Kozlowski, one of the most highly paid chief
executives in recent years, is betting that he can stay on that
list by proving his critics wrong.

   Kofi Annan might think he runs the United Nations, but no, at
the moment, it is George Lang, the New York restaurateur (Cafe des
Artistes) and entrepreneur. At the least, Lang is in charge of the
delegates' dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his native Hungary, Lang and the financier Ronald S.
Lauder are assembling an empire that includes vineyards, a paprika
factory, a foie gras factory and Gundel's, the fabled Budapest
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Lest that empire lack for attention, for much of this month Lang
has brought in Gundel's manager, five chefs and, of course, the
restaurant's publicity director to turn the dining room at U.N.
headquarters in Manhattan into Gundel's West.
</P>
<P>
   One lunchtime last week found him bounding from table to table,
pouring wines from Hungary's Lauder/Lang Vineyards, even as he
entertained 20 diplomats at a table set up in the kitchen and
decorated with miniature U.N. and Hungarian flags. There, flanked
by the Hungarian ambassador to the U.N., Andre Erdos, and the
Budapest mayor, Gabor Demsky, he announced, ``OK, guys. We're
invading.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians know about invasions, he explained. Because of
invasions by Tatars, Austrians, Turks and many others, he said,
``Hungary became a gastronomical United Nations.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Section 316 of Nassau Coliseum was empty. So
was 320. Five fans occupied 310. Three more inhabited 308. You
could hold a bar mitzvah in 306. Only 4,785 people showed up
Thursday night when the Islanders beat Tampa Bay, 5-4, in overtime.
They found easy parking, short lines at the concession stands and
abundant legroom almost anywhere they chose to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look behind me and ask, `Who are those empty seats
masquerading as Islanders fans?''' said Mike Lesco, 85, of
Huntington, the sole denizen of Section 314, Row G, a season-ticket
holder since 1972 and a hockey fan for 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it goes at Nassau Coliseum, where the paid
attendance averages a meager 9,666 in the 16,297-seat building but
the actual nightly body count would pack only a minor-league arena.
No-shows are a problem in the National Hockey League but most
serious at the Coliseum, which is in Uniondale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   People don't crowd into the Coliseum. They gather. They can
stroll in five minutes before a 7:30 p.m. game, buy a beer, chat in
the concourse and change their seats if the ones they have are too
far from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights, you can count the attendance, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Coliseum is not a mausoleum. The fans don't
hide their faces inside paper bags or hurl D batteries at
underperforming players. They are frustrated by the losing, but
they still love their Islanders. They want superstars but admire
the current players' grit and hustle.
</P>
<P>
   They cheer, they heckle, they wear the jerseys, they bring their
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter hasn't seen them win anything,'' said Gary Timm of
Holbrook, who knew better days in the early 1980s, when the
Islanders won four Stanley Cups. ``We're coming until she does.''
</P>
<P>
   The die-hards' presence is a dignified stand against the muck of
rotten business that surrounds the team: a Filene's Basement
payroll, a reviled landlord and a debt-riddled Nassau County that
cannot build a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they do not appear depressed, even if one winning season in
12 should make them reach for their St. John's wort, which is not
available at the snack bars. Even knowing that a former owner, John
Spano, sits in a prison cell for his fraudulent acquisition of the
team doesn't bring them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Islanders,'' Timm said. ``I can't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Durst of Babylon chose to look on the bright side.
``They're playing well, they're just not winning,'' he said. ``And
a lot of winning teams aren't selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   The loyalists are watching new suitors get thwarted in their
attempts to buy the team by the landlord, SMG, which manages the
arena for the county and refuses to rework a lease that pays the
Islanders little revenue. They are seeing the prospect of a
franchise-saving new arena fade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the die-hards return, not all of them every night, because
some won't until the ignominy ends. (Those fans in exile must be
watching on television; the Islanders' cable ratings are up 18
percent this season.)
</P>
<P>
   The loyalists continue to seek hockey sustenance from a young
team that finds itself skating before small roundups of intimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it depressing, but sometimes it is a little
bit of a letdown, because you get all fired up in the room and you
go out and there's 3,000 people out there,'' said Jamie Rivers, a
24-year-old defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Butch Goring, who played for the Islanders' four
championship teams, said, ``It's tough when the building isn't full
and you have to generate your own kind of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sanders, the team president, is the sole public
front-office face of the Islanders. Fans once saw Steven
Gluckstern, an owner, and they hear a lot about the others, Howard
and Edward Milstein. But the owners have rendered themselves
invisible since the fall of 1998, when a dispute over safety at the
Coliseum led them to abandon the building briefly, then file a
lawsuit against SMG and the county that is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has watched as some of the fans' frustration has shifted
from the owners to SMG for stalling talks with the potential
buyers, a group led by Bob Gutkowski and Charles Koppelman, and to
the county for not building a new arena that is central to the
team's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to understand the things we've known for a
long time, that SMG and the county are responsible for this
building,'' Sanders said. ``We should have been telling our story
better.''
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday night's game against Pittsburgh, about 120
disgruntled fans plan to stage a protest from Section 332 targeting
SMG and the county. ``We'll be loud enough in that empty building
for our chants to be heard,'' said Steve Ellers, president of the
Save the Islanders Coalition, who hopes fans will boycott the
SMG-operated concession stands and parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration should help fill a section that had more seats
than humanity Thursday, just like Section 315, where the nine fans
in attendance included Dale Steingraber and Matthew Kenney,
Islanders loyalists for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared with the old days?'' said Steingraber, 44, a paint
contractor from Huntington. ``Yeah, it's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody sat behind him except Kenney, 49, of East Northport, and
nobody sat in front of him for six rows. He had room to stretch.
``But I like hockey,'' he said. ``For my love of hockey, this is
good, but not as a fan of a team.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends, with an arena almost to themselves and the
score tied at 3-3 in the third period, fretted that the Islanders
would falter as they often have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Steingraber said, ``it's the third period and the ice
is more scratched up on the Islander end than the Tampa Bay end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprises me,'' Kenney said. ``Butch Goring is an
offensive coach.''
</P>
<P>
   With the game at 4-4 in overtime and the Islanders on the
attack, Kenney shouted: ``Come on, point man! Point man!'' The pass
went to the point, where Tim Connolly slapped the puck in for the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it!'' Kenney shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney and Steingraber were elated, just as they would have been
had the joint been jammed. But in the rare moment of an Islanders
victory, they had only each other to high-five.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nassau Coliseum _ 29 percent full _ emptied. Very quickly.

INVESTING WITH PETER A. VLACHOS: FORUM AUSTIN GLOBAL EQUITY FUND

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1950s, during the Cold War, Peter A. Vlachos traveled the
world as a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command,
repairing advanced electronics. His interest in such gadgetry
continues today as he buys shares of communications and electronics
companies for his $38.3 million mutual fund, Forum Austin Global
Equity. Such stocks account for 42 percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Of late, he has guided his fund to impressive results. Austin
Global returned 33.3 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Feb. 4, compared with 19.5 percent for its peer group
of world stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Vlachos, 62, takes a top-down approach at the fund, using
macroeconomic strategies to choose regions of the world for
investing. ``We look for growth in the gross domestic product and a
modernizing economy,'' he said, ``and we like to see that inflation
is under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that approach is leading him to the Pacific Rim,
including Japan. The region accounts for 30 percent of the fund's
holdings, up from 6 percent just two years ago. ``Japan is the
second-largest economy in the world,'' he said from his office in
Midtown Manhattan. ``It's vitally important that it be not only
viable but vibrant. We think it's recovering nicely from the 1998
monetary crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional 35 percent is in Europe. ``We like Europe, even
though it is still lagging behind the U.S. in its drive to
restructure,'' he said. ``But it's on the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not worried that the euro has fallen 42 percent against
the dollar since the beginning of last year. ``We think it should
appreciate to above parity'' with the dollar, he said. The euro now
trades at 98.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Vlachos is less sanguine about the domestic stock market, having
trimmed the fund's United States holdings to about 30 percent, from
more than 40 percent. ``Near term, we expect the U.S. market to be
pretty bumpy,'' he said. ``We think the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates another quarter-point this spring, which means a
little pause in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent is in Latin America, though he plans to
increase that share. ``It's gone through a rough period,'' he said
of the region, ``but earnings will probably start to show up later
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlachos focuses on companies that are being privatized by
governments and have strong long-term growth prospects. He looks
particularly at those involved in infrastructure, like
telecommunications companies, as well as electronics and financial
services concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatized companies usually come out at attractive valuations
because there's an awful lot to sell,'' he said. ``These companies
usually have an entrenched position in the industry; they are
well-financed and have interesting growth prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   He also looks for undervalued companies whose share prices can
be helped by mergers, spinoffs or reorganizations.
</P>
<P>
   While he has no hard-and-fast rules, he likes companies with
strong balance sheets and minimal debt. Depending on the industry,
he wants annual earnings and revenue growth of 15 percent to 40
percent. Vlachos says he is willing to pay for good growth
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't shy away from paying high multiples,'' he said, ``as
long as we see growth and a good operating history.'' The forward
price-to-earnings multiple of the portfolio is currently 30.
</P>
<P>
   He recently bought shares in Corning Inc., which makes
components for fiber optic cable and which holds some of the basic
patents in the telecommunications industry. ``They're streamlining
their business to focus on telecommunications,'' he said, noting
that Corning had recently acquired Oak Industries, a maker of
amplifiers and cable TV set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of high demand for its fiber optic products, he said,
Corning is building new factories. The shares have returned 238
percent in the last 12 months, but the price is justified by his
anticipated three-year earnings growth rate of 20 percent to 25
percent a year, Vlachos said.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares last December at $114; the stock now trades at
$165.75, or 71 to 69 times his earnings estimate of $2.35 to $2.40
a share for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Murata Manufacturing of Japan, which makes
components for telecommunications equipment, digital television and
hand-held wireless devices. The company has ``U.S.-style''
management, he said, meaning that it is willing to pare assets and
reorganize its work force to increase profits. He sees earnings
growth of 20 percent a year, on average, over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Vlachos bought shares in December at 18,300 yen. The stock now
trades at 21,010 yen, or 90 to 72 times forecast 2000 earnings of
234 to 290 yen a share.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia Mobile is the fund's third-largest holding, at
4.38 percent of the portfolio. The company is the second largest
mobile telephone provider in Europe, after Vodafone Airtouch, with
a customer base of nearly 18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares are expensive, he added, but valued in line
with similar companies worldwide. ``There's been a lot of talk
about the company merging with its parent,'' he said, referring to
Telecom Italia, which owns 60 percent of the shares. ``Anyone who
wants to take it over, whether its parent company or an outsider,
will have to pay a premium to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings growth should exceed 20 percent a year, on average,
over three years, he said. He bought shares in 1995 for the
equivalent of $1.24. The stock now trades at 13.752 euros, or
$13.5437; that is 71 times his forecast earnings this year of
$0.19, or 0.193 euros.

FOR THE MOMENT, AT LEAST, SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wondering what happened to the bull market in big
blue-chip stocks? It got downsized.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a very long time, small-capitalization
stocks are now firmly leading the market's charge. As the Dow Jones
industrial average struggles _ it is down 11 percent from its high
of Jan. 14, enough to qualify as a market correction _ the Russell
2000 small-capitalization stock index closed on Friday just less
than 1 percent off its high, reached on Thursday. The Russell is up
6.4 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   That outperformance is something of a shock to investors who had
come to believe that in the stock market, big would be beautiful
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The shift began in December, when a small-cap surge helped the
Russell beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 in 1999 for the first time
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there appears to be something more than hot air driving
this engine. Earnings among smaller companies _ defined as those
with market values of $1 billion or less _ are coming on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Penney, small-cap analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
said earnings growth expectations this year for the Russell 2000
stocks stood at 37.5 percent, more than double the 16.7 percent
expected from the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, price-to-earnings ratios of many smaller
companies are below those of their larger brethren. By Penney's
reckoning, the Russell 2000 trades at roughly 19 times what its
companies should earn this year. The S&AMP;P trades at 24 times this
year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small caps are doing better for a simple, fundamental and
honest reason _ they are a much better value,'' said Byron Wien,
chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   What Wien is starting to see is investors quietly taking some of
their money out of large technology companies and moving it into
smaller companies in both hot and cold sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you must be fully invested and you feel that technology is
fully or outrageously priced, the small caps may be a place to
hide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the market goes down, the thinking goes, small-cap stocks
will go down with it, but not as much as the larger highfliers.
Conversely, if the market rallies, small-company shares will, too.
</P>
<P>
   The move to smaller names is only beginning, according to Wien,
but it has already had a big effect on the small-cap indexes. A
little money goes a long way in stocks that have been beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   Three small-cap sectors look especially appealing, based on
analysts' expectations for earnings growth. Energy, basic material
and transportation companies have growth rates comparable to those
of technology stocks but carry much cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors do not yet seem inclined to include a broad
array of small companies in their portfolios. Robert Adler,
president of AMG Data Services, said that while small-cap funds
were becoming a more popular place to put money, the focus of the
mutual fund investor continued to be all technology, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   That view may change soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is still overwhelmed by the appeal of technology,''
Wien said. ``But for those who have said enough is enough, the
small caps hold a lot of allure.''

 &HT;    Woods avoids unkindest cut
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ In the world since Tiger Woods, this is the
way things transpire. At midday Friday in the second round of the
Buick Invitational, which used to be a tournament where the
para-sailers outnumbered the mini-cams, here's the stunning
headline at which we could have been looking:
</P>
<P>
   ``Woods Misses Chance at 7th Straight Win, Misses Second Career
Cut.''
</P>
<P>
   In golf history, this would have been a story even bigger than
Gene Sarazen inventing the sand wedge or discovery of the first
titanium mine. Surely, there were fears that it would affect the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, all logic was restored at the South Course at
Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
   After a pedestrian front nine featuring a bogey and eight pars
that temporarily had placed him at even-par for the tournament,
Woods suddenly decided to keep the story going a bit longer. With a
back-nine 31, he regrouped for a 4-under 68 and is tied for 22nd at
5-under 139 _ six shots behind leaders Phil Mickelson, Kirk
Triplett and Shegeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been keeping track at home, Woods is positioned just
right to be classified as Seriously Lurking, and there is evidence
everywhere you look. Five days ago at Pebble Beach, he was eight
back after 36 holes, tied for 13th. Last year at Torrey Pines, he
stood nine back at the halfway point (when he was also 5-under) and
then shot 62-65 on the weekend to win by two shots.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the streak is at 6 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm not too bad,'' Woods said. ``I'm only six back,
and I definitely moved up. I don't have as many guys in front of
me. Hopefully, I'll go out tomorrow (with a Pacific storm
approaching), if we get a chance to play tomorrow, and go ahead and
shoot a good round. . . . I'm doing a lot better than I was last
year at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not a player on the grounds who doesn't expect Woods to
be right there on Sunday, whatever the weather. Mickelson, who has
shot 66-67 and also possesses a comfort zone for Torrey Pines as
the 1993 champion, only would have felt protected from a Woods
attack had the world's No. 1 player been on a plane back to
Orlando, Fla. Instead, Woods made his 46th straight cut, dating
back to the 1997 Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, given the fact that he shot 17 under over the weekend
last year, a six shot lead, that isn't something to be comfortable
with,'' Mickelson said. ``And given the fact he was seven back with
seven to go last week, he can obviously turn it on at any time and
he can do some things that are pretty spectacular. . . It's kind of
a given that he's going to go low, because he usually does.''
</P>
<P>
   One minute on Friday, Woods was flubbing a flop on the 5th hole
and needing to sink an 8-footer just to make bogey. An hour later,
he was getting up and down on the par-3 11th, from 30-yards left of
the green. On the back nine, Woods birdied 10, 13, 15 (nearly
holing out from the fairway), 16 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only missed one cut before and I bogeyed the last hole to
do that,'' Woods said. ``But overall, when you get in those
positions when you're on the borderline, you just have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair, who missed the cut on rounds of 75-72 while
playing in Tiger's threesome for two days, was coming apart Friday.
On the 10th hole, Mayfair's third from behind the green bounced off
a Sports Illustrated photographer and kicked back about 10 feet
into high rough on the way to a double bogey. Then a cell phone
went off. Woods, meanwhile, heard only the sound of his continuing
quest to match Byron Nelson's streak of 11 straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he played the front side about as bad as he could and
he still got around,'' said Mayfair. ``Now he's at 5-under and he's
right there.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago on Wall Street, as elsewhere, thrift was a
virtue. Nowadays, it seems that only the highest-priced spread will
do.
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of so-called value investors, much of the money
going into the stock market is being funneled into technology
stocks whose sky-high price-to-earnings multiples result in market
capitalizations that can exceed those of of entire industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Most other companies, meanwhile, are going about their business
_ making good money in an expanding economy but not being rewarded
for it in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, value funds had a total return of just over 8
percent, according to Lipper Inc., the fund research firm. That
gain was dwarfed by the 21 percent return of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index, let alone the 86.1 percent surge of the Nasdaq
composite index.
</P>
<P>
   For the first five weeks this year, value funds are down 2.2
percent. James P. Barrow, stalwart value investor and lead manager
of the Vanguard Group's $25 billion Windsor II fund, spent some
time last week talking about when less will once again be more in
the stock market. Here are excerpts from the conversation: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There seems to be some disagreement over what constitutes a
value stock these days. How do you define it? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We build portfolios with low price-to-earnings multiples,
those that at this point have a discount to the market of 40
percent, have price-to-book ratios that are at a 40 percent
discount to the S&AMP;P 500 and current yields that in this environment
are a little less than twice the market average. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since only one-third of the stocks that trade on the New York
Stock Exchange were up in price last year and 20 percent of the
stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 were down more than 25 percent, you must have
a long list of stocks from which to choose. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have seen this many stocks that qualify as value stocks,
but not since the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. It was at that
point that value stocks did very, very well. But those are fond
memories, not current ones. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the bifurcation we have seen in the market a manifestation
of what some see as the emergence of the New Economy at the expense
of the Old Economy? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The New Economy folks would want to get you to think that.
</P>
<P>
   I think it is merely a very extensive speculative bubble. I
don't mean to throw cold water on people, but the general premise
that it doesn't matter what you pay for something but what you buy
with the money does make a difference is sort of crazy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the New Economy will work much better than the Old, but
the experience of e-commerce, particularly business-to-consumer
e-commerce, doesn't suggest that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of the Old Economy companies are doing just fine, thank
you, but the market has turned its back on them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We own a huge amount of Kmart, whose earnings over the last
three years have gone from 48 cents to an estimated $1.32 for 1999,
and whose bond rating has gone from trash to investment grade.
Despite this tremendous earnings growth, the stock still sells for
seven to eight times earnings. It's an OK company, and yet no one
gives a damn about it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think will need to happen to refocus attention on
value stocks? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When you have this sort of bifurcation between one group and
another it can't last forever. I think one of two things will have
to happen. Either high-technology stocks will correct back down to
value stocks, or value stocks have to move up to the levels of high
tech.
</P>
<P>
   The latter could happen if you get involved in a situation where
pools of private capital start buying companies with depressed
market values. We have seen that happen in the past and may see it
again.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what will cause the bell to ring, but one day it
will ring. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Presumably, the stocks you own trade at such deep discounts
that a technology-led correction would not hurt them much. What
sorts of stocks do you like at this point?  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think these stocks can go down much further. A lot of
the companies we own are trading at eight times earnings, and there
is a limit below which they can't go.
</P>
<P>
   We like oil stocks and oil service stocks, companies like ARCO
and Phillips, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton. These
stocks haven't moved because of nervousness over long-term oil
prices. But it looks like oil will hold above $20 a barrel for a
good while.
</P>
<P>
   We own stock in banks like Citigroup, Chase and First Union. We
have good-sized holdings in the regional Bells, which haven't gone
anywhere for a long time. And we probably own more utility stocks
than anybody in the country, companies like American Electric
Power, First Energy Corp. and Public Service Enterprise Group.

BRADLEY FACES TOUGH TEST IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Amid the clinking of cocktail glasses and the
sparkling crystal chandeliers, Governor Gray Davis hosted Vice
President Al Gore Friday night at a reception that included just
about all who matter in California Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator and presidential
hopeful without the governor's backing, was not invited.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, another example of the vice president's clout with
the party establishment will be on display. As both candidates
speak before the state's Democratic Convention here, the hall will
be filled with nearly 2,000 sign-waving Gore devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was given just 200 passes for his followers.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast Golden State, so crucial to the prospects of any
presidential candidate, Bradley is facing what may be his toughest
test. The vice president has the backing not only of the state's
political leaders, but a rejuvenated labor movement, teachers
unions, and gay and lesbian organizations. Each of those groups has
extensive get-out-the vote efforts in place to assist Gore in the
March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the institutional advantages are there, they're in
place,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political consultant who
is unaligned in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is an electorate that tends to swing wildly and
swing late. The same vast institutional forces at Gore's behest
could trigger a backlash against the candidate Bradley derides as a
creature of the political status quo. And then there is the
X-factor: inattentiveness. The weather has been gorgeous here this
winter, and few voters have holed up inside their homes watching
political debates from Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Californians really still haven't given a lot of attention to
the race,'' said Kam Kawata, a Democratic political consultant
working for US Senator Dianne Feinstein. ``That's good news for
Bradley because the contests where he didn't do as well as he
wanted were harmful, but not a knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Gore has grabbed almost all of the endorsements to be
had here, the early struggles of Texas Governor George W. Bush are
a reminder that voters aren't always impressed by Very Important
People vouching for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a recent Field poll showed Bradley with just 19
percent among his best demographic group _ people with college and
post-collegiate degrees. Even in liberal San Francisco and
high-tech Silicon Valley, he is far, far behind Gore, though he has
worked hard in Northern California. The poll gave Gore a 40-point
lead over his challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Bradley has gotten far less media
attention in recent days than he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain campaign has taken the oxygen out of the air for
the other independent, reform insurgent candidate,'' said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate
University. ``They're both trying to occupy the same ground. Right
now, the only one of the two on the radar screen is John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's array of organizational backers come with phone banks,
direct mail solicitations, and people to go door to door, dropping
literature and canvassing.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's gay community, for example, the Alice B.
Toklas group, the largest gay and lesbian Democratic club, has
endorsed Gore. And the membership has another reason to be fired up
as it helps the vice president: fighting an anti-gay marriage
initiative on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore comes out here very strong, very organized and very well
liked,'' said Robert Barnes, an openly gay Democratic strategist
who is helping to derail the so-called Knight ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, California's tradition of controversial propositions
has also energized the Latino, African-American and Asian
communities, all of which are behind Gore, according to polls.
Referendums to cut off health and education services for illegal
immigrants, to prohibit the state from giving preferences based on
race, and to move from bilingual education to total English
immersion for immigrant children have resulted in a wave of
Democratic activism.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions, which have endorsed Gore, are also
involved in a fight to make it easier to pass school bond issues.
They are spending about $15 million to turn out their 295,000
members and to win support for the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the California Education Association, the AFL-CIO, the
machinists and the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, among others, have increased their political
activity since former governor Pete Wilson tried to stop the
unions' ability to spend dues on political activity. All are
backing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't underestimate the potential of the unions,'' said Gale
Kaufman, Bradley's senior California adviser. ``Whether it
translates into actual votes is another story.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kaufman is in charge of organizing the teachers'
campaign to pass Proposition 26. And while she believes teachers
will go to the polls, she also believes that many will vote for
Bradley while voting yes on the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The established support that (Gore) has is not anything we
were not expecting,'' Kaufman said. ``What it translates into,
about excitement about his candidacy is still unclear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley only has a little over three weeks to ingratiate
himself with the voters here, with the help of a
multimillion-dollar advertising purchase will feature, among
others, his hottest new celebrity endorsement: Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is so great and the time is so short I just don't know
whether it can possibly work,'' said Bruce Cain, director of the
Institute for Governmental Studies at the University of California
at Berkeley.

 LONDON: on Saturday.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On taking his party into government in November with Sinn Fein,
the political ally of the IRA, Trimble promised his rank and file
that he would put the party's continued participation to a new vote
this month. He guaranteed the pledge by saying he would step down
from his leadership of the Assembly, and presumably the party, if
the IRA had not begun to disarm. His postdated letter of
resignation becomes effective on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that safety catch, he obtained only 58 percent backing
from his 860-member council, and many members of his historically
quarrelsome party harshly criticized his decision to abandon the
long-held unionist demand for IRA disarmament, ``No guns, no
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain based its action on the belief that Trimble is a crucial
moderating influence in the Ulster Unionist Party and that his
departure would leave the party in the hands of people determined
to bring down the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has argued that the deadline for a start to disarming
was an artificial one, outside the terms of the peace agreement
that put into motion the creation of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble's gamble provoked a widespread expectation of a
matching move by the IRA, and there was keen disappointment among
backers of the peace accord this month when nothing materialized
that Trimble could present to his party as evidence of a start to
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The implied timing of the reciprocal moves was Jan. 31, the date
by which de Chastelain had to make a report on the progress of
weapons turnovers. The report said, ``To date we have received no
information from the IRA as to when decommissioning will start.''
Decommissioning is the word used in the agreement for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Protestant paramilitary groups would not
move on weapons until the IRA did. It also addressed Sinn Fein's
argument that the only meaningful deadline for disarmament is the
May 22 date in the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The general's report further read: ``Given our understanding of
the quantity of arms held by the paramilitary groups, and the
dispersed nature of their locations, we believe a time will soon be
reached beyond which it will be logistically impossible for us to
complete our task by May 22.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pendulum swings of favor and disfavor in the politics of
Northern Ireland, it is the unionists these days whose frustrations
have been getting a more sympathetic hearing in places like Dublin,
Washington, London and Belfast, where their resistance in the past
was often seen as knee-jerk negativism.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists draw support from the Protestant majority who want to
keep the province part of Britain, while republicans, most of whom
are Catholic, represent those wanting to see Ulster establish
stronger links with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The peace settlement and the related cease-fires by the IRA and
other paramilitary groups that began in 1997 represented the best
hope for ending three decades of sectarian violence that has cost
more than 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The last two months have produced the unaccustomed sight of the
two sides functioning together with notable comfort and competence
as legislators. The old freighted debates over the threats to the
survival of their separate traditions were replaced by the normal
Assembly chamber cut and thrust over civic matters like health,
education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA stance has ended up costing its Sinn Fein allies their
current posts as ministers in the new government, at least
temporarily. The IRA has a symbolic attachment to its munitions,
based on a deep conviction that only vanquished armies turn over
their weapons and that disarming is equivalent to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, expressed exasperation
that Britain had not stayed its announcement once he made his
prediction late Friday that a ``major breakthrough'' was in the
offing. ``This party has worked day and night with others to
establish this position and at the point it could move on, it was
pulled,'' he said. It appeared, however, that he brought the
subject up only having been advised that Mandelson was about to
make his suspension statement.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said the parties knew the deadline he had set and that
he did not see the new report until afterward. ``Of course, it
changes things for the better,'' Mandelson told BBC television.
``But it doesn't transform things until the specifics have been
agreed between the IRA and Gen. de Chastelain.'' He added: ``The
IRA's position is still quite unclear in certain key respects,
notably whether they will actually decommission and when.''
</P>
<P>
   The oddly choreographed series of events could make sense in the
context of Ulster politics. By timing its disclosure when it did,
Sinn Fein restated the republican commitment to peace that had come
under question over the arms issue. And by not capitulating to the
deadline, it avoided the appearance of responding to a unionist
ultimatum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer industry has a long, respected tradition of hiring
so-called tiger teams of professional hackers who attack a computer
system to determine how secure it is. The idea is that only by
waging a full-scale siege on a system with an authorized break-in
can its true level of vulnerability be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, that hacker tradition has grown to embrace
unauthorized attacks in which programmers find a way to invade or
cripple a system, then publish the details of the vulnerability _
often accompanied by software that exploits the weaknesses they
discover.
</P>
<P>
   While the wisdom and ethics of these practices have long been
debated, the attacks that blocked access to several prominent Web
sites this week have fueled the controversy because the siege was
accomplished in part using a technique and software published last
year on the Internet by a hacker who calls himself Mixter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Mixter's motive, to law enforcement officials and many
security experts his posting of the attack software was akin to
leaving a loaded gun in the middle of a room full of children.
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail exchange Friday, Mixter, like other
self-appointed monitors of computer security, defended his actions
as a sort of wake-up call for complacent network administrators.
Mixter said he considered himself a responsible hacker, and he
tried to distance himself from this week's ``senseless'' attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers themselves are deeply divided over which actions are
responsible and which reckless, but there is general agreement that
the line between good guys and bad guys is somewhat blurry,
shifting and permeable.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the terms ``white hats,'' ``black hats'' and even
``gray hats'' are used to label hackers. Each hews to a unique, if
occasionally inscrutable, set of limits.
</P>
<P>
   But this splitting of ethical hairs is quickly losing its charm
for law enforcement officials and security experts alike, and there
is a growing sentiment that enough is enough. Earlier this week,
following the Web-site attacks, the Justice Department announced
that tougher penalties might be necessary to prevent more serious
attacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a hacker ethos, and even the bad guys have
thought there are some things you can do and some things that are
off limits,'' said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is
now a vice president at Global Integrity, a computer-security
consulting firm in Reston, Va. ``I think we've reached a point
where this kind of activity is almost universally decried as being
off limits.''
</P>
<P>
   White-hat hackers grew out of the concept of tiger teams. Since
the 1970s, a number of government laboratories and even some
corporations have deployed special groups of employees who test
computer security by trying to compromise a system or bring it down
in a sort of digital war game.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Palmer, manager of network security and cryptography at
IBM Research, leads a squad of white hats who are paid by companies
to attack their computer systems to test how well they can stand up
to an assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``A white hat does it when asked, under contract, with a
get-out-of-jail-free card,'' said Palmer. ``We'll do the job,
evaluate it, and tell the customer what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Black-hat hackers, on the other hand, adhere to the basic
philosophy that information should be free _ including information
about security weaknesses. For these people, ``breaking into a
system or exposing a system's weaknesses in literal terms, is a
good thing because truth and knowledge should win out in the long
run,'' said Dan Farmer, a network security specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gray-hat hackers, who straddle both worlds,
sometimes acting like malicious hackers, but in pursuit of some
greater good, whether real or imagined. Such is the case with a
group of hackers in Cambridge, Mass., who call themselves L0pht
(pronounced ``loft''). They recently joined forces with (AT)Stake,
a computer security consulting firm in Cambridge with $10 million
in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   When L0pht detected a vulnerability, the group published an
advisory on its Web site. But the description of the security flaw
was usually detailed enough for other, perhaps more malicious,
hackers to use in carrying out an attack. At the same time, the
group published a solution that told network administrators how to
close the hole.
</P>
<P>
   L0pht members have appeared before the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs and have generally received praise.
</P>
<P>
   Mixter, who identifies himself only as a 20-year-old German from
the Hanover area, says he was a gray-hat hacker who recently turned
white hat. In an e-mail interview Friday, he said the conversion
came when he crossed a few ``legal borders'' in 1998 and 1999 and
ran afoul of German law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Mixter, ``I am a white hat, the definition meaning
that I am trying to contribute to improving security by doing what
I do, and completely acting within the law and hacking ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixter defended what he did, saying that his intention in
posting the attack software, known as Tribal Flood Network, was to
alert security sites to vulnerabilities, not to provide vandals
with cyberweapons.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, was that Tribal Flood Network was
adopted as a weapon by vandals before security experts had
succeeded in creating a reliable defense. Even so, Mixter said,
other, similar tools had been available on the Net longer than his.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, said Rasch, the former federal prosecutor: ``That's
like saying, `I've come up with a better bomb, but I'm not the one
who came up with the idea of bombing people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, even if Mixter had intended that attackers use
what he posted, ``it's wrong, but probably not a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer of IBM agreed: ``If he's doing it to educate, I respect
it. But the fact of the matter is, it can be misused, and if he's
not real careful about how he posts it, it can fall into the hands
of people who want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mixter said he was ``not trying to play down the negative
aspects and dangers of this decision,'' he called this week's
attacks ``an inevitable price to pay to be able to develop
countermeasures and fixes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The security sites are making the tools and the source code
public so that everyone has an equal chance of informing himself
about them and coming up with countermeasures,'' he said of public
postings. ``It would be unfair to provide them to just a small
circle of security experts who would possibly only consult some few
elected companies. The only fair way is getting the information out
to everyone, because generally, everyone on the Net can be affected
by security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral ambiguity is most pronounced when hackers offer
commentary about one another. A member of the hacker group Cult of
the Dead Cow who goes by the handle Death Veggie condemned the
week's attacks as ``not hacking'' but ``digital vandalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take any skill, and it's purely destructive,''
Death Veggie said. ``Once a hacker starts becoming really
destructive, they stop being a hacker and become a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Cult of the Dead Cow produced and distributes a program
called Back Orifice, which enables a hacker to control another
computer from a remote location.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Palmer consorts with such groups but refuses to recruit
from their ranks, even if they claim to have gone straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hire reformed hackers because let's just say I've
never really found one,'' he said. ``It's like hiring an arsonist
to be your fire marshall. They know all about the stuff and they
know how to be good at it, but can you ever really sleep at
night?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Palmer occasionally attends Defcon, an annual
three-day hacker gathering in Las Vegas. Palmer said he often mixes
with hackers of all stripes at the hotel bar between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said that what he does _ inventing ways to defend against
attacks like this week's _ is both ``harder'' than malicious
hacking and ``a huge high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasch, who was the lead prosecutor in a high-profile computer
crime case in 1989, said he did not entirely agree with his former
bosses at the Justice Department who are calling for stiffer
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a single case that we can point to and say, `If
only the penalties were greater, the person would not have done
this.''' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's new, racially inclusive census might have seemed
tailor made for Michael Gelobter.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a white Jewish father and an African-Bermudan mother,
Gelobter lives in Harlem with his wife, Sharron Williams, a black
woman whose Caribbean background melds African and Indian
influences. Creating their own cultural road map as they go, the
couple embrace the range of their heritages and those of friends,
marking Passover, for example, with an African-American Latino
seder.
</P>
<P>
   But when the census invites Gelobter, for the first time, to
name all the races that describe him, he will do what he has always
done and claim just one: black. Checking more than one race, he
contends, would undermine the influence of blacks by reducing their
number as a distinct group and so most likely diluting public
policies addressing their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The census forms that will be mailed to most Americans in April
_ the count began last month in Alaska, where the winter chill
tends to keep people at home and easier to tally _ offers a nod to
the nation's increasing diversity. No longer will the Census Bureau
instruct respondents to ``select one'' race to describe themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will tell them to mark one or more of 14 boxes
representing six races and subcategories that apply _ white, black,
American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian Indian, other Asian, and
Pacific Islander _ or to check ``some other race.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Gelobter, many people, indeed most, who could claim
more than one race are not expected to do so, demographers and
census officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, demographers say, is habit: Americans are
simply unaccustomed to the option. More profoundly, however, the
change is fueling a weighty debate about the meaning of race, in
which interpretations of history, politics and experience
frequently overshadow the simpler matter of parentage.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after Loving vs. Virginia struck down the last laws
barring interracial marriage, the new change in the census and the
ensuing controversy have become a barometer of the complexity of
American attitudes toward race, and their contradictions. With the
six racial categories offering 63 possible combinations of racial
identity, which government demographers will tabulate as distinct
groups, the census could provide a remarkably meticulous racial
profile of American society.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the debate stand those who see the revision as a
tactic to divide blacks at a time when affirmative action and other
remedies to discrimination are under attack. Opposing them are
multiracial Americans who resent having to identify with just one
part of their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his perception that the change could diminish blacks'
influence, Gelobter, a 38-year-old professor of environmental
policy at Rutgers University, said that claiming a multiracial
identity would link him to a bitter, freighted history of privilege
for blacks who could cite some white lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should Frederick Douglass have checked white and black?''
Gelobter said. ``Should W.E.B. Du Bois have checked white and
black? He practically looked white.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisions people make, while personal, will echo through
public policy. The Justice Department uses racial data from the
census to analyze voting patterns and evaluate redistricting
proposals under the Voting Rights Act. The department's special
investigations division uses such data to look into accusations of
racial profiling by law-enforcement officers. And city and state
planners study the information to direct help to needy communities
and predict population trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to come up with an area of our work where we
wouldn't have, at one point or another, a need to have census
information broken down by race,'' said Anita Hodgekiss, deputy
assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has not determined how it will classify
people who check more than one race, Hodgekiss said. The racial
data the census provides is so crucial to developing civil rights
policy and directing government aid that some groups like the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are
urging people of both black and white parentage to identify
themselves as only black. The Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund has made a similar request of people who are part
white and part Asian.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the change remains hazy, however, since it is not
known how many people will claim more than one race. In census
dress rehearsals in a variety of places around the country in 1998,
only 2 percent of those surveyed checked more than one race, said
Jorge del Pinal, a spokesman for the Census Bureau.
   Demographers are bracing for an avalanche of data, and others
predict a raft of court cases challenging redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help us,'' said Joseph Salvo, director of the New York
City Planning Department's population division, who sits on a
national committee advising the Census Bureau about the coming
count. ``This is being worked out as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of people checking multiple races are
expected to be in metropolitan areas like New York with large
immigrant populations, but Salvo said there was no way to predict
that number. In Sacramento, the only city in the dress rehearsal,
5.4 percent of people answering the survey claimed more than one
race.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ann Rockquemore, a sociologist at Pepperdine University,
polled 250 college students who had one black parent and one white,
and found that those reared in middle-class or affluent white
neighborhoods tended to identify as biracial, while those who had
grown up in black communities generally considered themselves
black.
</P>
<P>
   Rockquemore, who also has one black and one white parent, said
she was often mistakenly viewed as only white and so heard racist
comments in social settings. ``People say things to me that they
wouldn't say in front of people who are more obviously black,'' she
said. Like Gelobter, she will identify herself as black when she
answers the census.
</P>
<P>
   How will nonblacks of mixed race answer the census? There is
little more than anecdotal evidence. But some experts note that
checking options like Asian and white or American Indian and
Pacific islander does not carry the same historical baggage that
mixed-race blacks confront in deciding whether to say they are
part-white.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Wasmuth, a white man whose wife is Filipino, said the last
time he filled out the census form, in 1990, he ignore the rules
and checked white and Asian boxes to describe his daughters. This
year he will do the same. ``People are beginning to say, `I'm a
mixture, and I don't have to choose one or the other,''' he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Wade, 34, an industrial electronics technician from
Brooklyn, wishes he could avoid descriptions altogether. His father
is half-black and half-white, and his mother is East Indian and
white.
</P>
<P>
   When applications ask his race, and none of the boxes fit, Wade
said, ``the first thing I feel is excluded. Then sometimes I feel
that I should not be in a position where I have to state my race.''
He said that in this year's census he would check all the boxes
that described his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do as a country is get rid of these stupid
boxes altogether,'' said Charles Byrd, who runs a Web site, Inter
Racial Voice.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1990 census, about 10 million Americans seemed to agree.
They did not identify themselves as members of any race, said Margo
J. Anderson, author of ``The American Census: A Social History''
(Yale University Press, 1988). A quarter-million ignored the
government's instructions and identified themselves as belonging to
more than one race in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first head count in 1790, Anderson said, the census
has played an important, if subtle, role in reflecting
preoccupations and shaping social thought. Over the last century,
the government devised questions to reveal the country's ethnic
makeup. In the 1910 census, the government asked people their
mother tongue, looking for Yiddish as then answer in order to tally
the number of Jewish immigrants. ``The changes in questions always
come about because of the social issues of the day,'' Anderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Graham, head of Project Race, a civic group that like Byrd
unsuccessfully pushed for a separate ``multiracial'' box for the
census, said she wanted a category that would accurately define her
children. ``Think of when you open a newspaper and see pie
charts,'' said Graham, who lives in Tallahassee, Fla. ``We wanted a
slice of the pie that says multiracial.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is white, is married to a black man. When she
testified before Congress, she brought along 14 pages detailing
crimes against interracial families. Without a single statistical
category for interracial people, she argued, those crimes remain
obscured in the thicket of hate crimes generally. Graham said she
did not want to hide her children's black heritage, but to nurture
their entire identity. ``Nobody can tell me my children are more
black than white,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the change describe it as a passport to
denial, and a reflection of prejudice. ``The only reason it isn't
fair to make them choose one race is because of what it means to be
black in America,'' said Wendy Thorpe-Cruz, who is black and
teaches multiculturalism in a high school equivalency program in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe-Cruz, 43, said she feels the sting of racism every day:
white women who clutch their purses when she passes and white men
she dated who dared not introduce her to their parents. ``In order
to understand why people are asking for the biracial category,
every white person would have to be black for a year,'' Thorpe-Cruz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Karp, the founder and director of an ``intellectual salon''
for blacks and Jews at Yale University called the Chai Society,
acknowledged a gap between his ideal, ``a world in which there are
no boxes,'' and his decision to identify himself as exclusively
black on the census. Karp, whose father is white and Jewish and
whose mother is black, said, ``It's a contradiction we're forced to
live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Karp noted that in America, the black label tended to
incorporate other races, including white and American Indian, while
white meant the absence of other races. Socially, he said, ``black
Americans get identified with their poorest members. Success is
seen as the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up and leaned forward. ``I am also the black
experience,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ The candidate small-talked his way through the crowd,
made some self-congratulatory remarks, cracked a few jokes _
everything about the fund-raising lunch for Sen. John McCain in
Manhattan on Friday had a familiar feel. Except for the people who
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting McCain with cheers and checks were an assortment of
political newcomers. There was Martin A. Cohen, a Democrat who has
never voted for a Republican; Patricia Wallace, a Republican who
was giving her first contribution in a presidential race, in part
because she was angered by the state party's effort to keep McCain
off many primary ballots; and John Sweeney, an independent on his
first foray into politics. And, just as notable, few politicians.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has sent jitters through the Republican establishment,
which overwhelmingly favors Gov. George W. Bush, by drawing support
from outsiders not normally involved in primaries. The fund-raiser
in Manhattan at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, as well as another later in
New Jersey, suggested that the New York area is no different when
it comes to McCain's surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a breath of fresh air,'' said Sweeney, a consultant
for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``When he says he is going to tell the
truth, I think you can depend on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this newfound ardor could be chalked up to curiosity,
and with the primary in New York weeks away, McCain's popularity
since his victory in the New Hampshire primary could fade as
quickly as it grew. The Republican leadership in New York is
staunchly backing Bush and would have no trouble putting together a
far larger fund-raiser for him in the city. The two McCain events
Friday were expected to bring in $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the Democrats and independents who flocked to the
McCain fund-raisers may have given their money, but they cannot
give their votes because they are barred from voting in the
Republican primaries in New York, on March 7, and New Jersey, on
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Republicans who attended the events maintained that
their Republican friends were also taking a long look at McCain,
particularly since the ballot fight in New York, which McCain won
by challenging the state party's complicated rules in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That annoyed me tremendously,'' said Wallace, a lawyer who
lives in Bronxville. ``When the state party called and asked for
money, I told them that I would not send the state committee any
money until they allowed Forbes and McCain on the ballot because I
didn't think it was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am probably one of about five people in Bronxville that
aren't supporting Bush at this point,'' she said. ``I'm hoping
there will be more converts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the event in Bedminster, N.J., at the Fiddler's Elbow Country
Club, Mollie O'Brien, a Republican, said she found McCain
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about a candidate for the first time since I've
been voting,'' said O'Brien, 31, a lawyer who lives in Morristown,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a retired public relations executive who has volunteered
for the McCain campaign in New York, said he was disappointed that
as a Democrat he could not vote for McCain in the primary. But he
noted that his wife, Annette, was not registered, and was going to
register by Friday's deadline so she could cast a ballot for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm what John calls a McCain Democrat,'' Cohen said. ``I am
tremendously impressed by him as an individual and what he stands
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some party stalwarts did attend the events, among them Georgette
Mosbacher and Gail Hilson, who have raised money for Gov. George E.
Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani but have broken with them in
supporting McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mosbacher and Hilson said that since New Hampshire, they had
been having little trouble rounding up money for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never experienced my voice mail being so full that
people couldn't leave messages,'' Mosbacher said. ``This is the
first time in politics I've ever had people call me to give me
checks for candidates, as opposed to the other way around.''

SCHOOL BOARD ACTS TO BLOCK FORMATION OF MORE GAY-RELATED GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct name of agency in lede graf.)  
(mk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Already ordered by a federal judge to allow
meetings of a gay tolerance club at a high school, the Orange
Unified School District voted Thursday night to restrict clubs at
elementary and middle schools to those related to studies in an
effort to block similar organizations at lower grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   The school board stopped short of taking such action at its high
schools, instead proposing to tighten rules on noncurricular clubs.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials described the move, which came one day
after the Gay-Straight Alliance at El Modena High School held its
first meeting under a court order, as a ``pre-emptive strike.'' The
officials noted that local activists had said they would assist
students wanting to start similar groups in other high schools or
in middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   The changes would require students to obtain written consent
from their parents to participate in a club, maintain a 2.0 grade
average and refrain from discussions of a sexual nature. The board
will discuss the proposed changes with its lawyer, and may vote on
them at its next regularly scheduled meeting on Feb. 24. The
changes, if passed, would not go into effect until July 1, after
the current school year ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to put safeguards in place while they
make a decision about how and whether to go forward in court,''
said Judith Frutig, director of communications for the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions over the issue continued at El Modena High School on
Friday, officials said. In the morning, about 200 students staged a
walkout, and 50 of them scaled a fence at the school and left.
While some students said they were demonstrating support for gay
alliance members, others said they opposed the group. Still others
said they were showing support for teachers in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tensions on campus are right on the surface,'' Frutig
said, noting that the school district had a holiday coming up on
Monday. ``It's been a long week. I think everyone is looking
forward to the three-day holiday as a cooling-off time.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, which in December denied the Gay-Straight Alliance's
application to meet at school, is being sued by club organizers
under the Equal Access Act, a federal law passed in 1984 that
prohibits schools from selectively denying noncurricular clubs on
the basis of content. The suit also contends that the students are
being denied their constitutional rights to free speech and equal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Judge David O. Carter of U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles found merit in the club's arguments and issued a
preliminary injunction ordering the district to allow students to
meet as the case progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberty groups representing the club's organizers in their
lawsuit against the district said they were examining the board's
proposed policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal to have a parental consent requirement is
discriminatory both in its intent and its effect,'' said Judith E.
Schaeffer, deputy legal director with People for the American Way
Foundation, one group involved in the suit. ``I think it's common
sense to know that a high school student who wants to join the
chess club won't have any problem asking her parents to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``There are many gay and lesbian students who
need the safe haven of a gay-straight alliance who will have
difficulty discussing that with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer noted that in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles,
school officials considered a similar action four years ago when
confronted with an application for a gay and lesbian students club.
In that case, lawyers persuaded the board to adopt a policy of
notifying parents about what clubs met at school and leaving it to
them to discuss any concerns with their children.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said lawyers were still examining the issue of the 2.0
grade average requirement. While it might be wise for some
students, she said, for others who are struggling with their
grades, peer support can be a way of staying engaged in school. She
also noted that the students in the alliance said from the
beginning that they would not discuss sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with this club,'' she said. ``The
board's obligation now is to abide by the court's decision and
return to the business of educating the school district's
students.''

DEUTCH HELPED OFFICIAL MONITORING THE INVESTIGATION OF HIM TO FIND
A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)

 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Deutch, a former director of central
intelligence, recommended a top CIA official for a high-paying job
at Citibank even as she was monitoring an internal investigation
into evidence that Deutch had mishandled classified information,
according to agency records and interviews with officials.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch resigned as director in December 1996 and was almost
immediately elected to the board of Citibank. That same month, CIA
computer security officials uncovered evidence that he had placed
large amounts of classified information on nonsecure computers at
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Slatkin, the former executive director of the CIA, notified
the agency that she was considering a position at Citibank while
she was still monitoring the Deutch case inside the agency, records
of the agency show. A classified review by the agency's inspector
general of the handling of that case found that actions by Slatkin
``had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin resigned from the agency in September 1997 and joined
Citibank as a vice president in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 1997, she officially notified the agency that she
was withdrawing from consideration of any matters involving
Citibank because she was thinking about taking a job with the bank,
according to agency records.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in July 1997, she reviewed a secret report from CIA security
officials on their findings in the Deutch investigation, according
to the classified report from the agency's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA declined to comment Friday on any aspect of the
investigation. A special panel reviewing the handling of the Deutch
matter by agency officials has just completed its report, but its
findings have not been publicly released.
</P>
<P>
   A Citibank spokesman, speaking for Slatkin, stressed that the
CIA's internal investigation into the Deutch case was over weeks
before her conversations began with Citibank. Although security
officials were still writing up their report on the matter at the
time, she was not involved in its drafting, the spokesman said.
Slatkin added in a statement that she had excused herself from
taking part in the Deutch investigation, and that her only role was
to keep information flowing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Citibank spokesman said Slatkin was referred to Citibank by
Deutch as she was considering where to move after leaving the
agency. Deutch encouraged her to go to Citibank after Slatkin told
him she was considering a different job at Chase Manhattan Bank,
the Citibank spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nora was seriously considering a job at Chase,'' the Citibank
spokesman said. ``When Deutch heard about that, he introduced her
to Citibank. She went through the normal interview process, and
everyone was quite impressed, and ultimately she was hired.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Slatkin's hiring at Citibank was a
quid pro quo for actions she took in the Deutch investigation while
at the agency. A Citibank spokesman described Slatkin as a
``star,'' adding that Citibank officials felt fortunate that she
had accepted their job offer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her move to Citibank further underscores the close ties that
existed between Deutch and the senior agency officials who played
crucial roles in the agency's long-stalled inquiry in Deutch's
case. Critics of how the matter was handled have contended that top
officials of the agency were too close to have conducted an
aggressive investigation. The inspector general's report also cited
the current director, George Tenet, who was Deutch's deputy before
succeeding him, for failing to do more to ``forcefully ensure''
that the case was properly investigated. Tenet would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin, who is still at Citibank and has risen to program
manager for Citigroup business services, served as the agency's
third-highest ranking official during Deutch's tenure as director,
and had previously worked with Deutch at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation of Deutch began in December 1996,
just as he was leaving the CIA. After computer security officials
at the agency discovered classified material on unclassified,
CIA-issued computers in Deutch's home, they investigated to
determine whether Deutch had violated agency regulations and
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their discovery, some CIA security officers came
to believe that senior officials at the agency, seeking to protect
Deutch, were blocking efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neill, who was then general counsel of the agency,
quickly told the FBI's general counsel, Howard Shapiro, that
classified material had been found on Deutch's computers. But CIA
officials did not formally notify the Justice Department that
Deutch might have broken the law for more than a year after the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch case was effectively dead until a CIA employee
notified the inspector general's office in early 1998 that the
inquiry had not been handled properly. The employee was angry that
another senior official of the agency had been punished for what
the employee believed were far less serious violations, while no
action had been taken in the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's inspector general opened his own investigation in
early 1998 and the Justice Department was then notified about the
Deutch matter, according to the report. Last April, Attorney
General Janet Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay of more than a year in notifying the department
had the effect of allowing a one-year time limit on appointing an
independent counsel to investigate the Deutch case to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin acknowledges that her close ties to Deutch posed a
serious problem for her in trying to deal with the agency's
internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Deutch moved to the CIA, he named her executive
director, where he gave her broad authority to supervise a wide
range of operations at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin says she talked to Tenet almost immediately after the
investigation began about her role. ``I thought I should recuse
myself, and I discussed it with George, and we agreed I would have
no role in the investigation other than facilitating the flow of
information,'' Slatkin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin's lawyer in Washington, Mark Tuohey, also stresses that
his client was not running the internal investigation at the
agency, but instead left that to its professional staff. The
inspector general's report quotes Slatkin as saying she explained
to Tenet that she believed the matter was too sensitive for her to
handle, and that Tenet ``had the responsibility for making the
decisions relating to the Deutch incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she played a major role in the case, other CIA officials
later told the inspector general. In fact, the inspector general's
report quotes Slatkin as saying that Tenet ``gave her the
responsibility for coordinating'' the case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By January 1997, security officials had determined that the most
critical evidence in the case was on four portable computer cards
that contained files from Deutch's computers. But when they looked
for them, they were informed that O'Neill had obtained the cards
and was keeping them in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill then began to rebuff requests to turn the four cards
over to the security staff, according to the inspector general's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Calder, the CIA's deputy director for administration,
who oversees the security staff, stepped in, and talked with
O'Neill about the cards. Calder said he wanted O'Neill to turn the
cards over to the security staff, but O'Neill wanted to keep them,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   A security official then complained to Slatkin that O'Neill
``was dragging his feet,'' and that his refusal to turn the cards
over to the security office ``made it look like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Slatkin reached an agreement with Calder in which
one security officer would be allowed to review all of the computer
files gathered from Deutch's home. The four portable computer cards
were finally turned over after Tenet directed O'Neill to do so, but
only after they had been held by O'Neill for about three weeks, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   In the inspector general's report, Calder is quoted as saying
that discussions on the Deutch investigation with Slatkin ``were
always difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Tenet, the new CIA director, began to establish his
own management team, Slatkin started looking for a new job. But
after notifying the CIA that she was in talks with Citibank on June
27, she remained in place as CIA executive director until July 21,
and continued to monitor the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   The security office's report on the Deutch case, dated July 8,
was sent to Calder, who then sent it to Slatkin. Calder later told
the inspector general that he recalled receiving the report back
from Slatkin with ``marginal comments, possibly asking if (the
computer memory cards) had been destroyed,'' the inspector
general's report states.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin recalled receiving a draft of the report from Calder,
making comments requesting clarification, and then returning it to
either Calder or Jay Castillo, the security official who had been
allowed to review the four cards. According to the inspector
general's report, the copy of the report with Slatkin's marginal
notations could not be found. The four cards were never destroyed
by the CIA.

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Within three hours of the killing of the
latest Israeli soldier, smiling officials of Hezbollah, the
Lebanon-based Party of God, summoned fresh cups of Turkish coffee
for Western reporters, handed out a communique about the attack and
released a freshly printed sheet of statistics, complete with a pie
chart, listing all seven Israeli soldiers killed by Hezbollah in
the last 18 days. Proudly, the Hezbollah men noted that the Israeli
losses were the heaviest inflicted by their group in a similar
period since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the gathering in the Beirut information center was a
smooth demonstration of what might be called Hezbollah 2000, the
media-friendly, computer-savvy, mobile phone-equipped, multiple Web
site version of the Islamic militant group that bludgeoned its way
into the American consciousness in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, the attack that killed Zachi Yitak, the
Israeli soldier, set off a serious crisis. Diplomats said it could
further widen the breach that has hobbled peace talks between
Israel and Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon and the patron,
along with Iran, of Hezbollah. But in the Hezbollah office, in a
ramshackle building not far from the Beirut airport, it was evident
that the Hezbollah of today wears a new face.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Hezbollah rose to the top of the United States'
list of terrorist organizations, with a series of attacks that
included the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Beirut,
the 1983 bombing of U.S. and French marine barracks in which 241
Americans and 59 Frenchmen died, and serial kidnappings that made
hostages for years of Americans, British and other victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah today has a new populist image, with
representatives forming the largest single-party group in the
Lebanese Parliament. It also has an impressive network of schools,
hospitals and welfare centers that cater to tens of thousands of
families, and an information network that may be unrivaled anywhere
in the world, at least by an organization that many Western nations
still list as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Hezbollah has one of the most watched
television stations in Lebanon, which nightly broadcasts footage of
Hezbollah strikes on Israeli forces, taken from hand-held video
cameras. The broadcasts, showing young guerrillas striking at
Israel on the last active Arab-Israeli combat front, have attracted
an enthusiastic audience across this nation of 3.5 million people.
Among them are many who previously shunned Hezbollah for what they
viewed as a militant Islamic posture ill attuned to the
cosmopolitan society on which many Lebanese pride themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Any Western reporter wanting to write about Hezbollah must first
make contact at the information office in the suburb of Haret
Hreik, a mile or so from the airport in a heavily crowded area that
has a concentrated population of Shiite Muslims, the largest of
Lebanon's population groups and the base of support for Hezbollah.
It was from this area in the 1980s that Hezbollah, or one of its
front organizations, mounted many headline-grabbing operations,
including the kidnapping in 1985 of Terry Anderson, the Associated
Press bureau chief who spent nearly seven years as a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the emphasis is not on taking Western reporters
captive but on welcoming them and convincing them of the legitimacy
of the Hezbollah cause. Escorted trips are arranged to southern
Lebanese Hezbollah strongholds like Nabatiyeh, near the site of the
attack on Beaufort Castle, the ancient Crusader fort where the
Israeli soldier died in Friday's attack. Videos are made available
of the latest Hezbollah assaults, with officials proudly pointing
out that many of them, including a missile attack earlier this week
that killed another Israeli soldier at Dabshe, near Nabatiyeh, end
up being shown on Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon Abvu Mohammed Alameh, a Hezbollah spokesman,
brandishing a personal organizer to check his facts, was especially
eager to point out that his group had its own bulletin on the
Beaufort Castle attack prepared and printed before the attack was
confirmed by Israel. The bulletin, in Arabic, was headed, as always
with Hezbollah communiques, with quotations from the Koran. ``In
the name of God the most merciful,'' it said. ``With God on your
side, no one can defeat you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The text of the statement was, it must be said, old-style
Hezbollah, with little public relations polishing of the style or
grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our continuing operations to end the occupation of southern
Lebanon and liberate the land of our people,'' it said, ``and in
accordance with our goal of inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli
forces and kicking the last of them out of our nation, in a manner
that leaves the occupying forces with no chance of withstanding our
Islamic fighters, the fighting unit known as Martyrs of Farouk
Ismail with God's help today at 11.55 a.m. attacked with rockets
and machine-gun fire the main Israeli stronghold at Qalat Ashrif.''
Qalat Ashrif is the Arabic name for Beaufort Castle.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying information sheet distributed by Alameh was
much closer to the buttoned-down, corporate style of the new
Hezbollah. The sheet gave figures for the casualties inflicted in
all of Hezbollah's attacks in the six weeks since the start of the
year, and included a column giving Israeli figures for the same
incidents, mostly the same as Hezbollah's. The pie chart, giving
percentage breakdowns for casualties among the Israeli troops and
the South Lebanon Army, the Christian militia force allied to
Israel in the occupation zone, said that 24 percent of the 77 dead
and wounded among the two forces since the start of the year have
been Israelis, 74 percent members of the Christian militia force
and 2 percent members of ``joint patrols.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no figures for Hezbollah casualties, either on the
two-month casualty sheet or from the officials, although Hezbollah
fighters near Nabatiyeh had told visitors on Thursday that
``hundreds'' of their men have been killed during the 22-year
Israeli occupation, and ``dozens'' in recent months. Roadsides in
the area are dotted with metal billboards bearing the images of
bearded young ``martyrs,'' mostly young, who have been killed in
fighting with the Israeli forces, and every reporter's visit
includes a supervised talk with a martyr's widow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hezbollah office in Beirut, the emphasis is kept
firmly on the positive. Alameh, the spokesman, seemed especially
proud that the bulletin on the operation that killed the Israeli
soldier Friday had been issued within 35 minutes of the strike,
before the attack was confirmed by Israel. Along with other
Hezbollah officials, he made it plain that he shared none of the
concerns of other Beirut residents about new Israeli air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he expected new Israeli bomb attacks on
targets around Beirut and other population centers, Alameh, 47, a
grizzle-bearded Lebanese who worked for years as a sales manager
for a U.S. oil company in the Persian Gulf, smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is open,'' he said _ including, it seemed, the
possibility of an air attack on Hezbollah's television station, the
jewel in its crown. A proposed visit to the station by two Western
reporters would have to be put off for a day, at least, he said,
still smiling, because Hezbollah would not want to put visitors at
risk.

RAVENS' RAY LEWIS INDICTED IN NIGHTCLUB KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro linebacker,
was indicted Friday on two murder charges by a Fulton County grand
jury, charged with six counts in connection with the stabbing
deaths outside an Atlanta nightclub 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two companions who rode away from the scene with Lewis in a
stretch limousine _ and who are the subjects of a manhunt _ were
indicted on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   A bond hearing for the 24-year-old Lewis will be held Monday. He
has been in police custody since his arrest Jan. 31, less than 24
hours after the stabbing deaths occurred in a sidewalk brawl
between two groups of post-Super Bowl revelers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrants have been issued for the other two men indicted with
Lewis, Reginald Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 24,
of Miami. District Attorney Paul L. Howard Jr. said Friday that he
did not expect any of the other nine passengers who left the scene
in the limousine _ and have not yet come forward to testify _ to
face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both
of Decatur in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects all face two counts of malicious murder, two counts
of felony murder and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon. Conviction on the malicious murder and felony murder
charges could result in the death penalty, the district attorney's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Howard appeared at first to indicate that
Lewis wielded a knife in the slayings, but he retreated from that
assertion under questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he actually used the knife is not important,'' Howard
said. Under Georgia law, he added, testimony by witnesses that
Lewis ``punched, encouraged and assisted others in the attack on
these men'' was sufficient for a murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' chief lawyer, Ed Garland, followed the announcement with
a news conference of his own at his offices, attacking Howard and
the Atlanta Police Department for mishandling the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, a noted criminal lawyer who is known in the region for
a certain flamboyance while representing the rich and famous,
blistered Atlanta investigators by citing a previous botched
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just did to Ray Lewis what they did to Richard Jewell,''
Garland said, citing the 1996 leaks to news media organizations
that led to speculation that Jewell, a security officer during the
Summer Olympics here, was responsible for a bombing attack at
Olympic Park that resulted in two deaths. He was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis was in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Garland
said. ``He is being singled out because of his celebrity status.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, Garland said, ``gave mealy-mouthed
answers when he knows absolutely that Lewis did not have a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they traced a knife found at the death scene
to a sporting goods store in the Atlanta area where Lewis was
signing autographs the day before the Super Bowl. The police also
have a receipt for the knife's purchase with Lewis' signature and
telephone number on it.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Lewis, who has a four-year, $26 million
contract, gave them misleading information and was uncooperative in
the hours before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Garland has acknowledged that his client was part of the group
of men involved in the brawl, but said Lewis tried to break up a
fight and entered his leased limousine before any blood was shed.

WALL ST. FIRMS REWARD CHIEFS FOR STRONG '99  
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Running an investment bank may not be the most
lucrative job around anymore, but, judging by the compensation
numbers from two of the biggest firms on Wall Street, the pay is
still very good.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., the biggest securities firm as
measured by capital, paid its top two executives more than $26
million each in salary, bonus, stock and options last year,
according to the firm's 1999 proxy statement. Those packages were
53 percent larger than the amounts awarded in 1998 to the
executives, Philip Purcell and John Mack.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which rebounded from a tumultuous year in
1998 but did not perform as well as Morgan Stanley, nearly tripled
the compensation of its chairman and chief executive, David
Komansky, to $29.3 million in 1999, according to Merrill's proxy
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky's package included a cash bonus of $8.2 million, stock
worth $2.1 million, stock options worth $9.8 million and an
insurance policy on his life worth $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Komansky's pay, certainly among the highest of any chief
executive on Wall Street, came in a year in which the firm's No. 2
executive, Herbert Allison, was forced to resign and the firm
changed its business model to accommodate low-commission stock
trading over the Internet. Allison, who was president and chief
operating officer, has not been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The next best-paid senior executive at Merrill was Stanley
O'Neal, the chief financial officer. O'Neal received $19.1 million,
including options worth $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're carting out compensation in 18-wheelers, but Wall
Street is no longer the highest-paying industry of all like it used
to be,'' said Graef Crystal, a compensation expert and shareholder
activist.
</P>
<P>
   The pay reports are the first from securities firms for 1999,
which was the most profitable ever on Wall Street. They disclose
the pay of top executives, but not necessarily the firms' best-paid
employees. Often, top investment bankers and traders earn more than
their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector's heavy use of stock options to pay
executives has made leaders of some relatively new companies in
Silicon Valley much wealthier, at least on paper, than their
counterparts on Wall Street. Even Purcell's pay, which Crystal has
characterized as excessive in past years, seems more justifiable
now, Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings per share are up sharply, and the returns to
shareholders are beautiful,'' Crystal said. ``He's done a very fine
job.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of his pay, Purcell gained $11.4 million last year from
the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Options
give their holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares
at preset prices. Purcell's exercises left him options worth about
$102 million, according to the proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the matching packages Morgan Stanley's board granted the
top executives, Mack received options worth $2.2 million to replace
shares Mack used to pay for the exercise of other options. Morgan
Stanley calls such grants restoration options. Other companies call
them reload options.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they are called, Crystal rails against them. ``An
option is supposed to die when it is either exercised or expires
without being exercised,'' he said. ``With these, you can reload
and reload and reload.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Purcell's pay package was the same as Mack's, except
for more than 600,000 restoration options Purcell received, which
the firm valued at more than $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and Mack each received a salary of $775,000, a bonus of
$12.1 million, stock worth $8.2 million and options worth $5.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   A third Morgan Stanley executive, Peter Karches, the president
of its institutional securities group, took home more than $25
million last year. Karches, the president of the firm's
institutional securities group, received a bonus of $11.8 million,
stock worth $7.9 million and options worth $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Morgan Stanley executives, Vikram Pandit and Joseph
Perella, received pay packages worth about $17.8 million. Pandit
oversees the firm's stock underwriting, sales and trading
operations; Perella is the head of the firm's investment banking
division.
</P>
<P>
   At Merrill Lynch, three other executives received more than $14
million each last year. Thomas Davis, who oversees the firm's
institutional businesses, took home about $17.3 million, including
$7.5 million in cash and stock, options worth $5.7 million and $3.9
million insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   John Steffens, the longtime head of Merrill's brokerage network,
and Jeffrey Peek, who has been trying to turn around Merrill's
struggling mutual-fund operation, each got about $7.5 million in
cash and stock, options worth almost $5 million and an insurance
policy worth about $2 million. Inside Merrill, Peek, Davis and
O'Neal are considered leading contenders to succeed Allison as
president of the firm later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Steffens gained more than $22 million last year from exercising
360,000 options, according to the proxy. Those moves left him with
options worth about $63 million, the proxy shows. Komansky held
options worth more than $110 million, it shows.

MRS. CLINTON BACKS TAX RELIEF FOR COLLEGE COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKVILLE, N.Y. _ Seizing on one of the central proposals of
Charles Schumer's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1998,
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday took her campaign to two Long
Island campuses and pledged to push to make college tuition
tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the rising costs of a college education, which
have outpaced family income and financial assistance programs, are
giving pause even to otherwise comfortable, middle-class families.
``Most parents that I know, whose children are young, are already
worried about how they will afford college,'' she told an audience
of students at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University in
Brookville.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with Schumer at her side, Clinton lent her support to
his proposal to make up to $10,000 a year in higher education
expenses tax-deductible. The plan would offer people paying for
college, graduate study or training courses up to $2,800 a year in
tax relief. Just two years ago, when Schumer was the candidate,
Clinton accompanied him to Long Island to make the proposal.
Friday, the message was much the same but the roles were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making tuition tax-deductible is gaining some
support in Washington, but its future is uncertain in Congress.
President Clinton, who included it in the 2001 budget proposal that
he unveiled last month, credited Mrs. Clinton and Schumer with
pressing for it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at C.W. Post and at Adelphi University in Garden City,
Clinton also advocated a $3,000 tax credit for people caring for
elderly relatives, a plan to cut taxes on married couples to ease
the so-called marriage penalty, and a provision to make it possible
for people who do not itemize their income tax returns to get
credit for charitable contributions.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I took the plunge into the after-hours stock
market, trying to buy 100 shares of the Superior National Insurance
Group.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't exactly interested in finding good companies in which
to invest _ and I knew little about Superior National, which just
happened to be one of the Nasdaq's most active stocks the evening I
sat down at my computer to trade.
</P>
<P>
   I simply wanted to participate in the new craze of buying and
selling stocks after the closing bell sounds on Wall Street. I
wanted to see if someone with little or no experience could trade
successfully in the after-hours market.
</P>
<P>
   I also thought it might be fun trading around dinner time with
someone else's money.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. After a few weeks of after-hours trading, with $5,000
generously supplied by this newspaper, my clicking and ordering had
all the drama of a Senate filibuster. Nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   My attempt to buy Superior National went nowhere. It was what
they call a penny stock, trading at just $4.75 a share, but no one
wanted my pennies. At 7:22 p.m., two hours after I first entered a
buy order, I received a message from ETrade saying that my order
had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I tried to buy 100 shares of Pfizer Inc., one
of the world's biggest drug companies. I clicked. I waited. I
expired _ or at least my order did.
</P>
<P>
   And so went my first foray into the after-hours markets. After
having just one of every three trades executed in four days of
trading (and making just $45 in profits before commissions and
taxes), I have decided that after-hours trading isn't all it's
cracked up to be _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is just my opinion. Clearly, big financial
companies with access to reams of statistics and surveys are of a
different mind. In the last year, some of the nation's largest
online brokerage firms, including ETrade and Charles Schwab, have
created after-hours markets, and the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq are planning late trading sessions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The online brokers say that reopening the stock markets to small
investors after 4 p.m. Eastern time is the next move in a
revolution sweeping Wall Street, toppling the old-boy network and
giving the average investor the chance to jump in and out of the
market day and night, just as the pros do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have surveyed our customers, we had 40 percent or
closer to 50 percent say if the market was available in the
after-hours, they would trade,'' said Lon Gorman, vice chairman of
Schwab, the nation's largest online brokerage firm, with more than
3.3 million online accounts holding total assets of $349 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but those customers are not exactly rushing into the
after-hours market. As they say on Wall Street, there's not a whole
lot of liquidity after 4 p.m. This month, the total volume in
after-hours markets open to retail investors has averaged 46
million shares a day, a mere 2 percent of the average volume on the
New York and Nasdaq markets during a regular trading day.
</P>
<P>
   And the trading that does occur is highly fragmented. The
after-hours market is, in fact, four separate marketplaces,
operated by different brokerage firms. Schwab operates one through
Redibook, an electronic communications network it owns in a joint
venture with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Fidelity Investments.
Datek uses its Island ECN, which caters to active traders.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade customers like me trade in an after-hours market run by
Instinet. MarketXT, headed by a former Instinet executive, offers
late trading through Dreyfus, Salomon Smith Barney,
Mydiscountbroker.com and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online. (The
Chicago Stock Exchange operates an after-hours market, too, but
mainly for institutional investors; retail investors can reach it
only through certain brokerage firms, not online.)
</P>
<P>
   Many experts agree that the after-hours markets will blossom
into a formidable trading forum, as the major exchanges extend
their hours and as the glitches that sometimes confound e-commerce,
like last week's hacker attacks, are overcome. But for now, some
financial advisers are warning against jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't need to trade in the after-hours market, don't,''
said John Markese, president of the American Association of
Individual Investors in Chicago. ``The market is thin and very
volatile. If you trade through an ECN, you may not get a good
price. There are still cul-de-sacs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the streets aren't marked very clearly. Some after-hours
markets trade only Nasdaq stocks, others just the best-known names
from both the Nasdaq and the Big Board. Some employ electronic
order-matching systems, others red-blooded human market makers.
Even the hours in question vary; some markets are open from 4 to 6
p.m., others from 4 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned. It says it
favors investor choice, but its regulators _ who continue to study
the after-hours markets _ want investors to be informed about the
risks, including the dangers of volatile price swings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how small a market are you in when you trade online after 4
p.m.? Last Tuesday, the volume in Schwab's Redibook market was 2.9
million shares. (During the day, Schwab trades an average of 330
million shares.) Also on Tuesday, there were 8.7 million shares
traded on the Island ECN, while just 156,000 shares traded on
MarketXT.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard L. Madoff, the president of Madoff Securities, said he
was working with MarketXT to spur activity in its after-hours
market. The Madoff firm is a big Nasdaq market maker, meaning that
its business is to foster trading in specific stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Madoff typically has eight traders buying and selling with
investors like me from 4 to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday. But not
many retail investors are showing up in MarketXT's virtual trading
room, and he is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of after-hours trading is designed for a
limited universe,'' he said, referring to investors comfortable in
a tougher, more sophisticated market. ``Some people were surprised
by the small volumes, but we weren't. Clearly it is not a liquid
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, hasn't stopped just about every major online
brokerage firm from announcing plans to offer after-hours trading.
The firms are expecting that trading volumes will eventually soar
and that all the various market arenas will be linked.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange,
talks in lofty terms about a time not far in the future when a
global stock marketplace will operate around the clock. The world
is ``equifying,'' he says, meaning that a global ``we'' are all
dying to trade stocks. And it appears that we are. More than 477
billion shares were traded last year on the Big Board and Nasdaq,
almost triple the 174 billion in 1995.

 &HT;    Rising new stars eclipsing the old
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It might as well be braided into Allen Iverson's
head or tattooed on Vince Carter's biceps. The state of the NBA,
exemplified by the participants in Sunday's All-Star Game, is that
evident: Time for the old school to move aside for the new.
</P>
<P>
   Nine first-time players will participate in the classic at the
Arena in Oakland, a clear indication that change is on the horizon,
if not already firmly in place. It is virtually unanimously agreed
that such an evolution is promising for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the game more open, there's more opportunities for the
younger players to shine,'' said Milwaukee forward Glenn Robinson,
a first-time All-Star. ``The faster the game, the more the
athleticism of the young guys comes out. And so, we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away neophyte All-Star Dale Davis, 30, of Indiana, and the
average age of the eight other first-timers is 25 years, 2 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a changing of the guard,'' Dallas first-timer Michael
Finley said. ``There's a young core of players who are ready to
take the league to the next level. We're aggressive. We're new
school. The former All-Stars are old school, meaning they're more
traditional. They like the pick-and-roll. We're more exciting, more
high-flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, Robinson and Davis are joined by first-timers Allen
Iverson of Philadelphia, Vince Carter of Toronto, Allan Houston of
New York, Ray Allen of Milwaukee, Jerry Stackhouse of Detroit and
Rasheed Wallace of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they've worked hard and earned it, I don't have a problem
with the young guys being All-Stars,'' said Utah's 10-time
All-Star, John Stockton, 37. ``I don't look at it like they're
taking over. I look at it like the young guys worked hard and
earned a spot. It's good for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with Michael Jordan two years removed from the league as
a player, the infusion of youthful excellence gives the NBA a level
of variety and security. On top of the nine first-time All-Stars,
there are six others playing Sunday who are 27 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in others who are early in their careers and did not make
the All-Star team _ like Golden State's Antawn Jamison (who
withdrew from the slam dunk competition because of a strained
knee), New Jersey's Stephon Marbury, Sacramento's Jason Williams,
Boston's Paul Pierce, Houston's Steve Francis and the Clippers'
Lamar Odom _ and the league has a plethora of young talent upon
which to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new school is definitely in effect,'' Minnesota All-Star
Kevin Garnett said. ``There are a lot of young guys who have raised
their game and bring excitement. There comes a time when things
change. And this just might be that time.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, said Wallace, the thrilling yet petulant
Trail Blazers forward. ``Change,'' he said. ``It had to happen.
There had to be an evolution. There was Magic and Michael. Now,
there are a lot of young guys coming along. To me, it's not
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprsing to a 13-year veteran and five-time All-Star
like the Pacers' Reggie Miller, either. ``A lot of guys are playing
well for the first time,'' he said, laughing. ``Really, though,
these guys can play. There has to be some change with time, and
there are a lot of guys who are taking the responsibility to jump
in there and help carry the league. They're the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Added the Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo: ``It's a challenge for the
veteran guys to continue to work hard and project a positive image,
because the young guys are coming along and will push your name
aside.''

<P>
   ``The product is global now,'' Grasso said. ``It's going to
trade like gold or oil trade. We are not there yet. No. But we will
experiment with extended-hours trading.'' Both the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq are studying when and how to offer it.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, a division of the
Reuters Group, said the evolution would start with stocks like AT&AMP;T
and Microsoft that are the most widely held and traded, then
broaden.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, the pioneer in after-hours trading for large
institutions, now trades about 40 million shares from 4 p.m. to
9:30 a.m. the next day, although one of the busiest days in the
trade-matching market it has operated after-hours for ETrade was
all of 1.6 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin and others say that if supermarkets can stay open around
the clock, why not stock markets? ``The studies we've done suggest
over three-fourths of U.S. trading decisions are made after
hours,'' Atkin said. ``Isn't it laughable that 1 p.m. is `after
hours' in California?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The after-hours markets are plagued by the inefficiencies of any
thin, fragmented marketplace. The problems are mainly liquidity _
that is, maintaining a pool of investors interested in trading _
and pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Until there are enough buyers and sellers, prices are bound to
be volatile, most experts say. Investors like me will have trouble
getting the best price, or any price, on a trade. And the wisest
investors _ institutions, or professional day traders with
sophisticated software and access to all the many markets and their
prices _ will be able to outfox the less sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another symptom of the lack of liquidity,'' said Craig
Pirrong, a finance professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
``There's less competition because fewer people are competing in
the after-hours market, so the uninformed investor is more likely
to get picked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the activity of a handful of buyers and sellers exchanging a
handful of shares is having a big impact in the established,
daytime market. If a stock's price moves sharply after hours, a new
benchmark is set for the stock's opening the next morning. And some
Wall Street executives say the wrong tone can be set.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the difference between how a price closes here
and what it opens at, it's significant,'' Grasso said of
extended-hour trading.
</P>
<P>
   He described trading that took place after hours one day in
December in General Electric shares. ``We saw a $5 billion market
cap swing because of a few hundred shares,'' Grasso said. ``That's
not indicative of the true public market and it instills a false
sense of the value in the eye of the public, and that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say the new markets are just making after-hours
trading more democratic. Investors are getting access to pricing
that once was available only to the big guys _ institutional
traders who could buy up shares late at night or early in the
morning, reacting to news ahead of the average Joes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' said Edward J. Nicoll, chief
executive of Datek Online in Edison, N.J. Datek offers trading
before the market opens, from 8 to 9:30 a.m., and after it closes,
from 4 to 8 p.m., accounting for about 8 percent of the overall
volume on its Island ECN.
</P>
<P>
   Nicoll pointed to the trading last Dec. 7 in Digital Island, a
networking provider, as an example of small investors' getting an
edge long reserved for the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital Island was huge,'' Nicoll said in an interview the
next day. ``There was a Reuters story at 7:14 p.m. last night: Sun
and Inktomi said they would invest in Digital. The stock closed at
69, ran to 79 last night. This morning it was at 90 on Island
(ECN). It opened on Nasdaq at 101; now it's 121. Everyone who
bought in the after-hours market was smart; everyone who sold was
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the promise of after-hours trading? Not really, say
Michael J. Barclay and Terrence Hendershott, who teach finance at
the University of Rochester. The two studied after-hours trading
over six months last year, just before the doors were opened to
smaller investors, and they concluded that there was little reason
for guys like me to jump into the market.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, they said, share prices were more
volatile (they rose and fell more sharply on thinner volume) and
the cost of trading those shares was higher. The study found that
the differences between bid and asked prices were almost twice as
wide as spreads during the day, and, as a result, investors were
paying larger sums to buy or sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see substantial problems and few benefits in the
after-hours market,'' Barclay said.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders love the after-hours market. With their powerful
software and real-time access to stock price quotations, they can
jump in and out of stocks, especially highflying Internet issues,
cashing in quickly when a stock soars after hours.
</P>
<P>
   But day traders are the kind of people who go bungee-jumping.
They were pioneers in online trading. They founded firms like
Datek. And the best of them know how to navigate electronic
communications networks and how to go head to head with
professional market makers. Their experience may not be very
instructive for the rest of us _ aside from the lessons it teaches
about ill-conceived trades in the after-hours market.
</P>
<P>
   There have been countless stories about day traders who make it
big and day traders who lose their shirts. Kirk Kazazian is one of
those who has made it big. He is 24 and has been day trading for
three years, ever since he graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania. His take in 1999? A cool $5.3 million after
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Times have never been so good, he said. He works 9 a.m. to 5:30
p.m., trading before the opening bell and after the close, trying
to ride the winners after others have hung up their trading spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks get really hot, say when CNBC mentions them at
4:15,'' Kazazian said. ``I got in a stock the other day. The stock
was mentioned on CNBC at $12 and then it moved to $20 by the end of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage for day traders is speed, according to Kazazian.
They have multiple computer screens and multiple sources of prices
and news. He sits in a room with about 100 other day traders at
Tradescape.com Inc., one of the nation's largest day trading firms,
based in New York. (Last week, Tradescape announced plans to buy
MarketXT for $100 million in stock, a deal that will drive its day
traders' transactions to MarketXT's marketplace.)

   ``We're successful here because we have a high-speed connection
and we can get in and out before anyone else,'' Kazazian explained.
``We have direct connectivity to nine ECNs. People at home may see
something and be too slow. People at home are not as well
trained.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, buyer (or seller) beware, because to some degree
market makers and day traders can use their information edge to
arbitrage. They can execute fast trades with smaller investors on
one market when they see a stock that looks ready to zoom higher,
then sell the same stock at a higher price in a different market.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade and most of the other brokerage firms offering
after-hours trading make an effort to protect investors by
requiring them to use limit orders _ orders that set a price at
which the investor is willing to make a trade _ rather than letting
them simply buy and sell at the market price.
</P>
<P>
   But limit orders are not foolproof. Unsure where a stock is
trading after hours, an online investor may place a limit order at
a price that is far out of line with reality _ offering to sell too
cheaply, for instance, or to buy too dear. Bam! A day trader nails
the order, matching the investor's ill-considered price.
</P>
<P>
   On some of the after-hours trading systems, like MarketXT, the
investor can see the last sale during the day, the most recent sale
in the evening and a long list of bids and offers. Other brokerage
firms, like ETrade, have decided to display just one bid and one
asked price. That means that prices at which other investors may be
willing to trade cannot be seen. The policy makes it difficult for
the little investor to be smart.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Koppel, a lawyer in San Clemente, Calif., has tried
to be one of the smart guys. But what he told me about his
after-hours experience was largely unprintable. Koppel had the same
problem I did late last year: He couldn't get his trades executed.
He called ETrade's investor hot line and became even more confused.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his orders expired, even though they seemed to match
up perfectly with other investors' offers to buy or sell the same
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me after-hours was very difficult,'' Koppel said of
his calls to the ETrade customer service department. ``I've tried
on three or four occasions. I haven't been able to get an order
through. I'm not a real experienced investor, but I know
something.''
</P>
<P>
   One night last December, Koppel was trading shares in Tyco
International, the conglomerate whose stock had been hammered
because of questions about the company's accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   He checked the bid and asked prices _ the bid is the price at
which someone is willing to buy a stock, and the asked is the price
at which someone is willing to sell _ and put in an offer to sell
200 shares at a price better than the posted asked price.
</P>
<P>
   He said it wasn't displayed, even though ETrade says it always
displays the best price. He called the ETrade hot line _ and, he
said, was told that the best price was not always displayed in
after-hours trading. Finally, his price appeared. When it
disappeared, he figured his shares had been snapped up. No. After
trading ended, a message informed him his order had expired.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than a month ago. Koppel said he has not traded
after-hours since: ``I haven't even tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at ETrade acknowledge that there are some problems
with the firm's after-hours offering, but they say the system is
still in the early stages and is evolving. The company also says
customer education should improve results.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they say, new pricing information will be added to the
site, giving investors clearer information on prices in after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The company also says some investors may be frustrated because
limit orders, by their very nature, reduce the chances of getting
an order filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some issues and we're moving quickly to resolve
those,'' said Patrick DiChiro, a spokesman for ETrade, which is
based in Menlo Park, Calif. ``When we launched it, we made it very
clear this is a new market with less liquidity. We said, `Go slow
at first.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things could change drastically in the coming months.
After-hours volume has climbed substantially since last fall. And
the ETrade system worked much more efficiently for me last week,
when I had four of eight trades executed one night and spent just
25 minutes waiting on the customer service line.
</P>
<P>
   Once the major stock exchanges offer extended hours and several
of the electronic markets are linked _ a step Nasdaq began
instituting last week _ the after-hours marketplace should improve
further.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, trading at night is much more difficult than
trading during the day. You have to read _ and take to heart _ the
disclaimers: the warnings about liquidity, volatility and risk,
risk, risk. And you need to be patient, very patient.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not.

COLORADO PANEL DEFEATS MOVE TO CLOSE GUN-SHOW LOOPHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ore., N.J.)   (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A measure that would have required private firearms
dealers at gun shows to conduct the same kind of background checks
that licensed dealers perform was narrowly defeated Friday in the
Colorado Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a blow to Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who
supported the bill as part of a larger package of gun-control
measures, the 6-5 vote by the House Appropriations Committee was a
milestone, of sorts, for proponents of gun control because such a
bill has rarely progressed so far in any state.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am disappointed legislation requiring background
checks at gun shows failed today,'' Owens said, ``we were
successful in passing other important bills which will keep
firearms out of the hands of children and criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two states, Florida and Oregon, have had more success in
trying to close the gun-show loophole. In 1998, Florida voters
approved a constitutional amendment that gave counties the right to
close the loophole, and seven have exercised that option. In 1999
in Oregon, a bill similar to Colorado's passed the House but failed
by one vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Vice President Al Gore cast a tie-breaking vote in
the U.S. Senate to approve an amendment sponsored by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., that would have closed the loophole. But
companion legislation in the House offered by Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy, D-N.Y., failed when the juvenile-justice bill was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Colorado, where even mundane gun issues gain high
visibility because of the shootings last April 20 at Columbine High
School in Littleton, where two teenagers killed 12 of their fellow
students and a teacher before killing themselves, the House
Judiciary Committee passed the loophole bill 7-6 two weeks ago,
sending it on to the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But twice the chairman of the committee, Rep. Steve Tool, a
Republican, held it back from a vote, fearing that the measure
would fail. The delay spurred intense lobbying on both sides of the
issue, including efforts that focused on the district of Rep.
Debbie Allen, a Republican from the Denver suburb of Aurora, who
was regarded as the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the district received letters opposing the measure
from the National Rifle Association and door-to-door pleas from
members of a grass-roots group, Sane Alternatives to the Firearms
Epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Owens' chief lobbyist, Michael Beasley, said he and
the governor had tried to generate more support before the vote;
Beasley said he had talked to Allen five times in an effort to
persuade her to vote for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But even after an amendment was offered Friday that would have
required private dealers to conduct background checks with the
Colorado Bureau of Investigation, rather than with the FBI, as a
way to assure buyers that their names would not be kept in any
federal databases, Allen voted against the measure, assuring its
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just another strong step toward a police state, with
the government deciding whether you can purchase a firearm,'' said
Dudley Brown, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners.
``But the will of the people was represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure vowed to continue the fight with a
campaign to collect enough signatures to get a ballot initiative
before voters in November, which is the same step their
counterparts in Oregon are considering.
</P>
<P>
   In testifying before the Appropriations Committee Friday, the
sponsor of the loophole legislation, Rep. Ken Gordon, the House
minority leader, cited two independent polls showing that more than
90 percent of respondents favored closing the gun-show loophole.
</P>
<P>
   He was rebuked by a Republican member of the committee, Rep.
Gary L. McPherson, who called the polling data ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not irrelevant,'' Gordon responded. ``It should be a
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, a state transportation official who became a
lobbyist for the Sane Alternatives group after his son, Daniel, was
killed in the Columbine shootings, said the defeat Friday would not
deter the group's efforts in the Republican-controlled Legislature
or in pushing for a ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With more time, ``we will be able to address all the myths out
there, which we have had trouble doing here at the Capitol,''
Mauser said. ``For too long, the gun activists have controlled the
rhetoric. We're going to start dealing with the facts and educating
the public.''

THE BUSH AD CAMPAIGN: A MATTER OF PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Nine advertisements for Bush are available from The New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/politics) 
(js) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The campaign of Gov. George W. Bush unspooled a 30-second
television commercial on Tuesday that escalated Bush's attacks
against Sen. John McCain. The advertisement, titled ``Promised,''
takes McCain to task as failing to live up to his promise to run a
civil campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Maverick Media
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial opens with a picture of Bush and
McCain shaking hands at a Republican debate on Jan. 10. The
quick-cut pictures are mostly in black and white and stripped
across a picture of the Capitol dome. One image shows three men in
dark suits walking out of what appears to be a Washington office
building. The final two images are clippings of newspaper articles
critical of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   VOICE-OVER: ``John McCain promised a clean campaign, then
attacked Governor Bush with misleading ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain says he's the only candidate who can beat Gore on
campaign finance, but news investigations reveal McCain solicits
money from lobbyists with interests before his committee and
pressures agencies on behalf of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He attacks special interests, but The Wall Street Journal
reports `McCain's campaign is crawling with lobbyists.'
</P>
<P>
   ``His conservative hometown paper warns, `It's time the rest of
the nation learns about the McCain we know.'''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The Bush campaign was infuriated by recent McCain
advertisements that said that McCain was the only Republican
candidate with foreign policy experience and that Bush's tax-cut
plan devoured the entire budget surplus and favored the rich.
Adding insult was a McCain commercial that implicitly compared Bush
to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On campaign finance, McCain does solicit and accept hundreds of
thousands of dollars in donations from lobbyists and others with
interests before the Senate Commerce Committee, which he heads. In
December he did exert pressure on the Federal Communications
Commission to act quickly on a television license sought by a major
contributor, Paxson Communications. McCain has used the Paxson
corporate jet for political travel, but he denies exerting improper
influence on the company's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal used the phrase ``crawling with
lobbyists'' to describe a number of registered lobbyists who advise
or work for the McCain campaign. But every major presidential
candidate, including Bush, receives advice and substantial
contributions from lobbyists and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic, in an editorial last October, cited
accounts in other newspapers about McCain's temper, and it
suggested that a discussion of his temperament was proper in the
campaign. But the Bush commercial's selective quotation about the
``McCain we know'' omitted the editorial's final two sentences:
``There is much there to admire. After all, we have supported
McCain in his past runs for office.''

 &HT;    Lewis indicted in Atlanta slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fulton County grand jury indicted Baltimore Ravens
star Ray Lewis and two of his friends Friday on murder charges in
the stabbing deaths of two men the morning after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard, in announcing the charges against
Lewis, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting, said he will consider
seeking the death penalty against the three men.
</P>
<P>
   Each is indicted on two counts of murder, felony murder and
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 24, has been in jail in Atlanta since his arrest Jan. 31.
Oakley, 31, a barber from Baltimore, and Sweeting, 34, who is
believed to live in Miami, have not been arrested. Federal warrants
were issued for them Friday, said Celeste Armstead, a spokeswoman
with the FBI in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to a two-page indictment, the three men are charged
with killing Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker ``by cutting and
stabbing them with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's still not clear if all three stabbed the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The main witness so far, limousine driver Duane Fassett, has
said that Lewis did not stab anyone. Lewis' attorneys have said
they have interviewed at least six witnesses who agree.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Friday that Lewis did use a knife. But when pressed
to say whether Lewis stabbed either of the two men, the district
attorney said Lewis didn't have to wield a knife to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   News of the indictments was welcomed by relatives of Lollar and
Baker, here and in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference to announce the indictments, Baker's aunt,
Vondie Baker, thanked Howard and Atlanta police on behalf of the
victims' families. ``We all miss Jacinth and Richard,'' she said,
as a cousin sobbed and clutched Atlanta Police Chief Beverly
Harvard's hand.
</P>
<P>
   In Akron, Fay Lollar, Richard Lollar's aunt, said: ``I'm happy.
I'll be even happier if he (Lewis) doesn't get bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' attorney Ed Garland responded to the indictments with
scathing criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a deplorable event. This has been a completely
inadequate, careless and sloppy indictment,'' he said. ``They have
indicted before the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland likened Lewis to Richard Jewell, saying both had been
wrongly accused by overzealous authorities: ``You can almost hear
the railroad whistle as it's going down the track. Richard Jewell
was the last passenger and now it's Ray Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities in 1996 said Jewell was their chief suspect
in the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park downtown. The FBI later
cleared Jewell.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, 24, and Baker, 21, were killed before dawn Jan. 31 just
hours after they celebrated the Super Bowl in Buckhead. The friends
_ who moved here two years ago from Akron _ were partying with
others from their hometown when an argument erupted at Cobalt, a
club in the heart of the entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, the fight moved outside, where a bottle
of champagne was cracked over the head of one of Lewis' friends.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying accounts about what happened next, but the end
result was more punching and kicking and the fatal stabbing of
Lollar and Baker at the corner of East Paces Ferry Road and
Grandview Avenue, two blocks from Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, speaking publicly for the first time about the case,
said Friday that the investigators' work is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a continuing investigation and we appeal to (Oakley
and Sweeting) to turn themselves in,'' Harvard said.
</P>
<P>
   Police, FBI and agents of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency on
Friday searched for Oakley and Sweeting in Baltimore and Miami,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to several of his friends and other
people who knew him,'' said Brent Eaton, a DEA special agent in
Miami, referring to Sweeting. ``We are working with Miami-Dade
police.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gulatea, an FBI spokesman in Baltimore, said the search
for either man may prove difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a long time,'' he said, adding that Thursday's news
conference in Atlanta was the first time FBI agents in Baltimore
had heard Atlanta police mention the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Joshua B. Good in
Baltimore and Janet Frankston in Akron contributed to this article.

VOTERS SAY CHARACTER, NOT ISSUES, IS THEIR CONCERN IN RACE FOR
WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ When they are asked how they go about choosing
a president, voters usually frown, cock their heads and finally end
up saying in effect that they are looking not so much for a
candidate they agree with as one they admire.
</P>
<P>
   The yearning this year for an upstanding, brave and decent
resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington _ seeking the
qualities of an ideal neighbor rather than applying the usual
ideological tests _ seems in particular to be helping the
insurgency candidacy of Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that for all the blizzard of commercials and
headlines about tax cuts, health policy and abortion, the main
issues so far this year are not exactly issues at all, but rather
matters of character, leadership and moral stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stuck on the moral thing,'' said Patricia Gensamer,
pausing from her job serving customers at a golf range here in
central South Carolina. ``We've got too much thoughts about sex
going on, and not enough about being a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, Gensamer said, can help change that mood and
serve as a role model for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Delaware and
South Carolina repeatedly turned up that refrain: This time,
character trumps the issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Merrimack, N.H., a truck driver named Fred Wendt put it this
way: ``An issue is worthless,'' he said firmly, ``unless it's a man
you can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   All this has sharply bolstered the campaign of McCain, whose
courage resisting North Vietnamese torture has left him with this
year's hottest campaign biography, and often hagiography.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where McCain scored his stunning victory over
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, an exit poll found that for
Republican voters ``the most important issue in deciding whom to
support'' was ``moral values.'' Asked what the most important
quality was in a candidate, they said by a hefty margin that it was
standing up for what one believed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, character has always been batted around campaigns,
ever since the vicious 1796 and 1800 contests in which John Adams
was denounced as a scheming monarchist and philanderer, and Thomas
Jefferson as an atheist revolutionary whose election would mean, as
the Connecticut Courant warned, that ``murder, robbery, rape and
incest will all be openly taught and practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about trust, honesty and character seem unusually
important in this race, and voters cite several reasons for their
emphasis on it this time around.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, some voters cite disillusionment with President
Clinton, particularly in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but also
annoyance at what they perceive as a politician who veers too much
with the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go more for character,'' said Janice Oliver, 29 a factory
worker in Pittsfield, N.H.. ``With Clinton, I went for the issues.
But now I wish I'd paid more attention to Clinton's character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the way voters seem to be turning away from scandal and
seeking a president who seems personally upstanding, there perhaps
is a parallel with the 1976 election. Voters that year reacted to
Watergate and elected Jimmy Carter, the outsider who was more
famous for his smile than his experience but who pledged never to
lie to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for the emphasis on character is that the
issues at the moment are not as striking as they have been in past
years.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming, the United States is pre-eminent in the
world, abortion appears to have receded a bit as a concern on both
left and right. In the broadest sense, voters seem less agitated
than they have been in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly want someone who can make them feel good about
this country,'' said Walter Mondale, the former vice president and
the 1984 Democratic nominee for president. ``This year we don't
have a Soviet Union coming at us, the economy seems pretty good,
and if you ask what people are interested in, it's all over the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll found that 83 percent of those surveyed were
satisfied with the economy and 54 percent with education. But
ranked near the bottom was satisfaction with the nation's moral
values, with only 27 percent saying that they were very or somewhat
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little ideology playing into this,'' said Wayne
King, a former Democratic candidate for governor in New Hampshire.
``Issues are far less important in this election than they have
been in the past. What people want is integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Those issues debated this year are also relatively complex, so
that voters often seem frustrated and unsure who really will be
best for them on Social Security, medical care or tax policy. When
Angela Edge, another factory worker in Pittsfieldl, was asked about
issues that concerned her, her face lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hearing this ad about nuclear, ugh, nuclear,
nuclear, you know, nuclear things,'' Edge said enthusiastically.
``I guess nuclear warheads. It's got the sound of BB's dropping and
says that each could be a nuclear thing, and it could destroy a
city. It's pretty scary, and I'd like to know more about the
candidates' feeling on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge faltered, and added: ``Actually, I look for who has the
best character, who has my best interests at heart.''

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WASTE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64 to 34, a bill that would
require nuclear waste to be shipped to a disposal site in Nevada
from power plants around the country, once a burial site in Nevada
is licensed. Supporters say a plan to remove waste from temporary
storage sites is long overdue. Opponents, including President
Clinton, say the plan does not give the Environmental Protection
Agency sufficient oversight in monitoring the storage radiation
levels. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 269 to 158, a $182 billion
measure that seeks to reduce the so-called marriage tax. The bill
attempts to remedy an aspect of the tax code that leaves some
married couples paying more in taxes than two single filers
reporting the same income. The measure raises the standard
deduction for married couples and also increases the earned-income
tax credit for lower-income couples. Supporters said couples should
not be penalized just because they are married. Opponents said the
Republican-sponsored plan is too costly, provides too much tax
relief to higher-income couples and further risks the future of
Social Security and Medicare. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 192 to 233, a $89 billion
Democrat-backed measure that also seeks to reduce the marriage tax,
but prioritizes saving Social Security and Medicare ahead of the
tax cut. The bill increases the standard deduction for married
couples, but at a smaller rate than the Republican proposal. It
would also increase the earned-income tax credit for lower-income
couples. Supporters said the bill addresses the need to eliminate
the marriage tax without jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare.
Opponents said the bill does not go far enough to help married
couples. A ``yes'' vote favores the bill.

BRADLEY AND GORE FIND AMMUNITION IN ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ With former Sen. Bill Bradley questioning
Vice President Al Gore's veracity on abortion rights, Gore is
trying to shift attention away from his voting record on the
subject and toward the question of who would be a better
standard-bearer for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is using the abortion issue as a framework to
cast Bradley, his lone rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, as someone who cannot be counted on to fight _ either
for abortion rights or, by implication, other Democratic
principles.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time publicly, Gore, who has defeated Bradley in
the three states that have voted so far in the Democratic
nomination process and has a wide lead in the national polls,
called on Bradley to drop his quest and join him against ``the real
enemy'' _ the Republicans, who oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no indication that Bradley is considering dropping
out, certainly not before the March 7 primaries and caucuses in 16
states, including California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is continuing to hammer Gore over the abortion question
in vying for the votes of women, who make up more than a majority
of Democrats and who have tended to lean toward Gore so far.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Bradley criticized the vice president
recently on his votes when he was a congressman from Tennessee
against various gun-control measures. And Friday he accused Gore of
``parsing'' his words on abortion, suggesting that he focused more
on the technical accuracy of words rather their truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the somewhat distorted time warp of intense political
campaigns, Gore's most recent comments on abortion came as a
pre-emptive strike late Thursday night, having learned through the
grapevine that Bradley intended to criticize him on the issue
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking in Seattle on Friday, suggested that the vice
president had insulted women by not fully explaining the evolution
of his views on abortion. When Gore represented a rural Tennessee
district in the House of Representatives, he was considered a
strong opponent of abortion by both the National Right-to-Life
Committee and abortion-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect that he can change his position,'' Bradley said.
``But I think he shows a lack of respect for women by refraining to
explain the evolution of his views. Over the last month, the vice
president has tried to twist his record rather than explain his
convictions. His record is clear; his reasoning and evolution are
very muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley recalled Gore's 1984 statement that an abortion was
``the taking of what is arguably a human life.'' And his staff
issued a compendium of similar quotations and references to votes
that document Gore's opposition to federal financing of for
abortions for poor women.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Washington Monthly in 1986, Gore said:
``It is quite correct that a position like mine in opposition to
the federal funding of abortion results in unequal access to
abortions on the part of poor women. Nevertheless, I feel the
principle of the government not participating in the taking of what
is arguably human life is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also ridiculed the vice president's attempt earlier this
month to clarify his views when he was asked if he still believed
that abortion was the taking of a human life. Just before the Feb.
1 New Hampshire primary, Gore reminded reporters that in the 1980s
he had said that abortion was ``arguably'' the taking of a human
life, and went on to say that he would not use that phrasing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds familiar,'' Bradley said. ``The parsing of words is
not what women need.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he meant to imply that Gore was sounding like
President Clinton, Bradley smiled and said, ``You can fill that
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also argued that he would be a stronger general election
candidate than Gore, asserting that the vice president has been too
tarnished by campaign-finance abuses and other problems to win the
general election in November. And, just as Gore has argued, Bradley
asserted that a Republican victory could lead to a roll-back of
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   At a rousing fund-raiser Thursday night in Beverly Hills with
several hundred Democratic women, Gore left no doubt that he now
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that earlier in his career he had
``wrestled'' with the question of whether the government should pay
for abortions for poor women. ``Since then,'' he said, ``I have
come to believe that because poor women deserve the same
constitutional right to safe, legal abortions that more affluent
women have, they need Medicaid funding so they can make that
decision for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I do not need a lecture from Senator Bradley about
how to protect a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also suggested that Bradley had abandoned the Senate
because he could not stomach the fight against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the anti-choice Republicans took over the Congress,
Senator Bradley walked away,'' Gore said, suggesting a cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans took control of Congress in 1995. Bradley, after
serving 18 years in the Senate, did not seek re-election in 1996.

   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore on Friday received the
endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
and lesbian lobbying group. He visited the Stonewall Democratic
Club here Friday morning, accompanied by Gov. Gray Davis of
California, several California officeholders and Judy Shepard, the
mother of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student whose murder in
Wyoming last year drew nationwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard, who has devoted herself to fighting prejudice
against gays and lesbians, delivered an emotional speech. When she
began to cry, Gore, who was standing next to her, rubbed her back.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised that if he was elected president, ``I will reissue
the executive order banning discrimination in the federal work
force, and fight with all my heart to pass the employee
nondiscrimination act.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN FINDS A NEW ARENA TO PLAY IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the conference room of a downtown office
building here Friday morning, a small group gathered at the Bill
Bradley campaign headquarters to watch the launch of his new
national ad campaign featuring Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular basketball player of all time endorsing the
presidential bid of a former New York Knick. Jordan's endorsement
became headline news in large part because it was so out of
character.
</P>
<P>
   One of the enduring signatures of Jordan's career was a
persistent neutrality on political and social matters: everything
from race riots in Miami to sweatshops in Indonesia to a Senate
race in his native North Carolina. In 1990, at the height of his
popularity, Jordan had the opportunity to endorse Harvey Gantt, the
Charlotte mayor, in a senatorial race against Jesse Helms. Jordan
did not publicly endorse Gantt, a Democrat, saying that Republicans
buy sneakers, too.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's Super Bowl, Jordan explained that he had had
more time to ``study and understand issues'' and that he might be
more inclined to take sides now. Given Jordan's stature, there was
speculation if his endorsement of Bradley was a significant first
step. Was this a signal to fellow basketball players, the most
politically oblivious group of athletes, that it was OK to play a
more active part in cultural and political affairs, including the
electoral process?
</P>
<P>
   During the Super Bowl, Jordan showed up at a high-profile event
to promote his partnership with John Elway and Wayne Gretzky in the
Internet venture mvp.com.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Jordan had been introduced as a part owner of
the Washington Wizards. Of course there is his namesake cologne and
his pitches for MCI and for his own line of Nike apparel. Was
Bradley simply one more endorsement in Jordan's portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jordan's endorsement reflects that National Basketball
Association players, the stars of a vibrant, global league, are
beginning to see themselves in a new way: not just as entertainers
but also as advocates or intermediaries, entrepreneurs with a
window of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take it that way,'' said Steve Smith of the Portland
Trail Blazers. ``I don't know Michael's reasoning. He might really
like Bill Bradley's views, or like him as a president. I think it
was him endorsing another NBA family member.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Jordan-Bradley advertising blitz was taking place, a
group of athletes, television executives and NBA owners sat in a
ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton for an intriguing seminar, ``Bridging
the Digital Divide'' with the subtitle, ``How to bring rapidly
emerging technology to lower-income youth losing ground in the race
for technology.'' There were network and computer executives
absorbed with the rapidly evolving technology of bringing athletes
to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself seems almost peripheral to the technology. Magic
Johnson, who has successfully parlayed his renown into successful
business ventures in urban centers, said that young players were
not seeing themselves in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's passed them,'' Johnson said of the technology. ``They're
not listening; they don't understand the dynamics. They don't
understand how big the Internet is. Why do you think we always come
out broke, the majority of us? We're so caught up in material
things instead of understanding that we're a power in this world.
You have to have ownership of something _ and knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has opened movie theaters in several cities and is
launching his Urban Magic Web site. He said a number of young
members of the NBA lost sight of the business of basketball in a
way that Michael Jordan never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a short career _ we are rented property,'' Johnson
said. ``In that career you get money and power. How do you use what
you've got while you're in the game? Put that together with
knowledge and you can build something. Old guys understand that.
The system loves when we become individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said he thought the young players were getting it.
``When I first came in, guys wanted to buy things like barbershops
and restaurants. Now you've got guys talking about owning their own
Internet companies and hotels _ and owning their own teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan may have inadvertently sparked a curiosity among
athletes to move beyond prescribed boundaries to take more active
roles in their world. Perhaps the goal, from the White House to the
Internet, is how to get closer to that elusive wild blue yonder.

ALL-STARS 2000: YOUNGER, HIPPER AND PLUGGED IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shaquille O'Neal, a Web site guru, spoke at a
technological summit Friday, espousing the virtues of a new era in
the National Basketball Association. Not to be outdone, Kobe Bryant
rehearsed lyrics to his rap song with the model Tyra Banks while
Vince Carter walked down a runway in a resplendent suit.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Michael Jordan retired, the All-Star Game was
canceled and the NBA seemed in peril, the showcase of the league's
greatest stars has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Carter, Bryant and O'Neal, the Class of 2000 features
younger, more athletic players with as much flair as some of their
predecessors. They arrived in the Bay Area on Friday for the 49th
All-Star Game on Sunday at the New Arena in Oakland, trudging into
a San Francisco hotel ballroom before a sea of cameras and lights
as if they were starring in their rock documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just doing what we can to fill the void,'' an ebullient
Kevin Garnett said. ``This league has a lot of great stars. If we
can live up to the standards set by some of those guys, we'll be
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been trying for more than a year with mixed results.
Global interest has increased, and the league's foray into the
Internet world has exploded. But ratings for NBC and Turner Sports
have dropped off noticeably. Total attendance figures are not awful
compared with last season's but recapturing the public may take
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest issue for us is how to manage it all,''
Commissioner David Stern said. ``Between the Internet and
everything else we're doing, it's overwhelming sometimes. But we're
happy. In the long run, I'm convinced the ratings will recover.
People forget, after Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, everyone said we
were in trouble, that this guy named Michael Jordan couldn't
shoulder the burden. I'm convinced we're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA brought back the dunk contest after a year hiatus for
All-Star Saturday, which will also include the long-distance
shootout and the rookie game, which should be entertaining. It pits
the 1999 rookies against the 2000 rookies, essentially Jason
Williams vs. Steve Francis in a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is the favorite in the dunk contest, and his Toronto
teammate Tracy McGrady may not be far behind. Once labeled an
overhyped event that lacked originality, the dunk contest caters to
younger, hipper leapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was reading Grant Hill's comments, `I'm getting to
be the old man of the All-Star team,''' Stern said. ``It's amazing,
all of these young kids who are really great players getting to
understand their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the millennium All-Star is 28, eight are 25
and under, and not a single member of the original Dream Team in
1992 was voted as a starter by the fans. Only Karl Malone, John
Stockton and David Robinson made the cut this season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, said to be so peeved about the league promoting
youngsters instead of codgers like himself, was fined $10,000 for
skipping a news media session. He informed the NBA he would play in
Sunday's game, but has apparently decided not to partake in other
promotional activities.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson and Tim Duncan were among others who did not make
Friday's session, but they were excused because of flight
difficulties, a league spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy, who will coach the Eastern Conference All-Stars,
and Miami center Alonzo Mourning walked into the ballroom
arm-in-arm, laughing. It was their way of making light of a
first-round playoff altercation in 1998 in which Van Gundy clung to
Mourning's leg like a terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him I admired him for it,'' Mourning said.
``Because I think a lot of Pat Riley has rubbed off on him. Because
I see Pat doing the same thing. Jeff sticks up for his players.
Looking back on it, it's kind of comical and he knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy said: ``I wanted to apologize for a couple of years
ago and it's been the first time I ever had a chance to. He
actually started the conversation, because I felt awkward about
bringing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jason Kidd and Gary Payton held court a few yards
away at separate tables. The two preeminent point guards in the
game are serving as unofficial hosts this weekend, their Bay Area
roots having something to do with both players being presented keys
to the city Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The last All-Star Game in the Bay Area was in 1967, a game in
which the East's coach, Red Auerbach, was inexplicably ejected and
the local favorite, Rick Barry, walked away with the most valuable
player award. In those days, players worried only about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, though, nearly every player has his own Web site or some
direct connection to his own fan base. O'Neal has two and counting.
There are parties to attend, corporate interests to appease and, in
Payton's case, 70 family members who need tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, man,'' he said, surveying the room full of the
news media and his peers. ``All-Star Weekend is flat-out crazy.
When's the game anyway?''

TIGER WOODS SALVAGES HIS QUEST, TRAILS BY 6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ For most of yesterday's second round at the
Buick Invitational, Tiger Woods flirted with the wrong kind of
history at Torrey Pines Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the first player in 52 years to win six consecutive PGA
Tour events, found himself on pace to miss his first cut in 46
starts. He headed to the back nine on the South Course at even-par
through 27 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine holes and five birdies later, Woods had turned up enough
heat that one of the tournament co-leaders predicted he had ``no
chance'' of finishing ahead of Woods by the time the final putt
falls tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by a back-nine 31 that moved him to 5 under par for the
tournament, Woods trails Phil Mickelson, Kirk Triplett and Shigeki
Maruyama by six strokes with 36 holes remaining. Woods' emergence
at 22nd place on the leader board _ up 21 spots from Thursday _
prompted Maruyama to predict he has ``no chance'' of beating Woods
despite matching the low round of the tournament with yesterday's
64.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson (67) and Triplett, who also had a 64, were more upbeat
about their chances of keeping Woods in the rearview mirror. But
both conceded that Woods, after yesterday's 68, is casting a
considerable shadow after collecting four birdies in his final six
holes of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do some things that are pretty spectacular,'' Mickelson
said, reflecting on Woods' weekend rounds of 62-65 (17 under) to
win this event in 1999. ``A six-shot lead isn't something you're
comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his strong closing stretch, Woods is three strokes
closer to the lead through 36 holes than he was a year ago. But
he's still not satisfied with the shots he's hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting a little heated at myself. I couldn't find my
golf swing and definitely didn't make any putts ... until the back
nine,'' Woods said. ``Late in the round, I started flushing it and
hitting it solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Matters turned in Woods' direction with a 20-foot birdie putt at
No. 10. The next hole, Woods uncorked ``as good a flop shot as I
could possibly hit'' after his tee shot at the par-3 hole struck a
cart path and wound up 30 yards from the pin. After Woods followed
the flop shot by draining a 10-footer for par, playing partner
Billy Mayfair said: ``You could tell the momentum changed for him
and he was off to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods collected four birdies over his final six holes, with none
of the putts from longer than six feet. At No. 18, a 498-yard
par-5, Woods' 5-iron from 206 yards set up an eight-foot putt for a
closing eagle that burned the lip of the cup. Woods winced as the
putt slid past. But by that point, he was three strokes clear of
missing the cut to 71 players for the weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he feared missing the cut before rallying on the back
nine, Woods _ whose lone missed cut as a pro came at the 1997
Canadian Open _ smiled and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only missed one cut, and I bogeyed the last hole to do
that,'' Woods said. ``When you get in those positions when you're
on the borderline, you just have to be patient. As long as I am
\Roff the tee\S, the par-5s are more accessible. If I drive the
ball in the fairway, I should have a good chance of making birdies.
I was able to do that on the back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Woods avoided a dubious historical achievement and
continued his quest of a memorable one: Byron Nelson's record of 11
consecutive PGA Tour victories.

SOME SIGNS OF A CONFLICT IN THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month ended on an unsettling note for the Episcopal
Church's leadership, the result of an unexpected event halfway
around the world that continues to reverberate through the 2.4
million-member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, the heads of two Anglican provinces overseas held a
ceremony in Singapore where two conservative Episcopal priests were
consecrated as bishops to work among like-minded Americans who see
themselves as alienated from the church.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony took place outside the church's procedures, in
which bishops are elected within their own dioceses and confirmed
by the church's prelates. No one warned the Episcopal Church's top
official, Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold III, who found out about
it two days later.
</P>
<P>
   A question now is, what will be the status of the new bishops,
who are back in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, these are not bishops of the Episcopal Church,''
Griswold said in an interview after returning from a trip to
England this week, where he conferred with Archbishop George Carey
of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop is the spiritual head of the Church of England
and first among equals among the heads of the 38 independent
provinces of the global Anglican Communion. The Episcopal Church is
the communion's American member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really up to him to determine if these are bishops of the
Anglican Communion,'' Griswold said, adding that the archbishop has
authority to decide whether the consecrations conform to the laws
of the two provinces whose officials performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop has made no statement yet on this aspect of the
matter, the Church of England's news office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new bishops are the Rev. Charles Murphy III, a priest in
Pawley's Island, S.C., and the Rev. John Rodgers Jr., a retired
seminary president in Ambridge, Pa. They were consecrated by
Archbishop Emannuel Kolini of the Province of Rwanda and Archbishop
Moses Tay of the Province of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the bishops issued a statement saying they hoped to
help ``lead the Episcopal Church back to its biblical
foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony might best be seen within the context of larger
tensions among Anglicans worldwide. The church provinces in Africa
and Asia have been growing rapidly, shifting Anglicanism's center
of gravity away from the older churches of the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Although some authorities on the church view the tensions as
rooted in issues of power and authority, those tensions have been
focused on questions of sexuality, particularly the church's
relations to gay and lesbian members. Some bishops in Africa and
Asia, along with conservatives in the United States, have faulted
liberal Episcopal bishops for supporting the ordination of gays.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, First Promise, an organization that Murphy helped
found, said the consecrations were meant to respond ``to the
growing crisis of faith resulting from the failure of Episcopal
Church leaders and seminary professors to defend the truth of the
Bible'' and the church's ``core teachings.'' Murphy was out of town
and was not available for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The consecrations may complicate the Anglican world's next big
event, the triennial gathering of the primates, the heads of the
church provinces, in Porto, Portugal, next month. It will be the
first such meeting that Griswold will attend as presiding bishop.
</P>
<P>
   He said some primates had heard ``a very biased opinion'' about
the Episcopal Church, a picture he said was false, of ``a church in
chaos, severely divided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my tasks at the primates' meeting is to share a
different story about the Episcopal Church,'' Griswold said, ``and
to bolster as much as what I have to say with concrete
statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There is no substitute for actually sitting down
face to face. Some of the presumed antagonisms will dissolve rather
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEETING ON POVERTY PLANNED  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with a different focus, on ways to alleviate problems
of poverty in urban and rural America, is scheduled in Washington
next week, with speakers from an unusually broad ecumenical
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The event, starting on Monday at National City Church, will be
the fourth such meeting organized by Call to Renewal, an
association of churches and faith-based groups. The Rev. Jim
Wallis, who will convene the meeting, said that 500 people had
registered and that those attending include representatives of the
United States Catholic Conference, the National Association of
Evangelicals, the National Council of Churches and prominent
African-American churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much movement-building, networking, sharing skills
and resources,'' Wallis said.

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Steven Ballmer, the president of the Microsoft
Corp., returned again and again to a single question. ``What is the
soul of MSN?'' he asked, referring to Microsoft's consumer Internet
business by its three-letter logo.
</P>
<P>
   A pressing question indeed for the 70 Microsoft managers
summoned last June to Building No. 27 here for a searching review
of the business. They had come from ``Red West,'' a cluster of five
buildings more than a mile from the main corporate campus and home
to MSN Web sites like Expedia, Carpoint and MoneyCentral, and the
MSN online service.
</P>
<P>
   Even within Microsoft, it was derided _ dubbed ``Red Vest,'' a
place to hide from real work while waiting for one's lucrative
stock options to vest. Outside Microsoft, it was regarded as a
laboratory of failure, called ``Red Ink West,'' running up losses
of as much as $1.5 billion since 1995, much of it squandered on a
wayward effort to become a production studio for new media.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-hour review, product teams showed off new ideas
being worked on for the MSN Web site. One, a collaboration tool,
was demonstrated with a community Web page for running a children's
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   The page could be created and the team's schedule listed,
changed and sorted, all on a site within MSN that combined elements
of a word processor, a spreadsheet and calendar software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went up,'' Yusuf Mehdi, a marketing executive,
recalled. ``Heads nodded and we all kind of agreed: Now
(italics)this(end italics) is what Microsoft does well _ software
that allows people to be more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization soon became the touchstone of the company's new
strategy for MSN _ the latest of several over the last five years,
as Microsoft has struggled, uncharacteristically, to find its place
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, honed in recent months, boils down to this: We're
going back to our roots as a software company. MSN will be pitched
to consumers as the best technology tool kit for the Internet, one
that makes online shopping, searching, communicating and managing
personal finances on the Web easier and more productive.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``end-user productivity'' is the jargonized shorthand
that Ballmer, now Microsoft's chief executive, uses for the
company's mission statement.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that message will work in the consumer market remains to
be seen. The test begins Sunday night, when Microsoft starts a
yearlong, $150 million advertising campaign with sitcom-style
television spots showing four characters _ two men, two women _
using MSN as their favorite Internet problem solver.
</P>
<P>
   In the online business, Microsoft trails well behind the
industry leader, America Online. But its catch-up strategy is
plucked from the same playbook it used in the Internet browser
market against Netscape Communications, the early front-runner in
browsing software and now owned by AOL.
</P>
<P>
   As it did with its Internet Explorer browsing software,
Microsoft is setting out to improve its Web technology, market
aggressively, cut distribution deals with industry partners _ and,
ultimately, change the economics of the online business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key executives behind the browser campaign _ the ``A
team,'' as one manager put it _ are now in place at MSN. Another
sign that the MSN house is in order: At the start of this month,
Ballmer moved back to the main Microsoft campus from ``Red West.''
He had first moved into an office in Building D of Red West on
Thanksgiving weekend of 1998, when losses were mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has not entirely showed its hand yet. And its track
record on the Web is uninspiring, from mistaking the Internet for
television (hence its failed foray into entertainment programming
for the Web) to its costly drive to create a collection of city
arts and entertainment sites, Sidewalk, which was sold off to
Ticketmaster last year.
</P>
<P>
   But executives here are encouraged by signs of improvement in
the last few months _ rising traffic at MSN, favorable trade-press
reviews for recently improved features and, last December, the
second-highest monthly increase in five years in new subscribers to
the MSN Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   MSN now has two million subscribers; the goal for this year is
to grow more than America Online, which analysts predict will add
roughly four million new users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is starting to feel like the early days of Internet
Explorer,'' observed Mehdi, a former product and marketing manager
for the browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Microsoft, there are many people who will find the
comparison unnerving. Microsoft's business practices in the browser
market are the focus of the government's sweeping antitrust suit
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has not
made a final ruling, but in November he issued findings of fact
that sided almost entirely with the government's portrayal of
Microsoft as a monopolist that used its market power to bend other
companies to its will and stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   The business of Web sites and online services is not the browser
market, and there is no suggestion that any of MSN's moves raise
antitrust issues. It seems doubtful, moreover, that Microsoft will
have the kind of market power in the emerging Internet era of
computing _ in which a proliferation of computing devices can be
used to tap into the Web _ that the company's Windows operating
system has given it during the personal computer era.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that Microsoft's culture and its
business practices have not changed as a result of the antitrust
case. At the Redmond campus, Microsoft workers seem to regard the
case as just one more competitive challenge, a suit manufactured by
their corporate enemies and hardly an accurate portrayal of the
company for which they work. Microsoft is neither chastened nor
humbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't changed anything we do in dealing with other
companies,'' said Brad Chase, a senior vice president Ballmer
brought to MSN last year, soon after Chase testified in the
Microsoft trial. ``We are good business partners, and we are moral
partners.''

WATSON IS BRUINS' MAN IN MOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Other than suspended forward JaRon Rush, no
one on the UCLA roster has had a tougher season than maligned guard
EarlWatson.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains Watson's reaction to the recent _ and some
believe overdue _ change in offensive philosophy. After the Bruins'
victory over USC, Watson was downright giddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad we made the change,'' Watson said. ``Now it's like
it was the last two years for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is not a natural point guard. He has always been happiest
in the freewheeling motion offense, slashing to the basket,
crashing for offensive rebounds, creating chaos with his tenacity
and athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1-4 offense UCLA installed in October is anti-chaos. It
shackles Watson's creativity and demands precision that's simply
not in his blood. For 20 games, he shot 39.9 percent and had a
modest assist-to-turnover ratio of 1.54-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been totally different for me, mainly because
the offense is new,'' Watson said two weeks ago. ``I'm not really
comfortable in it. For two years, I freelanced. This year, there's
more structure.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed this past week when UCLA coach Steve Lavin and
assistant Jim Saia revamped the offense. The coaches abandoned the
structured sets, returned to the motion game and inserted reserve
point guard Ryan Bailey in the lineup to reduce Watson's
ballhandling responsibilities
</P>
<P>
   His seat belt removed, Watson scored 22 points against USC, with
seven assists and no turnovers _ his first zero-turnover game of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion lets Earl do what he does best,'' Saia said. ``He
played (USC) like he played the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rush update: In conjunction with Rush's legal counsel, UCLA
is expected to submit its appeal of his 29-game suspension to the
NCAA. A response could come within a day or two, but immediacy is
not an issue because no one expects Rush to play this season. The
Bruins are hoping for a reduction of the 17-game portion of the
suspension he must serve next season.
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: Shooting guard Ray Young is 4 of 23 from the
field in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Billy Knight is 1 of 9 from 3-point range in the
last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Center Dan Gadzuric is averaging 6.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in
his last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpshooting forward Jason Kapono is 11 of 19 from the foul
line (57.8 percent) in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing statistic involves UCLA's free-throw
attempts, or lack thereof. Because of a passive offense, the Bruins
shot four free throws against Arizona, six against Oregon and 12
against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Their miserable accuracy (56 percent in league games)
compoundsthe problem.

 REDMOND, Wash.: moral partners.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The antitrust case has raised few qualms at Ford Motor, Best Buy
and Tandy, all of which have forged e-commerce and distribution
deals with Microsoft. In November, for example, Microsoft agreed to
a deal with the Tandy Corp. in which Microsoft invested $100
million in RadioShack.com, Tandy's new online store.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Tandy will create a Microsoft area in each of its
7,000 Radio Shack stores, offering MSN Internet Access, Web TV,
Windows CE-based hand-held devices, phones using MSN mobile
software and Microsoft home networking software.
</P>
<P>
   The deal offers Microsoft a formidable bulkhead in the consumer
market: There is a Radio Shack store within a five-minute drive of
94 percent of American households, and the chain is a huge seller
of consumer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and America Online competed head-to-head for the Radio
Shack deal. Len Roberts, the chairman of Tandy, says he chose
Microsoft mainly because of its software strategy for tying
together all the different Internet devices in the home. ``We
needed someone who could provide the technology glue _ the
operating system for home integration _ and that's something
Microsoft can do best,'' Roberts explained. ``There's no question
that AOL is a stronger Internet brand than MSN. But this deal is
with Microsoft, and we're tying into its strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Microsoft's consumer group has become a vital
leg in the company's wider Internet strategy in a way that was not
apparent earlier. Industry analysts have argued that Microsoft
should get out of the consumer business and focus instead on
providing software for the Internet's infrastructure _ the
operating systems, like Windows 2000, which is being introduced
Thursday, that run big server computers serving up Web pages and
e-commerce applications to desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the view at Microsoft. Richard Belluzzo, who was
recruited last September to become the group vice president of the
consumer unit, recalled his early talks with Bill Gates, the
chairman, Ballmer, Chase and other executives. They spoke, he said,
of the evolution of software into Web-based services that people
access by using cell phones, television set-top boxes and handheld
devices as well as PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Web services, Belluzzo observed, a relationship
with the consumer will be crucial _ to control the distribution of
your underlying technology, if nothing else. (That, of course, is
why Microsoft fought so hard in the browser wars. The Netscape
browser could be the layer on top of Windows that would
``commoditize'' the underlying operating system, as Gates warned in
a 1995 internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal Wave.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be branded Web services that become the new face
to the consumer, not the Windows desktop and how its icons are
arranged on the screen,'' said Belluzzo, who came to Microsoft from
Silicon Graphics, where he was chief executive, after running the
consumer PC and printer business for years at Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Chase added, ``If you're not in the consumer business, you're
not in the Web business, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside MSN, the company's biggest branded Web service, is an
effort that was recently dubbed ``Next Generation Windows
Services.'' It amounts to developing technology standards for the
Internet in the same way Windows is a PC technology standard.
</P>
<P>
   One such service, Passport, is software that enables consumers
to enter billing and shipping information once and not have to do
it again while shopping on any e-commerce site that supports
Passport. (One hundred companies, from Dell Computer to Buy.com,
have signed up.)
</P>
<P>
   Such Microsoft services are intended to save time for consumers
and money for e-commerce sites, which do not have to write their
own software. They are accessible without using any Microsoft
software, but the broadest range of functions and smoothest
integration are expected to come from using Microsoft products,
from MSN to Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Microsoft is doing is taking the essence of its Windows
strategy to the Web,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard business school.
</P>
<P>
   It is Microsoft's umbrella software plans for the Internet _ far
more than the new marketing push or new features on MSN _ that
cause anxiety at America Online. After its planned merger with Time
Warner, AOL will suddenly be much more a media company _ the
opposite course from Microsoft's. Even so, AOL executives say
Microsoft is the company they most fear.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen the pattern before, as Microsoft moves
relentlessly up the computing ladder, stepping from one technology
platform to the next. Microsoft started with the PC operating
system, then added software development tools, then software
applications like word processing and spreadsheets, then Internet
browsing software. The next step up is Internet services, and AOL
stands atop that business.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's lead appears to be huge. Its 20 million online subscribers
are 10 times more than MSN's Internet Access service. AOL is the
most-trafficked Internet portal site, while Microsoft ranks third;
Yahoo is second. Yet at different times, Lotus 1-2-3 had a
commanding lead in spreadsheets, as did WordPerfect in word
processing and Netscape in browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has done it again and again,'' observed Barry
Schuler, who runs most of the online services at AOL. ``Microsoft
sits back, waits for rivals to make mistakes; it improves its
product and then it leverages its platform advantage into new
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL executives are intent on avoiding the same fate. ``AOL won't
be mentioned someday in the same breath with Lotus 1-2-3,
WordPerfect and others,'' Schuler added.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives say that making inroads against AOL will be
a long uphill climb. ``There is no silver bullet,'' Chase conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they point to market research that suggests AOL has
vulnerabilities. The data shows that more than 3 percent of AOL
subscribers quit the service each month, an annual churn rate of
more than eight million subscribers. About 15 percent of AOL
subscribers get a busy signal during the most popular evening hours
while the failure rate for MSN is 6 percent.

<P>
   A survey commissioned by Microsoft concluded that half of AOL
subscribers might switch if they saw there was a ``credible
contender.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The churn rate is still very high in this industry,'' Belluzzo
said. ``Nothing is really settled yet.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL replies that the rate at which subscribers leave its service
is at ``historical lows'' and, based on its research, customer
satisfaction has never been higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the markets where Microsoft has come from way behind to win,
it has improved its technology, but it has also changed the
economics of the business. In office productivity software, it
bundled spreadsheets, word processing and database software and
sold them as a suite, charging little more than rivals charged for
a single application program. In the browser market, it folded its
browsing software into Windows and gave it away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Microsoft began offering a $400 rebate to PC buyers
who agreed to take the MSN Internet Access service for three years.
AOL responded within a month, but only with a rebate on its
CompuServe service, not the main AOL service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft is offering the rebate solely on the purchase
of a PC through certain manufacturers or retailers like Radio Shack
and Office Depot. The more aggressive approach would be to offer
the rebates directly to consumers, not just PC buyers _ a bold and
expensive bid to grab market share, if Microsoft did it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is apparently considering that option. ``We want to
change the rules, and we will,'' Chase said. ``But just how we plan
to do that is part of the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft's new consumer Web strategy will succeed is
unclear. And it has plenty of rivals besides AOL, including Web
sites that compete with one of the ``personal productivity''
services under the MSN umbrella _ from travel to personal finance
to shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's consumer business is expected to grow nearly 40
percent this year, to more than $3 billion in revenue _ and to lose
roughly $300 million, estimates David Readerman, an analyst at
Thomas Weisel Partners. That loss, however, would be well below an
estimated $500 million in 1998. ``That's Ballmer's influence,''
Readerman said.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, that $300 million loss would be regarded as an
investment in the future. But perhaps the surest sign of faith in
the new consumer strategy is the people it has attracted to the
business, both newcomers and executives drawn from elsewhere in the
company. Two veterans of the browser wars, Mehdi and Chase, are
examples.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi, 32, joined Microsoft in 1992, and given his yearly option
grants is probably worth tens of millions of dollars. Chase, 39,
has been at the company since 1987 and is likely worth more than
$100 million. Neither will comment on those estimates, but Chase
acknowledged, ``We don't have to work if we don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of their peers, they could have left to run Internet
start-ups; Mehdi says he gets about one such offer a week. But he
says he is staying in Redmond, where he now is director of MSN
marketing, because he believes in the strategy, and in Microsoft.
Chase echoes those sentiments, adding that he relishes the
come-from-behind challenge. ``We're underdogs, but we're starting
to bark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Microsoft's class of 1999, the 700 employees who
joined the company from computer science programs and business
schools last year, are also convinced that Redmond is still the
place to make a difference in computing _ and a personal fortune in
the bargain. Most of them declined jobs at Internet start-ups or at
one of Microsoft's big rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Olson, a graduate of the Sloan School of Management at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, passed up offers from
both start-ups and from Sun Microsystems. He speaks of the
``amazingly high quotient of really smart people'' at Microsoft and
the ``exciting challenge'' of trying to help MSN rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Other newcomers compare a talk with Gates or Ballmer to an
encounter with a ``Zen master.'' They see a big company with
extraordinary entrepreneurial energy, run from the bottom up, where
every project is a venture, where if you ship the ``right bag of
bits'' it can have a ``huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be here to get it,'' said Ori Amiga, 22, a
computer science graduate of Macalester College who is working on
an Internet software project.
</P>
<P>
   Others may doubt, or fear, but at Microsoft they still believe.

STOCK PRICES GO MORE THAN 11 PERCENT BELOW THEIR PEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES figures in the 3rd, 6th, 7th and 9th grafs)

 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average falling more than 200 points as technology
stocks _ which had been setting records _ joined in a decline that
had been affecting most other industries for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which was down 218.42 points, or 2.1 percent, to
10,425.21, has now fallen 11.1 percent since it set a record of
11,722.98 on Jan. 14. That is the fastest 10 percent correction
from a peak for the market's most widely followed indicator since
1955. The index was down 4.9 percent for the week, its worst weekly
performance since last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology
stocks that until Friday had been rising rapidly, also fell 2
percent Friday, or 90.18 points, to 4,395.45. Microsoft fell
$6.0625, to $99.9375, on worries that its Windows 2000 operating
system, which is to begin shipping next week, will not sell well.
The Nasdaq composite had set a new high on Thursday, and ended the
week with a 3.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which has more technology
stocks than the Dow but fewer than the Nasdaq, was down 2.6 percent
for the week after dropping 2.1 percent Friday, or 29.71 points, to
1,387.12.
</P>
<P>
   The price decline Friday followed a government report that
retail sales in January were up only 0.3 percent from December's
torrid pace, and were down if automobile sales are excluded. That
could be evidence that the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the
economy through higher interest rates are beginning to have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's drop came after the Gartner Group, a research
organization, warned that corporations should delay buying Windows
2000 because some existing software is incompatible with it and
after Michael Dell, the chairman of Dell Computer Corp., said he
had seen limited interest in the product from Dell's corporate
customers. Dell, which reported a small gain in profits after the
market closed Thursday, was down $1.921875, to $36.875.
</P>
<P>
   While technology stocks have been very strong until Friday, many
economically sensitive stocks have been weak, and that continued
Friday. An index of such stocks, the Morgan Stanley cyclical index,
fell 2.7 percent Friday and is now down 20.3 percent since early
January. Big losers included Caterpillar, off $2.0625, to $36., and
CSX, a major railroad, down $1.375, to $21.625.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm,
said that Friday's falls were not caused by heavy selling pressure,
but that ``there was a lack of buying interest'' in most stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market advanced, with interest rates falling as some
investors sought out the relative safety of Treasury securities.
The yield on 30-year Treasuries fell to 6.26 percent from 6.43
percent on Thursday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose
24/32, to 99 26/32.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the decline in many technology stocks, the
market for initial public offerings remained very hot. WebMethods,
a writer of software for Internet applications, soared to $212.625,
more than six times its initial offering price of $35.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 19 trading sessions for the Dow to fall from a peak
to a 10 percent decline, the traditional definition of a market
correction. That is the second-fastest fall from a peak ever,
Birinyi said. In 1955, it took just 12 trading days for a
correction that was set off when President Dwight D. Eisenhower
suffered a heart attack. He recovered, and so did the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Wien, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted
that long-term interest rates have declined since Jan. 14, even
while the Dow was suffering its correction. Falling rates are
normally good for stocks, he noted, saying that the decline was
evidence that stock prices had been very high before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, which spent most of the 1990s rising steadily,
went from 1991 to 1997 without a 10 percent correction in the Dow.
But since then the market has become much more volatile, and the
Dow took just 29 trading sessions to fall from a peak to a 10
percent decline in 1998, and just 36 trading days to do it again
last year. In 1998, there were fears brought on by the collapse of
the Russian economy, and last year there were concerns over rising
interest rates. In each case, the market recovered.

THE BRADLEY AD CAMPAIGN: SLAM DUNK FOR A JUMP SHOOTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Twelve advertisements for Bradley are available from The New

   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, a member of the National Basketball
Association Hall of Fame, on Friday began running advertisements
that feature a testimonial from the basketball superstar Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: The Crystal Team
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Jordan is seen in tight close-up, speaking
directly into the camera. The setting appears to be the den of an
upscale house. The Bradley campaign says the commercial was shot
two months ago but will not reveal where. When Jordan finishes
speaking, a picture of Bradley and Bradley's wife, Ernestine
Schlant, appears beneath the words, ``It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXT: ``I know the kind of America I want for my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a place where every family has good health and no family
suffers from the tragedy of gun violence. It's a place where every
child has a bright future, and where skin color or eye shape
doesn't matter anymore. It's a place where you can be proud to be
an American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to believe in something that will give every
American an opportunity to succeed, and be viewed equally. That's
why I'm supporting Bill Bradley for president. Shouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The commercial is designed to appeal to minorities
and young voters and will run in four crucial March 7 primary
states: California, Missouri, New York and Ohio. The Bradley camp
clearly hopes that some of the star power of His Airness rubs off
on the stolid Bradley.

NYC AMBULANCE WORKERS OBJECT TO ORDER BANNING BEARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Fire Department has ordered all city ambulance
workers to shave their beards, mustaches and mutton chops.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said safety, not cosmetic, concerns prompted the
new policy, which is intended to meet federal workplace safety
regulations. The regulations say facial hair interferes with a
tight seal for respirator masks used by ambulance personnel to
guard against communicable diseases like tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of Local 2507, the union that represents the 2,600
paramedics and emergency medical technicians who work for the city,
objected to the policy, saying it would inconvenience hundreds of
their members and discriminate against many others who wear facial
hair for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my members say they have had beards for 20 years,''
said the union's president, Patrick J. Bahnken, who is clean
shaven. ``They say, `My physical appearance means a lot to me
personally,' and they feel this is an intrusion, that an employer
would want to dictate their physical appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahnken said he suspected that the department's interest in
grooming was in retaliation for a recent labor dispute in which
fire officials accused some paramedics of diverting patients from a
hospital that has hired a nonunion ambulance company.
</P>
<P>
   A Fire Department spokesman, Michael Regan, said the department
had been discussing the change with the union for several months to
put the ambulance workers in compliance with U.S. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration regulations. Firefighters have had
to adhere to an identical grooming standard for several years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This OSHA requirement is about their safety and their family's
safety,'' Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Erenthal, an emergency medical technician, said that as
an Orthodox Jew he believes he is required to wear a beard. ``This
is an infringement on my religious rights,'' he said, adding that
he would fight the order.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they would review cases like Erenthal's
individually. They said the city had considered allowing some men
who wear beards for religious reasons to wear respirators specially
designed for people with facial hair. But Regan said those
respirators may not meet federal safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Muata Greene, a city EMT for 15 years, said shaving would
be a hardship. When he last shaved, 20 years ago, he said, his skin
became irritated. ``I am very attached to it,'' he said of his
beard. ``It has become part of me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said their lawyers were reviewing the new policy
to see if there were grounds for a lawsuit. But Bahnken said, ``If
this is to bring us into compliance with federal guidelines, then
our hands are tied.''
</P>
<P>
   The grooming issue and its religious implications have arisen
before in connection with police officers. The 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last year blocked police officials in Newark,
N.J., from dismissing two Muslim officers who had challenged an
order barring beards. But that case did not involve any safety
concerns related to medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials representing the New York City ambulance workers
said they believed the Fire Department was interpreting the OSHA
regulations too strictly.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garvey, a regional industrial hygienist for OSHA, said
the regulations require that tight-fitting respirators, like those
used by New York City, pass a test to show they fit correctly. The
regulations say ``the test shall not be conducted if there is any
hair growth between the skin and the face piece sealing surface
such as stubble beard growth, beard, mustache or sideburns which
cross the respirator sealing surface.''

DEUTCH HELPED OFFICIAL MONITORING THE INVESTIGATION OF HIM TO FIND
A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES ``high paying'' to ``management'' in lede; ADDS ``had'' to

(Exclusive)  
(rk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Deutch, a former director of central
intelligence, recommended a top CIA official for a management job
at Citibank even as she was monitoring an internal investigation
into evidence that Deutch had mishandled classified information,
according to agency records and interviews with officials.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch resigned as director in December 1996 and was almost
immediately elected to the board of Citibank. That same month, CIA
computer security officials uncovered evidence that he had placed
large amounts of classified information on nonsecure computers at
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Slatkin, the former executive director of the CIA, notified
the agency that she was considering a position at Citibank while
she was still monitoring the Deutch case inside the agency, records
of the agency show. A classified review by the agency's inspector
general of the handling of that case found that actions by Slatkin
``had the effect of delaying a prompt and thorough investigation of
this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin resigned from the agency in September 1997 and joined
Citibank as a vice president in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 1997, she had officially notified the agency that
she was withdrawing from consideration of any matters involving
Citibank because she was thinking about taking a job with the bank,
according to agency records.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in July 1997, she reviewed a secret report from CIA security
officials on their findings in the Deutch investigation, according
to the classified report from the agency's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA declined to comment Friday on any aspect of the
investigation. A special panel reviewing the handling of the Deutch
matter by agency officials has just completed its report, but its
findings have not been publicly released.
</P>
<P>
   A Citibank spokesman, speaking for Slatkin, stressed that the
CIA's internal investigation into the Deutch case was over weeks
before her conversations began with Citibank. Although security
officials were still writing up their report on the matter at the
time, she was not involved in its drafting, the spokesman said.
Slatkin added in a statement that she had excused herself from
taking part in the Deutch investigation, and that her only role was
to keep information flowing in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Citibank spokesman said Slatkin was referred to Citibank by
Deutch as she was considering where to move after leaving the
agency. Deutch encouraged her to go to Citibank after Slatkin told
him she was considering a different job at Chase Manhattan Bank,
the Citibank spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nora was seriously considering a job at Chase,'' the Citibank
spokesman said. ``When Deutch heard about that, he introduced her
to Citibank. She went through the normal interview process, and
everyone was quite impressed, and ultimately she was hired.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Slatkin's hiring at Citibank was a
quid pro quo for actions she took in the Deutch investigation while
at the agency. A Citibank spokesman described Slatkin as a
``star,'' adding that Citibank officials felt fortunate that she
had accepted their job offer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her move to Citibank further underscores the close ties that
existed between Deutch and the senior agency officials who played
crucial roles in the agency's long-stalled inquiry in Deutch's
case. Critics of how the matter was handled have contended that top
officials of the agency were too close to have conducted an
aggressive investigation. The inspector general's report also cited
the current director, George Tenet, who was Deutch's deputy before
succeeding him, for failing to do more to ``forcefully ensure''
that the case was properly investigated. Tenet would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin, who is still at Citibank and has risen to program
manager for Citigroup business services, served as the agency's
third-highest ranking official during Deutch's tenure as director,
and had previously worked with Deutch at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation of Deutch began in December 1996,
just as he was leaving the CIA. After computer security officials
at the agency discovered classified material on unclassified,
CIA-issued computers in Deutch's home, they investigated to
determine whether Deutch had violated agency regulations and
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of their discovery, some CIA security officers came
to believe that senior officials at the agency, seeking to protect
Deutch, were blocking efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Neill, who was then general counsel of the agency,
quickly told the FBI's general counsel, Howard Shapiro, that
classified material had been found on Deutch's computers. But CIA
officials did not formally notify the Justice Department that
Deutch might have broken the law for more than a year after the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Deutch case was effectively dead until a CIA employee
notified the inspector general's office in early 1998 that the
inquiry had not been handled properly. The employee was angry that
another senior official of the agency had been punished for what
the employee believed were far less serious violations, while no
action had been taken in the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's inspector general opened his own investigation in
early 1998 and the Justice Department was then notified about the
Deutch matter, according to the report. Last April, Attorney
General Janet Reno decided not to prosecute Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay of more than a year in notifying the department
had the effect of allowing a one-year time limit on appointing an
independent counsel to investigate the Deutch case to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin acknowledges that her close ties to Deutch posed a
serious problem for her in trying to deal with the agency's
internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Deutch moved to the CIA, he named her executive
director, where he gave her broad authority to supervise a wide
range of operations at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin says she talked to Tenet almost immediately after the
investigation began about her role. ``I thought I should recuse
myself, and I discussed it with George, and we agreed I would have
no role in the investigation other than facilitating the flow of
information,'' Slatkin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin's lawyer in Washington, Mark Tuohey, also stresses that
his client was not running the internal investigation at the
agency, but instead left that to its professional staff. The
inspector general's report quotes Slatkin as saying she explained
to Tenet that she believed the matter was too sensitive for her to
handle, and that Tenet ``had the responsibility for making the
decisions relating to the Deutch incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she played a major role in the case, other CIA officials
later told the inspector general. In fact, the inspector general's
report quotes Slatkin as saying that Tenet ``gave her the
responsibility for coordinating'' the case.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 270. PLEASE
NOTE: THERE IS NO ATTENDANCE CHART WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 -- The
following chart shows how senators and representatives voted on key
bills and amendments within the last week. A ``Y'' means the member
voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted against the
measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a ``P'' means
the member voted ``present.''

<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WASTE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 64 to 34, a bill that would
require nuclear waste to be shipped to a disposal site in Nevada
from power plants around the country, once a burial site in Nevada
is licensed. Supporters say a plan to remove waste from temporary
storage sites is long overdue. Opponents, including President
Clinton, say the plan does not give the Environmental Protection
Agency sufficient oversight in monitoring the storage radiation
levels. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 269 to 158, a $182 billion
measure that seeks to reduce the so-called marriage tax. The bill
attempts to remedy an aspect of the tax code that leaves some
married couples paying more in taxes than two single filers
reporting the same income. The measure raises the standard
deduction for married couples and also increases the earned-income
tax credit for lower-income couples. Supporters said couples should
not be penalized just because they are married. Opponents said the
Republican-sponsored plan is too costly, provides too much tax
relief to higher-income couples and further risks the future of
Social Security and Medicare. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: TAXCUT2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 192 to 233, a $89 billion
Democrat-backed measure that also seeks to reduce the marriage tax,
but prioritizes saving Social Security and Medicare ahead of the
tax cut. The bill increases the standard deduction for married
couples, but at a smaller rate than the Republican proposal. It
would also increase the earned-income tax credit for lower-income
couples. Supporters said the bill addresses the need to eliminate
the marriage tax without jeopardizing Social Security and Medicare.
Opponents said the bill does not go far enough to help married
couples. A ``yes'' vote favores the bill.

 WASHINGTON: the case. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By January 1997, security officials had determined that the most
critical evidence in the case was on four portable computer cards
that contained files from Deutch's computers. But when they looked
for them, they were informed that O'Neill had obtained the cards
and was keeping them in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill then began to rebuff requests to turn the four cards
over to the security staff, according to the inspector general's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Calder, the CIA's deputy director for administration,
who oversees the security staff, stepped in, and talked with
O'Neill about the cards. Calder said he wanted O'Neill to turn the
cards over to the security staff, but O'Neill wanted to keep them,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   A security official then complained to Slatkin that O'Neill
``was dragging his feet,'' and that his refusal to turn the cards
over to the security office ``made it look like a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Slatkin reached an agreement with Calder in which
one security officer would be allowed to review all of the computer
files gathered from Deutch's home. The four portable computer cards
were finally turned over after Tenet directed O'Neill to do so, but
only after they had been held by O'Neill for about three weeks, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   In the inspector general's report, Calder is quoted as saying
that discussions on the Deutch investigation with Slatkin ``were
always difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Tenet, the new CIA director, began to establish his
own management team, Slatkin started looking for a new job. But
after notifying the CIA that she was in talks with Citibank on June
27, she remained in place as CIA executive director until July 21,
and continued to monitor the Deutch case.
</P>
<P>
   The security office's report on the Deutch case, dated July 8,
was sent to Calder, who then sent it to Slatkin. Calder later told
the inspector general that he recalled receiving the report back
from Slatkin with ``marginal comments, possibly asking if (the
computer memory cards) had been destroyed,'' the inspector
general's report states.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin recalled receiving a draft of the report from Calder,
making comments requesting clarification, and then returning it to
either Calder or Jay Castillo, the security official who had been
allowed to review the four cards. According to the inspector
general's report, the copy of the report with Slatkin's marginal
notations could not be found. The four cards were never destroyed
by the CIA.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Just after headlines here pronounced an easing of
this week's heightened violence in southern Lebanon, an attack by
Shiite Muslim guerrillas killed another Israeli soldier Friday and
Israeli warplanes responded swiftly with airstrikes at suspected
guerrilla targets.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla attack disrupted a five-country meeting in Naqura,
Lebanon, that had been convened in an effort to calm tensions after
the worst week of fighting in southern Lebanon since last June. The
meeting of a committee that monitors the conflict ended before it
officially began when Israel's representatives were ordered by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister and Defense Minister Barak today instructed
Israeli representatives to stop the deliberations and return for
consultations,'' a statement from Barak's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said that guerrillas of the Iranian-backed
Party of God, or Hezbollah, violated the four-year-old rules of the
conflict Friday by firing rocket and mortar shells from inside a
civilian village, Nabatiye.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas fired on an Israeli outpost near a Crusades-era
castle just across the Lebanese border from Metullah, Israel. In
less than three weeks, they have killed seven Israeli soldiers,
including the one killed Friday, and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
   Seven soldiers from the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army have
also been killed by guerrillas since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours of the guerrilla attack Friday, Israeli jets
struck southern Lebanon, apparently sweeping the Nabatiye valley in
a search for the guerrillas who had fired.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors of the conflict fear that the violence could continue
to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very optimistic that the future will be very rosy
here,'' Timor Goeskl, a spokesman for the U.N. Interim Forces in
Lebanon, said in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Israelis would respond further by
bombing civilian targets, as they did earlier this week when they
struck power stations throughout Lebanon in reaction to Hezbollah
killings of their soldiers. The bombing wounded about 20 Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will respond at the time and place and in the way that we
choose,'' Barak said in an interview on Israeli television Friday
night. ``And as was proven this week, our response is not just
limited to south Lebanon. And our responses are very painful to the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israel bombed civilian targets in Lebanon only
after the guerrillas lobbed rockets over the border into Israel.
But this week, changing the terms of the 18-year-old conflict, the
Israeli army for the first time shelled civilian targets in
retaliation for attacks on its soldiers in the war zone. Since
Israel occupied the zone, a nine-mile-deep swath of southern
Lebanon, to protect its northern border from attack, guerrillas
have been seeking to oust its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army chief of staff,
said on Thursday that Israel would no longer tolerate attacks on
its forces and would respond harshly. If Hezbollah fires from
civilian villages, the Israelis will target guerrillas in those
villages, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Mofaz said
the army was working on ``a method for hitting those who fire at us
from civilian buildings, to deter the local populations from giving
them cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't plan to hit innocent civilians,'' he said, ``and
we'll act only when the conditions are right for a surgical strike
at the shooters. But we won't allow Hezbollah to exploit that fact
that we cannot hit the civilian populations.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials defended Israel and blamed
Hezbollah for using violence to disrupt the meeting in Naqura. The
Americans ``interpret this action as a deliberate attempt by
Hezbollah to wreck the prospects for peace in the meeting,'' said
James P. Rubin, spokesman for the State Department. ``Hezbollah's
action is particularly egregious in the context of Israel's
repeated commitment to withdraw from southern Lebanon by the middle
of this year.'' Barak has pledged to pull out of southern Lebanon
by July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is entering its very final stages,'' Barak said
Friday night. ``What I'm telling you is that I'm determined to end
the tragedy that is Lebanon, which has gone on for 18 long years.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had hoped to withdraw troops in the context of a peace
agreement with Syria. But the hopes for renewing peace talks with
Syria, suspended last month, may have grown dimmer in the face of
this week's violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rubin said the violence did not help the peace
effort. ``It was difficult enough in a calm environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also said that the United States had asked Syria to
``exercise its influence'' over Hezbollah to get them to restrain
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's monitoring committee meeting, gathering delegates from
the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, was to have
addressed violations of the rules of engagement in the conflict.
The rules, set in 1996 after an Israeli bombardment killed some 200
Lebanese, hold that civilians should not be involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Even before news of the soldier's killing reached the delegates
in Naqura, the meeting was endangered. Lebanese officials said that
U.S. and French monitors had spent four hours trying unsuccessfully
to get the Israelis to sit down with the Lebanese and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been the first official meeting between Israel and
Syria since peace talks broke off last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief lull between casualties, the Israelis had been
debating whether the fighting had calmed because Syria acted to
restrain the Hezbollah forces. Contrary to the Israelis'
expectations, the guerrillas did not respond to the bombing by
firing rockets at northern Israeli villages. Then there were two
days without any soldiers being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Polls published Friday showed that three-quarters of Israelis
surveyed supported the bombings, and that more than half thought
they should have been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians here have said that if Israel renounced the
four-year-old rules of engagement and if Hezbollah knew that the
Israelis would respond severely to every attack, the war would be
over. Some said that Hezbollah takes advantage of Israeli
hand-wringing over the futility of its presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Television interviewers grilled Barak Friday night about whether
the bombardment was sufficient reaction. They also asked Barak, a
former general and life-long military man, if he could put himself
in the shoes of the soldiers serving in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a soldier long enough to understand,'' he said,
``and I know what all the soldiers want _ to be home in peace.''

   THE REPUBLICANS: McCAIN'S OTHER RACE
</P>
<P>
   So you are in South Carolina, you are a former Navy pilot who
wants to be president, and you want to be where the guys are to do
a little politicking. What do you do? Test drive a high-powered
race car, of course, at the Nascar races in Darlington. Sen. John
McCain is planning a test drive on Saturday between town hall
meetings. The NASCAR tour happens to be one of the most popular
sporting events for a certain type of southern male voter. In
addition, McCain's aides say it is the perfect outlet for their
hyperkinetic candidate. Those who have dared to get into a car with
McCain say the high-speed test drive probably won't be much
different from his usual driving style. And at least there will not
be the risk of being pulled over. That is what happened on Thursday
when a member of the South Carolina highway patrol stopped two of
McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' buses. Officer Michael O'Donnell
said he just wanted to meet the senator. Unfortunately, he got the
two backup buses full of reporters, cameramen and photographers.

in the anti-video poker efforts in South Carolina,'' Witherspoon
wrote to the Bush campaign on Tuesday. ``I feel strongly that the
Republican national ticket should not include a nominee who
supports expansion of legalized gambling'' like Pataki. Pataki has
supported an expansion on casino gambling in New York.

   THE DEMOCRATS: OUTNUMBERED

   When former Sen. Bill Bradley speaks at the California
Democratic state convention in San Jose Saturday morning, his aides
say he will be in hostile territory. The hall can hold several
thousand people, but almost all of them are expected to be
supporters of Vice President Al Gore because almost all of the
state party organization has endorsed him, from Gov. Gray Davis on
down. Gore will also address the convention, just after Bradley.
Bradley's campaign has been offered 100 tickets for supporters, but
his aides argue that will hardly make things fair. They are trying
to persuade the state party to allow several hundred more Bradley
supporters to march from a pre-convention rally and listen to
Bradley inside the convention hall.

EDITORIAL: NORTHERN IRELAND'S REVERSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army's refusal Friday to spell out a clear
plan for turning in its vast store of hidden weapons led Britain to
take the regrettable but necessary step of suspending Northern
Ireland's 10-week-old power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   The launch of that promising experiment in local self-government
last December was one of the most significant achievements produced
by the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement. For more than two months,
representatives of the province's main Protestant and Catholic
parties, including the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, worked
side-by-side on a regular and constructive basis.
</P>
<P>
   Though British rule has temporarily resumed, the Good Friday
agreement and its hope for a fair and lasting peace remain alive.
Many of the policing and other reforms it produced will remain in
place, and the joint government can quickly be revived if the IRA
now moves to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Ireland and the political parties representing most of
Northern Ireland's Catholics and Protestants have worked tirelessly
to induce the IRA to end the disarmament impasse. What they managed
to get by last night was a statement committing the IRA to a
process of ``putting its arms beyond use'' to achieve the
disarmament provisions of the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That is a welcome advance, but would not have been enough for
David Trimble, who leads Ulster's main Protestant party, to win
endorsement from his party's ruling council Saturday for remaining
in the government. If Trimble and his party had withdrawn, local
rule would have been more seriously and lastingly damaged than it
is likely to be if the current government suspension proves brief.
If the peace effort is to succeed, London and Dublin also need the
continued involvement of Sinn Fein and its leader, Gerry Adams. The
longer the government remains suspended, the more difficult Adams'
position is likely to become.
</P>
<P>
   All of Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups must disarm. Of
these, the IRA is the most important, and has been the most
intransigent. Everyone, the IRA included, now acknowledges that the
arms issue must be resolved. The way to do that is for the IRA to
present a firm timetable for destroying its explosives, hand
grenades, assault rifles and pistols. The time to do so has come.

SHOCKING SETBACK FOR VALENZUELA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Santa Anita race track officials suspended jockey
Patrick Valenzuela through September for ``engaging in the use of a
dangerous drug amphetamine'' and on Friday recommended that he not
be relicensed for one year.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Board of Stewards' ruling came one week after
Valenzuela missed work because, by his own admission, he had been
out partying the night before. The stewards held a hearing
Wednesday after Valenzuela tested positive for amphetamines last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 37, was taking the news hard when reached at home
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of shocked,'' he said. ``It just all sank in today.
I'm disappointed in myself, but I feel that I should just accept
what they gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the term of the suspension, Valenzuela will not be
allowed in restricted areas of the track, which means that he
cannot exercise or train horses. The stewards asked that Valenzuela
not be relicensed by the state until he can prove that he has
experienced one year of ``uninterrupted sobriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Valenzuela did not contest the results of the drug
test, he did ask the board for mercy. Appearing on Valenzuela's
behalf were Eclipse Award-winning trainer Bob Baffert and Don
Murray, executive director of the Winner's Foundation, a drug and
alcohol treatment center. On Friday, Baffert criticized the board
and its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just basically took his livelihood away from him,''
Baffert said. ``They didn't need to do what they did. They
shouldn't have banned him from the premises. They basically jerked
the rug out from under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert suggested that owners and trainers would make better
character judges than the stewards.

FINISH FOR WOODS: WATCH THE BIRDIES
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Through nine holes Tiger Woods was in danger of
missing the cut on Friday. After 18, he was back in contention.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a surge of five birdies over the final nine holes,
Woods was at five under par, six strokes off the lead after today's
second round of the Buick Invitational. Shigeki Maruyama of Japan,
Phil Mickelson and Kirk Triplett were tied for first place at 11
under par (133), while Sandy Lyle (10 under), Bradley Hughes (nine
under), Davis Love III (eight under) and Shaun Micheel (eight
under) hovered close to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   None of the leaders felt comfortable, because Woods ended his
four-under-par round of 68 with momentum. Struggling to make putts
on the front nine, Woods made his first birdie of the day at No.
10, sinking a 25-foot putt that became a turning point. Woods
followed with birdies at No. 13, No. 15, No. 16 and No. 18, and
just like that, he was within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   So the weekend stage at Torrey Pines was set, with Woods still
having a legitimate chance to win his seventh consecutive P.G.A.
Tour start. At this tournament last year, Woods was nine strokes
behind after 36 holes, yet he roared back to win. Last Monday at
Pebble Beach, Woods was seven strokes down with seven holes to play
and then overtook Matt Gogel to win No. 6 in his streak.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 holes remaining, why would a six-stroke deficit look
imposing to Woods? It didn't even look imposing to his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that Tiger shot 17 under par on the weekend here
last year, a six-shot lead isn't something to be comfortable
with,'' said Mickelson, who shot a 67 on the south course, where
Woods also played. ``Given the fact he was seven back with seven to
go last week, he can obviously turn it on at any time. He can do
some things that are pretty spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really give myself a good chance Sunday, I need to shoot
low Saturday. I can't do that if I'm worried about what he's doing.
It's kind of a given he's going to go low, because he usually does.
I need to counter. I need to expect it to happen and be able to
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama and Triplett had the best rounds of the day, each
shooting 64 on the north course to propel themselves into a share
of the lead. But neither Maruyama nor Triplett has won on tour, and
with Woods in the rear view mirror, Triplett was prepared for a
difficult ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many guys who can come from seven or eight
strokes back, and Tiger is one of those guys,'' Triplett said.
``I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be thinking about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' ability to keep himself in contention for two days has
been more impressive than his play. Yet, while most other players
shoot 75 or worse when they struggle, Woods has enough length and a
good enough short game to shoot in the 60s. After a 71 Thursday,
Woods' troubles continued on today's front side. Through nine
holes, Woods was one over par for the day and even par for the
tournament. Today's 36-hole cut was two under par, so at that
point, Woods was in serious trouble of missing his first cut since
the 1997 Bell Canadian Open, the only 36-hole cut he has missed
since turning professional in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After missing a six-foot birdie attempt on No. 9, Woods angrily
slammed his putter into his bag and looked hot enough to raise the
water temperature in the nearby Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frustrated, you saw me,'' said Woods, who made his
46th consecutive cut Friday, the longest current streak on tour.
``On No. 6, No. 7, No. 8 and No. 9, I hit four good putts and
nothing went in. If a few of those fall, I could have turned it
around early.''
</P>
<P>
   But once his birdie putt dropped at No. 10, Woods looked like
Woods. He made a beautiful par save at No. 11, hitting a delicate
flop shot from behind the green that settled 10 feet from the hole,
then made the putt. On the par-4 No. 15, Woods almost made an
eagle, when his approach shot landed about eight inches from the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-3 No. 16, Woods hit his tee shot 10 feet from the
cup, then made the birdie putt. And at the par-5, 498-yard
finishing hole, Woods had a chance to eagle again, when he reached
the green in two shots and left himself with a 10-footer. But his
attempt for eagle slid past the cup, so he settled for another
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods knew he had let some opportunities slip away, he
felt good about his chances. Saturday's weather forecast called for
rain, but Woods said he would be ready regardless of the
conditions. Tied for 22nd place, Woods faced a difficult challenge.
But he has also rallied from far tougher situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, I've got to go out and play a good round
tomorrow,'' said Woods, who set a south course record last year
with a third-round 62. ``The weather forecast looks ugly for
tomorrow. If that's the case, it will be tough to shoot a good
round. But if it's ugly, and you play a great round of golf, you'll
pass a lot of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being six back, I still have a lot of work ahead of me to give
myself a run at this tournament. I'd rather be 10 or 12 under, but
that's why we have four rounds. Hopefully, I'll turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BILLY MAYFAIR (three over par) missed the cut and had a
difficult time playing with TIGER WOODS. On No. 10, Mayfair's chip
shot hit a cameraman, who had positioned himself too close to
Mayfair's line, in the foot. Mayfair double-bogeyed the hole. ``He
never said he was sorry,'' Mayfair said of the cameraman. ``Playing
with Tiger, it can get kind of circuslike out there.'' &QL;

WRESTLING FREE IN MINNESOTA 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party that Ross Perot founded eight years ago under
the banner ``United We Stand, America'' lost its highest elected
official Friday when Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota bolted what he
called ``this dysfunctional national party.'' The reasons for
Ventura's bailout may not be easy to decipher at this stage, but
the former wrestler's departure, like his entry into the strange
Perot family a few years ago, certainly offered this campaign
season another theatrical moment. Standing in the chill of a St.
Paul afternoon, his breath fogging over the microphones, Ventura
literally fumed about his newly shed party's swing toward Patrick
Buchanan as its nominee. Buchanan departed the Republican Party
last year to angle for the Reform Party presidential nomination and
its $13 million in federal election funds.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who seldom bothers to mince or even moderate his words,
made it clear that he considered the CNN commentator turned
candidate a ``right-winger'' who is out of line with his own state
of Minnesota and a generally bad choice as the party's national
standard bearer. ``Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an
unrealistic isolationist,'' he said. Ventura's preferred candidate,
Donald Trump, will apparently reveal his latest presidential hopes
sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, the Reform Party has been torn between
Ventura's allies and the disciples of Perot, who won a startling 19
percent of the national vote as the party's nominee in 1992 but
earned only 8 percent four years later. The Perot leftovers and the
Ventura newcomers have fought about everything from the site of
their nominating convention to who controls the party's records.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura says he has no plans to add his name to the presidential
candidate list and wants to focus instead on reviving the old
Independence Party in Minnesota. Independence certainly makes sense
for Ventura, who has been called a political party of one. As for
the Reform Party, it now settles back under the spell of Perot,
whose influence looks far less weighty with each presidential
election.

SPOTLIGHT ENDS FUGITIVE'S RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANA BALAZS, DENNIS WAGNER 
 AND ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nation's most wanted Vietnam War-era fugitives
surrendered to authorities Thursday after nearly 30 years of living
under a false identity.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Lawrence Mechanic, 51, who lived in Phoenix and
Scottsdale under the name Gary Tredway, turned himself in to
federal marshals and was arrested at his attorney's office in
downtown Phoenix after a day of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic was being held in a federal detention center in
Florence. A hearing is set for 11 a.m. Saturday before U.S.
Magistrate Lawrence Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway's lies unraveled over the past four days after he thrust
himself into the public eye as a political watchdog and a
Scottsdale City Council candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When he gave up at 4:15 p.m., Mechanic was ``resigned,'' said
attorney Thomas Hoidal, who said he intends to explore every avenue
to avert prison for Mechanic. That may include a petitions for a
reduced sentence, parole or a new trial and seeking a presidential
pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Hoidal said Mechanic was given the maximum sentence on his 1970
conviction for obstructing or impeding police and firefighters
during a fire in an ROTC building at Washington University in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very harsh sentence,'' Hoidal said, adding that
other students convicted at the time were not so severely punished.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, retired English Professor Carter Revard, 68, who
put up his house as collateral for Mechanic's $10,000 appeal bail
in 1972, said he was stunned to learn Mechanic had been living in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very disappointing and painful thing to see that he
had run,'' Revard said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Mechanic used a slingshot to hurl a ``cherry bomb''
firecracker at police and firefighters trying to control a blaze at
the Air Force ROTC building on campus after an anti-war
demonstration. The protest came a day after Ohio National Guardsmen
shot and killed four students during a demonstration at Kent State
Unversity in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   According to contemporary accounts in the Washington University
student newspaper,`` Student Life,'' the St. Louis protest started
over a campuswide debate whether the ROTC program should offer
credit classes.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members voted against allowing the military program, but
school officials overruled them. Incensed over the perceived
betrayal and over the Kent State incident, students made their way
to the ROTC headquarters, described as a hut.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, more than 800 students joined the
demonstration, and a large number started heaving stones at the
building. Shortly after midnight, a fire broke out, and the
building burned.
</P>
<P>
   Ten to 20 people, including Mechanic, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Mechanic's federal trial testified &UR; that he lobbed a
cherry bomb in the direction of a police line, where it landed
about 6 feet from an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic denied throwing the powerful firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses told a jury that they feared for their safety,
according to court records. One person was hurt at the scene of the
fire, but no one was hurt by the cherry bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic, who graduated from Washington in spring 1970, was
convicted that October of violating provisions of the federal Civil
Obedience Act of 1968, the first person in the country to be
convicted under the federal anti-riot law, according to newspaper
accounts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to five years in prison. At his sentencing, 75
young supporters sat in the courtroom to show support. He appealed
the conviction to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis,
but lost on Jan. 13, 1972. A warrant was issued May 26, 1972, after
he didn't appear at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tredway, who owns a Scottsdale apartment hotel, has lived in
Scottsdale for at least 13 years and has been active in some City
Hall causes. He was running for City Council in the March 14
election but dropped out Monday after questions were raised about
his resume. He first said he was dropping out because he had been
diagnosed with leukemia, then admitted that he made that up, too.
</P>
<P>
   His unmasking and arrest remained the talk of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all floored,'' said Tom Silverman, who along with
council candidate Ned O'Hearn were endorsed by two slow-growth
citizens groups that also endorsed Tredway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't expect people to be such liars. Obviously, it's a
shock. What can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Council candidate Barbara Espinosa said she had a ``gut
feeling'' about Tredway that she couldn't shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that Gary was the only candidate I
wouldn't want my name associated with,'' she said. ``It was not
anything in particular. I don't know what it was. It was really
sort of a funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes as a surprise to me more than anything is that he
would come out and tell it. It's so hard for me to even believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's hearing, Mechanic will likely face a detention
hearing in Phoenix before being taken to St. Louis to face charges.
U.S. marshals will have five days to seek a detention hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hoidal, the attorney, said he expects to ask that Mechanic be
incarcerated in Arizona until a decision is made on his permanent
placement within the U.S. prison system. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no doubt that this hasbeen the most scrutinized development
proposal in state history, a new community on the doorstep of Grand
Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Tom De Paolo, the developer behind the proposed Canyon
Forest Village. His group has spent nine years, $18 million and has
generated enough paperwork to fill a small library.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Coconino County Board of Supervisors will
decide whether to give its nod to the project, which would build
1,220 hotel rooms, 270,000 square feet of commercial space and up
to 2,500 housing units just outside the park gates of the Canyon's
South Rim.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major environmental groups, save the Sierra Club,
have endorsed the development. Conceding growth in the area as
inevitable, they say the village plan offers the best hope of
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo and Hopi tribes also have signed off on the project,
and the Havasupai Tribe said it wouldn't oppose it. Canyon Forest
Village has promised to hire Native Americans in a cultural center
it plans to build.
</P>
<P>
   The objection, instead, has come from the business community _
in nearby Flagstaff, Williams and Tusayan, all of which stand to
lose major tourist dollars. They are joined by the Sierra Club,
which questions whether the area's sparse groundwater is being
adequately protected and the need of a new town so near the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of public hearings, the four supervisors are mum
on how they will vote.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth, Supervisor Paul Babbitt, has recused himself from the
decision. Babbitt is the brother of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, who was a consultant for Canyon Forest Village before his
appointment to the Cabinet post in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairwoman Liz Archuleta said she is torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengths are their environmental plans in conservation of
water and use of solar and all the important partnerships they have
forged,'' she said. ``The weaknesses are how they are going to make
the cost of housing affordable to employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta also wonders how they plan to make that much retail
space environmentally sensitive and whether the cultural center
would be too much like an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the vote will not definitively decide the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan passes, opponents have vowed to take it to
countywide referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff and Williams and the Grand Canyon Improvement
Association, which represents Tusayan merchants, filed a lawsuit
against the U.S. Forest Service last month. The suit claims that
the Forest Service drastically undervalued the 272 acres it
exchanged to Canyon Forest Village last summer and didn't follow
proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the large investment made in the project, De Paolo said
his partnership doesn't plan to go away. He refused to say what he
will do if the proposal fails. Three of the four supervisors need
to vote yes for the development plan to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved, De Paolo said he expects construction
to begin and the legal issues to be resolved in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   One nagging issue is water.
</P>
<P>
   When moisture falls on the plateau above the Grand Canyon, it
ends up thousands of feet below the surface because of a porous,
catacomblike structure beneath the ground. The groundwater in the
area also is linked to many springs beneath the Canyon rim,
including the Indian Garden area.
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo has proposed an elaborate plan to bring water to the
site by rail and pipeline from the community of Topock on the
Colorado River, more than 200 miles away. De Paolo said he can
transport the water to Canyon Forest Village for 6 cents a gallon
and that his overall cost for utilities, with the use of solar
energy, will be about the same as in neighboring Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village also plans to treat and recirculate
wastewater for use in toilets.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are fretting about a proposed covenant that the
village developers want to sign and file with Coconino County. That
covenant would allow, among other things, the pumping of an
unspecified amount of water over a six-month period if water
delivery should be interrupted by an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo flatly ruled out last week that the village would use
groundwater. Phoenix attorney Grady Gammage, who represents the
village, also said in public meetings that drought would not be a
factor to trigger the emergency declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Barb Dawson, a Phoenix attorney who represents Tusayan business
owners, also urged the Board of Supervisors to require Canyon
Forest Village to disclose more information about its ``financial
ability, commitment and stability'' and to require bonding for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no established track record of successful
developments. They have no expertise in the area of planned
community development,'' Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canyon Forest Village literature, the company's
most noteworthy investor is the Percassi Bros. Co. of Bergamo,
Italy, which ``constructs, operates and owns large-scale
residential and commercial projects.'' The literature also says
that Percassi Bros. has licenses with retailers and restaurants
like the Italian clothing company Benetton and Swatch, a watch
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo bristled when asked about financial details concerning
Canyon Forest Village II Corp., of which he is listed as vice
president in Arizona Corporation Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you ask the same of Jerry Colangelo?'' De Paolo asked. &QL;

KWAN IN THIRD AS THE FUTURE ARRIVES FOR U.S. FIGURE SKATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ She wore a white costume, which can engulf a skater
on an ice surface, but Sasha Cohen hardly disappeared Friday night.
After Michelle Kwan fell on her most reliable jump, the 15-year-old
Cohen performed a wonderfully lyrical and impossibly flexible
routine to take first place in the short program at the national
figure skating championships.
</P>
<P>
   Performing a mesmerizing spiral sequence, in which she leaned
backward and touched her head to her skate, then bent forward and
grabbed one ankle while lifting her other leg in the 12 o'clock
position as she glided across the ice, Cohen won first from five of
the nine judges.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hughes, the 14-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., also skated
an elegant routine, drawing out her jumps nicely and taking second
place. Kwan dropped to third after the short program, which counts
for one-third of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need for panic in the Kwan camp. Saturday's long
program will count for two-thirds of the scoring. If Kwan wins the
long program, she will win the overall competition, her fourth
national title. But Cohen and Hughes are positioned to take
advantage of Kwan's increasing vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan has not skated both a clean short and long program at the
same competition since the 1998 Winter Olympics. In 1998 Kwan lost
the gold medal to a younger challenger, Tara Lipinski, and now she
is trailing two other skaters not yet old enough to drive. The
future of American figure skating has arrived with a sudden
abruptness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see to my right a lot of potential and athleticism, great
technical ability,'' the 19-year-old Kwan said at a news
conference, sitting on the podium with Cohen and Hughes. ``I know I
have to keep on top of things. I can't maintain. I have to keep
going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cohen wins the national championship, or finishes in the
top three, she may not be eligible for next month's world
championships in Nice, France. Because she did not turn 15 before
July 1, she would have to first win a medal at the world junior
championships to qualify for the senior championships.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a four-minute-long program to skate, and if
Cohen has any weakness in her sophomore year in high school, it is
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tradition: The champion never rests easy on the
throne,'' said John Nicks, who coaches Cohen in Costa Mesa, Calif.
``There will be a challenge, but there is nothing like Michelle for
consistency in performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, though, it was Cohen who could not have been more
reliable or refined while performing the eight required elements of
the short program. She received marks ranging from 5.4 to 5.7 for
technical merit, and 5.4 to 5.9 for presentation.
</P>
<P>
   She is only 4 feet 9 inches and weighs 79 pounds, but she
possesses the maturity and gracefulness of a much older skater.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is extremely difficult to coach; she has a mind of her
own,'' Nicks said. ``She's really a challenge. I really earn my
money when I give her lessons. But she is a very special young
lady. She is elegance personified. She is naturally unable to get
into an ugly position. She looks fragile, but that is very
deceptive. She is a tough little girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Second at last year's junior national championships, and sixth
at the novice competition two years ago, Cohen suffered a heel
injury last fall that put her on crutches for a week. But she has
been the talk of the competition during recent practices with her
courtly performances, and Friday night she demonstrated what the
buzz was about.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, however, seemed to surprise her most of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited I skated a clean program,'' Cohen said.
``To be on top is great, but I really didn't expect to do this
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had the difficult task of skating just after Cohen
received a standing ovation. And while she did not have what her
coach, Robin Wagner, called the ``special touch,'' she still earned
two 5.9s in presentation and first place from three judges. And
Hughes is in an inviting position. She will skate the most
difficult long program on Saturday, and will attempt to become the
first American woman to land triple salchow-triple loop and triple
toe-triple loop combination jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with my performance,'' said Hughes, who finished
fourth last year at the nationals and seventh at the world
championships. ``It wasn't easy going out there after a standing
ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan fell on a triple toe loop, which she kept in her short
program instead of the more difficult triple flip because the
routine jump had become a kind of security blanket. She had not
missed the jump in four years. But Frank Carroll, her coach, had
warned her not to take the easy things for granted. And that is
what she did after superbly landing a double axel and a triple
toe-double lutz combination while skating a jazzy, edgy routine to
the Beatles' ``A Day in the Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short program, you can't lose concentration for a
single second,'' Carroll said. ``When you've done the difficult
things, you can't take the easy things for granted. Nine out of 10
times, after you've done the difficult things, you fall on
something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen comes by her athleticism on her mother's side. Galina
Cohen, a Ukrainian who emigrated to the United States in 1971, was
a ballet dancer. Sasha's grandfather once performed a gymnastics
routine for Stalin, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha Cohen skis, both on water and snow, and Nicks said he had
to learn to let her follow her own path, whether it is choosing her
music or ad-libbing her spiral maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never want the choreography to get in the way of her
natural feelings and movement,'' he said.

SMALL BOMB ON WALL STREET SHATTERS WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A small explosive packed inside a military ammunition
can shattered windows in two Wall Street towers early Friday, just
hours before workers began thronging to their jobs in the financial
district.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously injured, but the police shut down a
two-block stretch of Wall Street during the morning rush, leaving
sidewalks crowded with workers who were forced to hold meetings on
street corners or do business at tables in a nearby cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who briefed reporters at the site of the
blast at midday, said there was no evidence that the predawn blast
was the work of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, investigators said they had questioned two
people who had worked in the building and were seeking a third. The
first deputy police commissioner, Patrick E. Kelleher, later
released a sketch, based on the descriptions provided by witnesses,
of a man they were seeking for questioning in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing all leads, including potential disgruntled
employees or someone who may have had something against the
building,'' said Kelleher. He also displayed a butterscotch-colored
work jacket with a corduroy collar that he said was similar to the
one investigators believed the man was wearing.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred at 4:41 a.m. outside the 36-story Barclay's
Bank building at 75 Wall St., which is at the corner of Water
Street. About half a dozen people were nearby when the bomb
exploded in a recessed entryway outside the side door of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The blast shattered windows on the Water Street side of 75 Wall
St. and windows at 95 Wall St., which is across Water Street from
the Barclay's Bank building.
</P>
<P>
   It caused several buildings to remain closed as the workday
began. Most people who gathered outside seemed to take the delay
with good spirits, but worried that the delayed start of the
workday might force them to come in over the weekend or early on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inconvenienced,'' said Matthew Garth, 25, an associate
analyst for Thompson Financial. ``The world may not end but it does
make the job more difficult. You are late to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms joined with
the FBI and the police in the investigation. A law enforcement
official said a Postal Service worker and a window washer got a
good look at a man as he kneeled and placed something on the ground
between two pillars at the side entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that four other post office employees, who,
like their colleague, were on their way to work at the Peck Slip
Station, passed by the device, and that one of them saw what he
thought was a burning fuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them sees this thing on the ground with what looks like
a lit fuse, says `Bomb!' or something, and they run for it,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   They were about 30 feet from the bomb, just rounding a corner,
when it exploded, said Kelleher, who joined the mayor at the midday
briefing because Police Commissioner Howard Safir was on vacation.
One of the postal workers was treated for ringing in his ears and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were checking videotape from security cameras in
the area _ one of the most closely monitored areas in the city _ to
see if they picked up the bombing or the movements of a possible
suspect before or after the explosion. Detectives also ordered
MetroCard records from nearby subway stations so that they could
make possible links to any suspect who might have traveled by
train.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that authorities were offering an $11,000 reward
for information leading to the conviction of the bomber. The police
described the suspect as a 35-to-40-year-old light-skinned black or
Hispanic man, about 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall and weighing
200 to 225 pounds. Some witnesses said the man, who was also
described as wearing a black cap, was carrying a yellow toolbox.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the green metal ammunition can was packed
with black powder or smokeless powder and cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   They said the device was unlike those used in two similar
unsolved bombings, including one in 1997 at an office tower owned
by Merrill Lynch where Barclays Bank had offices.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, a crude bomb fashioned from a coffee can packed
with gunpowder exploded just before 6 a.m. outside the building at
222 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion came on the same day as an anti-terrorism drill
in Lower Manhattan, but at the time the police said it was
unrelated to the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The second unsolved bombing came a month later, outside the
Planet Hollywood nightclub on West 57th Street.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Saturday, Feb. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Russian immigrants spending their old age in Brooklyn
these last three years, the Parkshore adult day-care centers must
have seemed wonderful. Ambulance vans picked them up and brought
them home whether they needed transportation or not, and at the
centers, waiting for them, were free beauty parlors,
Russian-language television, borscht and herring, golden gift
watches and, for a time, bonuses of $50 just for signing up friends
to enjoy more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   For Lawrence Friedman, the Parkshore owner, it was wonderful
indeed. By 1999, blooming like a money vine, the Parkshore centers
were running three shifts a day, for which federal Medicaid
billings rose to $47 million annually, or more than $52,000 for
each of the 900 aged clients being served for a few hours each day.
With the permission of senior officials in the New York State
Health Department, Parkshore expanded until it accounted for
one-quarter of all state adult day-care billings, capitalizing on a
formula that allowed nursing homes to open day-care centers
offsite, and be reimbursed at 65 percent of the local daily
nursing-home rate.
</P>
<P>
   For old people struggling to remain independent, and for
families burdened by the ferocious responsibility of caring for
loved ones enfeebled by stroke damage, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,
day-care programs and home health care can make all the difference.
But day care at that cost level is supposed to include skilled
medical care and rehabilitation, not just food and diversion, and
there is substantial doubt that Parkshore is providing it.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer,
charged Friedman with defrauding Medicaid of $62 million, the
largest such case in the state's history. Lawyers for Friedman say
that high-quality health care was provided and that the State
Health Department approved every patient and service. But employees
told investigators that services deteriorated to little more than
social activities, as a report in The Times this week by Dan Barry
and Katherine Finkelstein suggests. Investigators will now need to
determine why state health department officials approved the
Parkshore expansion against the recommendation of lower-level
health department staff, and bring charges against senior officials
if warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The case in Brooklyn is part of a national pattern of exploiting
programs intended to care for the old. In 1998 the inspector
general of the federal Health and Human Services Department said
that 90 percent of the nation's community mental-health centers
were improperly billing for acute care while in fact merely
providing recreation for mostly healthy patients. The practice of
bilking Medicaid and Medicare programs has been sadly commonplace.
The Justice Department announced just last week that Beverly
Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing-home chain, had agreed to
pay $175 million and relinquish 10 of its homes for defrauding
Medicare, the biggest such settlement ever. This pattern of waste
and greed devours money badly needed for the care of older
Americans.

</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 12:
</P>
<P>
   In a prudent turnabout, the Food and Drug Administration has
decided to suspend a regulation that it issued last month that
would have allowed the manufacturers of dietary supplements to
assert that their products ease the symptoms of pregnancy. Faced
with sharp protests from public health experts, the agency has
decided to hold public meetings to review this dangerous new rule
as it applies to pregnancy-related claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the freewheeling supplement market, consumers get very little
protection from government regulators on the safety or
effectiveness of these products. When pregnancy is involved, this
lack of regulation can pose serious hazards, since a product that
may do no harm to the woman could potentially cause birth defects.
At present, there is very little research on the kinds of plant
compounds that might pose a risk for fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Supplements, such as herbal remedies and vitamins, do not have
to undergo rigorous FDA testing for safety or effectiveness as do
drugs. Under federal law, supplement makers are allowed to assert
that their products affect the ``structure or function'' of the
body. But they cannot make any claims that the products prevent,
treat or cure disease. Yet last month the FDA weakened that
principle in deciding that common symptoms associated with normal
life stages such as pregnancy and aging would not be considered
diseases. Thus manufacturers could say that their supplements can
treat morning sickness or leg swelling in pregnancy. The opening
allows them to target pregnant women with products whose safety for
fetuses is unknown. Some pregnant women may also be lured into
treating themselves for conditions that require prompt medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA should permanently bar all supplement manufacturers from
making claims related to pregnancy. Beyond that, it should do all
it can to discourage pregnant women from consuming untested
products. The potential risk of birth defects demands that the FDA
proceed with caution.

BOEING STRIKE IN THIRD DAY, DELAYS 747 DELIVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its striking engineering union
still weren't talking Friday as the strike achieved one of its
first public victories, delaying delivery of a 747 jet.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 17,000 engineers and technicians stayed away from their
jobs for a third day, according to company estimates. They struck
Wednesday over demands for greater compensation and guaranteed wage
increases. Officials on both sides of the fight said they had no
plans to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas Air Inc. reported one of the first public casualties of
the strike Friday, saying Boeing failed to deliver a 747-400
airplane, which lists for $177 million. The Denver-based cargo
company is now planning a delivery ceremony for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is because of the strike,'' confirmed Vicki Foster, a
spokeswoman for Atlas Air.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Boeing hasn't delivered an airplane since employees
walked out Wednesday, according to one Boeing official. But
officials are confident the Seattle-based manufacturer will meet
its delivery commitments for the year, said Peter Conte, a Boeing
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to maintain operations to the highest degree
possible,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace giant may not face penalties for delaying
deliveries. That's because Boeing is often protected from paying
penalties tied to delays from labor disputes under its contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the union charged that the world's largest commercial
airplane manufacturer is already paying a price for the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The company is missing many of the specialized engineers charged
with approving the final set-up of an airplane, according to Pat
Waters, chairman of the Society of Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace Council. It often takes as many as 50 of
these engineers to approve a single delivery, the union claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Since some of the engineers walked off their jobs, the company
may ask the Federal Aviation Administration to lend a hand, Waters
said. That could delay the entire process, according to union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Conte said he was unaware that Boeing had established a
relationship with the FAA to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the FAA did resume its authority to make one type
of final approval _ approval it had granted to three master Boeing
engineers. However, the agency said Wednesday's move wouldn't
affect production or deliveries. Federal regulators handled the
approvals until last year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, many of Boeing's customers, including Southwest Airlines
Inc., Continental Airlines Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Airborne
Freight Corp., aren't registering delivery complaints.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Southwest prepared for a possible strike by making
many repairs that required assistance from Boeing engineers before
the strike, according to Beth Harbin, a spokeswoman for the
Dallas-based carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still not anticipating any delays,'' Harbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest isn't scheduled to receive a Boeing plane until Feb.
28.
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute between Boeing and its second-largest union
wasn't yielding more talks at the bargaining table Friday, it
entered the political arena. Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley visited protestors and endorsed one of the largest
white-collar strikes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you are what really makes this company go,'' Bradley
told 500 cheering union members outside Boeing corporate
headqaurters. ``Keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers and technicians struck after negotiations broke down
over union demands for greater compensation, more guaranteed wages
increases, and other issues. Boeing has repeatedly defended the two
contract offers it made last year, although union members rejected
both proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The union says the average technician currently earns about
$45,000 and the average engineer earns about $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders expect to carry the strike's momentum into next
week. Members will get a headstart on Monday's picket lines by
rallying outside Boeing's Everett, Wash., plant on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be just as strong on Monday,'' said Charles
Bofferding, executive director of the union.

   NEW YORK _ A month after Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani announced a long-awaited plan to redevelop Governors
Island with parks, a conference center and museums, a senior White
House official has called the proposal ``only a conceptual
framework'' and urged the city and state to provide more details.
</P>
<P>
   But the comments, by Jacob J. Lew, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, ultimately concern the price that the city
and state will have to pay for the island, a question that remains
a sticking point with both the mayor and the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 7 letter to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Lew said the
island could be transferred to the city and state before the end of
the year at ``a nominal cost.''
</P>
<P>
   And although he did not specify the amount, the letter made no
reference to a 1995 pledge by President Clinton to help transfer
the island as surplus federal property for $1.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said the island might be transferred at a bargain-basement
price, but only if city and state officials act quickly, using what
he called ``their best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Tony Coles, the mayor's senior adviser,
said the city-state plan for the island announced in January was
detailed enough to warrant a commitment from the White House, and
the letter to Moynihan ``talks all around the promise that was made
by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped and expected that the president would come
through,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   Lew's letter responded to requests to the White House from
Moynihan, the mayor and other officials to help remove a
congressional barrier and allow the island to be used as a
nonprofit public resource.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier was created in 1997 when Congress adopted a federal
budget plan that designated Governors Island an asset to be sold to
the highest bidder in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal that Clinton sent to Congress on Monday
disappointed New York officials by failing to delete Governors
Island from Congress' list of disposable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposal merely lowered the island's estimated
value to $300 million from $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   That provoked angry criticism from Giuliani, who said at a news
conference Tuesday that the president may no longer intend to help
transfer the island to the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the president is just trying to fund some
of his spending programs out of that $300 million,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, the chief economic adviser to Pataki, said the
new federal estimate of the island's worth was ``utter fantasy.''
Since the city and state intend to devote much of the island to
public use, and pay for its maintenance, ``its fair market value is
really $1 or less,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But another official said the long-awaited transfer of Governors
Island for $1, or another acceptably low amount, had not been
derailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reasonable to look at the president's budget and say,
`Yikes, what is the intention,''' said Tony Bullock, the chief of
staff to Senator Moynihan. ``But the letter from Lew comes out
saying, `don't pay much attention to the $300 million figure.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do now,'' Bullock said, ``is get busy on the
details of the plan.''  &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Within three hours of the killing of the
latest Israeli soldier, smiling officials of Hezbollah, the
Lebanon-based Party of God, summoned fresh cups of Turkish coffee
for Western reporters, handed out a communique about the attack and
released a freshly printed sheet of statistics, complete with a pie
chart, listing all seven Israeli soldiers killed by Hezbollah in
the last 18 days. Proudly, the Hezbollah men noted that the Israeli
losses were the heaviest inflicted by their group in a similar
period since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the gathering in the Beirut information center was a
smooth demonstration of what might be called Hezbollah 2000, the
media-friendly, computer-savvy, mobile phone-equipped, multiple Web
site version of the Islamic militant group that bludgeoned its way
into the American consciousness in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, the attack that killed Zachi Yitak, the
Israeli soldier, set off a serious crisis. Diplomats said it could
further widen the breach that has hobbled peace talks between
Israel and Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon and the patron,
along with Iran, of Hezbollah. But in the Hezbollah office, in a
ramshackle building not far from the Beirut airport, it was evident
that the Hezbollah of today wears a new face.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s Hezbollah rose to the top of the United States'
list of terrorist organizations, with a series of attacks that
included the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Beirut,
the 1983 bombing of U.S. and French marine barracks in which 241
Americans and 59 Frenchmen died, and serial kidnappings that made
hostages for years of Americans, British and other victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah today has a new populist image, with
representatives forming the largest single-party group in the
Lebanese Parliament. It also has an impressive network of schools,
hospitals and welfare centers that cater to tens of thousands of
families, and an information network that may be unrivaled anywhere
in the world, at least by an organization that many Western nations
still list as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Hezbollah has one of the most watched
television stations in Lebanon, which nightly broadcasts footage of
Hezbollah strikes on Israeli forces, taken from hand-held video
cameras. The broadcasts, showing young guerrillas striking at
Israel on the last active Arab-Israeli combat front, have attracted
an enthusiastic audience across this nation of 3.5 million people.
Among them are many who previously shunned Hezbollah for what they
viewed as a militant Islamic posture ill attuned to the
cosmopolitan society on which many Lebanese pride themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Any Western reporter wanting to write about Hezbollah must first
make contact at the information office in the suburb of Haret
Hreik, a mile or so from the airport in a heavily crowded area that
has a concentrated population of Shiite Muslims, the largest of
Lebanon's population groups and the base of support for Hezbollah.
It was from this area in the 1980s that Hezbollah, or one of its
front organizations, mounted many headline-grabbing operations,
including the kidnapping in 1985 of Terry Anderson, the Associated
Press bureau chief who spent nearly seven years as a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the emphasis is not on taking Western reporters
captive but on welcoming them and convincing them of the legitimacy
of the Hezbollah cause. Escorted trips are arranged to southern
Lebanese Hezbollah strongholds like Nabatiye, near the site of the
attack on Beaufort Castle, the ancient Crusader fort where the
Israeli soldier died in Friday's attack. Videos are made available
of the latest Hezbollah assaults, with officials proudly pointing
out that many of them, including a missile attack earlier this week
that killed another Israeli soldier at Dabshe, near Nabatiye, end
up being shown on Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon Abvu Mohammed Alameh, a Hezbollah spokesman,
brandishing a personal organizer to check his facts, was especially
eager to point out that his group had its own bulletin on the
Beaufort Castle attack prepared and printed before the attack was
confirmed by Israel. The bulletin, in Arabic, was headed, as always
with Hezbollah communiques, with quotations from the Koran. ``In
the name of God the most merciful,'' it said. ``With God on your
side, no one can defeat you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The text of the statement was, it must be said, old-style
Hezbollah, with little public relations polishing of the style or
grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our continuing operations to end the occupation of southern
Lebanon and liberate the land of our people,'' it said, ``and in
accordance with our goal of inflicting heavy losses on the Israeli
forces and kicking the last of them out of our nation, in a manner
that leaves the occupying forces with no chance of withstanding our
Islamic fighters, the fighting unit known as Martyrs of Farouk
Ismail with God's help today at 11.55 a.m. attacked with rockets
and machine-gun fire the main Israeli stronghold at Qalat Ashrif.''
Qalat Ashrif is the Arabic name for Beaufort Castle.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying information sheet distributed by Alameh was
much closer to the buttoned-down, corporate style of the new
Hezbollah. The sheet gave figures for the casualties inflicted in
all of Hezbollah's attacks in the six weeks since the start of the
year, and included a column giving Israeli figures for the same
incidents, mostly the same as Hezbollah's. The pie chart, giving
percentage breakdowns for casualties among the Israeli troops and
the South Lebanon Army, the Christian militia force allied to
Israel in the occupation zone, said that 24 percent of the 77 dead
and wounded among the two forces since the start of the year have
been Israelis, 74 percent members of the Christian militia force
and 2 percent members of ``joint patrols.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no figures for Hezbollah casualties, either on the
two-month casualty sheet or from the officials, although Hezbollah
fighters near Nabatiye had told visitors on Thursday that
``hundreds'' of their men have been killed during the 22-year
Israeli occupation, and ``dozens'' in recent months. Roadsides in
the area are dotted with metal billboards bearing the images of
bearded young ``martyrs,'' mostly young, who have been killed in
fighting with the Israeli forces, and every reporter's visit
includes a supervised talk with a martyr's widow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hezbollah office in Beirut, the emphasis is kept
firmly on the positive. Alameh, the spokesman, seemed especially
proud that the bulletin on the operation that killed the Israeli
soldier Friday had been issued within 35 minutes of the strike,
before the attack was confirmed by Israel. Along with other
Hezbollah officials, he made it plain that he shared none of the
concerns of other Beirut residents about new Israeli air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he expected new Israeli bomb attacks on
targets around Beirut and other population centers, Alameh, 47, a
grizzle-bearded Lebanese who worked for years as a sales manager
for a U.S. oil company in the Persian Gulf, smiled broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is open,'' he said _ including, it seemed, the
possibility of an air attack on Hezbollah's television station, the
jewel in its crown. A proposed visit to the station by two Western
reporters would have to be put off for a day, at least, he said,
still smiling, because Hezbollah would not want to put visitors at
risk.

PATIENT SETTLES   CASE OF INITIALS   CUT INTO BELLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman whose doctor carved his initials into her
skin after he delivered her baby by Caesarean section has settled a
lawsuit against the doctor and dropped her claim against Beth
Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, the hospital said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, the patient, Dr. Liana Gedz,
a dentist, will receive $1.75 million, according to people who were
involved in the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   The obstetrician, Dr. Allan Zarkin, did not deny to hospital
officials that he carved his initials into Gedz's abdomen in early
September after delivering her baby girl. Zarkin's lawyer has said
his client has a frontal lobe dementia similar to Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin has been charged with assault in the carving, and he has
pleaded not guilty. Gedz, while pursuing her civil suit against
Zarkin and the hospital, said she did not think the district
attorney should pursue a criminal case against Zarkin. Gedz
socialized frequently with Zarkin before he delivered her baby.
</P>
<P>
   The State Health Department fined Beth Israel $14,000 and
ordered it to improve its monitoring of doctors as a result of
Zarkin's actions, the second major problem in the hospital's
obstetrics and gynecology department in two years. In 1997, Lisa
Smart, who went to the hospital for a common surgical procedure,
died.
</P>
<P>
   State Health Department officials said the hospital failed to
file proper reports with the state after the carving incident, and
did not sufficiently monitor Zarkin, despite earlier complaints by
hospital workers that the doctor's behavior had been erratic. The
department, which is responsible for licensing doctors, did not
suspend Zarkin's license until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Gedz has released Beth Israel Medical Center from all
claims and liability arising out of the incident with Dr. Allan
Zarkin without payment of any kind by Beth Israel,'' the hospital
said in a faxed statement. Zarkin's malpractice insurance is
expected to cover the cost of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Gedz's lawyer, Robert Sullivan, could not be reached for comment
last night.

   WHITE PLAINS _ One could be forgiven for thinking that Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who has raised $12 million for his U.S. Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, was already running.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Last week in a series of television interviews on the
same day that Clinton announced, he still left the door slightly
ajar. ``There's always a doubt,'' he said on one program.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, to the surprise of absolutely no one, he finally made
it definite when a reporter asked him at the Westchester County
Republican headquarters here if he was running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what an official candidate is,'' he said after a
speech to 150 supporters. ``I am very interested in running. Look
what I'm doing, I'm not walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the mayor said it: ``Give me a break, I'm running.''

CONNECTICUT SENATE REFUSES TO DISCUSS GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ For the first time since Connecticut lawmakers began
passing two-year budgets in 1991, a powerful group of legislators _
in this case, Democrats in the state Senate _ are insisting that
the state not tinker with a budget in progress.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two days after Gov. John Rowland proposed his
$12.27 billion budget on Wednesday, key legislators have yet to
agree on whether they should be discussing any budget at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to be persuaded that we should reopen the budget,''
said the Democrats' Senate majority leader, George Jepsen.
</P>
<P>
   This has left Republicans biting their fists. Without the
support of Jepsen and Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president, the
General Assembly's joint Appropriations Committee has not been able
to begin discussing the governor's proposals, including $237
million in tax cuts for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage among Republicans was only aggravated Thursday, when
Sullivan refused to reconsider his no-new-budget stance. (Most
lawmakers took Friday off in observance of President Lincoln's
birthday, a state holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   If the impasse keeps up much longer in this year's 12-week
legislative session, Republicans say they will not have enough time
to push any of Rowland's proposals through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to cut off the legitimate dialogue of the
merits of the proposals of the governor from discussion,'' said
Robert Genuario, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Democrats are the first political caucus to hold up
an effort to change an already adopted budget. In every
even-numbered year since 1991, legislators have had no compunction
about considering midcycle financial tune-ups. But late last month,
Sullivan and Jepsen announced their opposition to doing the same
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Without a budget adjustment, Republicans said Rowland's proposed
tax cuts would die, including a 7-cent reduction in the state's
32-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, the elimination of $75 million in
annual gross receipts taxes on hospitals and a four-year phasing
out of inheritance tax, valued at $52 million The Democrats'
opposition also threatens to hold up $50 sales-tax rebate checks to
260,000 people who mistakenly did not receive them last year.
Rowland administration officials said that if the budget was not
revised this year, it would exceed the state's mandated spending
cap, leaving several agencies a total of $162 million in the red
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a public-relations disaster, Democrats agreed Thursday
to allow the Appropriations Committee, which they control and which
must approve the rebates, to vote on the matter Feb. 18. Notably,
Democrats in the House of Representatives have not joined their
Senate colleagues. When asked why the moratorium on mid-budget
tinkering came up this year, Moira Lyons, the Democratic speaker of
the House, replied, ``You'll have to ask the Senate Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan, who said he felt ``stupid'' sitting behind Rowland
Wednesday as the governor delivered a budget proposal he did not
agree with, was not about to concede. ``I haven't seen anything yet
that is better'' than the current budget, he said.

OH, FED, WHERE ARE THY SMARTS? 
</HEADLINE>
 FED-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News of another strong U.S. productivity gain in 1999 was a
reminder that the Federal Reserve's effort to restrain economic
growth is a policy as futile as it is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, the concept of productivity is boring stuff best
left to academicians to sort out. It's easy to define, but
difficult to credibly measure. It's basically the amount of output
per unit of input. Those unschooled in economics tend to view it as
how much a worker produces, but a good deal more goes into
productivity's most comprehensive calculations. As a favor to
readers, none of them will be discussed here.
</P>
<P>
   What's important is that a productivity surge in the fourth
quarter resulted in the best annual gain in seven years. Last
year's overall 2.9 percent increase marked the third time in the
past four years that productivity rose nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The practical benefit of these productivity increases is
noninflationary economic growth. Economists are increasingly
crediting rising productivity with the U.S. economy's ability to
tolerate relatively low jobless rates and relatively high growth
rates without the rising inflation that traditionally has
accompanied such developments.
</P>
<P>
   What's increasingly frustrating to those who claim rising
productivity minimizes the inflationary threat is the Federal
Reserve's insistent disregard for this variable. Fed policy makers
continue to raise interest rates under the central bank's control
in an attempt to slow the economy, let the air out of the stock
market bubble and thereby pre-empt the possibility of an
inflationary surge.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Fed's intrusions have had little effect in the real
world. Interest rates, to be sure, are higher than a year ago. But
this is mainly due to the market leading the Fed, as other key
rates have tended to rise well before the Fed makes its moves.
Meantime, the economic expansion set a longevity record, the stock
market is holding up reasonably well, and unemployment is at a
30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good. And it would be better if the Fed weren't allergic
to prosperity. Readers occasionally call to ask what Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan has against good times for working folk. Their basic
gripe is that whenever jobs appear too plentiful, borrowed money
too cheap, and investment rewards too promising, the Fed takes
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is valid, because the Fed is running out of excuses.
In the past, when it had nothing else to justify its rate
increases, it could take refuge by claiming humongous federal
budget deficits demanded tighter monetary screws. Nowadays budget
surpluses have taken away that excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, none of the fears on which the Fed bases its current
policy have materialized. As for accolades, the Fed deserves none.
Whatever good is happening is occurring in spite of the Fed rather
than because of it.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is happening? In the absence of a better answer, it
must have to do with steadily rising productivity. Americans are
not only working harder and smarter, but they're also putting
capital to better use. Some say computer technology is finally
starting to pay off big time, and there's probably something to
this.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, though, it's turning the Fed into a paper tiger.

PROSECUTORS JOIN DEFENSE IN OPPOSING EXECUTION OF MENTALLY
RETARDED 
</HEADLINE>
 BILL-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the first time, Missouri prosecutors and
defense lawyers are working together to craft a law to stop
executions of mentally retarded persons convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to prevent the state from executing mentally retarded
killers is pending in Jefferson City and has created two unusual
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Callahan, director of the Missouri Association of
Prosecuting Attorneys, and Sean O'Brien, a Kansas City defense
lawyer, are working together on a House bill. Kansas already has
such a law.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents hope the issue will become part of a
national shift toward limiting or stopping capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor who signed Missouri's death penalty into law
in 1977 said he now believes execution is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a moral duty to honor life,'' said Joseph P. Teasdale,
now a Kansas City lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents want other states to stop using capital
punishment as Illinois did last month. But even supporters say
moratorium bills in the Missouri General Assembly stand little
chance of passing this year.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, the Cole County prosecutor, said his decision to work
for the law regarding the mentally retarded had nothing to do with
a changing political climate. He said it's just the right thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first blush,'' Callahan said, ``standing for putting
mentally retarded people to death is not something I'm comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other prosecutors are concerned the law may create
another vague defense, Callahan said. He also says a judge should
determine if the defendant is mentally retarded after a jury
recommends death. If so, then the judge could not impose death.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien counters that Missouri judges have always imposed the
death sentence after juries recommended it. He says mental
retardation should be determined before trial and, if found, it
should preclude any possible death sentence. That is the law in
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan and O'Brien say they'll work with legislators to try
and craft a bill that will satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the Kansas City area differ on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Bob Beaird said he favors such a law
but does not need it to shape his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are never, under any circumstances, going to seek the death
penalty on a retarded person,'' Beaird said.
</P>
<P>
   Platte County Prosecutor Todd Graves said any such law would
have to be carefully crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be an exception you could drive a truck through,''
Graves said. ``A lot of these guys aren't real smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay County Prosecutor Don Norris said he had not studied how
such a law would work, but he would think long and hard before
seeking death against any mentally retarded person.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they know of no mentally retarded person among
the 80 persons awaiting lethal injection. The state has executed 41
persons since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Other retardation cases
</P>
<P>
   Executing mentally retarded convicts has raised questions in
some high-profile cases in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   - The state executed killer Ricky Lee Grubbs in 1992 despite
defense pleas that he was borderline mentally retarded. Grubbs told
police he killed drinking buddy Jerry Thorton in 1984 after the two
got into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   - Gov. Mel Carnahan in 1993 commuted inmate Bobby Shaw's death
sentence to life without parole. Defense lawyers argued that Shaw
was both mentally retarded and mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   - In a case that received national attention, a borderline
mentally retarded man pleaded guilty to a 1986 slaying to avoid a
possible death sentence. Johnny Lee Wilson, who had told police he
killed Pauline Martz in Jasper County, started serving a sentence
of life without parole in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan pardoned Wilson five years ago. Another man confessed
to the crime and evidence indicated police coerced Wilson's
confession.
</P>
<P>
   A Jackson County case also brought the issue of capital
punishment against the mentally retarded into sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Shawn Jackson was accused of strangling six Kansas City
women in eight months. Patrick W. Peters was the assistant
prosecutor against the man known as ``the Gillham Park strangler.''
Peters, then called ``Dr. Death,'' prosecuted half the 12 Jackson
County cases that landed defendants on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, now a defense lawyer, said Friday that he never even
considered seeking death against Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was simple-minded,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   There clearly should be a law against executing mentally
retarded people, Peters said. ``I think it's sad the debate even
has to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Jackson pleaded guilty and received a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, the 24-year-old man said he was 28 and bobbed up
and down during questioning. He often answered gruesome murder
questions with a wide and seemingly sincere grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to be nice,'' he said. ``I never even robbed
nobody.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time one sat down to witness a parade of
perfectly lovely ball skirts whirl by at the Heidi Weisel show on
Thursday afternoon, it was easy to feel as if Fashion Week had
become the longest-running and least funny Woody Allen movie of all
time. More than a few designers played out a romance with New York
_ a Bobby Short New York _ so giddy, so unquestioning, that it
seemed they had turned into the kind of teen-ager who stared out a
window from the concrete banality of Roosevelt Island, certain that
all the answers lay across the water between the walls of the River
House.
</P>
<P>
   Had no one ever run up against the wayward side of East Side
privilege? The blowzy, 36-year-old divorcee well into her bourbon
and her search for a third husband? The trust-fund squanderer who
makes the party worth showing up for in the first place? Had no
one, in fact, ever read a word of Dominick Dunne?
</P>
<P>
   It fell upon John Bartlett, who put forth a stunning show on
Thursday evening, to cast a more discerning eye on the world of the
well bred. A Harvard graduate, Bartlett has probably been exposed
to a broader faction of the elite than most young designers. It is
tempting to roll one's eyes when a designer starts relaying
inspiration sources, but when Bartlett says he was thinking of
``Grey Gardens'' as he put together this collection, he should
probably be taken seriously. Bartlett has watched ``Grey Gardens,''
the Maysles brothers' 1976 documentary, every four months for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which has also inspired fashion photography in
Harper's Bazaar and Italian Vogue, turns a camera on the lives of
Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edie Bouvier Beale, former
debutantes and an aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
whose lives took a turn into mesmerizing dissipation.
</P>
<P>
   In the pet-infested squalor of their East Hampton mansion,
mother and daughter famously show a taste for unconventional style.
At one point, Edie, a failed dancer and Norma Desmond sort, slaps a
makeshift piece of fabric around her pantyhose, attaches a safety
pin in front and declares her intent to wear it also as a cape.
Perhaps in homage to that scene, Bartlett sent out smart
minidresses in the form of capes.
</P>
<P>
   How easily allusions to ``Grey Gardens'' could have turned
Bartlett's show into a camp escapade a few turbans shy of the
Greenwich Village Halloween Parade. He let no such nonsense
transpire.
</P>
<P>
   On an elevated runway, the designer turned out his most mature
collection to date. His clothes _ black and camel geometric print
blouses over similarly colored check trousers, and chevron leather
skirts _ had the cool of a woman who has done more with her life
than marry at 25 and preside over a Classic Six.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the clothes very literally referenced those of the
designer Pauline Trigere, but in a way, they managed something more
metaphoric, too. Trigere, who was recently profiled in a Vanity
Fair article by Amy Fine Collins, has lived the kind of Park Avenue
life that makes room for having a younger, Latin lover as an
80-something.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bartlett, Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley at Tuleh became
fascinated with Trigere after reading about her in Vanity Fair. The
pair did not make their typical clients travel too far to see their
clothes Friday: The show took place at the Regency Hotel on Park
Avenue and 61st Street. The venue, and the sight of so many
cheerful-looking young socialites in the front row, made one fear
at first that the designers had lost any irony about who they were
dressing. But all the worry faded once the show got going and the
clothes came down the runway, not to Cole Porter but to Axl Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Patner and Bradley showed Trigere-ish prints. There were
matelasse gold pants and a leopard-print trench on view. The 1940s
dowdiness of their spring collection had vanished, replaced by a
tasteful sexiness that made you want almost all the clothes that
went by.
</P>
<P>
   One had the same feeling at the Geoffrey Beene show earlier
Friday. There are precious few designers who have the right to stay
secluded in the library of their own references, though Beene, so
devoted to graphic precision, is certainly one of them. Yet, Beene
seemed to be opening the doors a bit, in what many considered his
best show in years. He presented a loose-waisted, spaghetti-strap
minidress over fishnet hose. Equally stunning was a '20s-inspired
dress with cap sleeves and rhinestones and sheer pleated dresses.
</P>
<P>
   There was a feeling that Beene was beginning a new chapter in
his career. For the first time in nearly 20 years, editors from
Women's Wear Daily and W were given seats at a Beene show, putting
an apparent close to one of fashion's most prolonged feuds, dating
back to the Johnson administration. Patrick J. McCarthy, the
chairman and editorial director of W, who had never seen a Beene
show in his career, had called the designer this season and asked
if he could come. Beene welcomed him, and three other Fairchild
journalists. ``I'm thrilled,'' McCarthy said after the show.
</P>
<P>
   There were other high points by the end of the week. The Tse
show was noteworthy for beautifully colored, boldly geometric wool
dresses and suits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cynthia Rowley show on Thursday night, it seemed that the
designer was moving happily beyond date-night clothes, even if her
program notes suggested she was honoring young women ``rocking out
on someone else's dime.'' Rowley's clothes seemed more compellingly
grown up, in the sense of a woman who had broken the habit of
watching ``Friends'' reruns and switched to Alison Lurie novels.
Among her best looks was a strikingly clasped wrap skirt made of
alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rowley, Richard Tyler was not one to gush over Upper East
Side gentility. His fall collection, presented on Thursday, had
more fun and less of the aggressive sexiness he has had in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   At Wink Friday afternoon, it was apparent that the label's
talented young designer, Wynn Smith, needs to venture forward.
Given the mood of the season, it was perversely comic, refreshing
even, to hear the voice of Glenn Close as the comatose Sunny von
Bulow from the film ``Reversal of Fortune'' play throughout the
show. But Smith's clothes, evoking visions of stoned 15- year-olds
in the back of a pickup truck, left one merely sighing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the designer turned out a sweet and
beautifully cut floral-lined, short-cropped suit, one had hope that
Smith would take another trip north of 14th Street someday soon.

FANS LOVE EDDIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Eddie Jones might have been the most-loved Los Angeles
Laker of the late 1990s, but he could never be the floor leader on
a team with Shaquille O'Neal, Nick Van Exel and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's the Charlotte Hornets' go-to guy, and for the first
time, a starter in Sunday's All-Star Game. The two things are most
certainly related.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, while playing for the Lakers, Jones made his All-
Star debut as a reserve, chosen by coaches. Now he's tearing up the
Eastern Conference, averaging 20.6 points, 4.5 assists, 4.8
rebounds and a league-leading 3.0 steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that the fans are showing me a lot of love, they're
respecting my game more so than they did in Los Angeles,'' Jones
said Friday at the start of the All-Star weekend. ``I won't say
they disrespected my game in Los Angeles, but they showed me a lot
more love seeing me on a Charlotte team where I'm really showing my
skills more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it's rewarding to have been elected to the game, even
after changing teams and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you can come from a situation and do it again,
that tells you that you accomplished something,'' said Jones, who
was traded last March for Glen Rice. ``A lot of players go to
another team and they don't keep on that same pace. And I did.
Whether the fans voted me in or the coaches, that shows me that I'm
a consistent player.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No-shows: Lakers coach Phil Jackson and several players were
no-shows at Friday's media session, but Utah Jazz forward Karl
Malone probably will be the only one fined $10,000 for missing the
event.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials said Jackson and several others were held up by
airline delays related to bad weather. Malone, however, simply
informed the league he would not show up until Sunday's All-Star
game.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had threatened not to play at all in order to rest his
sore back, but he changed his mind after the league threatened a
fine and potentially a five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers guard Derek Fisher, a participant in the 2ball
competition, and Clippers forward Lamar Odom, who plays in today's
rookie game, also missed the media session because of flight
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Also reportedly delayed by the weather were Tim Duncan and David
Robinson of San Antonio, Steve Francis of Houston and Chris Webber
of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   __ Relief: Clippers second-year center Michael Olowokandi will
be playing against rookie teammate Odom in today's NBA rookie game.
The good news is, one of them has to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a nice break to come out here and just relax and
play basketball from a completely different perspective, where
we're out here to have fun and compete and not worry abut how many
games in a row we've lost or whatever,'' said Olowokandi. ``If I
wasn't here, I think I would have been as far away from basketball
as much as possible and just taking a break from, so far, the
dismal season we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No sweat: Shaquille O'Neal, a veteran of All-Star games,
summed up the general philosophy of most players on the event:
``I'm just going to go out there, have a feel and try to give the
fans a good show. I'm not going to go out there and try to break my
neck.''

WOOD CHIP MILLS IN OZARKS RAISE CONCERN AMONG ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHIP MILLS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Mo. _ Every school day, Joe Hamilton bounced in a bus
down Funk Branch Road, through the Ozark hills on his way to and
from school. The lush limbs of hardwood trees lined the road and
shaded it like a canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the road runs through a land stripped of trees. Only
stumps, a few piles of brush, a small dogwood or two remain. This
large clear-cut fed a chip mill, a new kind of mill in Missouri
that can chew up many times more wood a year than a traditional
sawmill and turn it into pulp for paper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Hamilton and his schoolmates ride down Funk Branch
Road, they look away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it wasn't ugly, I'll put it that way,'' said Hamilton,
a high school junior. ``Now it looks mangy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton joined landowners and businessmen who assembled on Funk
Branch Road earlier this week to mourn what they say is a coming
plague for the vast timberlands of the Missouri Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Southeast, chip mills have emerged over the last
decade like dogwoods in the spring. The growth, now reaching into
Missouri, has come because of restrictions on timber harvesting in
the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   And with the mills has come concern from environmental groups.
They worry about increased clear-cuts that could foul streams or
wreck the homes of native species of birds and other wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip mills represent the biggest, most efficient and most
damaging aspect of the new wave of deforestation,'' said Katie
Auman, an organizer for the Dogwood Alliance, a national coalition
of environmental groups concerned about chip mills.
</P>
<P>
   The chip mills, because they can consume so much timber,
encourage clear-cutting, Auman said.
</P>
<P>
   But chip mill owners and the industry's promoters say their new
mills can benefit the Missouri Ozarks, providing a new use for the
bad timber that can't be sold to sawmills or other markets. Removal
of that less valuable timber can actually help the more valuable
oaks grow bigger, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They also say they support ``sustainable forestry,'' which
promotes harvesting of timber in ways that would allow the forest
to sustain itself in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the end of the world coming,'' said Stephen
Galliher, procurement forester for Willamette Industries in nearby
Piedmont. ``This is just something different.''
</P>
<P>
   If someone were clearing the land to convert it into pasture,
people wouldn't be complaining, Galliher said. But Willamette's
practices are sustainable, he said, and should allow for continued
harvesting of timber.
</P>
<P>
   The timber from Funk Branch Road _ cut by private loggers on
privately owned land _ went to supply Willamette Industries' mill
in Mill Spring, 20 miles south of Annapolis. From there, the wood
chips went to a Willamette paper mill in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Willamette officials say some harvests, such as the one on Funk
Branch, are more drastic and appear to be damaging because the
landowner has directed them to clear the land so it can be
converted to pasture or development.
</P>
<P>
   If Willamette had owned that land, Galliher said, the 300-acre
clear-cut would have been limited to 50 acres. Yet loggers took
precautions to stop erosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Willamette officials, like many in the forest products
industry, point to the role they play in society. People want paper
and wood products; they supply it. And for some in Missouri,
Willamette's supplying of pulp for their Kentucky paper plant
provides jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that works here comes from a 20-mile radius,'' said
Claude Shupe, mill manager at Mill Spring Chips. The mill employs
six.
</P>
<P>
   Logging crews also are local, he said, and the company's
economic benefits are many times greater than the mill's $200,000
or more annual payroll, Shupe said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the mill can use some wastes from sawmills in the
area, opening a new market for those small businesses, Shupe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting money back into this community,'' he said.
``We're not the evil people that some make us out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On Funk Branch Road, though, concerned landowners say the costs
of such drastic clear-cuts outweigh the benefits that chip mills
bring to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about private property rights,'' said Mike
Smith, a teacher and cabinetmaker who owns land along Funk Branch
Road, below the clear-cut area. ``But with rights come
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see here represents a lack of respect for the forest
and for the things that live here....I'd like to see it stopped as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith dreads when heavy rains come, for he fears Funk Branch, an
arm of the clear-flowing Black River, will become fouled with muddy
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, no state regulations govern logging or
clear-cutting of timber on private land. If soil erosion or other
runoff degraded a stream, the Missouri Clean Water Act might allow
regulators to cite the landowner. But no one has been cited.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mahfood, director of the Missouri Department of Natural
Resources, said he thought the Funk Branch site failed to follow
good forest harvesting practice. ``No it wasn't good,'' he said.
``There will be potential for siltation and sediment running off
the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfood said he also planned to send out inspectors to check
other clear-cuts in the area to look for violations of Missouri's
water pollution law, which limits the flow of soil and sediments
into streams.
</P>
<P>
   What happened along Funk Branch Road is also well known to
members of Gov. Mel Carnahan's Advisory Committee on Chip Mills, a
group appointed in 1998 to examine the economic, social and
environmental effects of the mills in Missouri. While the committee
works on its study, Carnahan has placed a moratorium on any more
mills opening in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the committee's most recent report, it cited the Funk Branch
Road as an example of a cut that did not follow ``best management
practices,'' standards accepted by the forest industry for timber
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan recently directed the committee to consider an internal
report from the Missouri Department of Conservation that detailed
many potential ecological problems that could come if more chip
mills were allowed into Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Most timber will be harvested on private land without the
assistance of professional foresters, the conservation report
stated. And clear-cut harvests probably would result in stream
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Just a mile or so from Funk Branch Road, Iron County landowners
and Joe Hamilton gathered in another clear-cut to survey the
damage. Steep slopes off Route K had been cleared by modern
tree-chopping machinery.
</P>
<P>
   And the cuts were on extreme slopes that appeared certain to
send soil and sediment into a tiny stream in the hollow, Auman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the group was forester Clinton Trammel, who manages the
nearby Pioneer Forest in the Ozarks, a vast tract of timber, more
than 150,000 acres, that is owned by St. Louis conservationist Leo
Drey. The forest is managed only by selectively cutting timber,
never clear-cutting trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is every bit as devastating as lead mining, if not
more,'' said Trammel, who said he wished to see as much concern
about chip mills as he has seen about lead mining in the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Trammel and his group watched loggers work in a clear-cut
area nearby. A four-man crew worked big machines that grabbed the
trees, cut them, pulled them through a saw to cut off their limbs,
then stacked them on the truck. The workers' hands never touched a
limb.
</P>
<P>
   Trammel talked of how the Ozarks were clear-cut 100 years ago
but said those cuts were done by two-man crews with crosscut saws.
``This is so far more destructive,'' he said, ``that it doesn't
even compare.''

 CANDIDATE FOR SENATE TRIES TO BASK IN McCAIN'S GLOW  
(ko) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK _ Sen. John McCain's surging presidential candidacy is
lending hope to another Republican maverick seeking higher office:
the Essex County executive, James Treffinger, who is considered a
dark-horse contender to succeed Sen. Frank Lautenberg when he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's arrival at Newark International Airport Friday morning
for a day of fund-raisers, interviews and meetings in New York and
New Jersey gave Treffinger, who is trailing two other moderate
Republicans in the race to raise money and collect endorsements, a
chance to identify himself with McCain as a fellow crusader against
what both call the Washington establishment. He did not waste the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In welcoming remarks at the airport that went on so long that
McCain looked a bit embarrassed, Treffinger said McCain's positions
on fiscal policy were nearly indistinguishable from his own. They
both favor lowering taxes and cutting pork-barrel spending,
strengthening Social Security and Medicare and eliminating the
national debt, he said. ``I share the beliefs and values and goals
articulated in McCain's career and in his campaign for the
presidency,'' Treffinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the two share a commitment to change the nation's
campaign finance system. Treffinger says he favors eliminating
political action committees, allowing contributions from
individuals only, and providing matching funds and spending caps
for all candidates for federal office. But he made no mention of
their marked differences on abortion rights, which Treffinger
favors, and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shoulder to shoulder with McCain in front of the
senator's ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus, Treffinger
praised the senator as ``a true American hero,'' adding, ``I am
very proud to join his team today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not return Treffinger's endorsement, saying that he
was pleased to receive it but that ``obviously I'm seeking the
support of every citizen of New Jersey.'' Treffinger's chief rivals
for the Senate nomination, Rep. Bob Franks and state Sen. William
Gormley, have both endorsed Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Treffinger believes that even unrequited support for
McCain could help his own Senate candidacy, as he acknowledged when
he said that from now on, he would end all his own campaign
speeches by making a plug for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, who said today that he was gaining support from
so-called Reagan Democrats in South Carolina and elsewhere,
Treffinger, a former Democrat who worked on the 1980 presidential
campaign of Gary Hart, is advertising his own potential appeal to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter mailed this week to registered Republicans,
Treffinger, who was elected to two consecutive terms as county
executive in predominantly Democratic Essex County, asserts that he
is the only Republican who can win a general election. ``In every
statewide election, Essex County always gives the Democrats the
margin of victory they need to win,'' he writes. ``I won in Essex
County, twice.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Treffinger's relations with Democratic freeholders in
Essex County have been anything but contentious.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Treffinger appears to face an uphill climb. He has
little support in the southern third of the state, while Gormley,
who represents the Atlantic City area, has made deep inroads in
North Jersey counties. Franks, meanwhile, a fellow North Jerseyan
whose district includes part of Essex County, said today that he
had won the endorsement of nearly every prominent official in
southern Burlington County.

   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore on Friday received the
endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
and lesbian lobbying group. He visited the Stonewall Democratic
Club here Friday morning, accompanied by Gov. Gray Davis of
California, several California officeholders and Judy Shepard, the
mother of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student whose murder in
Wyoming in 1998 drew nationwide attention.

   Mrs. Shepard, who has devoted herself to fighting prejudice
against gays and lesbians, delivered an emotional speech. When she
began to cry, Gore, who was standing next to her, rubbed her back.

   Gore promised that if he was elected president, ``I will reissue
the executive order banning discrimination in the federal work
force, and fight with all my heart to pass the employee
nondiscrimination act.''
