<HEADLINE> List Names Great Rock Music Moments  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Feb. 9, 1964. A British band from Liverpool
takes ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' stage and sends waves of teen-agers
into screaming convulsions across America, bewildering millions of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   What's rock 'n' roll's biggest TV moment?
</P>
<P>
   A new top 100 list from VH1 and Entertainment Weekly magazine
says that was it -- the day Beatlemania hit the states and stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles U.S. debut even topped the 1968 comeback of the
King.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 73 million people were watching that night in '64 --
about three times the audience of an episode of this summer's TV
blockbuster ''Survivor.'' John Lennon was so nervous he taped song
lyrics to the back of his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   As Ringo Starr explained, the band didn't realize until it
arrived in America how important Sullivan's Sunday night showcase
was.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of rock 'n' rollers, it was the moment they
knew they wanted to be stars. ''I remember thinking, 'this can be
done. I can do that,''' singer Billy Joel said.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley's comeback special four years later, his return to
radio after years of B movies, was No. 2, and deemed more important
than the King's 1956 debut. The 1968 return at least showed those
swiveling hips; in 1956, the camera only shot him from the waist
up.
</P>
<P>
   Several selections were more important in retrospect as
historical movements rather than memorable moments, such as the
premieres of MTV, ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''American
Bandstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moments in VH1's top 10 included Michael Jackson's first
moonwalk on the 1983 ''Motown 25'' special, the Live Aid telecast
in 1985, Madonna's ''Like a Virgin'' performance on the 1984 MTV
Video Music Awards, and The Who's appearance on ''The Smothers
Brothers Comedy Hour'' in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre selection: No. 17, the man who crashed Bob
Dylan's 1998 Grammy Awards performance with ''Soy Bomb'' written on
his bare chest.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent: Ricky Martin's performance at the 1999 Grammy
Awards, one of 28 events from the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes three performances of the national
anthem: by Marvin Gaye at the 1982 NBA All-Star Game in Detroit, by
Whitney Houston at the 1991 Super Bowl, and by a crotch-grabbing
Roseanne at a 1990 San Diego Padres game.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles made the list seven times, Madonna and Michael
Jackson are each on it five times.
</P>
<P>
   VH1 plans to air selections from the list in a series of five
one-hour specials on VH1 starting July 31.

Clinton Returns to Camp David
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton rejoined the troubled Middle East
talks at Camp David Sunday a four-day trip to Asia. The president arrived by
helicopter at the retreat in the mountains of Maryland, where he met with his
negotiating team and was assessing the state of the summit, according to a
spokesman. Boarding the chopper at the White House after his flight home from an
economic summit in Japan -- which he left early to get back to Camp David --
Clinton showed reporters his crossed fingers, and said he was keeping them that
way.

Algerian Militants Under Siege
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algerian troops backed by artillery and helicopter
gunships besieged the mountain hide-outs of Islamic militants, amid militant
attacks that have killed 31 people in four days, newspapers said Sunday.
Twenty-eight militants have died over the past week in the army's offensive in
the mountainous Jijel region, 160 miles east of the capital of Algiers, the El
Watan daily reported Sunday.

Fla. Murder Suspect Releases 2 Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding five hostages in a suburban
home released two of the four children Sunday as police tried to end the two-day
standoff. Both children, an 8-year-old boy and a girl under 1, were in good
health, although the boy was hungry and thirsty, Orange County Sheriff Kevin
Beary said. Beary said the suspect, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, had asked police to
see the children reunited with their parents on live television after releasing
them. Local news stations aired the footage shortly after their release.

Defraud Contractors Get Contract
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A computer analysis shows that hundreds of companies
prosecuted or sued for defrauding the government can still receive federal
business -- and many have gotten new contracts -- because agencies chose not to
ban them. The companies range from a Texas contractor convicted of selling
faulty Coast Guard windshields to an environmental cleanup company convicted of
bribery. Vice President Al Gore wants to expand the federal debarment program to
exclude businesses with troublesome labor or worker safety records -- even
though the program is not debarring many of those already convicted or sued for
fraud.

Cheney Said Sanguine on VP Chances
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, George W. Bush's top
vice presidential candidate, has told associates there is a good chance he will
get the job, officials said Sunday as the Republican governor from Texas
prepared to announce his pick. Cheney, former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri and
perhaps others are on Bush's short list, according to highly placed GOP
officials. In seclusion at his Texas ranch, Bush tentatively planned to
introduce his running mate Tuesday.

Stephen King Offers Online Novel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an ambitious and quirky experiment beginning Monday, the
king of horror, Stephen King is offering up the first two installments of a
previously unpublished serial novel by posting them on his Web site and asking
readers to pony up a buck for each copy they download. If the honor system
works, the episodes will continue. Although he's eliminating his publisher from
the process -- and the story line of ''The Plant'' is about a creeping
''vampire'' plant that takes over a publishing company -- King says the only
people he's interested in scaring are his readers.

Larkin Rejects Mets, Signs New Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin is staying in Cincinnati -- for the rest of
this season and the next three as well. Hours after he rejected a trade to the
Mets, the All-Star shortstop agreed Sunday to a three-year, $27 million contract
extension that will keep him with his hometown Reds through 2003.
</P>
<SUBHEAD>
Braves Beat Mets 1-0
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Ashby, acquired in a trade during the All-Star break to
bolster Atlanta's rotation, picked up his second complete-game victory for the
Braves, allowing only four hits in a 1-0 victory over the New York Mets on
Sunday night. The Mets were told before the game that All-Star shortstop Barry
Larkin rejected a proposed trade from Cincinnati. Then, while watching his team
try to make up ground on the Braves in the NL East, New York general manager
Steve Phillips learned that Larkin signed a three-year contract extension with
the Reds. Ashby (6-7) dropped six games behind Atlanta after losing two of three
in the weekend series. New York is 2-18 at Turner Field since September 1997.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Pledges Money for Poor Nations  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- Leaders of the world's most powerful
economies pledged Sunday to help poor countries reduce their debts
and improve their education, health care and computer technology,
but proposed little real money for the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts wonder whether the Group of Eight -- the United
States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia,
the newest member -- still matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page summit-ending communique, the countries said they
would work harder to relieve the debt burden of developing nations.
They set a goal of universal primary education for all the world's
children by 2015 and gender equality in schools by 2005. They also
pledged a one-quarter reduction by the year 2010 in the number of
young people infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, the summit host, said
wealthy nations had an obligation to break the ''vicious cycle'' of
poverty and disease faced by poor nations. He declined, however, to
say whether Japan would provide funds to help developing nations
enter the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no statement on how the leaders would pay for
the goals they set for themselves, other than President Clinton's
pledge of $300 million in surplus farm crops to provide school
lunches in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're basically repeating what they have done in recent
years -- a very long laundry list of relatively marginal
decisions,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for
International Economics. ''I simply think they have gone off
track.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended the G-8's work at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many who work hard in the developing world, progress is
often agonizingly slow,'' Blair said. ''But we have made some
significant steps'' in helping poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
   The summit was the final G-8 meeting for Clinton, who arrived
late and departed quickly because of the simultaneous Mideast peace
talks at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md. Speaking for
the other leaders, Blair said, ''He will be missed greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its pledges on debt relief, education and health
care,the leaders called for new partnerships with undeveloped
countries to ''bring the opportunities of the next century within
reach of all.''
</P>
<P>
   They established an information technology task force to make
recommendations on how best to ''bridge the international
information and knowledge divide'' between rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   They urged a new round of world trade talks this year despite
the violent protests in Seattle last year that prevented it from
advancing the cause of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we make the transition to the new century, we will continue
to exercise leadership and responsibility in addressing these
persistent problems and squarely face new challenges as they
arise,'' the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no agreement, however, on the issue of genetically
modified food, which the United States and Canada generally think
is safe while the Europeans and Japanese are skeptical, French
President Jacques Chirac said Sunday. The communique glossed over
the differences.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the group has had problems following up
effectively on the important advances it does make. Last week, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was disappointed by the lack
of progress since the group agreed to provide debt relief to poor
countries at last year's summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize that there are no simple solutions to the debt
problem,'' Annan said in a statement. ''But ... clearly more must
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Prodi, president of the European Commission, said Annan's
statement was unfair. ''He expressed his disappointment before we
even discussed the problem in Okinawa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the group's early years in the 1970s, summits were more
informal. There was no intense bureaucratic flurry, no rambling,
pre-cooked statements.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schott, a negotiator in the 1973-79 Tokyo Round of the
GATT, the precursor of the World Trade Organization, said the 1978
summit provided real advances in global trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The need for the G8 is perhaps as important if not more
important as it ever has been,'' said Schott, now a senior fellow
at Bergsten's think tank. ''But the output ... has become less and
less useful over time.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that meetings increasingly have become
orchestrated as they elevated in profile, leaving little to
negotiate between heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the number of issues the G-8 are dealing with has grown.
While the original group dealt mainly with economic matters, the
meetings in Okinawa focused on problems like the proposed U.S.
missile defense shield and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Russia -- a key political player but a marginal
economic power -- has furthered this trend by bringing in a member
that does not participate fully in the economic discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the world is no longer the place it was in the 1970s. The
rise of Asia in the world economy, for example, has challenged the
overwhelming European presence at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the annual summits have become annual lost
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say leaders should make more of their chance to make the
kinds of tough bargains and agreements that lower level bureaucrats
do not have the authority to make.
</P>
<P>
   One key step to giving the future summits could be to limit the
scope of the meeting so summiteers could concentrate -- and provide
some breakthroughs -- on the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten, for example, proposes a more manageable G-3 -- the
United States, the European Union, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd be much more effective,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Embarks on Endurance Test  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   With favorable weather and a festive send-off, triathlete and
marathon swimmer Jim Dreyer dived into Lake Erie and his latest
challenge Sunday: a plan to swim his way across two Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Michigan man, already having conquered lakes
Michigan and Huron, took to Lake Erie's chilly waters shortly
before 7 a.m. near Erie, Pa., then began stroking toward his
destination 26 miles away by waves and water.
</P>
<P>
   Should he finish that feat, Dreyer planned to run 26.2 miles and
bicycle 112 miles before swimming 31.6 more miles, this time across
Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   More than six hours and nine miles into his swim Sunday, Dreyer
was ''looking very good'' and being helped along by a friendly
current, said Bob Johnson, part of a support team that included a
42-foot vessel accompanying the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 p.m. Sunday, Johnson said shifting winds and current
caused a slight drift, slowing things a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Dreyer had fought off cramps that began in his
calves and began working their way up his leg. They were relieved
with magnesium, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lake couldn't be any flatter than it is now, the skies are
clear,'' Johnson said Sunday afternoon. ''Lake Erie is going to be
a piece of cake for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:55 p.m. Sunday, Dreyer continued to make slow progress
through the cross-current and was about four miles from shore, his
Web site said. It said he was expected to reach land early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer had hoped to begin the estimated 15-hour swim Friday but
had it pushed back two days, given strong winds then. On Sunday,
Johnson called the water and weather ''very favorable,'' with waves
a bit choppy at first but calmer the farther Dreyer ventured from
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting what we wanted,'' Johnson said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   His 195.8-mile journey, which he expects to take between 50 to
60 hours, will take him from near Erie to downtown Toronto. Each
segment of what he calls the ''ultimate triathlon'' will be
completed without stopping any longer than necessary to prepare for
the next segment.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Dreyer became the first person to swim a direct
crossing of Lake Michigan. Last September, he pared more than seven
hours off the record for the fastest swim across Lake Huron.
</P>
<P>
   All of his athletic stunts have been to raise money for, and
public awareness of, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America,
representatives of which bid him farewell Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Larkin's Reject Astonishes Mets  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Disappointment turned to astonishment for the New
York Mets, who were spurned in their attempt to acquire Barry
Larkin -- then learned later that he signed a three-year contract
extension with Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips wouldn't go as far as say he
felt used in the whole situation, but he did take a shot Sunday
night at his Reds counterpart, Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have expected the courtesy of a phone call to at least
say, 'Hey, this is what happened,''' said Phillips, who got details
of the contract from Larkin's agent, Eric Goldschmidt.
</P>
<P>
   The injury-plagued Mets, trailing Atlanta by six games in the NL
East after losing 1-0 Sunday, worked out a trade to acquire Larkin
after Bowden said the Reds wouldn't meet the All-Star shortstop's
contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   But Larkin, who becomes a free agent at the end of the season,
rejected the trade late Saturday after New York balked at a
three-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, Larkin had agreed to a three-year, $27 million
extension with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we helped Barry Larkin get a new contract,'' Phillips
said. ''I need to call Goldschmidt back and see what kind of fee I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to the Braves, the Mets tried to downplay the
surreal turn of events with Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he got what he wanted,'' said reliever John Franco,
who played with Larkin in Cincinnati. ''I'm disappointed, but you
can understand his view. He wanted to stay home and finish his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine added, ''That what it was all about --
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The player most affected by Larkin's decision was Melvin Mora,
who took over as the Mets shortstop when Rey Ordonez was lost for
the year with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I can help at other positions,'' said Mora, who also
has started at second, third and the outfield this season. ''I'm a
big part of this team. It won't bother me if they bring in another
shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora said the only drawback to going through two days of
back-and-forth negotiations was the uneasiness in the clubhouse
over the Mets' end of the deal. Phillips never disclosed the
players New York agreed to give up, but it was thought to be a
package of minor league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were saying, 'Oh, who's going to be traded? Who are the
guys who are going to leave?''' Mora said. ''We didn't know. Maybe
it was me who was going to Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Lenny Harris, who played with Larkin in
Cincinnati, said he hasn't had a chance to talk with his close
friend about his reasons for turning down the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll probably say, 'Hey, I was looking for security for my
wife and kids. I wanted to be a Met, but not a temporary Met,'''
Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, who sat out the weekend
series against the Braves with a sore hip, doesn't expect the Mets
to suffer a letdown now that the trade has fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team here is going through many things,'' said Alfonzo,
one of three New York infielders who are injured. ''It would have
been great to have a guy like Larkin. But everything works out for
a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the team figures to improve when Alfonzo and third
baseman Robin Ventura -- on the DL with a bruised rotator cuff --
return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been a pretty good team so far,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the Mets were working on other deals, with
pitching considered a top priority as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This door has closed, but sometimes that has a way of opening
up another door,'' he said. ''We're talking to some teams about
some pretty significant players.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he did everything he could to convince Larkin to
at least spend the rest of this season with the Mets. The GM
offered a 10-day window after the World Series in which he could
discuss a contract extension with Larkin or pay him a bonus for
agreeing to the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also wanted to take the extraordinary step of flying a
group of players, coaches, officials and Valentine to Cincinnati to
meet with Larkin. But the Reds player rejected that idea, saying he
''didn't need that sort of attention or recognition,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pushed all the buttons we could push,'' the GM said. ''We
were not allowed to get close enough to exert any peer pressure.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- In an ominous sign for PC vendors, U.S. sales of

customers debate whether to upgrade and consumers ponder the need for expensive
replacements. While quarterly data from research firms Dataquest and IDC

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Denny Neagle was dominant again in his second start with the
Yankees, pitching a four-hitter for his 100th career victory, 5-1 over the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays on Sunday. Neagle won his fifth straight start overall, including
his final three with the Cincinnati Reds before being traded to the Yankees on
July 12. He struck out eight and walked one in his first complete game since
Aug. 16, 1998, against Los Angeles with Atlanta.

<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez silenced the powerful Chicago White Sox Sunday,
striking out 15 and allowing six hits to lead the Boston Red Sox to a 1-0
Victory. The performance followed an unusual stretch in which he was winless in
four consecutive starts and didn't pitch in the All-Star game because of a
strained side muscle that put him on the disabled list.

<HEADLINE> Colombians Bid for Peace in Geneva  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- After 36 years of rebellion, moves toward peace in
Colombia have been slow. But negotiators are back in Europe for a
new try at ending Latin America's longest-running war.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Colombia's second-largest rebel movement, the
National Liberation Army, are joining government officials and
dozens of Colombian civic and religious leaders in two days of
talks beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate goal of the meeting in a Geneva hotel is to work
out details of a plan to create a troop-free enclave for the
rebels, known by their Spanish initials ELN.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas want to host a national peace convention in the
proposed zone, a region rich in oil, gold and cocaine in northern
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The idea follows Colombian President Andres Pastrana's November
1998 removal of all government troops from a large southern
ranching region now administered by Colombia's larger insurgent
group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with the FARC since then have moved very slowly. The
FARC allegedly is using its area to rustle cattle, forcibly recruit
teen-age fighters and become more deeply involved in the lucrative
cocaine trade.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999 Pastrana rejected the ELN's request for its own
demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   But in April of this year, Pastrana gave the plan his tentative
approval even though he faces stiff opposition from conservatives,
including rightist paramilitary groups and northern residents who
fear having to live under rebel rule.
</P>
<P>
   The idea would be to turn greater San Pablo and two neighboring
counties along the Magdalena River, Colombia's main waterway, into
a guerrilla safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has pledged tighter controls than in the south,
including international observers and naval patrols on the river.
</P>
<P>
   When the ELN joined in four days of secret peace meetings in
Germany two years ago, the negotiations with civic leaders in a
Roman Catholic cloister in Bavaria fell short of arranging direct
talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN said it would keep seeking talks with the government
while continuing negotiations with civic leaders, but the process
was interrupted by rebel bombings and mass kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-member ELN was formed in the 1960s by disgruntled
peasants, leftist priests and radical students. It trained in Cuba.
Nearly wiped out in the 1970s, it rebounded with the help of
millions of dollars from kidnappings and blackmail of foreign oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The government let two ELN leaders -- Francisco Galan and Felipe
Torres -- out of jail to participate in the peace talks. They must
return to jail in Medellin immediately afterward. The two, who were
convicted of sedition, terrorism and kidnapping, were also briefly
released for the talks in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Taipei Emerging From Ugliness  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- With its drab tile floors and cheap
plastic seats, the arrival hall of Taipei's airport looks more like
a bus depot in a developing country -- not the entry point to one of
Asia's most robust economies.
</P>
<P>
   More ugliness greets visitors as they finish their 50-minute
airport cab ride and pull into Taipei. Rust-stained shop signs
crawl up the facades of low-rise concrete office buildings
discolored by smog, while apartment blocks are covered with tacky
colored tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The depressing scenes would seem more fitting for one of
Taiwan's struggling neighbors, such as the Philippines or Vietnam --
not for a bustling island with the world's third-highest foreign
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   How did Taipei get this way?
</P>
<P>
   The drabness of Taiwan's capital can be explained partly by one
of the great oddities of Taiwanese history: For most of the past 50
years, Taiwan was ruled by a political party that didn't want to be
here.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nationalist Party lost China to the communists in 1949,
they fled to Taiwan and planned to use the island as a temporary
base to rearm before fighting their way back to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody thought they were going to stay forever. When you don't
consider a place your home, you don't build anything permanent or
beautiful,'' said Lung Ying-tai, a writer and director of Taipei's
cultural bureau who has lived in Europe and the United States for
21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, one of the landmark structures in Taipei is the
massive blue-tiled roof Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a white
marble monument to the late president who moved the Nationalist
government to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Nationalists, who were voted out of the
presidency last spring, had more pressing matters than spending
money to create a beautiful Taipei whose streets would rival the
boulevards of Paris or Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The government had to worry about housing a total 2 million
soldiers and refugees who fled with them. Apartment blocks made of
cheap concrete or red brick were part of the solution, and that
helped set the standards for Taipei's dull architectural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a constant threat of a communist invasion, the
Nationalists had to spend heavily on defense at the expense of
fancy public works projects. Building up the economy was also a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nationalists are widely blamed for tolerating corruption
and cronyism that sapped Taiwan's creative energy and drained funds
for public projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nationalists controlled the entire creative process
because it was profitable,'' said Lee Wei-min, a Harvard-educated
urban planner who had difficulty breaking into the business
dominated by old-school Nationalist planners.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got back I realized I couldn't even design a street. I
realized I could only practice as an architect or designer, but not
an urban planner,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee said most of the interesting architecture is being built
in small, private places because Taipei wasn't planned to be a
sprawling metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taipei was meant to be a small, functional city in a remote
province of China,'' said Lee, sitting in his spare studio he
designed using steel, glass and stone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Taipei's architectural wonders are hidden in its
labyrinthine of back streets. It's easy to stumble upon cafes and
restaurants designed with granite floors, or wood and glass panels
lit by soft halogen lamps, surrounded by manicured shrubs and
potted plants.
</P>
<P>
   Interior designer Fay Lin believes Taipei is only beginning to
emerge with confidence to create a unique image and individuality
that would eschew the previous designs of slapdash neon lights, and
shoebox apartments with aluminum cages covering their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Lin says many of Taiwan's younger entrepreneurs who had cashed
in on the dot.com frenzy have asked her to design their offices
with custom-made furniture and lighting ''that nobody else in the
world had.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Until five years ago, everything had to be functional. Period.
Now people realize money means a quality of life,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   The government is also waking up to this. In recent years, it
has built grassy public parks, renovated the trendy Hsimenting
shopping district and finished constructing a subway system with
sleek stations decorated with modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Even the airport is getting spiffed up. On July 28, a second
terminal opens, featuring a bright, airy arrival hall with padded
chairs, plants and carpeted resting areas.

<HEADLINE> Lazio on the Senate Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATFIELD, N.Y. (AP) -- It's a gorgeous July morning in western
New York, perfect for cutting hay or milking cows. Instead, two
dozen farmers are outside a barn listening to U.S. Senate candidate
Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   As he's done at many stops, Lazio introduces his wife, Patricia,
and their two daughters, then scans the crowd for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're having the ball of their lives,'' Lazio says of Molly,
8, and Kelsey, 6. ''They got to milk a little calf, and of course
their week is made now with that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Milk a calf? Not on any farm around here, murmur the farmers
gathered on a field in this aptly named farm town near Niagara
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   During much of his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the
42-year-old Lazio's family has traveled with him. It's a strategy
that keeps Lazio from missing the comforts of home while boosting
him politically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do feel like I'm home when I'm here,'' Lazio tells
the farmers, unaware of the calf-gaffe. ''And I want you to know
how grateful I am for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the four-term congressman and his family offers a
stark contrast to the Clintons, whose marriage woes are
well-chronicled. The Clinton campaign took a stab at countering the
image in late June when Chelsea Clinton showed up at her mother's
side at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton made it clear that her college-age daughter
would not be a fixture on the campaign trail. ''She's going to be
coming and going as she chooses,'' Clinton said. ''You'll be seeing
her sometimes, which will be a delight for me, and that's all I can
tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea hasn't been seen since on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for the Lazios.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lazio, who met her husband while studying to be a
nurse, even appears in the campaign's latest television commercial,
boosting her husband's stands on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been busy,'' she conceded during a Buffalo Bisons
double-header. It was near the end of a weeklong bus tour that
included three Fourth of July parades and visits to factories,
hospitals and village squares.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit reluctant about bringing the girls, but
they've been having such a great time,'' she said. ''And it's so
nice that we've gotten to spend some time together.''
</P>
<P>
   While many newspapers were running stories about Clinton's own
recent bus tour, the reports were played alongside pictures of a
doting Rick Lazio painting his daughter's fingernails or helping
them feed a newborn calf.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a hometown guy, he's a real person,'' said Mary Donahue,
a court clerk who attended a recent Lazio rally in Schenectady.
''Like he said, he pumps gas, he goes to the grocery store like
everybody else. ... He's winning me over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey and Molly have become favorites of photographers who
can't get enough of the sisters -- hanging out of the ''Mainstream
Express'' bus distributing Lazio hats, T-shirts and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vote for my dad, he's great,'' the little Lazios bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio girls have grown up in a political atmosphere, joining
their dad during congressional campaigns on Long Island. But the
Senate race has taken them farther afield in one of the most
closely watched elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them,'' their mother
said as the pair ran to watch the antics of the Bisons' mascot.
''Just the things they've seen that they could never otherwise see
doing something like this. And the exposure and the experience has
been really fun.''

<HEADLINE> History Foggy at Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The midnight fog wreathed the oaks and
maples at Camp David last week, turning headlights to silvery
shimmers in the dense woods with only token power to cut through
the mist.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to see at first that history was being given a
second chance.
</P>
<P>
   After nine days of impasse, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had just determined that the
price of failing to reach a comprehensive Middle East peace
agreement was too high to pay without greater effort to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton boarded Air Force One at dawn Thursday,
to ponder the demands of world economics at a summit in Japan,
Barak and Arafat slogged on alone in the mountainside refuge whose
name has become entwined with hope that peace can trump fear and
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Camp David has been an emblem of odds-on struggle since Sept.
17, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   That's when President Carter guided Israel's Menachem Begin and
Egypt's Anwar Sadat to a last-minute agreement after talks that
lasted just a day short of two weeks and seemed predestined to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's fog made Camp David seem remote from the world.
That's exactly what Franklin Roosevelt had in mind in 1942 when he
named the place Shangri-La and began to use it as a sanctuary less
than two hours' drive from the pressures of wartime Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had made James Hilton's 1933 novel, ''Lost Horizons,''
a best seller, then a popular movie. Thus, they knew ''Shangri-La''
as a mountainous Asian eden ''where all the fret of existence had
ebbed away.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, reporters wanted to know where the U.S. warplanes that
raided Tokyo had flown from. ''From our secret base in
Shangri-La,'' Roosevelt replied.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Nelson, a former Associated Press White House correspondent
and author of the 1995 history, ''The President is at Camp David,''
gives the postscript:
</P>
<P>
   ''The reporters did not know that on the very next day,
Roosevelt would be driven 60 miles north into the Catoctin
Mountains of Maryland to choose a site for a presidential weekend
retreat from the 'fret of exist existence' of the wartime capital.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt Shangri-La, a 143-acre rough-and-ready camp rather
hidden in the trees, has always offered presidents that sense of
escape and worry-free repose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I leave my troubles outside the gate,'' Lady Bird Johnson once
said.
</P>
<P>
   But from its earliest days Camp David has been more than just a
retreat from the world. The world's leaders have long had it on
their maps.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the trail blazer.
Relaxing with Roosevelt, he puffed cigar smoke at mosquitoes and
helped the president lay the policy groundwork for the Normandy
invasion. They conferred in Roosevelt's cabin called The Bear's
Den. Since Dwight Eisenhower's time the place has been made far
more luxurious and renamed ''Aspen.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower, in a renaming mood, found Shangri-La too fanciful
and called the place Camp David instead, giving a nod to his father
and 5-year-old grandson, Davids both.
</P>
<P>
   The name would stick.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Roosevelt's day it was a hide-out with little hot water and
with brush growing to the windowsills,'' Nelson writes. Harry
Truman had the brush cleared and Eisenhower built a putting green
in the clearing; Nixon added a heated swimming pool. Nelson
summarizes, ''Presidents and their families persisted in calling it
rustic. Others called its trappings luxurious, even princely.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a small pool of reporters, summoned to Laurel Cabin
to hear Clinton read a statement, got a rare glimpse inside the
security fences.
</P>
<P>
   A boardroom table the size of a sailboat nearly filled a meeting
room at Laurel Lodge. A large, wooden Camp David seal and antique
maps of the region hung on the paneled walls. Two maps included
nearby Gettysburg, Pa., and Sharpsburg, Md., sites of two Civil War
battlefields used by several presidents to show visitors the
enormous human cost of war.
</P>
<P>
   It's the negotiating session, not George Bush's horseshoe pit,
that gives Camp David its place in modern history. And it was Jimmy
Carter, mule-stubborn and untiring, who made the name Camp David
synonymous with a negotiating marathon that blooms only when all
hope for success has been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had reserved just three days in September 1978 for the
meetings with Begin and Sadat. He kept his calendar clear for four
extra days in case they were needed. They were.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Carter was to write, it took ''thirteen intense and
discouraging days, with success in prospect only during the final
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton would agree that the days of Camp David II also
were ''intense and discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   And the power to predict the outcome was as imperfect as the
ability of headlights to pierce a foggy night in Maryland's western
mountains.

<HEADLINE> Tiger, Lance Take Europe by Storm  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY SCHWARTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sports stars shined in a rare alignment on one historic day.
</P>
<P>
   The world's top cycling competition is starting to look like the
Tour de Lance, as Lance Armstrong title defense in the 2,250-mile
race was conceded days before Sunday's finish in Paris. Hours later
across the English Channel, Tiger Woods dominated a British Open
field so badly that the future of golf may now be for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Their mastery of the Tour de France and the British Open left
adversaries and fans of these American stars reaching for
superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really human what he does,'' said Corbett Wood, a
mountain bicyclist in Armstrong's hometown of Austin, Texas.
Armstrong won his second consecutive Tour, beating second-place
finisher Jan Ullrich by 6 minutes, 2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the chosen one. He's the best player who has played the
game right now,'' golfer Mark Calcavecchia said after Woods became
the youngest golfer ever to win golf's career grand slam, and only
the fifth in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Supernatural,'' five-time Open winner Tom Watson added of
Wood's victory at St. Andrews' Old Course in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Woods shot a 269, 19 under par and eight shots ahead of his
nearest competitor. That's the best score against par in the
history of the major events, and the largest margin of victory at
the British Open since 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, he made a mockery of the U.S. Open, winning by
15 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's victory was special. Woods -- the untraditional
golfer, son of a black man and a Thai woman -- has a deep
appreciation of golf's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the home of golf,'' he said. ''This is where you
always want to win. To have a chance to complete the slam at St.
Andrews is pretty special. I was able to bring it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Americans have won the British Open before. Twenty
American golfers have won it 33 times in the 127 years the event
has been played. The first, Walter Hagen, won it four times in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The '20s are often called the golden age of sports, the time of
Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey, Bill Tilden and Red Grange. Bobby Jones
was the golfer of that age. In 1930, he won all four events of what
was then the grand slam -- the U.S. and British Opens, the U.S. and
British Amateurs -- and then retired.
</P>
<P>
   But a case could be made that we are in another golden age. We
have seen Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky, Tiger Woods and ...
well, Lance Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   His sport is not considered a sport at all in his home country,
but a way to get to the grocery store. No American even placed in
the world's greatest bicycling event, the Tour de France, until
1984, when Greg LeMond took third. LeMond won the Tour in 1986,
1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A giant? No, says Armstrong. ''I'm not a superstar, I'm a
regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A regular guy who overcame testicular cancer that had spread to
his lungs and brain, and then battled to win the 1999 Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still my biggest ambition, the fight against cancer,''
Armstrong said Sunday. ''It's nice to win the Tour de France, and
to win it a second time, but this is something that will be going
on when I'm 50.''
</P>
<P>
   There were naysayers who pointed out that the 1997 champion,
Ullrich, and the 1998 champion, Marco Pantani, did not compete in
1999. This year, they did. And he beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armstrong is a worthy champion. He was the strongest man, and
he met our every attack. He earned his victory,'' Ullrich said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Woods have met -- they're both under contract to
Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the ... sporting superstars that I've met,'' Armstrong
said, ''I can honestly say that he was the most excited to meet
Lance Armstrong. It was strange. I mean I met all of them, and he
was genuinely excited, and that surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Armstrong doesn't think of himself as an immortal, not
like Woods. ''Perhaps it's his sport but he's much more consistent
than I have been or that a cyclist can possibly be,'' he said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''But clearly he's the best golfer in the world. Nobody would
argue that. And I don't know that by winning the Tour de France you
can say that you're the best cyclist in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He will have an opportunity to prove just that in September, at
the Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is just 24, with a long career ahead. Perhaps he will
contest Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 victories in major events. Or
perhaps he will be the first to win all four modern grand slam
events -- the two Opens, the Masters and the PGA Championship -- in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are, he and Armstrong will never again share the
spotlight, as they did on two sides of the English Channel on a
historic July day.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan King Imposes New Rule  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- In just a year on the throne, King
Mohammed VI has imposed his authority in Morocco even while taking
the first steps toward liberalization after the 38-year rule of his
late father Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
   Financial compensation for victims of torture, an easing of
censorship in print media, the return of political exiles banned by
the former government, and a ''new concept of authority'' based on
the respect of the law are among the young king's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Daunting challenges, however, remain for the 36-year-old
monarch, who took power after his father's July 23, 1999, death.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between rich and poor continues to widen in this North
African country of 30 million people, where unemployment stands at
20 percent. Economic growth is stagnant and drought is a major
problem for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The king has provided crucial momentum, but his government is
not following,'' said Abraham Serfaty, a former opponent of Hassan
II who returned to his homeland with the personal authorization of
Mohammed VI in September after eight years in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rhythm of change is inadequate,'' Serfaty said. ''People
can wait but they can't wait indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Bank, poverty has risen 50 percent in the
last 10 years, and the number of Moroccans considered poor is now
one in five. The bank says the unemployment rate could reach 30
percent by 2010 in the absence of important economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and unemployment are driving thousands of young
Moroccans to attempt to cross the treacherous Straits of Gibraltar
in an effort to reach Spain in hopes of finding work.
</P>
<P>
   Since ascending to the throne, Mohammed VI, dubbed ''king of the
poor'' by Moroccan media, has extended his hand to the
disadvantaged and forgotten, leading efforts to increase solidarity
among his countrymen and making donations to charitable
organizations and orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed VI also has reached out to the underdeveloped Rif
region of northern Morocco, where his father refused to travel
following an uprising against royal power in 1958. The king is
spending increasing amounts of time in Tangiers, the capital of the
Rif.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has wooed the nation with high-profile campaigns on
behalf of the poor, Mohammed VI is discreet, almost secretive. He
makes key decisions in consultation with a select group of young
advisers, many of whom attended the royal college with him.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in the capital Rabat say the king is trying to
tackle difficult social issues in order to prevent a rise in the
country's growing Islamic movement, which seeks a strict
interpretation of the Quran.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants, who are represented in parliament and have
strong bases in universities and poor neighborhoods, have
multiplied efforts in favor of the poor, sponsoring literacy
campaigns and distributing food and medicine to the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic militants haven't directly challenged the king, but
they have increased opposition activities. Thousands of them have
flooded the beaches this summer urging people to attend daily
prayer at mosques.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic movement has yet to reveal its strategy for
legislative elections scheduled for 2002, but some democrats fear a
sweep by Islamic candidates if the government doesn't accelerate
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, the king has followed in his father's
footsteps, maintaining alliances with the United States and France
and seeking to remain a force of reconciliation in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Western Sahara, the territory claimed by both
Morocco and the Polisario rebels, remains deadlocked. Plans for
creating a Maghreb union among Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are
also at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Recent promising indications of important oil reserves on the
Moroccan-Algerian border also has complicated relations with
Morocco's eastern neighbor, but could provide greater economic

<HEADLINE> Voting in Ivory Coast Extended  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- The ruling junta has extended the
voting for a new constitution that tests its resolve to return the
nation to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Organizational problems marred Sunday's vote by Ivory Coast
residents, and the junta announced on state-run radio that voting
would continue Monday at stations where voters were unable to cast
their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Voting irregularities included late openings at some polling
stations, insufficient voting materials and election officials who
failed to turn up. Some of the country's 4.8 million registered
voters were kept waiting for their voting cards, and there were
also scattered accusations of voting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, which will play a major role in deciding who
could be the next president, comes at a critical juncture for Ivory
Coast. Once among Africa's most stable nations, the country faces
increasing military unrest, a battered economy and fears that
things could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters in Abidjan, the referendum appeared to be a vote
on Ivory Coast's willingness to remain a haven for immigrants, many
of them from poverty-wracked states to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are victims of that hospitality now,'' said Dominique
Agnero, 41, a civil servant. ''The foreigners should get in an
airplane and call us by phone. We don't want to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivory Coast has some 19 million residents, about 40 percent of
them immigrants who came here when the country was the region's
economic powerhouse. But in recent years, as prices for the
country's main exports, cocoa and coffee, have plummeted, the
economy has stumbled and its hospitality has turned to a simmering
xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Many see the referendum as a junta plan to exclude the country's
main opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, from the Sept.
17 presidential elections, because a last-minute amendment to the
draft constitution stipulates that both parents of presidential
candidates must be ''of Ivorian origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara, a former top official with the International Monetary
Fund, has encouraged his followers to vote ''yes,'' insisting both
his parents were Ivorian. Yet some Ouattara supporters feared their
leader would be excluded and said they would vote against the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara was at the center of controversy over similar
eligibility conditions under former President Henri Konan Bedie,
who was ousted in a Christmas Eve coup that brought junta leader
Gen. Robert Guei to power.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie claimed Ouattara was not eligible for the presidency
because he said Ouattara's parents were from neighboring Burkina
Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's ethnically divisive policies were a major reason Guei
gave for his takeover. Now many Ivorians see Guei's constitutional
modifications as fueling the divisions again.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing a backlash, the government announced the
state of emergency last week, with Guei accusing opponents of
''maneuvering in the shadows'' to organize a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Guei, a former army chief, is widely believed to be planning to
run in the Sept. 17 elections, though he has not revealed his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular among Ivorians,
who had grown tired of the Bedie regime's corruption and ethnic
favoritism, many have since become disillusioned.

   GENEVA (AP) -- After 36 years of rebellion, moves toward peace in Colombia
have been slow. But negotiators are back in Europe for a new try at ending Latin
America's longest-running war. Leaders of Colombia's second-largest rebel
movement, the National Liberation Army, are joining government officials and
dozens of Colombian civic and religious leaders in two days of talks beginning
Monday. The immediate goal of the meeting in a Geneva hotel is to work out
details of a plan to create a troop-free enclave for the rebels, known by their

<P>
	   OTISVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A 35-year-old inmate remains at large
after walking away from prison work detail at the Otisville Federal
Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Gray-Santana was serving time for drug possession. No
description of the escaped man was available.
</P>
<P>
   State Police were on the lookout for the fugitive, as were U.S.
marshals. Gray-Santana was noticed missing at about 3:45 p.m.
Saturday, said prison spokesman Paul Ott.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently was working on the prison campus when he fled. Ott
said Gray-Santana is not dangerous, and residents should not be
concerned about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Santana seems to have simply walked away from the
minimum-security prison. He was a resident of the prison's
satellite camp, an annex next to the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of Gray-Santana's escape remained under
investigation last night. To live in the satellite camp, inmates
must have no history of violence or escape.
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Santana has no prior escapes or attempts, prison officials
said. He had been in Otisville for about two years. He has seven
years remaining on his sentence.

   Otisville Federal Correctional Facility is a minimum-security

<HEADLINE> Clinton Returns to Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Plunging into talks immediately upon
returning to Camp David, President Clinton is weighing whether
there was potential for a peace accord to be struck at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived back at the presidential retreat Sunday evening
after a quick four-day trip to Japan for an economic summit. After
a briefing by his own team, he went into separate talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of those talks, the president would decide whether
it was worthwhile to continue, the spokesman indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect meetings into the night,'' Boucher said late Sunday.
''A lot depends on his meetings and how he wants to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As the contentious talks hit the two-week mark -- Monday was the
14th day -- the main point of dispute remained Jerusalem, the holy
city claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians as a capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball is in the Israeli court,'' said Hassan Abdel Rahman,
Washington envoy of the Palestine Liberation Organization and a
frequent spokesman during the talks. ''Will they do what is needed
to reach an agreement? Or will they stick to their unacceptable
positions?''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli spokesman Gadi Baltiansky suggested it was the
Palestinians who would need to make concessions to move matters
forward. With Clinton's return, he said, ''We will try to see if
there are grounds for continuing this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. officials declared prematurely that the summit
had ended without an agreement. In view of that, Boucher said,
''one hesitates to make any kind of prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no formal deadline for wrapping up the talks, the
spokesman said the U.S. mediation effort could not continue
indefinitely. ''We are not here for an unlimited period of time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American mediators have declined to discuss the substance of
the peace talks, but Boucher said the tenor of negotiations --
centering on the status of Jerusalem, the fate of several million
Palestinian refugees and the borders of a future Palestinian state
-- had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It continues to be very hard, and we continue to try to move
forward,'' Boucher said. ''We might reach a deal; we might not.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to comment on Vatican proposals for a special
international status for Jerusalem's holy sites. Pope John Paul II
said Sunday that only world oversight could safeguard the rights of
Christian, Jewish and Muslim worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that Jerusalem is special -- the great faiths of the
world have holy sites in it, and take a lot of interest in it,''
Boucher said. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talks on secondary issues that Israeli and
Palestinian teams had held at nearby Emmitsburg, Md., had gone as
far as they could, Boucher said. Those negotiations had focused on
side issues including water and civil administration.
</P>
<P>
   On another subject, an Israeli official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, denied reports that the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard,
a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst imprisoned for spying for Israel,
was among issues on the table at Camp David. Israel has long
pressed for Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher refused comment on whether Pollard's case had been
brought up in the talks, saying he could not answer questions
dealing with ''what might or might not be discussed up there.''

<HEADLINE> G-8 Summit Called a Disappointment  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH COLEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAGO, Okinawa (AP) -- It was the highest-profile summit of the
year, with the leaders of the world's richest and most powerful
nations tackling the globe's most pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end, many critics saw only one thing in the Group of
Eight summits of wealthy nations and Russia: disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The output ... has become less and less useful over time,''
said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conference on the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Like other recent G-8 summits, the meetings that ended Sunday
produced a lengthy document that addressed just about every
conceivable issue, from the economy to cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Important commitments were made. The leaders pledged to help
poor countries reduce their debts and improve their schooling,
health care and computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   They also urged the World Trade Organization to hold another
round of talks this year, despite the violent protests at last
year's gathering in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the approach was clearly scattershot. No one issue was dealt
with comprehensively, there were no breakthroughs, and there was
little real money behind the grand initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leaders rebuffed criticism that the summit failed to
provide a road map for concrete action. French President Jacques
Chirac, for example, argued the meetings are still valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most certain way to ensure that things don't progress is
to not talk ... for everyone to remain in their corner,'' he told
reporters Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The declining role of the summits was especially apparent this
year, when President Clinton arrived a day late, and left hours
early to lead more critical Mideast peace talks at Camp David in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the summit wasn't always such a secondary event.
</P>
<P>
   In the group's early years in the 1970s, for example, the
gatherings were more informal, without the intense bureaucratic
flurry and the rambling, precooked statements that characterize
current meetings, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Schott, a negotiator in the 1973-79 Tokyo Round of the GATT, the
precursor of the World Trade Organization, said the 1978 summit
provided real advances in global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the decline are many.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that as the meetings have become more
high-profile, they have become increasingly orchestrated events,
with little left to bargaining between heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   And the heap of issues on the G-8's plate has also expanded.
While the original group was aimed at economic issues, the meetings
in Okinawa focused on such security concerns as the proposed U.S.
missile defense shield and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''A failure of strong leadership from the heads of government
... means the results are almost inevitably these long laundry
lists of marginal things,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the
Institute for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Russia -- a key political player but a marginal
economic power -- has furthered this trend by bringing in a member
that does not participate fully in the economic discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the world is no longer the place it was in the
1970s. The rise of Asia in the global economy, for example, has
challenged the overwhelming European presence at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 also has had problems following up effectively on the
important advances it does make. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
criticized the group for failing to make progress on a pledge last
year to provide debt relief to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the annual summits have become annual lost
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say leaders should make more of their chance to make the
kinds of tough bargains and agreements that lower-level bureaucrats
don't have the authority to make.
</P>
<P>
   One key step to giving the future summits could be to limit the
scope of the meeting so summiteers could concentrate -- and provide
some breakthroughs -- on the most important issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten, for example, proposes a more manageable G-3 -- the
United States, the European Union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd be much more effective,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Schools Using Wireless Microphones  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Lizette Adkisson started teaching three
years ago, she had to raise her voice over the sound of the
ventilation system and fidgeting fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the help of wireless microphones, Adkisson is sure the
students hear her and believes they are grasping the concepts
better.
</P>
<P>
   The microphones are installed in all 44 classrooms at Fenton
Charter School and at least 300 schools across California.
Increasingly, their use is national, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to strain my voice anymore,'' Adkisson said. ''I
just speak in a normal tone and it grabs their attention. And I
don't have to repeat myself as much.''
</P>
<P>
   The microphones -- which include lapel, collar, hand-held and
headsets -- are being used in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New
York, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though students have gone for decades without microphones,
experts say the world is much noisier now. Ventilation systems,
lawn mowers, street traffic, and overcrowded schools are just some
things that have contributed to noisier classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers are blowing their voices out. They didn't do that
years ago,'' said Brian Van Waay, president of TeachLogic, the
company that installed Fenton's systems. ''But now, they have to
talk over all this noise.''
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, at least 30 percent of elementary children in
regular classes have some degree of hearing impairment because of
middle ear infections, said Ken Ullrich, a clinical audiologist in
Wenatchee, Wash. In special education classes, it goes up to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's long overdue,'' Ullrich said. ''I know that classroom
amplification will do for children's listening and learning what
classroom lighting did for children's seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   On one recent afternoon, Adkisson slipped the set over her head,
bringing the small microphone inches in front of her mouth. She
neatly tucked the black transmitter box in her dress pocket. Her
voice was amplified about 15 decibels through a rectangular-shaped
speaker hanging in the center of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she gives directions, I don't have to walk up there and
ask again,'' said one of her students, Reymond Maldonado, 9. ''And,
I don't have to scoot up in my chair to try to hear her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkisson and many other Fenton teachers often allow their
students to use the microphone when reading or asking questions
during class, a practice that has proved popular.
</P>
<P>
   ''It encourages participation and gives them confidence,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be evidence backing the anecdotal claims of
better grades, behavior and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the government funded a project that studied the
effects of louder teacher voices on performances of students in
grade school.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year study, scores of students in younger
grades increased in listening, language and word analysis when
teachers used microphones. Other amplified classrooms showed better
scores on math concepts and computation.
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies have also indicated improvements in speech
recognition, reading comprehension and learning behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone systems range in price from $700 to $1,400,
depending on style and accessories. Newer systems, which use
infrared lights or sensors to transmit sound rather than FM radio
technology, can run up to $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Rukeyser, coordinator of Learning in the Real World,
a Woodland, Calif.-based group often critical of ballooning school
spending, said officials should be careful when choosing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real strength of education still lies in person-to-person
contact,'' he said. ''If people think that technology is going to
replace it, they may be headed down the wrong path. If they believe
it will enhance it, then they may be going in the right
direction.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Adds 18 Russian Fighter Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Despite threatened cuts in anti-narcotics aid
from the United States, President Alberto Fujimori said Peru will
carry on the fight against drug trafficking with its fleet of
Russian-made fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   At an anniversary ceremony for Peru's air force Sunday, Fujimori
announced that 18 Sukhoi-25 tactical fighter jets purchased for the
country's now-ended border conflict with Ecuador would be used for
anti-narcotics efforts. Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if it is only with our own resources, Peru will be a
barrier to narcotics trafficking,'' Fujimori said. ''Peru's
struggle against narcotics trafficking will not be halted.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States acknowledges Fujimori as one of its most
effective regional partners in the fight against narcotics. But
Congress last month held back $42 million of emergency
anti-narcotics and development aid and threatened to cut back
millions more following Fujimori's win of a third term as president
in a May 28 election tainted by irregularities and fraud
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Said Sanguine on VP Chances  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has told
business associates there is a good chance he will get the job as
George W. Bush's running mate, but Bush aides caution that the
likely Republican presidential nominee could still make ''a
surprise pick.''
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP nominating convention in Philadelphia opening in a
week, Texas Gov. Bush expects to announce his decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri and perhaps others
are on Bush's short list, said highly placed Republican officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In seclusion at his Texas ranch, Bush tentatively planned to
introduce his running mate Tuesday. Even his closest advisers said
Sunday they did not know if he had made his choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's silence on a day he had promised to decide prompted aides
to caution that he could make a surprise pick. ''Nobody has a lock
on the job,'' said a senior GOP official, but Cheney was the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned as possible candidates include Govs. Frank
Keating of Oklahoma, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of
New York; Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and Sens. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska and Bill Frist and Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But signs continued to point toward Cheney, who had led Bush's
vice presidential search team and is a former Wyoming congressman,
White House chief of staff under former President Ford and defense
secretary under Bush's father, former President Bush:
</P>
<P>
   --Cheney, now chief executive officer of Halliburton Co., an
energy and construction conglomerate, said there was a ''good
chance'' he would be tapped by Bush, according to an official close
to Cheney in Texas. The official said Cheney wanted to give the
company a ''heads up'' because he had previously assured it he
would not accept the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   --Seeking to reassure Bush --and perhaps potential voters -- Cheney
underwent a physical exam in recent days and received a clean bill
of health, said a GOP official familiar with the deliberations.
Cheney, 59, suffered three heart attacks by age 48, but has
reported no health problems since.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush's top two strategists, Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, fanned
out to the Sunday TV news shows, defending Cheney against questions
about his health and ties to the oil industry. They said, however,
they had no idea who would be Bush's pick.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he doesn't expect to be chosen and predicted that
Cheney will get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's Cheney. You know, with the registration change,
that's what I believe,'' Danforth told The Associated Press as he
headed into church in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cheney changed his voter registration from Texas to
Wyoming to avoid a constitutional hurdle if a party's presidential
and vice presidential nominees come from the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and Danforth both would bring a range of national
experience and stature lacking in the presumptive nominee. Both
also would appeal to Bush's conservative base without alienating
moderates, Republican operatives say. Danforth, unlike Cheney of
Wyoming, comes from a battleground state, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney left his suburban Washington home Sunday and said he was
heading to Dallas, where he also has a home, because ''that's where
my work is.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say whether he was referring to Dallas-based
Halliburton or his work on Bush's vice presidential search.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll have to ask somebody above my pay grade,'' Cheney said
when asked if he would be Bush's running mate as he and his wife,
Lynne, packed a black Isuzu Trooper with about 10 suitcases and
duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the surprise voter registration switch three days
after Bush met with Danforth in St. Louis. The timing suggests
Cheney's stock rose after the Texas governor had met and considered
the large pool of candidates reviewed under Cheney's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strategist Rove said Cheney's history of heart trouble
wouldn't be a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those heart attacks occurred in the '70s and '80s and he then
served as secretary of defense in President Bush's administration
and presided over Desert Storm,'' Rove said on CBS' ''Face the
Nation.'' ''I don't know of a more stressful situation than being
secretary of defense during an armed combat, and he seemed to do
just fine.''

<HEADLINE> Where Bush Goes, Evans Goes, Too  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- These days George W. Bush is governor of Texas
and the presidential hope of the Republican Party, a man surrounded
by security guards and a staff that executes his every order.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans can remember when Bush was just a bad house painter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turned on a little country and Western music and slopped
around the paint and got it a few places we shouldn't and my wife
would come in and scold us,'' Evans says with a chuckle, recalling
a scene from the 1970s at his home in Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Bush has been blessed with a lot of good
friends, but Evans may be the closest.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush left Harvard Business School in the 1970s and headed
for Midland to begin an oil career, he found Evans married to one
of his elementary school classmates and ready to pal around.
</P>
<P>
   In a story that has already become campaign legend, Bush used to
hang out with Evans while Evans' wife, Susan, washed bachelor
George's clothes and made him dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1975, when Bush last flew an airplane, a bouncy
trip that proved his one-time fighter pilot skills had faded, Evans
was with him, buckled into the copilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush quit drinking in 1986, it was after a night of
celebrating his 40th birthday with wife Laura and some close
friends -- including Evans.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bush won the Iowa caucuses, lost the New Hampshire
primary and then rebounded with a victory in South Carolina this
year en route to the Republican presidential nomination, Evans was
one of the few non-family members in the room to mark each moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Bush is poised to announce his running mate and present
himself as his party's standard-bearer at next week's Republican
National Convention, Evans remains at his side. He was at Bush's
ranch this weekend, as the candidate did his final ''long and
hard'' thinking about choosing a potential vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Evans began as Bush's chief fund-raiser, spearheading the drive
that raised the governor more than $90 million for his campaign --
double the previous record.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he was named campaign chairman, coordinating
interaction between the staff, the national party and convention
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ''Donnie'' or ''Evie,'' as friends call Evans, has a more
prominent role than any title can signify.
</P>
<P>
   He is the straight man to his hyperactive friend.
</P>
<P>
   He is a trusted adviser who knows Bush's every mood.
</P>
<P>
   He is a soothing presence at the end of a day on the road, the
kind of guy Bush can sit back with, talking baseball or puffing on
a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not easily excitable. He's smart. He's a successful
businessman,'' said Clay Johnson, Bush's gubernatorial chief of
staff and a friend since the governor's prep school days. ''Anybody
would welcome advice from a person like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like when Laura is around,'' the governor said during an
interview. ''I view him as somebody who knows me well, is not
afraid to give me his opinion, has my best interest at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Neill, a Texas businessman who with his wife, Jan,
introduced Bush to Laura, said: ''George's plans and ambitions and
dreams meshed perfectly with Don's abilities. ... He's very
organized and yet still very fun to be with. He's not some nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans was born in July 1946, as was Bush. A native of Houston,
he received a mechanical engineering degree from the University of
Texas in 1969 and a master's in business administration from the
school in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Today he heads Tom Brown Inc., an independent natural gas and
crude oil company based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush made his first foray into politics, an unsuccessful
run for Congress in 1978, Evans stepped up and raised the money. He
took on the same role when Bush ran for governor in 1994 and again
when Bush won re-election in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, less than a month in office, Bush appointed
Evans to a highly sought position in the state: the board of
regents at the University of Texas. In 1997, Evans' colleagues
voted him chairman, a position he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Evans has frequently followed Bush on the campaign
trail, talking up his friend to whomever will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell people he's somebody you can trust, he's an
extraordinary leader, he's got a lot of courage, but at the end of
the day, he's a real person. He doesn't take himself too
seriously,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush be elected president, Evans is not sure what he will
do. His wife and 11-year-old son, Donnie, live in Midland. His
eldest daughter resides with her family in College Station, Texas,
while a daughter with developmental problems, 23-year-old Jenny,
lives at an adult community in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been blessed with a tremendous family. I've been blessed
with great friends. I want to share that with others any way I can,
and I see my future as a future of trying to help other people. And
if it's a role in public service, so be it. And if it's not, that's
OK, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush knows that no matter where Evans is, their bond will remain
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be a friend whether he's in Washington or not,'' the
would-be president said. ''And he'll be a confidante, no matter
what his ZIP code is.''

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Students Return to Classes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The ruling military allowed the full
resumption of higher education after nearly 3&AMP;frac12; years, as nearly
60,000 university students entered classes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The country's hardline regime closed down colleges and
universities in December 1996 following student demonstrations.
Neither the closure nor the reopening of universities and colleges
were officially announced.
</P>
<P>
   First-, second- and third-year students in the arts and sciences
began classes Monday, following about 20,000 senior in those fields
who started courses June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Classes at institutions teaching medicine, computer science and
engineering were reopened in stages, beginning in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-democracy leaders and foreign human rights organizations
have cited the closing of schools as one of many human rights
abuses inflicted by the military on the population in Myanmar, also
known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Students are allowed to register at educational institutions
after signing a declaration that they will stay clear of political
activities.

<HEADLINE> Genesee Union boosts management buyout plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A labor agreement that may ease the way
for a management buyout of the struggling Genesee Brewing Co. has
been approved by union workers at the brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Teamsters Local 791 voted to support ''working with
the new management group,'' said union president Michael
Jarosinski, who declined to give specifics about the vote or the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is expected to make it easier for a team of
investors, led by Genesee Corp. chief executive Tom Hubbard, to buy
the company and keep the brewery operating in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters Local 791 represents 250 of the 450 workers at the
plant. The workers were voting on an agreement that called for some
cuts in wages and benefits, but that also kept the current pension
plan intact and would create a profit sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard has presented his buyout proposal to Genesee board
members - and having an agreement with the union makes the offer
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee produces 1.6 million barrels of beer and ale a year and
had revenues of $103.3 million in the 1998-99 fiscal year. Its
brands include a line of regional beers - Genesee Beer, Genny Light
and Genny Cream Ale - as well as high-end specialty beers such as
J.W. Dundee Honey Brown Lager and Michael Shea's Irish Amber.

<HEADLINE> Actor Happy With Horrors of Oz  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Terry Kinney had good reason for going into
''Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured it was always going to be surprising,'' the actor
explains three years later. ''And it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Like he has to tell that to any fan of this bare-knuckles,
bares-it-all prison drama, where surprise is mandatory. (''Oz''
airs Wednesday at 11 p.m. Eastern on HBO.)
</P>
<P>
   For the inmates of Oswald State Correctional Facility (Oz, for
short), surprise is a key to survival. And for Kinney's character,
Tim McManus, who runs the prison's experimental unit (dubbed,
correspondingly, Emerald City), surprise is an ever-present threat.
</P>
<P>
   But much to Kinney's satisfaction, McManus packs his own
surprises in the form of his shifting personality: He's caring.
Cold. Fearless. On the edge. Cheerful. Slinking in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Who IS this character?
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing that didn't interest me was playing some sort of
idealistic do-gooder who was not conflicted, who didn't have a dark
side,'' Kinney says.
</P>
<P>
   ''What interested me was how he assimilated the prison. His
whole life has a prison metaphor. The first season he even stopped
going home. He was sleeping in his office. Smoking dope in the
halls!''
</P>
<P>
   McManus' brainchild, Em City, reflects his hopeful, progressive
approach to detention. Unlike the rest of Oz, it's modern and
bright and communal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a basic belief that these guys are salvageable. He
believes in people being changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney is in his dressing room in the converted factory where
''Oz'' is shot. Furnished with a cot, a mirror and two folding
chairs, Kinney's quarters are scarcely more plush than the prison
cells on the set nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Now, between sips of hot soup in one paper cup and a root beer
in another, he leans back in his chair and weighs a reporter's
question:
</P>
<P>
   Isn't McManus ultimately a pathetic figure? Granted, he fights
the good fight. But the system always has the upper hand, typically
with cruel results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that McManus is willing to struggle isn't something
we tend to applaud in the real world,'' says Kinney, shaking his
buzz-cut head. ''People don't honor a struggle unless it pays off --
and pays off right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if McManus succeeds only one time out of 50, why is he
pathetic? That's not pathetic, it's heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of late, McManus has succeeded only in losing his job. Since the
new season began two weeks ago, he's been acting pretty nutty. Last
week, he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   McManus' woes dovetailed tactically with Kinney's need for time
off. During the spring, he directed ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest'' with his celebrated Chicago theater troupe, Steppenwolf, now
in its 26th season. One day a week, he flew back to shoot scenes
for ''Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in every episode this year, but I'm not around as much as
in the past,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oz'' has an enormous ensemble to take up the slack, including
Ernie Hudson, Rita Moreno, Harold Perrineau, J.K. Simmons and Lee
Tergesen. Still, McManus will likely be conspicuous in his absence:
''Let's just say I get in a lot of trouble,'' Kinney confides.
</P>
<P>
   With a distinguished career primarily in film and stage work,
the 46-year-old actor has been part of only one other series: A
decade ago, he had a recurring role as Ellyn's uptight boyfriend on
''thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the male bimbo,'' says Kinney, who as soft-spoken Steve
Woodman had little to do and not a lot of screen time to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The drama that brought him back to series TV is a different
story. ''A godsend,'' Kinney says.
</P>
<P>
   So is HBO, he adds. ''They're allowing us'' -- he halts, laughs
and corrects himself: ''They're not just ALLOWING us, they're
saying, 'Go farther, go farther!' That's all they ever say. They
don't think ANYTHING is too much!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's ironic that a drama about prison enjoys the most
freedom of any TV series. Violence, nudity, depravity -- it's all
there, with judicious frequency. Created and written by Tom Fontana
(also hailed for ''Homicide: Life on the Street''), ''Oz'' has
brought to television shocking language and even more shocking
images.
</P>
<P>
   A little too shocking?
</P>
<P>
   ''There are viewers who will take those elements at face
value,'' Kinney concedes, ''and they will either be disgusted, or
stimulated in a very bad, negative way.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think Tom paints things not unlike the way they are at a
prison, in terms of the everyday life-and-death stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus does ''Oz'' rage as a world with too many fearsome choices,
yet no underlying freedom. A far-from-certain battleground between
good and evil (or, more often, between bad and badder), it boils
with many lessons. But no message is expressed more clearly and
repeatedly than this: Jail is a wonderful place to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   As a cautionary tale, then, ''I think the show does a really
good job of serving some greater good,'' says Kinney, about to
re-enter Oz to shoot a scene. ''Although I don't think art should
have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think television should be telling people how to live.
If they're learning how to live off of TV,'' he says, ''they're
already in trouble.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 21
points in today's early going. Advancing and declining issues are
evenly split on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 14 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is down fractionally.
</P>
<P>
   Merger news could help the market overcome any remnants from
Friday's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks sold off to finish last week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say there appears to be some excitement attached to
Deutsche Telekom's purchase of VoiceStream Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a report that Nortel Networks is in talks with
Corning.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is some earnings news out this morning.
Merck is among those posting better-than-expected numbers.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Monday as investors
continued a downdraft that began last week after a series of
disappointing quarterly earnings reports.

<P>
   In the first half-hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial

   Earnings disappointments were also the catalyst for a broad

   One shock came from Agilent Technologies, the test and

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were narrowly mixed in early trading
Monday as investors continued a downdraft that began last week
after a series of disapppointing quarterly earnings reports.

<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 3.54 at 10.730.03.

<HEADLINE> Walters Nixes OJ Simpson Appearance  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Loud cheers from a studio audience greeted
Barbara Walters' announcement Monday that she has canceled a
scheduled appearance by O.J. Simpson this week on her syndicated
talk show, ''The View.''
</P>
<P>
   Several viewers, members of the show's production staff and all
four of her co-hosts had told her they were uncomfortable having
Simpson as a guest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Simpson will not appear on our program,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson's appearance, scheduled for Wednesday, was to promote
his participation in a two-hour Internet ''chat'' session on
Thursday where members of the public can pay a fee to ask him
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was
found liable in a subsequent civil trial for the 1994 deaths of his
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. He was
ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said she and her co-executive producer, Bill Geddie,
made the decision to cancel the booking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although on 'The View' Bill Geddie and I encourage differences
of opinion among us -- we can't stop it and indeed we love it --
there was more serious concern about having Mr. Simpson on the
program from all of you at this table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was surrounded by her co-hosts, Meredith Vieira, Joy Behar,
Star Jones and Lisa Ling. Vieira joined in the audience's cheers by
pounding the table after Walters' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Behar chose to make a joke: ''As Johnnie Cochran says, if the
guy's a schnook, you must unbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is making other television appearances ahead of his
Internet ''chat'' session, including interviews Tuesday on NBC's
''Today'' and with Paula Zahn on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   A Fox News Channel spokesman said Simpson's representatives
asked to see questions they would be asked on the show in advance
but were refused.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's father, Fred, went on Fox News Channel last week to
encourage television networks not to have Simpson as a guest.

<HEADLINE> German Libraries Stock Harry Potter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAARBRUCKEN, Germany (AP) -- Harry Potter fans just can't wait
for the German translation, and now a few won't have to: A state
Education Ministry said Monday its libraries are stocking the
English edition of the latest novel about the young wizard.
</P>
<P>
   The books are in such demand that the 16 libraries in the
western state of Saarland won't loan out ''Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire.'' Instead, those wanting to find out what happens
in the fourth in the series of books by J.K. Rowling must read the
book during library hours.
</P>
<P>
   The state's education minister, Jurgen Schreier, said he hoped
enthusiasm for the novel would have a beneficial side-effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't this an exciting opportunity to expand knowledge of
English and at the same time satisfy curiosity?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has set sales records in the United States. The first
three novels are also extremely popular in their German
translations here, occupying the top three spots on best seller
lists this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher Monday as investors
tried to make sense of weaker-than-expected corporate earnings
reports that conflict with indications that the threat of inflation
is waning.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 26.16 at 10.759.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 3.03 at 1,483.22, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 3.02 at 4,097.47.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was well below normal levels, a sign that traders
have no strong feelings one way or the other toward buying or
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Investors spent most of last week punishing the stocks of
technology companies that aren't living up to high earnings
expectations. The trend began when such industry bellwethers as
Microsoft, Apple and Intel beat analysts expectations -- but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings disappointments were also the catalyst for a broad

of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported second-qaurter earnings so
far have still beaten analysts' expectations,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average was up primarily on the strength of a
strong earnings report from drug company Mercks, whose shares were
up $6.063 at $69.813.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to falter Monday after Deutsche
Telekom said it will pay $50.7 billion for VoiceStream Wireless
Corp., giving Europe's biggest telecom company its first foothold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tag for VoiceStream, which is unprofitable and
only one year old, and fears that U.S. regulators may oppose the
sale sent both stocks tumbling. VoiceStream was down $11.375
$138.375, while Deutsche Telecom fell $5.812 to $45.688.
</P>
<P>
   Still, VoiceStream wireless was seen by many as an attractive
property for Deutsche Telekom because it's growing rapidly, has
licenses covering many major U.S. markets and is not part of a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 239.24 million
shares, down from Friday's early pace.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Grounded With Wing Cracks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways has grounded one of its Concorde
supersonic jetliners after small cracks spotted on its wings grew
larger, the company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers detected 2-inch cracks in the rear-most wings of the
entire seven-plane fleet a few months ago, company spokesman Peter
Middleton said. After ultrasonic testing and consultations with
aviation authorities, all seven planes were allowed to remain in
service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a major structural element of the wing,'' Middleton
said. ''It was declared not safety critical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crack in one of the planes' wings was found to have
grown to 2.6 inches last week, forcing the company to ground it for
maintenance repairs. It is expected to return to the skies by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Middleton said passengers were never at risk, and that the six
aircraft still in use remain completely safe, despite the cracks.
The other planes will continue to undergo regular checks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows that we are so ultra-cautious that we wouldn't
be flying it if we had the slightest doubts,'' Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Concordes' wings are manufactured by the French company
Aerospatiale, which has been notified about the problem. Concorde,
the world's only supersonic passenger service, is an Anglo-French
project.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BREMEN, Germany (AP) -- An explosion ripped through a hotel in a
town near Bremen early Monday, killing two men and a woman, police
said. They said they suspect the explosion was caused by a gas
leak.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three couples were staying in the hotel at the time
of the pre-dawn explosion in Thedinghausen, 10 miles southeast of
Bremen in northwest Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A German couple and a Swiss man were found dead in the rubble. A
Swiss woman was hospitalized with serious injuries, and another
German couple escaped the blast unhurt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said late Monday that no one else was believed to have
been in the building and that search dogs had checked the area.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Uwe Homes said the cause of the blast was still
undetermined, however, ''we suspect it was a gas explosion, but we
won't know for sure until the rubble is cleared away.''
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the structure, which also houses a
restaurant and dance hall, was destroyed and the rest of the
building was in danger of collapsing, police said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ends Border Violations  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Ending weeks of border bickering, the
United Nations said Monday that Israel has pulled back from spots
where it had violated Lebanon's border, clearing the way for U.N.
peacekeepers to deploy along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have hit a point of zero violations of the line,'' U.N.
envoy Terje Roed Larsen told reporters after a meeting with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said he hoped the peacekeepers could be deployed ''in the
next few days.'' He said he hopes to speak to Lahoud about the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon two months ago,
ending an 18-year occupation intended to protect northern Israel
from cross-border guerrilla attacks. The withdrawal was supposed to
be followed by deployment of Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers
to the tense border region.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government delayed the deployment, complaining
of frequent Israeli violations of its border in the form of army
patrols, military positions and moving the border fence inside
Lebanese territory. Israel also has complained of Lebanese
violations, including the throwing of stones and metal objects at
soldiers and workers along the border and attempts to cut through
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Larsen told reporters after meeting with Lahoud that
one last Israeli border violation had been rectified as he went
into the meeting. He said he expected Annan to announce UNIFIL's
deployment soon.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Lebanese and U.N. officers flew over the
U.N.-drawn border line for one last look to verify that Israel's
incursions into its territory have indeed ended.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by Lahoud's office said the Lebanese side had
requested the final verification tour before agreeing on the next
step. A meeting was scheduled for later Monday evening to discuss
the deployment of the peacekeeping force, called the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatch of peacekeepers -- about 5,000 are already deployed
north of the border in southern Lebanon -- could ease tension in the
region in the wake of the Israeli troop withdrawal. Anti-Israel
guerrillas have been the most visible armed force in the region
since the Israelis left.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the border violations had ended was
welcomed in Israel by Aviv Shiron, spokesman for Foreign Minister
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see this as ... another step toward Lebanon assuming the
responsibility of deploying its own forces, in order to secure
order and quiet in the area and along the border,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bus Bombing Kills Seven in India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMRITSAR, India (AP) -- A bomb exploded in a bus in northern
India on Monday, killing at least seven passengers and wounding 20,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was carrying 55 passengers when the blast occurred near
Jullundur, a city in Punjab state 200 miles north of New Delhi,
said Suresh Arora, the deputy inspector-general of police.
</P>
<P>
   The bus caught fire, but the flames were doused by a heavy rain.
The bomb was hidden in the luggage hold of the bus, said Gaurav
Yadav, the senior superintendent of police.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Punjab witnessed a secessionist war in 1980s by militant Sikhs.
But the Indian government controlled the insurgency in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmiri militant groups fighting to secede from India also
attack buses in other Indian states.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Lazio ad from Republican Leadership Council  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the Republican Leadership Council's
new
television advertisement boosting U.S. Senate candidate Rick Lazio:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Health Care.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Les Heintz.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Starting Tuesday in upstate New York television markets
(Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Binghamton) and on cable
systems in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: Announcer: ''Democrats and Republicans agree. Rick Lazio
is a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton: ''Senator Moynihan, Representative Lazio,
thank you, sir ... Give them all a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: Together, Lazio and Moynihan helped disabled New
Yorkers work without losing access to vital health care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazio and Moynihan make a difference. They're from New York.
They're fighting for New York. Tell Lazio and Moynihan to keep
fighting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Lazio is shown in a conservative gray suit and tie.
There is footage of President Clinton speaking at the bill-signing
ceremony at which he praises U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio and Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan. While Lazio and Moynihan are not shown at the
ceremony, the ad features separate split-screen shots of them,
edited to appear as if they are actually side by side. The ad also
features shots of a woman in a wheelchair. At the end of the ad,
telephone numbers for Lazio and Moynihan are shown on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This is the second pro-Lazio TV ad of New York's U.S.
Senate campaign produced by the moderate Republican Leadership
Council that counts Gov. George Pataki among its leaders. The new
ad, like the first, relies on the words of President Clinton to
praise Lazio for his work in Washington. Lazio is battling the
president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for the Senate seat being
vacated by Democrat Moynihan at the end of the year. She has been
attacking Lazio's congressional record.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first RLC ad praising Lazio, the latest one seeks to
link the congressman from Long Island with Moynihan, a popular New
York figure who has had differences with the Clinton administration
but who has endorsed the first lady's campaign. Using the
president's words to link Lazio and Moynihan allows the RLC to
tweak the first lady and possibly make the congressman more
acceptable to moderate voters who will decide the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her husband said it first. He put the names together and we
thought that makes a lot of sense,'' said Mark Miller, executive
director of the RLC. ''We're following his lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the RLC plans to spend $1 million between now and
Labor Day on such ads in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president signed the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999
on Dec. 17 at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington.
In addition to Moynihan and Lazio, the president singled out six
other members of Congress for recognition at the event.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Armenia Plan Weapons Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Armenia will receive $300,000 worth of U.S.
equipment and training for improved border control as part of an
agreement on limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a signing ceremony with his Armenian counterpart, Cohen said
the equipment will include nuclear and contraband detection kits to
help Armenian authorities stop unauthorized movement of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and components.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have similar agreements with nine other countries that want
to work with us to control weapons of mass destruction,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Serzh Sarkisyan, the Armenian defense minister, said his country
expects to develop military-to-military relations with the United
States once the conflict between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan
over Nagorno-Karabakh is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia has had a cease-fire with Azerbaijan for five years, but
has failed to resolve disputes over independence claims by
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is controlled by Armenia but is located
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' primary concern in the region is a planned
pipeline to carry Caspian Sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and
European oil companies, across Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean at
Ceyhan, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said no U.S. troops will be sent to Armenia in connection
with the agreement on controlling weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 87; Dow Drops 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Monday as investors were troubled by
weaker-than-expected corporate earnings reports that overshadowed
signs of moderating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 20.51 at 10.713.05.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 11.82 at 1,468.37, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 86.65 at 4,007.80.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was well below normal levels and stock prices
fluctuated in and out of postive territory, a sign that traders
have no strong feelings one way or the other toward buying or
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Investors spent most of last week punishing the stocks of
technology companies that aren't living up to high earnings
expectations. The trend began when such industry bellwethers as
Microsoft, Apple and Intel beat analysts expectations -- but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings disappointments were also the catalyst for a broad
selloff Friday, and analysts said the hangover extended into
Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overriding consideration has been that earnings growth has
slowed from the first-quarter pace. But, nevertheless, the majority
of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported second-qaurter earnings so
far have still beaten analysts' expectations,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion, as investors also consider
encouraging remarks last week by Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who suggested that the Fed's efforts to stem
inflation may be working.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two potential acquisitions brought unfavorable
responses from investors, who dragged down the shares of the
companies in question.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to falter Monday after Deutsche
Telekom said it will pay $50.7 billion for VoiceStream Wireless
Corp., giving Europe's biggest telecom company its first foothold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tag for VoiceStream, which is unprofitable and
only one year old, and fears that U.S. regulators may oppose the
sale sent both stocks tumbling. VoiceStream was down $17.359 to
$132.391, while Deutsche Telecom fell $5.687 to $45.813.
</P>
<P>
   Still, VoiceStream wireless was seen by many as an attractive
property for Deutsche Telekom because it's growing rapidly, has
licenses covering many major U.S. markets and is not part of a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of Corning Inc. fell $31.50 to $252.25 on news that
the company is apparently in talks to buy Nortel Networks Corp.'s
fiber-optic parts unit in a deal worth more than $100 billion. The
move would make Nortel the majority shareholder in Corning.
Nortel's shares rose 50 cents to $81.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average might have fallen farther if not for a
strong earnings report from drug company Merck, whose shares were
up $6 at $69.75.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 576.77 million
shares, well below Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 7.67 at 515.63.

<HEADLINE> Senator's stand against spy draws possible threats  </HEADLINE>
dtnhrjcsy
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Federal and local authorities are
investigating possible death threats against Sen. Joseph Lieberman
by a controversial New York rabbi who has condemned Lieberman for
opposing the release of an Israeli spy, the New Haven Register
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Mordechai Friedman, head of the American Board of Rabbis,
a small orthodox rabbinical group, slammed Lieberman during a
recent public access television broadcast on Long Island. He
criticized Lieberman's public stand against the release of Jonathan
Pollard, who is serving a life sentence for passing defense secrets
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   During a broadcast of his show, ''Judaism The Series,'' Friedman
said Lieberman is evil and a traitor, and suggested there is cause
to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman on Monday could not comment on the ongoing
investigation, but said the threat was the most serious he had
received in public office. He said it would not affect his
activities or his position on the Pollard case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously this is occasionally the price one pays for being
involved in public life,'' Lieberman said. ''It's not going to
affect my behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd, attending a news conference on
another topic with Lieberman in Hartford, condemned the threat and
praised Lieberman for his position on the Pollard case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe showed a lot of courage in doing this,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols said the agency has a threat
assessment division that handles such matters to determine whether
special protection is warranted, but declined to discuss the
Lieberman case.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven police said they are familiar with Friedman's
television program, but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware of the television segment and we are looking into
it,'' police spokeswoman Judith Mongillo told the Register.
</P>
<P>
   Citing sources it did not identity, the newspaper said city
police have stepped up patrols in Lieberman's neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Friedman refers to Hebrew scripture as saying
''it is permissible to execute'' someone who turns over a Jewish
person or his property to gentiles, or non-Jews, according to the
newspaper. And, whoever executes that person ''has great merit,''
Friedman asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Some viewers of the show said Friedman made similar comments
about Lieberman, who is an Orthodox Jew. Friedman also gave out
Lieberman's office phone number and said Lieberman and his family
should be cursed.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He described his organization on his Web site as a group that
''takes on issues on behalf of Jews, Judaism &AMP; Israel that not
other rabbinical organization in America has the zealous fortitude
to tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Diesel, area vice president for Cablevision Systems Corp. in
Connecticut, which owns the franchise that runs Friedman's program
on Long Island, said the company ''does not want to answer
questions on this because the matter is under police
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has called Pollard's betrayal of his country serious
breaches of law and morality. He also has said he should not
interfere in a case in which the courts have ruled. The Connecticut
Democrat was one of 60 senators including Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn. who wrote to President Clinton last year urging him not to
set Pollard free.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish groups have criticized Lieberman on the Pollard
case. Rabbi Michael Whitman of the Young Israel of New Haven said
the National Council of Young Israel has taken Lieberman to task
for his failure to support Pollards release.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman called it a ''respectful disagreement.''

<HEADLINE> Chile Seeks Pinochet Charges  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The Puma pounced in October 1973, its
rotors thumping as the military helicopter swooped down on cities
in northern Chile in the aftermath of a bloody coup led by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, military men in combat gear bounded from the Puma
with grenades, machine guns and the Chilean corvo, a curved knife
intended for close combat.
</P>
<P>
   The garb and weaponry seemed out of place for the small cities
where the helicopter touched down, but investigators say they
foretold what would come: a mission to shoot, slash and stab to
death imprisoned political opponents, ushering in the reign of
terror of Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two people were killed in the two-week, so-called
Caravan of Death, which endures for many as the regime's most
notorious human rights case. Chile's Supreme Court will begin
deliberations Tuesday on whether Pinochet can be tried, and
prosecutors say the Caravan case would be the one to carry forward.
</P>
<P>
   Following the September 1973 coup that toppled Marxist president
Salvador Allende, a few military officers hopscotched the country
by helicopter, going to the jails and asking to see the lists of
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the mission that founded the dictatorship,'' said
Patricia Verdugo, an investigative reporter who wrote about the
caravan in a best-selling 1989 book, ''The Claws of the Puma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caravan of Death has been well known for years, but more
details have emerged recently as investigators made it central to
the charges against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The democratic government that succeeded Pinochet reported that
3,197 people died or disappeared during the general's 1973-1990
dictatorship. Pinochet's lawyers have said vehemently and
repeatedly that he had no part in executions or disappearances
ascribed to his regime.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, the Supreme Court opened hearings to determine
whether Pinochet could be tried in Chile, signaling a new chapter
in a legal odyssey that began with his arrest in Britain in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Seized in London while recuperating from back surgery, the
general fought a 16-month legal battle, successfully fending off a
Spanish judge's extradition request on torture charges. British
doctors declared Pinochet unfit for trial and he returned home
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''That arrest opened the floodgates and emboldened the Chilean
judiciary,'' said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pinochet ultimately avoids trial in Chile, Brody added,
''it wouldn't be a total defeat. This entire process has set a
string of important precedents both for international law and the
principle that no one is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 84, Pinochet suffers from diabetes, uses a pacemaker and had
three mild strokes in London.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Ricardo Rivadeneira, told Chile's Supreme Court that
Pinochet is in such poor health he cannot organize a proper
defense. Chile normally exempts suspects from criminal proceedings
only for insanity or dementia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I myself have not been able to have a direct contact with Gen.
Pinochet,'' Rivadeneira said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court must give final word on Pinochet's appeal of a
lower tribunal ruling, which stripped the general of the immunity
he enjoyed from prosecution as a senator-for-life. It is unclear if
the 20 justices will first order medical tests to determine whether
he is fit for stand trial, or immediately rule whether he could be
tried.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend Pinochet had clear control over the Caravan
and sent a trusted ''delegate'' as mission leader. Alfonso Insunza,
a lawyer representing relatives of a slain union activist, told the
justices Pinochet was responsible ''for the crimes of homicide,
kidnapping and illegal burial of bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rivadeneira said his client ''never ordered any executions
much less kidnappings.''
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims insist trying Pinochet is the only way
to attain justice. ''The state has not yet confronted the central
issue. This is a bedrock value for any healthy society,'' said
Mario Silva.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Hector Mario Silva Iriarte, was among 16 killed in
Antofogasta on Oct. 19, 1973. A socialist in the Allende
government, he surrendered to military authorities and was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were taken out in the night and executed in the hills
near Antofogasta,'' said the son. ''They said at the time that they
were plotting against the government, but that was all a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Silva, who was 7 at the time, said his mother was left
with five children to raise. ''It was terribly painful and
difficult after that because we all had depended on my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the caravan victims are still missing. Until the
bodies are found, the Supreme Court has agreed the cases can be
considered kidnappings, and thus ''ongoing crimes'' exempted from a
controversial amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   One of the missing is Carlos Berger, director of a radio station
in Calama who defied orders to cease broadcasting the day of the
coup. Twelve others from the northern city also disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Wife Carmen Hertz said she was in the radio station when the
soldiers took him away. ''On the day of the coup he kept
transmitting. They ordered him to close up and he refused,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was given a 61-day jail sentence. Hertz visited every
day.
</P>
<P>
   He had just a few days remaining when he was plucked from jail
along with his cellmates, victims of what she called a ''cruel and
cowardly massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day of my life I remember those faces.''

<HEADLINE> Summertime and the living is - cool  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Some numbers little seen so far this summer
are showing up in the forecast for later this week: 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Buffalo's temperature hits 80 an average of 19 times
in July. As of Monday, the mercury had cracked it just twice,
according to the National Weather Service. Seventies by day and 50s
at night have been the rule.
</P>
<P>
   But before adding another page to Buffalo's poor weather
history, look around. The story is pretty much the same throughout
the Northeast and Midwest, where some are wondering what happened
to summer.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, meteorologist Steve McLaughlin said Monday, is a
shift in the jetstream that has normally retreated into Canada by
now. For the most part, any place above that ribbon of air -
including New York City, Washington and Boston - has had a cool
July. Places below - like Texas - a scorcher.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, temperatures have been running about four degrees
below normal during a July that, as of Monday, was the coolest in
50 years. (A few 80s to finish out the month may drop that a notch
or two.)
</P>
<P>
   While some are grumbling about lost beach time, there are few
complaints about perfectly comfortable weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who can complain about 75 and sunny?'' asked McLaughlin,
describing Sunday and Monday's weather in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is cool but we are enjoying it because we're not
hot-weather people,'' said Hildegarde Rittmann who was reading the
newspaper with her husband, Karl, at the Erie Basin Marina. ''This
suits me fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Town of Tonawanda couple had turned on the central air
conditioning in their house just once over the summer and the car
air conditioner had gotten only a few days' work.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Brown of Buffalo is hoping for at least a week of
consistent upper 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to enjoy a little hot weather,'' she said. ''I bought
all these short sets for the kids. There hasn't been much use for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint has been the rain. While McLaughlin said
the July total is actually a little below normal, the rain has come
on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   There has been plenty of room to spread a blanket at the
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a normal hot July weekend, we would have a good 4,500 to
5,000 people between the two beaches Erie County runs,'' said Mark
Galvin, superintendent at Bennett and Wendt beaches in Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not getting half that,'' he said. ''It's the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Highs of about 80 were forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday, while
some rain was expected Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, meanwhile, said Buffalo residents are used to weather ups
and downs.
</P>
<P>
   ''But even for Buffalo,'' she said, ''this is a little
strange.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Testifies in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A U.S. soldier admitted in a
statement read in a Kosovo court Monday that he fired explosive
rounds into a shed where an ethnic Albanian was killed in a
shootout, offering new evidence that may clear a Serb man and his
sons on trial for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Mirolub ''Mirko'' Momcilovic, 60, and his sons
Jugoslav, 32, and Boban, 25, has been considered a test of whether
any non-Albanian can get a fair trial in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement read Monday, Cpl. Robert Black said he fired in
self defense into the shed where U.N. officials have said Afrim
Gagica was killed on July 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed a man in the shed firing at the tower. I fired with
my M203, 40 mm high explosive rounds,'' said Black's statement.
''The second round exploded inside the shed and I kept up small,
suppressive fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Black's statement was part of a 130-page report submitted by
U.S. authorities and admitted into evidence Monday. U.S. military
and U.N. officials have offered no explanation for why it took so
long for the evidence to be submitted.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no suggestion the U.S. troops may face charges
since the rules of engagement at the time permitted NATO-led
peacekeepers to use deadly force to defend themselves and protect
Kosovo residents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initial U.S. report said the Momcilovics were
defending their home against the victim's ''criminal intent,'' the
three men were arrested and transferred to the American detention
facility at Camp Bondsteel, where they have been held for more than
a year. In January, an ethnic Albanian magistrate ordered them to
stand trial for murder and illegal weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patrice de Charette of France, an international trial
judge hearing the case, adjourned the trial Monday, asking the U.S.
Army's investigation department to bring him weapons and narcotics
seized from the Momcilovic residence the night of the crime, as
well as the bullets found in Gagica's body.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the French judge, the case is being tried before
a panel of four ethnic Albanian judges. A simple majority is
required to rule on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened April 25, but the proceedings were suspended
the following day after the defense asked to introduce a security
videotape showing some of the events of the day of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. court initially refused to accept the tape into
evidence, saying it could not determine whether it had been
altered. However, after protests from human rights advocates, it
was admitted into evidence Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tape, the elder Momcilovic is shown answering the
intercom of his motorcycle repair shop and speaking with a stranger
who ultimately demanded that he come out and surrender his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Gun drawn, a man later identified as Gagica tried to kick the
door down as a group of his armed companions looked on. An exchange
of gunfire followed. Minutes later, U.S. troops entered the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tape does not show who shot Gagica, human rights
observers had contended that it raises reasonable doubt that the
Momcilovics were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press last month, the three
jailed Serbs admitted they fired shots from a second-floor window
but said they were trying to warn U.S. troops. Terrified of attacks
by ethnic Albanians, the three Serbs insisted they were fighting
for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have declined to comment on the case, saying they
did not want to interfere with the judicial process.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is to reconvene on Aug. 7.

<HEADLINE> Sources: Coverdell Successor Named  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia's Democratic former governor Zell Miller
will accept appointment to the late Republican Paul Coverdell's
Senate seat and will run for the remaining four years of the term
in November, The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes was to announce the appointment Monday evening,
sources close to both men told the AP. Georgia law gives the
governor the right to appoint a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, died of a stroke last week. In 1998, he became
the first Georgia Republican since Reconstruction to be re-elected
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Miller would increase the number of Democrats
in the Senate to 46. There are 54 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 68, left office last year as one of the most popular
governors in Georgia history. His approval rating topped 85
percent, thanks mostly to his lottery-funded program that gave
college scholarships to any high school student with a ''B''
average or better.
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution had barred Miller from running for a
third term in 1998. Some Democrats suggested he run against
Coverdell for Senate, but Miller instead retired and began teaching
college courses.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be running in the special election Nov. 7. Any
candidate who pays the $4,101 qualifying fee can take part in a
nonpartisan election for the remaining four years of the term. If
no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two will meet in
a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's popularity with voters is expected to scare off any
other serious Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll be an excellent candidate and an excellent
senator,'' said state Rep. Larry Walker, the House Democratic
leader. ''He'll be in the Sam Nunn, Richard Russell mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials were attempting to unite behind one
candidate, probably one of Georgia's eight Republican congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (Miller's appointment) probably sends the strongest
signal I know that we need to be focused and united behind a
candidate in this race,'' state Republican Party Chairman Chuck
Clay said. He said the GOP had a strong shot at winning, because
''most Georgians are going to want a Republican voice in a
Republican-controlled Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   After 16 years as lieutenant governor, Miller was elected
governor in 1990 -- beating former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and
Barnes, among others, in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Miller gave Georgians a chance to vote on a state
lottery, which passed. The lottery funds several popular education
programs, included HOPE Scholarships, a plan copied by several
other governors and President Clinton, a longtime friend of Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller campaigned for Clinton in 1992 and pushed up the Georgia
presidential primary in 1992 to help his fellow Democratic
governor. Miller also introduced Clinton to campaign strategist
James Carville.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Launch Attack in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebels launched an unusual daytime attack
Monday, underlining their growing boldness by ambushing a Russian
military convoy in Chechnya's capital and reportedly killing
several Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian soldiers were traveling in a three-truck convoy in
Grozny when the rebels attacked, said the office of Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's spokesman on Chechnya. The rebels set
off a mine under one of the trucks, then opened fire on the
soldiers with automatic weapons and grenade-launchers. The Russians
returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian soldiers were killed and 17 wounded in the attack,
Igor Kistayev, deputy prosecutor in Chechnya, was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency. Yastrzhembsky's office would not
comment on casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Mumadi Saidayev said 18 Russians were killed.
''The operation was carried out accurately,'' with no rebel losses,
he said by telephone from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the Chechnya conflict routinely exaggerate enemy
losses and play down their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels have stepped up attacks against Russian positions in
Chechnya in recent weeks, using explosive-filled trucks,
remote-controlled mines, artillery and automatic weapons -- but they
usually attack at night. Russian media report practically every day
that the federal forces are tightening security in the breakaway
republic, yet the attacks continue to take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Kistayev said another, similar rebel attack occurred in central
Grozny on Monday afternoon, leaving Russians wounded, Interfax
said. The report did not give more details.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent Russian success on Sunday, the military said
dozens of rebels were killed in Russian artillery strikes after
they clashed with federal forces in the forests of eastern
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting occurred nine miles east of Grozny, the military
command in the North Caucasus town of Mozdok said. The command's
press service said 42 rebels were killed in the woods there and 18
in forests in the nearby Argun region after Russian troops called
in artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   The claim could not be independently confirmed, but it could be
one of the Russian forces' biggest successes in weeks. While the
rebels have not launched large-scale operations, their series of
ambushes and bombings have sapped troop morale.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters, and Moscow lost control of the region.
Troops returned in September after militants based in Chechnya
raided villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and
after about 300 people were killed in apartment bombings the
authorities blame on Chechen militants.

<HEADLINE> Buddy Films Trade Action for Emotion  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Think movies for guys, and what comes to
mind? Tom Cruise dangling from a cliff in ''Mission: Impossible
2''? Bruce Willis blowing things up in a ''Die Hard'' thriller? Mel
Gibson and Danny Glover looking for someone to shoot in ''Lethal
Weapon?''
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   How about a chubby seducer who shares dating secrets with male
friends but ultimately recants his womanizing ways? Two brothers
offering supportive shoulders as they work through pivotal times in
their romances? A reunion between childhood chums that helps both
men exorcise boyhood demons?
</P>
<P>
   Male bonding in the movies does not just come packing a pistol
anymore. In a bullet-ridden summer that includes ''Mission:
Impossible 2,'' ''Shaft'' and ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' there are
also smaller, intelligent movies about men getting in touch with
their feelings and thoughtfully interacting.
</P>
<P>
   Think of them as chick flicks for guys.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chick flicks allow for a degree of introspection and feelings,
which are things men weren't really acknowledged to have until
recently. Except maybe feelings of rage. Rage and lust,'' said
''American Pie'' producer Chris Weitz, who co-stars in ''Chuck &AMP;
Buck,'' a darkly comic tale of a man-child's obsession with a
boyhood buddy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opened in mid-July, also stars screenwriter
Mike White and Weitz's brother Paul, who directed ''American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Men can be depicted now as less macho, more flawed, less
likely to inflict violence and mayhem,'' Chris Weitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 4 brings ''The Tao of Steve,'' a romantic comedy about an
overweight, underachieving lech who finds love and rethinks the
libertine preaching he's been offering his male pals. ''Smiling
Fish and Goat on Fire'' arrives a few weeks later, about two
brothers who commiserate and share advice on their love lives.
</P>
<P>
   They're all independent features playing in limited release. But
movies featuring circles of men bonding emotionally have become
more common, notably this year's ''High Fidelity'' starring John
Cusack, last year's ''Flawless'' with Robert De Niro and
''Swingers'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it's because men of our generation, approaching 40,
they've been exposed to feminism,'' said Jenniphr Goodman, director
of ''Tao of Steve.'' which stars Donal Logue and Goodman's sister
Greer. ''Being able to express emotions more freely is probably a
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive film portraits of male relations certainly are not
new. ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' from 1946, about three war
veterans adjusting to civilian life, and ''Midnight Cowboy'' from
1969, about the tender friendship between a country stud and an
urban gnome, both won best-picture Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   But today's audiences seem more willing to accept films showing
men in a vulnerable light.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chuck &AMP; Buck'' writer White, who stars as the emotionally
stunted Buck, said the old notion of the manly, self-contained
Hollywood hero is foreign to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Wayne on a prairie, the man alone, definitely is
something I can't relate to,'' White said. ''I want to love, I have
needs. Men around me in my life, they've got needs. In this day and
age, I think it's become necessary to depict that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goodman sisters wrote ''Tao of Steve'' with their friend
Duncan North, whose cool, aloof, Steve McQueen style of picking up
women inspired the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Logue, whose credits include the jilted priest in ''Runaway
Bride'' and a rebel in ''The Patriot,'' said the movie gave him the
chance to portray a potentially heartless heartbreaker in a
sympathetic light.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through the whole movie, he's teaching the tao of Steve and
telling his clueless friend to stop being such a desperate,
backrubbing guy to get women,'' Logue said. ''Then he ends up
telling him to forget everything he taught him and saying, 'I've
been trying to turn you into me, and I don't even like being me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Big hits such as ''Jerry Maguire'' and ''As Good As It Gets''
also depict men incapable of dealing with their emotions gradually
opening up with help from women and from male buddies, said Paul
Weitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a kind of post-buddy movie movement,'' Paul
Weitz said. ''We've just kind of gorged ourselves on the 'Lethal
Weapon' sort of buddy movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher divorce rates since the 1950s may have helped men open
up, because more boys grew up in homes with mothers as the dominant
parent, said Felicia Rose Adler, author of ''Master Dating: How to
Meet &AMP; Attract Quality Men.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It used to be that boys would have been hanging out with the
men at Dad's poker games,'' Adler said. ''Now more are hanging out
with their mother's friends. They got used to that relationship
talk because women talk about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Martini, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Smiling Fish and
Goat on Fire'' with his brother Derick and director Kevin Jordan,
joked that the trend toward more insightful renderings of men in
movies could have repercussions for films starring women.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what it means, don't you?'' he quipped. ''It means
that women are going to have to start picking up guns and killing
people.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 94; Dow Sheds 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Monday as troubled investors
responded to weaker-than-expected corporate earnings reports that
overshadowed signs of moderating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 45.61 at 10,687.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 12.28 at 1,467.91, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 93.94 at 4,000.51.
</P>
<P>
   Investors spent most of last week punishing the stocks of
technology companies that aren't living up to high earnings
expectations. The trend began when such industry bellwethers as
Microsoft, Apple and Intel beat analysts expectations -- but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overriding consideration has been that earnings growth has
slowed from the first-quarter pace. But, nevertheless, the majority
of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported second-qaurter earnings so
far have still beaten analysts' expectations,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion, as investors also consider
encouraging remarks last week by Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who suggested that the Fed's efforts to stem
inflation may be working.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings disappointments were also the catalyst for a broad
selloff Friday, and analysts said the hangover extended into
Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   The big technology stocks were taking it on the nose again
Monday. Dell Computers fell $5.375 to $47 after an analyst said
sales of personal computers are expected to decline. Apple, down
$5.063 to $48.50, and Microsoft, down $1.875 to $70.438, also fell
on the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, investors voiced strong disapproval of two
potential acquisitions, pulling down the shares of the companies in
question.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to falter Monday after Deutsche
Telekom said it will pay $50.7 billion for VoiceStream Wireless
Corp., giving Europe's biggest telecom company its first foothold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tag for VoiceStream, which is unprofitable and
only one year old, and fears that U.S. regulators may oppose the
sale sent both stocks tumbling. VoiceStream was down $17.359 to
$132.391, while Deutsche Telecom fell $5.687 to $45.813.
</P>
<P>
   Still, VoiceStream wireless was seen by many as an attractive
property for Deutsche Telekom because it's growing rapidly, has
licenses covering many major U.S. markets and is not part of a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of Corning Inc. fell $30.25 to $253.50 on news that
the company is apparently in talks to buy Nortel Networks Corp.'s
fiber-optic parts unit in a deal worth more than $100 billion. The
move would make Nortel the majority shareholder in Corning.
Nortel's shares rose 50 cents to $81.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average might have fallen farther if not for a
strong earnings report from drug company Merck, whose shares were
up $6 at $69.75. Merck's earnings pushed up other drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 687.48 million
shares, well below Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 7.31 at 515.39.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Presidential Hopefuls Named  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Moshe
Katzav, a one-time contender for the leadership of the hawkish
Likud party, were named Monday as candidates for the Israeli
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg announced the two candidates of the
two largest parties -- Peres, for Prime Minister Ehud Barak's One
Israel, and Katsav, for the Likud. The vote by the 120 members of
the Knesset will take place July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The previous president, Ezer Weizman, resigned July 10 in the
wake of a scandal in which he admitted receiving more than $350,000
from a French textile magnate. Although the case was closed, the
attorney general ruled Weizman had acted improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Were the election held by popular vote, the 77-year-old Peres, a
Nobel Peace Prize laureate with impressive achievements throughout
Israel's 52-year history, would win easily, opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Peres is credited with taming hyperinflation in Israel and
ending the Lebanon war during his 1984-86 term as prime minister.
He also served as prime minister after the assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995, narrowly losing to Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government coalition has lost its majority in the
Knesset and many members are opposed to the Oslo interim agreement
with the Palestinians, of which Peres was an architect. Three
parties quit the government on the eve of Barak's departure for the
Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Peres has been regarded as the leading contender for
the largely ceremonial post. Katsav, 54, who has held second-grade
Cabinet posts in Likud administrations, lacks an international
reputation and has said that if elected he would avoid politics and
devote himself to fostering domestic unity.
</P>
<P>
   The former transportation minister placed fourth in the 1993
Likud primaries that vaulted Netanyahu to the Likud leadership. He
failed to cultivate a following beyond the Iranian Jewish
community, of which he is a scion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Camp David talks continue until July 31, Peres will lack
the votes of Barak and the other Cabinet ministers and legislators
who are with him at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Burg has ruled out any postponement of the election.
</P>
<P>
   The duties of Israel's president are limited mostly to presiding
at functions, although the president has the power to pardon
convicted criminals and to name judges.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Benefit From Public Outcry  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Public outrage over the
environmental damage caused by an oil spill off the coast of Cape
Town has been tempered by how well the disaster has been handled.
Of some 43,000 penguins affected by the spill, fewer than 1,000
have died.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from 1994 when 10,000 birds were coated in oil
from a spill and only half could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   While conservationists can't prevent environmental disasters
such as those caused by the Apollo Sea, which sank off Cape Town in
1994, and the Panamanian-registered tanker Treasure, which sank
June 23, they are at least coping better.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the Apollo Sea spill there was no one in charge.
Everyone was complaining it was so unorganized,'' said Jay Holcomb,
a member of an international team of wildlife experts assembled by
the International Fund for Animal Welfare to help local
organizations deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, local groups have gleaned management expertise from
international experts, and imparted their own knowledge about
penguins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at least two months before all birds are washed and
released into the wild and more will die, but already the operation
is being hailed as a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can say with certainty these (rehabilitated) birds do
survive,'' said Les Underhill of the University of Cape Town's
avian demography unit. ''We do know that they breed again within a
very short time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 volunteers and many organizations can claim
credit for helping save the penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are working on a miracle here. I think we can all begin to
have more faith in mankind,'' said Estelle van der Merwe, of the
Southern African National Foundation for the Conservation of
Coastal Birds, the backbone of the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Crawford of the government's marine and coastal management
department has been praised for his decision to truck some 20,000
uncontaminated birds up the coast and release them. While the birds
swam home, workers cleaned up most of the oil spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a relatively easy decision. We had to get the birds
away from the oiled environment,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   That meant volunteers could concentrate on looking after the
other 23,000 oil-coated birds and chicks which had lost their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Improved catching, transporting and stabilizing methods also
contributed to the penguins' high survival rate.
</P>
<P>
   During the Apollo Sea spill, about 60 percent of the birds that
died did so within a day of being captured. Many suffocated or died
from breathing toxic fumes in poorly ventilated and crowded
transportation boxes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, specially designed and ventilated cardboard boxes
carried three penguins each. The birds were also given iron
injections, lots of fluid and kept warm.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was total panic with the Apollo Sea. This time it was a
lot better coordinated,'' said van der Merwe. ''The weather was
also on our side this time. In 1994 it was cold and wet and we did
not have enough infrared lights to dry the birds,'' which loose
their waterproofing when they come into contact with the oil.
</P>
<P>
   The technique of feeding the birds has also been refined to get
them to eat voluntarily, which most do after a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the penguins were force-fed, but this was very labor
intensive and stressful for the birds, said Holcomb.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the operation's success, the spill has been a severe
setback for the African penguins, which are only found off the
coast of southern Africa and are classified as vulnerable to
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The spill happened in the middle of their breeding cycle, and
many chicks and eggs were lost. Underhill estimates it will take
the population several years to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Merwe also warned that the birds were still vulnerable
to disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no telling what happens when you have so many birds
together in one place, but at this stage we are feeling very
positive,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rick Rockwell Says He Was Assaulted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) -- The ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' groom says he was assaulted early Sunday by a
fan who hurt his toe.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rockwell said a fan who stopped to chat with him late
Saturday after his comedy show at a local nightclub followed him
back to his motel room. The two scuffled after the fan looked in
his window, Rockwell said, and the man stepped on his toe and took
off a toenail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are investigating the incident as an assault and
have a suspect, police Sgt. Kevin Kallinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell gained fame by marrying Darva Conger on the Fox TV
special ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire'' in February.
</P>
<P>
   The show quickly turned into a fiasco when Conger, who posed
nude in Playboy's August issue, filed to end the marriage days
after the two returned from a Caribbean honeymoon. Rockwell's
status as a multimillionaire also was questioned just days after
the broadcast, and it was disclosed that a former fiancee obtained
a restraining order against Rockwell in 1991 for allegedly hitting
and threatening her. Rockwell denies the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Albright Might Miss North Korea Trip  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP)-- The open-ended Mideast summit at Camp David
jeopardizes a trip to Asia by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and a chance to quiz North Korea's foreign minister on whether the
country's ominous missile program can be diverted to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is at the peace talks ''for the duration,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday as President
Clinton and Albright pursued with Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators their detailed stands on such core issues as the future
of Jerusalem and the boundaries of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking this day by day,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had hoped to go to Bangkok, Thailand, for a meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a talk with North
Korea Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun.
</P>
<P>
   She also had tentative plans to make a stop in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   If the summit ends shortly, she should be able to make the trip,
but as the talks go on, the possibility of scrubbing it increases.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's deputy, Strobe Talbott, remained in Kapan after the
conclusion of the G-8 economic summit meeting, on call to replace
Albright on the Asia trip.
</P>
<P>
   The high-level contact with North Korea reflects an improvement
in relations between the United States and a country long-denounced
as being headed by a ''rogue regime.'' The State Department stopped
using that reference after North and South Korea began
reconciliation talks during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and others in the Clinton administration still
described North Korea as a potential foe and a prime reason for
considering an expensive system to defend the United States against
missile attack.

<HEADLINE> Brockovich Challenges ABC Reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Erin Brockovich challenged
''20/20'' TV reporter John Stossel to drink water with the
carcinogen chromium 6 after Stossel questioned the research she
used to gain a $333 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, a legal aide, helped win compensation for residents
of the small desert town of Hinkley whose water was found to be
contaminated by Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric. Her story was told in the
movie ''Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Stossel questioned the harmful effects of chromium 6 in the
''Give Me a Break'' segment of the ABC news magazine that aired
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chromium 6 is toxic, chromium 6 is poison,'' Brockovich said
Friday. ''I want Mr. Stossel and his family to start drinking
chromium 6-laced water day in and day out, just like the people in
Hinkley did every day.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he and his family would do, Stossel said: ''I
wouldn't like them to drink the water, but let's not terrify people
unless we know it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News statement said Stossel never claimed drinking
chromium 6 was safe. Brockovich has asked Stossel and his producer
to apologize for what she called a dangerous and misleading
broadcast.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
found political harmony at the Neshoba County Fair. It came in the
form of foot-stomping music.
</P>
<P>
   The Singing Senators, featuring Lott and fellow Republican Sens.
Jim Jeffords of Vermont, John Ashcroft of Missouri and Larry Craig
of Idaho, drew repeated applause Saturday for their gospel hymns,
patriotic standards and country tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said performing in his home state brought a few jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've performed with these senators in their states, but you
are always a little nervous to bring your gig to your home state,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators perform for charities and colleagues and also have
a CD recording which benefits Alzheimer's research in honor of

<HEADLINE> Andrea Bocelli Cancels Greece Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli canceled his
sold-out performance under the Acropolis on Monday due to ill
health, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Italian singer was to perform in the 1,800
year-old Herod Atticus amphitheater at the foot of the Acropolis.
More than 4,500 people will have their tickets refunded, organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli, who has been blind since age 12, was scheduled to
perform with American conductor Lorin Maazel as part of the
Hellenic Festival, a summer-spanning series of cultural
performances. They did not say what was wrong with Bocelli.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuscany-born vocalist is known as much for his traditional
operatic singing as for his pop ballads. Bocelli's platinum album
''Sacred Arias'' currently tops the classical charts. His 1999
album ''Sogno'' received a Golden Globe award.

<HEADLINE> Italy Cop Arrested For Slaying Teen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy (AP) -- A state police officer was arrested Monday,
four days after he shot and killed a teen-age scooter driver who
ran a police checkpoint to avoid getting a ticket for not wearing a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Tommaso Leone was taken into custody on suspicion of
homicide, the Naples prosecutor's office said. Leone, who has said
the shooting was an accident, was being held without bail in a
military prison.
</P>
<P>
   Leone is accused of killing 17-year-old Mario Castellano, who
ran a police checkpoint set up to enforce a new law mandating
helmets for Italy's 9 million scooter and motorcycle riders.
</P>
<P>
   Castellano ran the checkpoint because he wasn't wearing a helmet
and didn't want to be ticketed, as he had been repeatedly before
the shooting for flouting the new helmet law. The teen-ager
reportedly loathed helmets because they flattened his gel-held
hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   His killing provoked scattered riots, calls to boycott helmets
and several vigils.

<HEADLINE> 'Practice' Actress Tired of Typecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- Lisa Gay Hamilton says she's tired of being
typecast -- in chains.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who plays Rebecca Washington on ABC's ''The
Practice,'' has appeared as a slave in a lot of theater and
television productions: the 1998 movie ''Beloved,'' Showtime's ''A
House Divided,'' and the 1999 off-Broadway production
''Angelique.''
</P>
<P>
   She was again offered the role of a slave in a New York theater
production this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Look, I am not Miss Jane Pittman, OK?''' Hamilton
told TV Guide in its July 29 issue. ''I can't play every slave
woman ever written! I love my people, I love my history. But can we
do some contemporary something?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said she never wanted to be a TV or movie star, and it
had nothing to do with the job itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would be able to do it,'' she said. ''Not
because I wasn't capable. But I'm a short black girl. I'm not
mulatto. I'm not exotic.''

<HEADLINE> Grand jury indicts 16 for allegedly scalping Yankee and Mets tickets </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan grand jury has indicted 16 people on
charges of taking part in schemes that helped scalpers get hundreds
of thousands of dollars worth of tickets to Yankee and Mets
baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Three indictments unsealed Monday allege that eight Yankee
ticket agents and one Mets agent accepted tens of thousands of
dollars to divert home game tickets to brokers and scalpers who
sold them to fans at inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 10 defendants Sunday, including four Yankee
agents who were arrested at the stadium before and during the game
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The others, who included brokers
and scalpers, were arrested at their homes. The Mets agent was
arrested Monday morning at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include Frank Greenwald, president of the Ticket
Agents Union Local F-72, and his brother Richard, an officer of
that union. They and other defendants were charged variously with
grand larceny, scheme to defraud and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began some 15 months ago after a fan
complained that the scalper who had sold him tickets before a
Yankee game was the same man he saw working in the Yankees' advance
ticket sales window after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said that so far
this year alone, more than $300,000 worth of Yankee and Mets
tickets were diverted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ordinary fans showing up at the stadium had virtually no
chance to obtain the best tickets available to Yankee games, since
corrupt agents were diverting them to scalpers,'' District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Mets received face value for all tickets sold,
but the Yankees lost royalties they would have collected from
Ticketmaster, which has an exclusive contract to sell Yankee
tickets by telephone and Internet.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, whose office ran a
parallel investigation, said the probe revealed a statewide
''unholy alliance between ticket scalpers and those who work in the
box offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the three main schemes the defendants used were:
</P>
<P>
   - Brokers and scalpers payed ticket agents a bribe plus face
value of the tickets and received tickets.
</P>
<P>
   - Ticket agents helped brokers get multiple season or partial
season ticket plans that are not for sale to brokers and are
restricted to one per customer.
</P>
<P>
   - Ticket agents helped brokers make group sale purchases that
are not available to brokers. The agents let the brokers use
multiple identities to make it appear that several individuals were
making the group purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the scalping ring was led by Steven Mootoo, an
unlicensed ticket broker in Manhattan. He said Mootoo had developed
a relationship with Yankee ticket agent Edward Angelino who sold
season and partial season tickets to the broker in violation of
Yankee policy.
</P>
<P>
   Mootoo worked with three other unlicensed brokers, who called
themselves ''The Three Amigos,'' to scalp tickets he had obtained,
Morgenthau said. He said that if they could not sell all of their
tickets before a game, they returned the extras to the agents who
sold them to the public at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The top count against Mootoo and the others, second-degree grand
larceny, is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeper Killed in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By GRANT PECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A soldier from New Zealand was shot in
the head Monday during a clash with armed opponents of
independence, becoming the first U.N peacekeeper to be killed in
East Timor and imperiling the fragile peace in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''That endangers everything we've been trying to achieve,''
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N.'s top official on East Timor, told
journalists in Bangkok. ''This is the first combat casualty since
the peacekeeping troops arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, identified as Leonard William Manning, 24, a
private of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, was on a patrol
searching for a group of armed men who had reportedly crossed the
border from Indonesian-ruled West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and the armed men clashed in the morning, and the
private's body was recovered in the late afternoon with one or two
bullets in the head, de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   De Mello blamed the attack on ''unscrupulous extremists'' who
last year went on a spree of burning and terror after most East
Timorese voted in a U.N-backed referendum for independence from a
quarter-century of brutal Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have our forces combing the area looking for the
perpetrators of this attack,'' de Mello said, adding that the
Indonesian army in West Timor had also been asked to block the
border and prevent the raiders from returning to their sanctuaries
</P>
<P>
   The infiltration took place near Suai, about 60 miles southwest
of East Timor's capital, Dili.
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, the commander of the 8,500-strong U.N. forces in East
Timor, Thai Lt. Gen. Boonsrang Niumpradit, described the killing as
a ''tragic loss.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to extend my condolences,'' he said in a
statement. ''Our thoughts go to the family of Pvt. Manning and to
the New Zealand contingent in East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was the third serious attack on U.N. peacekeeping
troops since they arrived on the devastated half-island a year ago,
following the rampage by Indonesian troops and their militia
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, pro-Jakarta militiamen have regularly infiltrated
across the border to stage attacks. Much of East Timor remains a
terrorized wasteland and tens of thousands of people are refugees.
</P>
<P>
   De Mello said East Timor could have been rebuilt much more in
the past year but for ''this constant threat on the part of a small
number of thugs and extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   De Mello was taking part in a panel discussion in Bangkok with
East Timorese leaders Jose Ramos-Horta and Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   They are attending a meeting of foreign ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Ramos-Horta said
earlier that East Timor may try to join when the territory emerges
from U.N. tutelage in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, the former leader of independence fighters, said the
attacks showed that not everyone accepted the new democratic
government in Jakarta, which has tried to make amends for the harsh
rule of former dictator Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao said East Timor had made progress since last year but
''all this can be imperiled if problems like this morning still
happen.''

<HEADLINE> High Court rejects group's bid to close nuclear plant  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state's highest court - in two
decisions - on Monday ruled against environmental groups which
claim the Millstone nuclear reactors are polluting Long Island
Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court found the environmentalists had no
standing to bring the complaints to trial because they did not
first exhaust all of their administrative remedies through the
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millstone has been the subject of department reviews,
approvals and permits for more than 25 years,'' Justice Joette Katz
wrote in the unanimous rulings. ''The plaintiffs, however, have
failed to intervene in any of those proceedings, many of which
addressed the very issues that they claim justify the trial court's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plaintiffs cannot now benefit from this deliberate
decision to wait until the eleventh hour,'' Katz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Burton, an attorney for Fish Unlimited and other
environmental groups involved in the case, said the ruling
effectively silences citizen activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a dark day indeed,'' she said. ''In this decision, the
Supreme Court has left the stewardship of the environment to
bureaucrats who have expressed an extreme disinterest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the groups did not file their complaints earlier
because the facts in their case developed only recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''We moved when we got the information,'' she said. ''I don't
think it's fair to fault us for that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would ask the high court to reconsider its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had argued that Millstone Unit 2's cooling
system is damaging the winter flounder fishery in Niantic Bay and
Long Island Sound and that the DEP had issued an improper
wastewater discharge permit to the Millstone complex. The group
claimed the permit is invalid since the complex was idled for
months because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The groups sought to shut down the reactors or curb their
operation during fish spawning season.
</P>
<P>
   NU maintains its permits are valid and that its nuclear plant
cooling systems have a negligible impact on the fish population. A
Hartford Superior Court judge last year blamed overfishing for the
drop in numbers of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new Millstone will continue its focus on the path to the
best of the best in operating our plants safely, reliably and in an
environmentally sound manner,'' said NU spokesman Joe Pillittere.
</P>
<P>
   Other parties to the appeals include the Green Party of
Connecticut; Don't Waste Connecticut; Standing For the Truth About
Radiation of East Hampton, N.Y.; the North Fork Environmental
Coalition of Mattituck, N.Y.; New York State Assemblyman Fred
Thiele of Long Island and the town of East Hampton, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 113; Dow Falls 49  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Monday as troubled investors
responded to weaker-than-expected corporate earnings reports that
overshadowed signs of moderating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 48.79 at 10,684.77,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 15.87 at 1,464.32, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 113.41 at 3,981.04.
</P>
<P>
   Investors spent most of last week punishing the stocks of
technology companies that aren't living up to high earnings
expectations, and that pattern continued Monday. The trend began
when such industry bellwethers as Microsoft, Apple and Intel beat
analysts expectations -- but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overriding consideration has been that earnings growth has
slowed from the first-quarter pace. But, nevertheless, the majority
of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported second-qaurter earnings so
far have still beaten analysts' expectations,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion, as investors also consider
encouraging remarks last week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who suggested that the Fed's efforts to stem inflation
may be working.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings disappointments led to a broad selloff Friday, however,
and analysts said the hangover extended into Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   The big technology stocks were taking it on the nose again
Monday. Dell Computers fell $5.937 to $46.438 after an analyst said
sales of personal computers are expected to decline. Apple, down
$4.813 to $48.75, and Microsoft, down $1.813 to $70.50, also fell
on the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, investors voiced strong disapproval of two
potential acquisitions, pulling down the shares of the companies in
question.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to falter Monday after Deutsche
Telekom said it will pay $50.7 billion for VoiceStream Wireless
Corp., giving Europe's biggest telecom company its first foothold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tag for VoiceStream, which is unprofitable and
only one year old, and fears that U.S. regulators may oppose the
sale sent both stocks tumbling. VoiceStream closed down $19.75 to
$130, while Deutsche Telekom fell $6.937 to $44.563.

   And shares of Corning Inc. fell $32.75 to $251 on news that the

<HEADLINE> Buyout leaves one son with company, one with $54 million  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Twenty-two years after the death of
diamond king Harry Winston and 12 years after his sons started
suing each other, one of them gave up his claim on the family
company Monday - for a $54 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The two skittish brothers - they insisted on being photographed
only from behind - sealed the deal in Surrogate's Court in White
Plains with a handshake, apparently their closest contact in years.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time after two decades, Harry Winston can rest
in peace,'' said Kevin Plunkett, attorney for Ronald Winston,
Harry's older son.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Winston, 59, and an investment firm, Fenway Partners, are
paying Bruce Winston $54.1 million for his share of the fabled
company, which their father Harry started in the 1920s with $2,000
and an eye for precious stones.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Winston prospered to the point where he could buy the Hope
Diamond for $1 million, then donate it to the Smithsonian
Institution. When Marilyn Monroe sang ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best
Friend,'' it included the line, ''Talk to me, Harry Winston.''
Movie stars still borrow gems from Harry Winston Inc. for Oscar
night.
</P>
<P>
   Winston groomed his son Ronald to run the business, while Bruce
dropped out of college and spent six years roaming Europe. In his
will, Harry gave Ronald his inheritance outright, while Bruce's
would be parceled out by a trust. Ronald had control over the
company and his brother's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy with his income, Bruce Winston went to court, claiming
Ronald was mismanaging things and demanding the company be sold so
he could get his share. Ronald, insisting their father wanted more
than anything else to keep the company in the family, offered $5
million, then $17 million, for his brother's stake. Bruce refused,
forcing Judge Albert Emanuelli to order a sale.
</P>
<P>
   By partnering with Fenway, Ronald Winston, of Scarsdale,
receives enough cash to buy out his brother while still holding
onto the company, which has ''salons'' on Fifth Avenue and in
Beverly Hills, Geneva, Paris and Tokyo. He will be president,
chairman and a part owner, Plunkett said, and is delighted to be
free of ''the stranglehold that litigation had on this company.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bruce Winston, 56, who lives in Katonah, attorney David
Boies said, ''He and his family are well taken care of. He can do
whatever he wants. He has $54 million and no longer has this
litigation to worry about.'' His local attorney, Guy Parisi, said,
''Bruce is very happy to put this behind him. ... It's more
emotional than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuelli, who was thanked by both brothers for pushing the
settlement, urged them to shake hands, saying that even if they do
not leave as friends, they should think of their children and
grandchildren. ''One day you may want to call upon each other,'' he
said. ''It's what your father would have wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce stood and crossed the courtroom to Ronald, who stood to
meet him. They shook hands and smiled briefly. The only jewelry in
sight were wristwatches and Bruce's wedding band.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we resolved it,'' Bruce said outside the courtroom.
''It brought us closer together after 12 years of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Plunkett said earlier attempts at reconciliation - and even
handshakes - had failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fights are always difficult, especially between brothers,''
said Boies, who led the federal government's antitrust case against
Microsoft and is defending Napster Inc. against the recording
industry. ''This settlement frees both brothers to get on with
their lives.''

<HEADLINE> Texas-Okla. Border Compact Approved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Monday gave its consent to an
agreement between Texas and Oklahoma that settles a two-century-old
effort to determine their common border along the Red River.
</P>
<P>
   The House, fulfilling its constitutional duty to approve
compacts reached between the states, voted by voice to accept the
agreement. The compact was formally endorsed by the Texas state
government in May, 1999, and by Oklahoma in June last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to act on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Reps. Max Sandlin, a Democrat, and Mac Thornberry, a
Republican, said the boundary has been an issue since the Louisiana
Purchase nearly 200 years ago because the Red River that divides
the states changes course.
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry said an 1819 treaty with Spain, which then held what
is now Texas, set the boundary on the south bank of the river, but
the meandering river continued to cause problems. In the 1930s, the
lawmakers said, Oklahoma sent a National Guard tank to the border
where it was confronted by a Texas Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the border is to be the vegetation line on
the south bank of the Red River.

<HEADLINE> Pataki signs law to improve school safety  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Teachers will be allowed to remove disruptive
students and required to teach civility under a new law signed by
Gov. George Pataki on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If our kids can't be safe in our public schools, where can
they be safe?'' asked Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue, a former teacher who
chairs Pataki's Task Force on School Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Donohue were joined by state legislators including
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, as well as teachers' union
officials and New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy at a
bill-signing ceremony at Stuyvestant High School in lower
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''One student in a classroom who refuses to learn can prevent
all of those who want to learn from having the opportunity,''
Pataki said before outlining the provisions of the law, titled
Project SAVE, for Safe Schools Against Violence in Education.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, schools will be required to adopt codes of
conduct and file them with the state Education Department.
Additionally, officials will have to report violent incidents to
the state commissioner of education. Educators also will be
required to work with local law-enforcement agencies to develop
emergency response plans.
</P>
<P>
   The law clarifies teachers' ability to remove violent or
disruptive students from the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gerstl, legislative counsel for the United Federation of
Teachers, said teachers can now send a disruptive pupil to the
principal's office but the principal will often return the pupil to
the classroom almost immediately. ''We end up with a revolving-door
syndrome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, Gerstl said, ''the student will stay out
until the principal determines what the appropriate punishment
should be, whether it's a suspension or something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for injuring a teacher or other school employee in
an assault is also being made more serious, as the legislation
Pataki signed raises such crimes to felony status. That's one
provision applauded by Mary Anne Durham, a teacher who suffered a
neck injury during a fight involving an angry parent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about time legislation was passed with serious penalties
for those individuals who think that they can come into a school
and act violently toward those of us that work there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction in civility, citizenship and character at each grade
level is also being added to school curriculum in an effort to curb
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Future teachers and other school employees will have to be
fingerprinted and their backgrounds checked for criminal histories.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the components of the new law take effect on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   UFT President Randi Weingarten called the legislation ''the best
school safety law that this United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are kids in classrooms - and everybody who has taught
knows this - where you have 28 fabulous kids and you have one kid
you don't know what to do with,'' she said. ''You have to do
something about that.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Wants Missile Shield in N.D.  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad, trying to get
the missile shield installed in his state instead of Alaska, has an
answer to critics who say it won't protect Alaska's lightly
populated Aleutian Islands and Hawaii's uninhabited outer islands:
Pay the unprotected people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we really going to say we aren't going to protect the
whole rest of the country because of 1,500 people in the Aleutian
chain, who could be offered a generous buyout package?'' asked
Conrad, who says he hasn't decided what a fair payment might be.
''Especially in light of the fact that it would make no strategic
sense for them to be a target in the first place?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senator's argument sat poorly with Alaska's
congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that we aren't willing to sell our right to be
defended,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Rick Lehner of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization did not comment on Conrad's idea but said any missile
defense system, by law, must protect all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said the Alaska site provides the best defense
for the ''most prevailing threat'' -- North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to decide whether to move forward
with a plan for 20 missile interceptors operating with a network of
tracking radars and high-speed computers in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed with
then-Soviet Union, the United States designated its anti-missile
site as near Nekoma, N.D. Any location change requires approval
from the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   If the Russians won't accept the change, keeping the site in
North Dakota could save the United States from choosing between
breaking the treaty or not deploying a system, Conrad says.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, accused Conrad of ''playing to the
hometown audience'' in economically struggling North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's very shortsighted and relatively small of himself
to just excuse 1,500 people as not really worth that much,'' Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob King, a spokesman for Alaska's Democratic governor, Tony
Knowles, called the proposal ''somewhat callous,'' and added: ''I'm
sure the senator would not so easily propose leaving out a certain
part of his state from a national missile defense initiative and
attempt to buy off his constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer said putting the shield in his
state makes fiscal sense, since the Pentagon already has poured
billions into the site near Nekoma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayer money, foreign relations, treaty negotiation -- all of
that points to North Dakota,'' Schafer said.

<HEADLINE> Court says juries need to know insurance companies not always liable </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A jury needs to know that an insurance
company is not always liable, especially if an owner could have
taken steps to prevent property damage, the state Supreme Court
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-1 decision, the court ordered a new trial after a jury
said The Princeton Insurance Co. had to pay $150,000 to the owners
of a failed nightclub damaged by arson.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, no one disputed that the June 1994 fire was
intentionally set. But witnesses disagreed over whether the
managers of Hollywood Nights in Bloomfield turned off the automatic
sprinkler system before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The trial court judge was clearly wrong when he failed to tell
jurors the insurance company could not be held liable if something
changed on the property that would increase the risk of a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Standard fire insurance contracts allow for the policy to be
suspended if that fire risk is somehow increased. The policy is
only in effect once that fire risk is gone. State law requires that
hazard clause in all fire insurance policies, according to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our holding today is dictated as much by common sense as by a
straightforward reading of the statute,'' Associate Justice Peter
G. Verniero wrote in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The court found ''by plain logic'' that a property owner who may
have disabled a sprinkler system could be found to have ''increased
the hazard,'' Verniero wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot fathom that the Legislature would have intended a
contrary conclusion in mandating the increase-of-hazard clause in
policies,'' Verniero said.
</P>
<P>
   This decision reinforces what is a common clause in fire
insurance policies across the country, said Allan Maitlin, the
insurance company's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This clearly is the enforcement of that legislative
directive,'' Maitlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The clause is not simply a benefit to insurance companies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It keeps rates down. It gives the insurance companies the
right to make payments for risks that are only present at the time
policies are written,'' Maitlin said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki backer accused of corrupting criminal system  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Korean-American businessman orchestrated a
scheme to buy freedom for violent Asian felons through large
contributions to George Pataki's campaign for governor, prosecutors
charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments at the Brooklyn trial of Yung Soo Yoo,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Friedberg told a jury the defendant
''corrupted the (criminal justice) system with promises of early
prison release.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedberg argued that Yoo - a volunteer fundraiser for numerous
high-profile Republican candidates - and a top Pataki campaign
deputy, Patrick Donohue, solicited about $40,000 in ''bribes'' from
the families of three inmates during the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-week trial, parents of the inmates testified that
Yoo guaranteed their sons would be released once Pataki was
elected. Prosecutors pointed to a paper trail of internal memos
they said proved Donohue and administration aides pressured parole
officials to fix the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's attorney, Nicholas DeFeis, argued that there was nothing
sinister about the memos. He also noted that Donohue, the finance
director for ''Friends of Pataki,'' testified that he never
conspired with Yoo to make deals with the contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has not proven that anyone intended to
corruptly influence these agencies,'' DeFeis said. Yoo, he added,
''has no motive or incentive to do this ... He's just not that
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge, N.J., faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted on campaign corruption and obstruction of justice
charges. The jury was expected to begin deliberating on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yoo case stems from an ongoing grand jury investigation of
an alleged influence peddling by Pataki aides in parole cases. So
far three parole officials have been either charged or convicted.
</P>
<P>
   No one close to Pataki, including Donohue, has been charged. The
administration has denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Biodegradable Surgical Tools Studied  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Tiny coils used to prop open the clogged arteries
of heart patients now come in a biodegradable form -- and they may
work just as well as widely used metal versions, according to a new
study.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the biodegradable coils, called stents, could change
the way doctors perform surgery to reopen narrowed blood vessels,
according to Japanese researchers who performed the tests on a
small group of human patients.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths, heart attacks or bypass surgeries were recorded among
the 15 heart patients who were given the plastic, zigzag-shaped
coils over a six-month period, according to the lead researcher,
Dr. Hideo Tamai of Shiga Medical Center in Shiga, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, metal stents are implanted into the blockage site of
arteries through a balloon. They are used in 75 percent of all
angioplasty operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since metal is a foreign material for humans, traditional
stents sometimes cause inflammatory reactions in patients, and
there are many long-term safety concerns associated with metallic
stents,'' Tamai said.
</P>
<P>
   An inflammatory reaction can lead to a re-narrowing of the
inside of the arteries, which could lead to problems as severe as
heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the biodegradable stents, which are made of a polymer that
slowly dissolves in the months after being inserted, reduce the
rate of re-narrowing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, researchers hope to find ways to insert anti-inflammatory
drugs into the biodegradable coils so the medicine could be
delivered right into the arteries as the stents disssolve.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appeared in Monday's issues of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association. Tamai is a co-inventor
of the biodegradable stent used in the study; he worked on the
study with officials from Kyoto-based Igaki Medical Planning Co.,
which plans to market the stents.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers were careful to note the study involved too few
patients to draw a definitive conclusion, but they noted larger
human studies were being planned in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Herrmann, a cardiologist at the University of
Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study, said the findings
were interesting. But he cautioned the researchers' claims that
biodegradable stents could ultimately reduce the risk of arterial
inflammation are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that one could place a stent and not have to deal
with any of the latent concerns about inflammation would be
great,'' Herrmann said. ''But we've got to follow patients for more
than six months -- maybe even a year -- to know for sure.''

<HEADLINE> Double tragedy: Drunken driver returns to road, kills Navy ensign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSGROVE TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The driver at fault in a
head-on collision that killed a U.S. Navy officer had been cited
for drunken driving hours earlier, state police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Pangle, 37, of Woodstown was charged with driving under
the influence after registering a blood-alcohol content of 0.21
percent - more than twice the limit for drivers - at about 10:30
p.m. Saturday, according to John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state
police.
</P>
<P>
   Pangle was arrested after a caller notified state police that
someone in a black 1987 Chevrolet Blazer was driving aggressively
and erratically on Gerschel Avenue in Pittsgrove, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes after the call came in at 10:07 p.m., Trooper
Robert Gates spotted the vehicle parked along the same street.
Pangle flunked a sobriety test and was taken to state police
barracks, where he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Powell, 38, of Pennsville, a friend of his, was
contacted and came to the station to pick up Pangle. He told police
he would take Pangle home, but he took him back to the vehicle on
Gerschel Avenue, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:23 a.m., Pangle was behind the wheel when his truck
collided head-on with a car driven by Ensign John R. Elliott, 22, a
recent graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Pangle's westbound vehicle clipped a passing trailer
and then hit Elliott's vehicle head-on. Both were killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's passenger, Kimberly Hohenwarter, 22, of Westminster,
Md., survived the wreck. She was listed in critical condition
Monday in the intensive care unit of Cooper Hospital-University
Medical Center in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was charged with allowing an intoxicated person to
operate a motor vehicle. Prosecutors haven't decided yet whether to
file criminal charges, according to Michael Ostrowski, chief of
trials for the Salem County prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ostrowski nor Hagerty could say whether Pangle drank
again after his arrest. He left the station at 12:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests will be performed on his body but the
blood-alcohol content will not be known for several weeks, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a traffic incident in which innocent individuals need
not have been killed or injured,'' Hagerty said. ''Had Mr. Powell
fulfilled his obligations and responsibilities, certainly Mr.
Elliott and his passenger would not be deceased and severely
injured today.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell was sober and possessed a valid driver's license when he
arrived to take custody of Pangle, Hagerty said. That is where the
police's responsibility ended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, a 1996 graduate of Egg Harbor Township High School, was
a former National Merit Scholar, class president and a football
player. He was to attend flight school at Pensacola, Fla., in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has just ripped a piece of our life from us,'' said his
father, Bill Elliott, director of marketing and development at
Shore Memorial Hospital in Somers Point. ''We are not bitter or
angry. We are just so, so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our community, our nation, is all the poorer for his loss,''
said Richard Pitman, president of Shore Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Other states looking to follow Vermont's civil unions lead  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - Legislators in Rhode Island and New York
are looking to follow Vermont's lead in granting same-sex couples
the benefits of marriage, even if it might be called something
else.
</P>
<P>
   From New Hampshire to California, politicians are intrigued by
the civil unions statute Vermont created to grant gay and lesbian
couples rights and benefits without wandering into the politically
volatile thicket of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But most advocates say Vermont will remain a pioneer on the
issue for the foreseeable future while the public becomes more
comfortable with the idea.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be introduced until next winter, but a state senator
in New York is drafting a bill based on Vermont's statute and a
Rhode Island state representative is pushing a bill that would
expand his state's marriage laws to include same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not introduce anything but marriage,'' said Rep.
Michael Pisaturo, a Democrat from Cranston, R.I. ''I don't
necessarily see something like civil unions or domestic
partnerships as a stepping stone to marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York state Senate, Manhattan Democrat Tom Duane is
drafting a bill that his aide said would be ''similar to''
Vermont's first-in-the-nation civil unions statute, although
details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our Legislature won't be back until January, so it wouldn't be
until then,'' said Scott Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also see opportunities in New Hampshire, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Massachusetts and California for laws granting marriage
benefits, either through marriage itself or through a civil unions
compromise like Vermont's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the situation we're in is Vermont will be there and
will have to have the courage of its convictions for a while and
then, I think, it will fall into place in a number of spots,'' said
Beatrice Dohrn, a lawyer for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund, which led the legal fight in Hawaii for gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Although most advocates insist that full inclusion in marriage
statutes is the only way for gay and lesbian couples to achieve
equality, some see the civil unions statute as a good way to begin
moving toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Using Vermont as a model, other legislatures wishing to enact
equal benefits, equal status for gay and lesbian people will look
at this,'' said David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay rights organization. ''There are several
progressive legislatures around the country that would look to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's law is parallel to marriage but is a separate legal
creation. It has prompted a lot of debate around the country about
granting benefits to couples who want legal recognition and
protection for their long-term relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont lawmakers have said repeatedly that their law could be a
model for other states to emulate as they seek to steer clear of
the emotional debate about marriage. Thirty-two states have adopted
statutes specifically outlawing gay marriage. Because civil unions
aren't marriage, though, the Vermont authors of the law say,
they're a way to take a step without getting bogged down in
emotion, religion and morality.
</P>
<P>
   But to people like California Assemblywoman Rep. Carole Migden
of San Francisco, that's demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The premise of civil union is still an insult, but
nevertheless we're pleased that the state of Vermont recognizes the
quality of lesbian and gay equality in a less-than-dignified way,''
said Migden, whose state last year outlawed gay marriage in a
referendum. ''We're moving along. Each year we add to it. It's a
step-by-step building-block process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gay rights advocates caution that experiences in Hawaii and
Alaska, where courts said same-sex couples should be allowed to
marry and then lawmakers and voters reversed them, should temper
any predictions that the idea of civil unions will spread quickly
beyond Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important to bear in mind that Vermont is a
leader in not just civil unions, but in terms of hate crimes,
second parent adoption and nondiscrimination issues for the lesbian
and gay community,'' said Tim Sweeney, deputy executive director of
New York state's Empire State Pride Agenda. ''I think that's an
important context to keep in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Political considerations appear to be far from the minds of many
of the people entering into civil unions since they became the law
on July 1. Of the 115 that had been reported to the state vital
records division through Monday, more than two-thirds have been
between couples from outside Vermont. That's even though civil
unions for now are not legally recognized anywhere else in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   That alone will make a difference in other states, though,
advocates say, because it is generating debate in practically every
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole movement in Vermont has created a tremendous amount
of education and discussion about lesbian and gay relationships and
the kind of discrimination we face,'' Sweeney said. ''It's been an
extremely positive discussion and very helpful to humanize lesbian
and gay relationships and our families.''

<HEADLINE> Agency Upgrades Ford Trucks Probe  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency on Monday upgraded its
investigation of nearly 250,000 Ford Motor Co. trucks after
hundreds of drivers cited problems with braking and steering.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 233 complaints and 310 warranty claims involving
1999 and 2000 model Ford Super Duty F Series and Stripped Chassis
with Hydroboost trucks, according to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers reported losing the power assistance in steering or
braking, making the trucks harder to handle. The problem has been
cited in 13 crashes in which one person died and four were hurt,
according to NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Ford spokesman Mike Vaughn said the company is aware of the
problem and cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also upgraded its investigation into 1998 and 1999 model
years of the Kia Sephia and Sportage. Some drivers have reported
turn signals do not work while the car is in motion.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 115 complaints, 1,868 warranty claims and two
lawsuits related to the problem. There are 179,302 of the vehicles
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens safety investigations with a preliminary inquiry in
which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork that
includes any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then could be upgraded to an ''engineering
analysis,'' during which engineers study parts to see if they are
defective. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Kia is recalling 100,137 model year 1998 and 1999 Sephias
because of a NHTSA investigation into faulty fuel valves. NHTSA
found that valves on some of the vehicles stopped gas from being
pumped before the tank was full.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers will replace the faulty valve for free.
</P>
<P>
   Two cases were opened in June, according to NHTSA's monthly
report. They involve 1995 to 1998 model years of the Ford Contour
and Windstar and the Mercury Mystique.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA has received 28 complaints that the blower switch in the
Contour and Mystique can overheat, melt or burn. Five of the
complaints involved a vehicle fire. There are 878,078 of the cars
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also received 10 complaints from Windstar owners who
said the van's front suspension coil spring broke, resulting in a
collapsed suspension. In four cases, the broken coil spring
punctured the tire, once while the van was going 45 to 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes all the complaints came from states that
heavily salt roads. There are an estimated 250,000 of the cars in
the so-called ''salt belt'' states.

<HEADLINE> Hollinger International sells three newspapers to new company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The Times Herald of Olean, the Salamanca
Press, Salamanca Penny Saver and the Bradford (Pa.) Era have been
sold by Hollinger International Inc. to the newly formed Bradford
Publications Co.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford Publications is led by John Satterwhite, publisher and
editor of the Bradford Era; Conrad Black, chairman of Hollinger
International of Toronto, and F. David Radler, publisher of the
Chicago Sun-Times, president of Hollinger and chairman of its
subsidiary American Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local ownership is returning to these properties and I think
that will be good for the community,'' Satterwhite said following
the sale's completion last week.
</P>
<P>
   Satterwhite said the newspapers' operations would continue
unchanged while the new owners look to improve content and
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal will be to strengthen the franchises in each market
by concentrating on services to our readers and advertisers,''
Satterwhite said.
</P>
<P>
   American Publishing had owned the Bradford and Salamanca
newspapers since 1986. The Hollinger subsidiary acquired The Times
Herald in 1995 from Thomson Newspapers, which bought it in 1988
from the Fitzpatrick family of Olean.
</P>
<P>
   Hollinger said in April it would sell most of its community
newspapers in the United States and Canada. At the time, it owned
77 paid daily newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, the
Daily Telegraph in London and the Jerusalem Post. It also held 302
non-daily newspapers, plus magazines and other publications.

<HEADLINE> Infected mosquitoes found in Central Park, Staten Island  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile Virus have
been found in Central Park and on Staten Island, prompting city
officials to order the park closed Monday night and canceling a
concert that had been expected to draw 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The city was scheduled to spray the park with insecticide
beginning at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As a precautionary measure, on Wednesday, the ground spraying
will expand to Manhattan between 23rd and 110th streets. Spraying
previously scheduled for Staten Island on Monday night and parts of
Queens and Brooklyn on Tuesday will also take place.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said residents should not be alarmed by
the discovery of infected mosquitoes or the ground spraying of the
synthetic pesticides Sumithrin and Resmethrin, which could cause
breathing problems for the elderly and people with respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public should not have a great deal of apprehension,''
Giuliani told a City Hall press conference. ''Go about your lives
normally, but for one night, stay out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The park will close at 9:30 p.m., postponing a free performance
by the New York Philharmonic and a road race for children that had
been scheduled. Giuliani said the concert would likely be held
tomorrow evening.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of rain, spraying will take place Tuesday night,
said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of infected mosquitoes marks the first time that
the deadly West Nile virus has been found in mosquitoes in the city
this year. Earlier this summer, the virus was found in birds and
mosquitoes in the suburbs that ring the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people and infected
62 others in the New York metropolitan area, prompting the city and
neighboring areas to undertake a massive campaign of aerial and
ground spraying.
</P>
<P>
   To staunch a new outbreak this year, the city embarked on a
program of trapping and testing mosquitoes and placing flocks of
sentinel chickens around the city in order to detect the presence
of the virus early and by placing mosquito larvae eating fish in
water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious cases, the West Nile virus causes infection
resulting in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Elderly
individuals or those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The infected mosquitoes were found in Central Park near 63rd
Street on the east side of the park; and in Staten Island in the
Fresh Kills landfill and Pond Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protests about the insecticides' potential risk to human
health and animal life, Giuliani said he was primarily concerned
with human life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to wait until it shows up in human beings like
it did last year,'' said Giuliani. ''And I'm sorry, but if it kills
animals, it kills animals. My job as mayor of New York City is to
help protect human life as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the mayor's announcement, Central Park was filled
with people clad in T-shirts, tank-tops and shorts. Young men and
women lounged on the grass, parents watched over their children,
and several elderly women rested in their wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Few people were concerned by the news.
</P>
<P>
   As Ellen Wheatley looked after her playful 3-year-old daughter,
Allison, she wondered what really could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''What can I do about it - kill myself with (bug spray)?'' said
Wheatley, who was vacationing in Manhattan from her home in
Washington state. ''We already got chewed up by the bugs on the
Jersey shore, so maybe they already got us.''

<HEADLINE> Expose Details Corruption in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Detailing corruption, sex and murder in high
places, the ex-mistress of a former president's brother has written
a book that gives a lurid portrait of the behavior that helped lead
Mexicans to end the 71-year reign of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   The expose, written by Maria Bernal, the Spanish ex-mistress of
Raul Salinas, who was imprisoned for homicide shortly after his
brother Carlos left Mexico's presidency, provides a firsthand look
at the corruption that helped bring the party down.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal's main disclosure -- that Raul Salinas told her about
plans to murder a political rival in 1994 -- is less revealing,
analysts and editors agree, than her description of the
extravagance and violence in Mexico's inner circles of power.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal said that in August 1994 Salinas told her that his fellow
ruling-party member Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu ''is going to die
very soon, everything is ready.'' A few days later, Ruiz Massieu
was gunned down on a Mexico City street.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was convicted of masterminding the murder early last
year. He continues to insist he is innocent and he has disputed
Bernal's account.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''Raul Salinas and I,'' has nearly sold out of its
original print run of 20,000 copies in two weeks, indicating
Mexicans retain an interest in past scandals even as they speculate
about a future with the first opposition presidency in seven
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party was dealt a historic
defeat in July 2 presidential elections by Mexican voters driven by
a desire to air out the long-closed corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a passion to know what went on, but that passion has
to do more with morbid interest than a search for knowledge,'' said
writer and social observer Carlos Monsivais. ''I am sure that
everything will come to light.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernal's book is an account of how she met the president's
brother when she worked at a clothing store in Seville, Spain,
became his mistress, and went on to witness some of the darkest
days of Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, now 38, had testified against Salinas during his trial
and ''there isn't much in the way of statements that hadn't come
out before,'' said Oscar Davalos, an editor for Oceano publishing
house, which released the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''But what is fascinating is the first-person account of how
these people lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was a ''a brusque and clumsy'' lover whose passion
was saved for his ill-gotten wealth, Bernal writes. ''I've never
heard a man express such love for his properties.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also described Salinas family quarrels. Bernal said the
Salinas family patriarch, Raul Salinas Lozano, screamed orders over
the telephone at his sons and tried to hide their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal said one of her jobs was to catalogue the treasures
hidden at one of Salinas' ranches, so they couldn't be linked to
his brother, Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas became depressed after the May 1994 assassination
of ruling-party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, whom
he apparently considered an ally, Bernal said. She hinted he feared
another president would prosecute him for corruption, as eventually
happened.
</P>
<P>
   He is now serving a 27-year prison sentence for murder and still
faces corruption charges and has $114 million of his money frozen
in Swiss banks. Swiss prosecutors said they believed they were
profits from drug ties during his brother's administration.
</P>
<P>
   The book paints the modern rulers of Mexico in much the same
light as the hacienda-owners and conquistadors of five centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Government bureaucrats such as Raul Salinas invested in huge,
colonial-style haciendas, purebred horses, collections of exotic
animals, hunting parties, fine artwork, titanic dinner parties and
fine clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't understand how he could spend so wastefully, with so
many people going hungry in this country,'' Bernal wrote. ''He
wouldn't understand that, and would answer with a cynical smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Agustin, who has written an insider's history of Mexico,
said such scenes were likely to anger Mexicans, but might also
serve as a cautionary tale, ''so that the powerful will moderate
their grotesque and ridiculous ostentation.''

<HEADLINE> Plan Helps Chicken Contamination  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chickens that are slaughtered under an
experimental new inspection system are showing lower rates of
disease, harmful microbes and fecal contamination, the Agriculture
Department says.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of fecal contamination in seven poultry plants
dropped from 2.4 percent to 0.2 percent under the new system. The
prevalence of salmonella bacteria on the chickens dropped slightly,
from 6.1 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The project seems to be working,'' Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman
for USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, which is the subject of a court battle
between USDA and its inspectors' union, the department is
experimenting with ending its traditional poke-and-sniff method of
inspecting animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors leave it to plant employees to check the carcasses
and instead do more testing for microbes and sampling for fecal
contamination. They are also supposed to supervise the plant
workers who are doing the hands-on inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The union won a legal victory last month when a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled unanimously that federal laws require that USDA inspectors do
hands-on checks of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say that's a waste of their inspectors' time
because harmful microbes can't be detected by sight.
</P>
<P>
   The new system appears to be working, based on the results in
the seven plants, said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a government inspector does nothing all day but look at 30
birds a minute ... then they aren't able to do microbial testing or
increased fecal checks at the end of the line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Test results from nine additional plants are due by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The tests on the seven plants showed declines in every sort of
contamination or defect on the chicken carcasses, except in the
incidence of so-called dressing defects, such as stray feathers.
Such defects are not considered a concern for human health.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of poultry diseases that are considered dangerous
to humans dropped from 0.3 percent to zero under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The testing was conducted by the Research Triangle Institute, an
independent consulting firm. Data was collected on 14,000 carcasses
before and after the new inspection system was started.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seven plants are in Alabama; the rest are in
Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Governor Reports Pipe Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Another oil pipeline fire has erupted in
southeastern Nigeria, killing an undetermined number of people in
an area where similar blazes recently killed hundreds, a state
governor said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, near the village of Sapele and the oil port of Warri,
came a week after another pipeline blast in the region left dozens
of fuel scavengers dead -- and two weeks after 200 people were
killed in yet another inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James Ibori of Delta State gave few details of the latest
blaze, except that it began Sunday, that firefighters were still
battling it and that ''some people have lost their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am shocked that this is the sixth pipeline fire in the state
in two months,'' the visibly shaken governor told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the latest fire were not known, although
similar blazes in the oil-rich but poverty-ravaged Niger Delta have
been accidentally touched off as scavengers use anything from
simple funnels to sophisticated pumps to steal fuel from holes
punched in the pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the oil fires have occurred near Warri.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline vandalism, known as ''scooping,'' is common in Nigeria
despite the risk of a deadly fire or punishment which can include
being shot on sight by police.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, more than 700 people were killed in a pipeline
blast in Jesse. Since then, the government has tried to educate
villagers about the danger of scavenging pipeline fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty and residents' anger at the government and oil
industry for allegedly polluting the environment and financially
neglecting the Delta -- an area where few villages have roads,
electricity or running water despite the region's immense petroleum
wealth -- have kept the illegal practice alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of oil imported by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Bill Requires Jail Deaths Reported  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State and local prison authorities would be
required to report the circumstances behind prison deaths under
legislation that the House approved Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., the bill's sponsor, said about
1,000 men and women die questionable deaths every year while in
police custody or in jail. ''This is an obvious sign that something
needs to be done to restore accountability in prisons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed by a voice vote, now goes to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson cited a report by the Asbury Park Press of Neptune,
N.J., which found that many who die behind bars are listed as
suicides. But those conclusions often come into question because of
inadequate record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''With no one looking at these deaths from a systematic point of
view, we don't know whether there is any pattern or practice
relating to such deaths nor whether there is any training needed
among law enforcement officials which should limit such
occurrences,'' said Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   The information to be reported to the Justice Department must
include the name, gender, race, ethnicity, and age of the deceased;
the date, time and location of death, and the circumstances
surrounding the death.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 113; Dow Falls 48  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell Monday as troubled investors reacted
to weaker-than-expected corporate earnings reports that
overshadowed signs of moderating inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 48.44 at 10,685.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 112.88 at 3,981.57, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was off 15.90 at 1,464.29.
</P>
<P>
   Investors spent most of last week punishing the stocks of
technology companies that aren't living up to high earnings
expectations, and that pattern continued Monday. The trend began
when such industry bellwethers as Microsoft, Apple and Intel
surpassed Wall Street forecasts -- but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overriding consideration has been that earnings growth has
slowed from the first-quarter pace. But, nevertheless, the majority
of S&AMP;P 500 companies that have reported second-quarter earnings so
far have still beaten analysts' expectations,'' said Jack
Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been confusion, as investors also consider
encouraging remarks last week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who suggested that the Fed's efforts to stem inflation
may be working.
</P>
<P>
   The big technology stocks were taking it on the nose again
Monday. Dell Computer fell $5.937 to $46.438 after an analyst said
sales of personal computers are expected to decline. Apple, down
$4.875 to $48.688, and Microsoft, down $1.75 to $70.563, also fell
on the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that investors are growing weary of losses from
Internet retailers, Priceline.com, an online seller of airline
tickets and other items, fell $8.938 to $31.125 after reporting
second quarter losses of 1 cent a share, excluding one-time
expenses. The losses were narrower than those predicted by Wall
Street analysts, but Priceline's revenue also came in at the low
end of unofficial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, investors voiced strong disapproval of two
potential acquisitions, pulling down the shares of the companies in
question.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to falter Monday after Deutsche
Telekom said it will pay $50.7 billion for VoiceStream Wireless
Corp., giving Europe's biggest telecom company its first foothold
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price tag for VoiceStream, which is unprofitable and
only one year old, and fears that U.S. regulators may oppose the
sale, sent both stocks tumbling. VoiceStream closed down $19.75 at
$130, while Deutsche Telekom fell $6.50 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   Still, VoiceStream wireless was seen by many as an attractive
property for Deutsche Telekom because it's growing rapidly, has
licenses covering many major U.S. markets and is not part of a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
   And shares of Corning fell $32.75 to $251 on news that the
company is apparently in talks to buy Nortel Networks's fiber-optic
parts unit in a deal worth more than $100 billion. The move would
make Nortel the majority shareholder in Corning. Nortel's shares
rose 18.80 cents to $80.688.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average might have fallen further if not for a
strong earnings report from drug company Merck, whose shares were
up $5.625 at $69.375. Merck's earnings pushed up other drug stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.08 billion shares,
well below Friday's pace of 1.17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 8.45 at 514.25.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.57 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.61 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.05 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.59 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cuomo Settlement Under Scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To settle a lawsuit over housing funds, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development agreed to pay $130
million to the Puerto Rican Housing Authority, even though the
agency faces corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Now some Republicans are questioning why money is going to an
agency under federal investigation and hinted HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo may be cozying up to New York state's large Puerto Rican
constituency in advance of a possible run for governor there in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just a whole raft of questions about alleged criminal
activity (in the housing authority) that I find very troubling and
make me wonder why HUD would do this,'' Sen. Christopher Bond,
R-Mo., said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican housing officials alleged HUD's allocation formula
has consistently shortchanged their administration. They first
filed a complaint in 1975, then a lawsuit in 1996 seeking $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials denied Cuomo's political aspirations were a factor
in settling the case. HUD spokesman Leland Jones said Cuomo agreed
the funding formula was unfair and wanted a settlement that was
fair to taxpayers and the Puerto Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a landlord violates the law, do tenants get evicted? Of
course not. Then why should the people of Puerto Rico be denied
their fair share of funding because of the wrongdoing of others?''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo traveled to San Juan to announce the settlement on June 6,
four days before the Puerto Rican Parade in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement disturbed HUD Inspector General Susan Gaffney,
who sent a rare ''seven-day letter'' to Cuomo blasting the deal.
Such a letter requires a response to Congress within seven working
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, an appointee of President Clinton who spars frequently
with Cuomo, criticized HUD's ''failure to stop flagrant fraud,
waste and abuse'' in the Puerto Rican housing administration. She
said HUD should have appointed an independent third party to handle
the authority's checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   In HUD's response, Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez chastised
Gaffney, saying she had never made such a recommendation before and
that her use of a seven-day letter was inappropriate
</P>
<P>
   Bond, chairman of the committee that oversees HUD and a frequent
critic of Cuomo, fired off another letter to Cuomo on July 18
asking for additional documents on the housing authority and proof
that the Department of Justice had signed off on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials say they received Justice approval and Justice
spokeswoman Kris Watney confirmed that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe at the Puerto Rican authority is being
conducted by the HUD Inspector General's Office and the FBI.
According to a June 9 internal memo by Emil Schuster of the HUD
Inspector General's Office, the probes so far have resulted in 10
indictments and nine guilty pleas. Additional indictments are
expected, according to Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican Public Housing Administration is HUD's second
largest, trailing only New York City.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Talk of Statehood  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Should the Camp David summit fail,
the Palestinians plan to declare a state in less than two months
that would include lands still controlled by Israel, a senior PLO
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will tell the world that all of our land is under the
umbrella of the Palestinian state, including the land that Israel
should withdraw from,'' said Salim Zanoun, the chairman of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's legislative body. ''We will
consider this land occupied land of the (Palestinian) state.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was a new twist in Palestinian talk of a future
state. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and others have repeatedly
pledged to declare statehood by the Sept. 13 deadline for a final
peace agreement, but they have left open the possibility that such
a declaration would not define borders, which would leave the door
to negotiations open.
</P>
<P>
   A declaration encompassing Israeli-controlled land, however,
could invite a retaliatory annexation by Israel -- and that could
lead to an outbreak of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate on his statement Monday, Zanoun said the
''occupied'' lands include lands the Palestinians believe are due
them under interim peace agreements. Palestinians control about 40
percent of the West Bank, and say interim agreements would bring
them another 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Israel regards such lands as open to negotiation in a final
agreement. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said a unilateral
statehood declaration could prompt Israel to annex some West Bank
lands.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel on Monday, Barak's hard-line opponents -- including
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- again urged him to avoid
far-reaching concessions at the U.S.-mediated talks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such calls, a poll published in the daily Maariv Monday
showed that 59 percent of Israelis want some kind of deal reached
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   There were 590 respondents in the poll, conducted by Gallup,
with a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points. Thirty-one percent
would prefer to see the summit fail, and 10 percent said they don't
know, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli spokesmen have expressed a cautious optimism about
success at the summit, but one of Arafat's advisers dismissed that
as misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up to this moment we did not reach any conclusion,'' said
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a top aide who is in daily phone contact with
the Palestinian leader. ''I can say the situation there is
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahim said the stumbling block was Barak's refusal so far
to concede Palestinian sovereignty in east Jerusalem, claimed by
the Palestinians as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Christian and Palsestinian leaders in Jerusalem demanded Monday
that all of east Jerusalem -- including the Old City, where Muslim,
Jewish and Christian holy sites are located -- should be given to
Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Old City is part of east Jerusalem. All of east Jerusalem
... is Palestinian,'' said the statement, which the local heads of
the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Churches joined.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi, who returned from
Washington last week, said the sides should begin lowering
expectations, and prepare for yet another of the interim deals that
have characterized the peace process since its launch in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She said negotiators should aim for ''either some kind of vague
framework or damage control to prevent a total breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   In the disputed territories, each side has accused the other of
stepping up military activity.
</P>
<P>
   Waji Afouni, a security official in the West Bank town of Nablus
who trains youths in guerrilla techniques at summer camps, says the
Palestinians have lost patience after years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Israeli government continues to (deny our rights),
maybe we will find ourselves in the future forced to defend our
rights and get it back by violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers say they have recently purchased flak jackets
and night vision equipment in anticipation of an increase in
hostilities if the summit fails.

<HEADLINE> Rebels in Sierra Leone Surrender  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Dozens of rebel fighters, many of
them children, emerged without warning from the jungle and
surrendered to U.N. forces in wartorn Sierra Leone, U.N. officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Revolutionary United Front rebels accompanied by 22
child combatants turned up Saturday in the government-controled
eastern city of Kenema and handed over their weapons to U.N.
forces, U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   More fighters surrendered the same day at a disarmament facility
in the eastern town of Daru, though Befecadu could not say how
many.
</P>
<P>
   No further details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, members of the group that reignited the country's
bloody 8-year civil war in May, gave no reason for their decision
to disarm, Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   The move, however, came after the 13,000-strong U.N. force began
using force this month to maintain order -- and to restore its
credibility after the humiliating capture of hundreds of its
peacekeepers in May.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a U.N. operation successfully freed the last
233 U.N. troops who had been surrounded for weeks in the eastern
rebel stronghold of Kailahun. One Indian U.N. peacekeeper was
killed and seven injured in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a ragtag alliance of pro-government fighters
continued to push the rebels away from the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Government soldiers recaptured the western town of Lenge Koro on
Thursday, army spokesman Maj. John Milton said. One soldier was
killed and 11 rebels were captured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more in bid to oust the government
through terror. They have abandoned three peace treaties, the
latest signed in July 1999, since launching their campaign in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Albright Might Miss Asia Trip  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP)-- The open-ended Mideast summit at Camp David
jeopardizes a trip to Asia by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and a chance to quiz North Korea's foreign minister on whether the
country's ominous missile program can be diverted to civilian use.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is at the peace talks ''for the duration,'' State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday as President
Clinton and Albright pursued with Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators their detailed stands on such core issues as the future
of Jerusalem and the boundaries of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking this day by day,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had hoped to go to Bangkok, Thailand, for a meeting of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a talk with North
Korea Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun.
</P>
<P>
   She also had tentative plans to make a stop in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   If the summit ends shortly, she should be able to make the trip,
but as the talks go on, the possibility of scrubbing it increases.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's deputy, Strobe Talbott, remained in Kapan after the
conclusion of the G-8 economic summit meeting, on call to replace
Albright on the Asia trip.
</P>
<P>
   The high-level contact with North Korea reflects an improvement
in relations between the United States and a country long-denounced
as being headed by a ''rogue regime.'' The State Department stopped
using that reference after North and South Korea began
reconciliation talks during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright and others in the Clinton administration still
described North Korea as a potential foe and a prime reason for
considering an expensive system to defend the United States against
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to Pyongyang, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
said North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if
other nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked to Putin in Okinawa, and Boucher said Monday ''we
got some clarifications.'' But, the U.S. official said, ''there are
still quite a few questions'' to take up with North Korea.

Franks says Corzine's ''universal'' proposals would bankrupt
country
By NANCY PARELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With one of Capitol Hill's most prominent
budget experts at his side, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Bob
Franks said his opponent's ''universal'' proposals would ''bankrupt
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But he failed to offer any concrete alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, accompanied by House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich, R-Ohio, acknowledged voters want ways to improve education
and health care. He promised to forward his own detailed proposals
sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Franks confined his comments to criticizing
Democratic candidate Jon Corzine's proposals to provide
''universal'' health care, long-term elder care and public
preschool, estimating the programs would cost $756 billion, or
about $4,900 per taxpayer, per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one year, Jon Corzine's spending would bust the federal
budget,'' said Franks, a Congressman from Union County.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich backed him up, calling Corzine's plan a ''dinosaur'' that
is so free spending it would fail to find support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could never go to Washington with this thing,'' Kasich
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corzine camp said Franks' numbers are skewed and, in
some cases, go beyond Corzine's actual proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Jon has said is he supports universal long term health
care, education and preschool, within the context of a balanced
budget and in a way that allows us to pay down the debt and
preserve Social Security and Medicare,'' said Tom Shea, campaign
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Corzine is not immediately proposing providing
government-financed long-term care for all the elderly, Shea said.
At first, Corzine simply wants to give a $3,000 tax credit to
families who are caring for aging kin.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also calls for other reforms, such as lowering the cost
of private long-term care insurance and changing federal spending
to help more seniors stay in their homes, instead of being forced
into nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   But, referring back to Corzine's campaign ads promising
''universal'' services, and pulling numbers from a variety of
sources, including Corzine's own Web site, Franks offered some
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   He said providing long-term care to every needy elderly American
would cost $550 billion a year. That's $50,000 for 11 million needy
elderly Americans - figures taken from Corzine's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Franks also estimated that Corzine's call to give all Americans
access to health care would cost $110 billion. He arrived at that
figure using different sources, including research from the Urban
Institute, to calculate the cost of providing insurance to all
uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine's platform, outlined on his Web site, isn't quite
that ambitious. Instead, he calls for covering all children and
forcing employers to provide health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' pegs Corzine's plan for ''universal'' college at about
$50 billion, in addition to the $8 billion the federal government
already spends on college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But Franks' calculation overlooks Corzine's call to restrict
scholarships to students with a ''B'' average, which would lower
the number of eligible high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   On preschool, Franks said it would cost $38 billion per year to
provide public preschool to every 3- and 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes a 90 percent participation rate, translating to 6.8
million preschoolers, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. It
assumes half would attend full day, while half would go half day.
The estimate is based on a cost of $8,415 per child - the average
per pupil spending, according to the National Center for Education
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine doesn't specifically call for giving preschool to
every child - at least not right away. Instead, he is initially
proposing doubling the size of Head Start, the federal preschool
program for poor children.
</P>
<P>
   Franks also suggested that Corzine was unwilling to debate him,
but Shea said they are waiting to hear back from the Franks'
campaign to set up a debate schedule.

<HEADLINE> Lautenberg begins to forge legacy with donation of papers to Rutgers </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg donated
his collection of official papers from his 18-year Senate career to
Rutgers University on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, D-N.J., has begun to take steps to forge his legacy
in New Jersey as his third Senate term comes to an end this year.
He decided to retire last year after determining he did not have
the time or the heart to raise the funds required to wage a strong
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not happy about it,'' Lautenberg said Monday of his
retirement. Referring to the campaign spending of the Democratic
nominee for his seat, Jon Corzine, he said, ''Perhaps if I had
known then what I know now, I can think of several million reasons
why this decision may have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg summed up his career to a room of Rutgers
administrators Monday, citing the 1990 legislation that banned
smoking on airplanes and 1984 legislation that raised the drinking
age to 21 as key accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   His legislation ''may look narrow on the surface,'' he said, but
said the impact of a smoking ban on airplanes and the higher
drinking age has saved thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg also authored legislation that banned convicted
domestic abusers from owning a gun, and helped write the Superfund
Clean Air and Safe Drinking Water acts, as well as the Balanced
Budget Agreement of 1997 that helped produce the first balanced
budget since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not bad stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The papers - 2,000 cubic feet of them - will include drafts of
those bills, as well as correspondence, speeches and photographs
documenting his career, that ''form a window in the process of
American politics during two full decades,'' said Rutgers President
Francis L. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg spoke next to a photograph of himself at the podium
announcing the signing of the Balanced Budget Act with President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in the background. The
photograph is framed with a thank-you note from Clinton and the pen
he used to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers officials say it will take nearly two years to go
through the material, which is still in Washington. When it is
ready, it will become part of Rutgers' Special Collections and
University archives, which also houses the papers of the
congressional careers of Millicent Fenwick and former Gov. Jim
Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, a self-made millionaire and owner of a payroll
services company, defeated Fenwick in 1982 to win an open Senate
seat after serving for four years on the board of the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. He is the senior Democrat on
the Senate Budget Committee and also serves on the Appropriations,
Environment and Public Works and Intelligence committees.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Doctor Says Capitol Suspect Worsens  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A psychiatrist testified Monday that Russell
E. Weston Jr., accused of killing two police officers inside the
national Capitol, spends his time sitting emotionless, often mute,
in a federal prison hospital, his mental state clearly
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, 43, sat silently as Capt. Sally Johnson, forensic
psychiatrist with the U.S. Public Health Service, said in a
District of Columbia courtroom: ''I'm warehousing Mr. Weston in a
psychotic state.''
</P>
<P>
   As an associate warden at the hospital in Butner, N.C., Johnson
has observed Weston for almost two years. He was judged incompetent
to stand trial 4&AMP;frac12; months after officers John M. Gibson and Jacob J.
Chestnut were shot to death July 24, 1998, inside the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's evaluation led to the incompetence judgment. She also
is the author of the psychiatric report asserting Unabomber
Theodore Kaczynski was competent for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Johnson painted a picture of a profoundly
disturbed man who continues to express a ''highly delusional belief
system.'' In addition to claiming an ability to control and even
reverse time, he has said he has been targeted by the Central
Intelligence Agency, and the government has placed listening
devices in his teeth and put atomic weapons around his Montana
cabin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan is holding hearings to
determine whether Weston should be medicated forcibly in an effort
to make him competent for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Sullivan
would have to consider possible side effects of medical treatment.
The court also ordered the judge to consider whether Weston's
improvement would aid his ability to assist with his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without anti-psychotic medication, it is unlikely that he will
ever be competent to stand trial,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Weston has refused for more than a year to take medication. He
also has refused to participate actively in physical therapy
designed to help him recover from wounds sustained during a gun
battle in the Capitol. He uses a walker and wears a brace on his
left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will stay in his bed and hide under his blanket,'' Johnson
said. At Butner, Weston is secluded because he is considered a risk
to other prisoners. He also is kept under a 24-hour suicide watch.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Wins Hall of Fame Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- C.C. Sabathia pitched well in the Hall
of Fame Game on Monday, but maybe not well enough to earn a spot in
the Cleveland Indians rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Long after he left, the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied with six
runs in the eighth inning to beat Cleveland 12-7 Monday in the
annual exhibition scheduled at Doubleday Field on induction
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sabathia, the Indians' top prospect, struck out four in three
innings, allowing three hits and two walks. He gave up a three-run
homer to Greg Colbrunn in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got good stuff. I like his stuff, especially when he's
down,'' Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel said. ''He still needs to
be polished up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabathia is 3-3 with a 3.51 ERA in nine Double-A starts, and
represented Cleveland in the All-Star futures game. Asked if he
would call up the left-hander, Manuel said, ''I don't know. I'm
going to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 6-6 in the eighth when Arizona rallied for six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Terrero, who also made two great catches in center, singled
and Craig Counsell blooped a hit over the head of third baseman
Richie Sexson. Danny Klassen followed with a bouncer over the head
of the 6-foot-7 Sexson to make it 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   After Erubiel Durazo walked, Kane Davis relieved and gave up a
two-run single to Alex Cabrera. Chip Sell doubled off the
left-field fence to make it 10-6, and Damian Miller singled to
drive in two more.

<HEADLINE> NFL Broadcaster Summerall To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fifty years of involvement with the NFL might
be enough for Pat Summerall. Then again, they might not.
</P>
<P>
   Summerall announced his retirement -- sort of -- as an NFL
broadcaster Monday, effective after the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   His final assignment for Fox Sports will be the play-by-play
call of the Super Bowl in January 2002. As the 70-year-old
Summerall made clear at a news conference, however, nothing is
etched in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is Pat's call, Pat's decision,'' said David Hill,
the chairman of Fox Sports Television Networks. ''We'll do the next
two seasons with Pat and John (Madden).
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever happens after two years, it's Pat's call. It doesn't
get any better than Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall and Madden, a former head coach of the Oakland
Raiders, have been one the most prominent sports television teams
for 19 years, calling NFL games at CBS for 13 seasons and at Fox
the last six.
</P>
<P>
   Summerall and Madden have broadcast seven Super Bowls -- more
than any other network broadcasting team. In total, Summerall has
worked 15 Super Bowls on network television -- the first five as a
game analyst and the rest doing play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   His contract expires after the upcoming season. Fox will give
him a one-year extension that will allow him to call a record 16th
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He will have completed 50 years of involvement with the NFL
following next season, 10 as a player and 40 in the broadcast
booth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be 50 years in the NFL, I don't know if anyone's
ever done that before,'' he said. ''That's the story. I was sure
that next year would be the end of 50 years. This is 20 years with
John.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not retiring from broadcasting. I'll miss it, but I'm not
sure I'm going away from it. I want to take another look. I'm not
sure what I want to do at the end of two years. My health is good.
There might be other sports I might be getting involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he might call football games after next season,
Summerall replied: ''If after two years I still feel as good about
football, as enthusiastic, that's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall said he'd like to be involved in golf, a sport he
announced for CBS. Fox doesn't carry golf.
</P>
<P>
   Summerall, who plays a lot of golf, feels much better physically
after undergoing left knee replacement surgery nearly five months
ago -- his 10th surgery on an old football injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twelve pounds of titanium in there,'' he said with a smile.
''I set off every alarm in every airport.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he stays in shape by, among other things, doing
1,000 sit-ups a day in front of the television. He said it takes
him about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy for him,'' said Summerall's wife, Cheri. ''When we
started talking about it, it was the 50 years. We decided to take a
look, see where we are after two years. We decided to make it a
celebration, not a retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been sober for over eight years. His health is better
than it's ever been, better than mine. Every day he gets up happy,
he keeps me grounded. He enjoys every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall became a play-by-play announcer in 1974 strictly by
accident. He was working with Jack Buck, and CBS boss Bob Wussler
said the two sounded too much alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'As long as you want to make a change, I'd like to do
play-by-play,''' Summerall recalled. ''He said OK. It was a
Wednesday. I did a game the next Sunday with Tom Brookshier.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall's transformation to sobriety has been well-documented.
After an intervention involving, among others, former NFL
Commissioner Pete Rozelle, CBS head Peter Lund, and PGA leader
Deane Beman, he checked into the Betty Ford Clinic in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no intention of quitting, I was having too good a
time,'' Summerall said. ''I'm sure I'd be dead if I hadn't stopped.
The prescribed stay at Betty Ford is 28 days. They kept me 33
because I was so angry at the people who did the intervention, the
first five days didn't do me any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Summerall was a place-kicker and tight end for the Chicago
Cardinals and New York Giants for 10 seasons. He has been
announcing NFL games since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's more than a play-by-play announcer, Pat is football,''
Madden said. ''If it wasn't for Pat, I wouldn't be in this business
for so long. Pat Summerall is the easiest man to get along with
I've ever met in my life.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Criticized for Egg Irradiation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has approved
irradiation of eggs to kill harmful bacteria even though the
process can lower nutritional content.
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision, which was effective last Friday, FDA
found that irradiating eggs would cause no harmful side effects.
Although the eggs would contain less vitamin A, the agency said,
people generally get enough of the nutrient from other foods.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer advocacy group criticized the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The all-American breakfast is quickly becoming the
all-irradiated breakfast. The FDA's decision is not only
scientifically irresponsible, but it is an insult to Americans who
expect to wake up in the morning to a fresh, wholesome meal,''
Wenonah Hauter of Public Citizen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation, already approved this year for meat, can lower the
level of salmonella bacteria in eggs, FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs pasteurized with hot water to kill the bacteria are
available in limited markets.

<HEADLINE> Plan Lowers Chicken Contamination  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chickens that are slaughtered under an
experimental new inspection system are showing lower rates of
disease, harmful microbes and fecal contamination, the Agriculture
Department says.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of fecal contamination in seven poultry plants
dropped from 2.4 percent to 0.2 percent under the new system. The
prevalence of salmonella bacteria on the chickens dropped slightly,
from 6.1 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this pattern is maintained then I think we're on to
something on how to modify slaughter inspection ... to
significantly improve consumer protections,'' Thomas Billy,
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, which is the subject of a court battle
between USDA and its inspectors' union, the department is
experimenting with ending its traditional poke-and-sniff method of
inspecting animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors leave it to plant employees to check the carcasses
and instead do more testing for microbes and sampling for fecal
contamination. They are also supposed to supervise the plant
workers who are doing the hands-on inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The union won a legal victory last month when a three-judge
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled unanimously that federal laws require that USDA inspectors do
hands-on checks of animal carcasses.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say that's a waste of their inspectors' time
because harmful microbes can't be detected by sight.
</P>
<P>
   Billy said the government has not decided whether to appeal the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The new system appears to be working, based on the results in
the seven plants, said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a government inspector does nothing all day but look at 30
birds a minute ... then they aren't able to do microbial testing or
increased fecal checks at the end of the line,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Felicia Nestor of the Government Accountability Project,
which opposes the new inspection system, said USDA is trying ''to
turn the inspection of meat and poultry over to the industry for
self-inspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Test results from nine additional plants are due by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The tests on the seven plants showed declines in every sort of
contamination or defect on the chicken carcasses, except in the
incidence of so-called dressing defects, such as stray feathers.
Such defects are not considered a concern for human health.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of poultry diseases that are considered dangerous
to humans dropped from 0.3 percent to zero under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The testing was conducted by the Research Triangle Institute, an
independent consulting firm. Data was collected on 14,000 carcasses
before and after the new inspection system was started.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seven plants are in Alabama; the rest are in
Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Virginia.

<HEADLINE> House Urges Display of Mottos  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arguing that Americans should embrace their
religious heritage, the House on Monday voted to encourage the
display of the national motto ''In God We Trust'' in public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The motto, said bill sponsor Rep. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo.,
''unites us as a people and has made us the greatest country on the
planet. We should not run from it. We should endorse it and embrace
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one lawmaker spoke against the non-binding measure, which
passed by voice. It was one of several recent moves by the House to
give religion a more visible role in public life.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House approved a bill urging the display of the
Ten Commandments in public offices and schools. Last month, it gave
its support to Ohio's state motto, ''With God, all things are
possible,'' after a federal appeals court ruled that it violated
the church-state separation provision of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry W. Lynn of Americans United For Separation of
Church and State said that with their latest effort to ''appear
pious in the eyes of voters,'' members of Congress have
''simultaneously trivialized, politicized and manipulated
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schaffer said the nation's association with ''In God We
Trust'' goes back to 1864 when Abraham Lincoln signed a law putting
the motto on all American currency. President Eisenhower in 1956
made it the official national motto and the phrase appears over the
entrance to the Senate chamber and above the Speaker's dais in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In Schaffer's home state of Colorado the state Board of
Education recently adopted a resolution also encouraging the
motto's display in schools and other public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be engraved into our national conscience,'' said
Rep. Ronnie Shows, D-Miss., who sponsored a similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., said church and state matters
should be left to the courts, not Congress, and noted that the
Supreme Court has recently sent mixed signals on complex issues
such as school prayers and Christmas displays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are inviting localities and states into this quagmire
without any guidance at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation states that the display and teaching of the
motto should be encouraged because ''nearly every criminal law on
the books can be traced to some religious principle or
inspiration.'' The resolution states the motto ''reflects the
national sentiment that we are a religious people whose
institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.''
</P>

   The bill number is H. Res. 548.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Cops Break Up Protests  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Riot police used truncheons and water
cannons Monday to break up anti-government protests by several
thousand people ahead of the president's state of the nation
address.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 police officers were deployed to prevent the
protesters from disrupting President Joseph Estrada's speech in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Police dispersed a group of about 500 supporters of the
left-wing New Patriotic Alliance on a road leading to the House,
hours before the speech. Several protesters and at least one
newspaper photographer were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Several miles away, police sprayed water cannons at protesters
from other left-wing groups who attempted to leave a park where
they had been allowed to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance called the protests to demand Estrada's ouster and
blaming him for deterioration of the economy and what it called
''social instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada devoted much of his state of the nation address to
Mindanao, saying he would seek peace with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, but only if the rebels abandon their goal of an
independent Islamic state, stop criminal activities and disarm.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Estrada headed to the United States for an
eight-day visit, during which he will meet with President Clinton
and Defence Minister William Cohen. Estrada will also meet in San
Francisco with the heads of several Silicon Valley companies in a
bid to drum up greater investment in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Business confidence in the Estrada administration has plummeted
because of weaknesses in the economy and because of the crisis in
the southern region of Mindanoa, where the government is battling
Muslim separatists.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, he offered greater autonomy to the Mindanao
rebels and help with economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will write a new history for Mindanao,'' Estrada said. ''We
will rectify centuries of historical wrongs committed by successive
colonial powers, and decades of inequities committed by successive
Philippine governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said his next battle would be against corruption, which
remains a major problem for the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I believe the Philippine economy needs is not just
reforms, but radical restructuring from the ground up'' to remedy
decades of misdirection, mismanagement and corruption, he said.

<HEADLINE> Accused Wrestlers Given Probation  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Three Trumbull High School wrestlers
accused in a brutal hazing ritual were granted a special form of
probation Monday that might clear their criminal records in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old victim, who was hogtied and slammed against a
wall in several incidents between December and February, did not
contest the probation for his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Gerard Esposito ordered the three teen-age
boys to pay $2,500 each toward the victim's medical expenses. He
also sentenced them to 300 hours of community service apiece and
ordered them to undergo psychiatric evaluations and counseling as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the boys follow the terms of their probation and stay out of
trouble for two years, their records could be wiped clean.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what was going through your heads, but you've got
two years to earn yourselves a dismissal. Take advantage of that,''
Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Former wrestling team co-captains Daniel Rocco Scinto, 19, and
Jeremy Maxwell Dommu, 18, and teammate Christopher Ricci, 16,
apologized in court to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry this ever happened,'' Scinto told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who has not been identified, is a special education
student who suffers from attention deficit disorder and a
hyperactivity condition.
</P>
<P>
   The victim did not appear in court, but his lawyer, Howard
Klebanoff, said he expects to file civil lawsuits, possibly against
the Trumbull public schools and the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a family that is seeking vengeance. It's a family
that seeks justice,'' Klebanoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the wrestlers said their clients also endured hazing
to get on the wrestling team, such as having their heads shaved or
being hung on towel hooks by their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of activity has been going on at Trumbull High
School for years,'' said Andrew Bowman, the lawyer for Dommu.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci's lawyer, Salvatore DePiano, said such hazing went on with
the knowledge of school authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wanted to be on the wrestling team, you had to go
through the hazing,'' DePiano said.
</P>
<P>
   School leaders have said such activity is prohibited in the
student conduct policy, which forbids intimidation, harassment or
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Peggy Kelley opposed the probation,
saying the charges were much too serious to warrant probation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley described the case as ''one of the most offensive cases I
have ever prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Scinto was charged with unlawful restraint and third-degree
assault. Dommu was charged with unlawful restraint and reckless
endangerment, and Ricci was charged with unlawful restraint and
attempted assault.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight members of the wrestling team were charged.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of five wrestlers have been resolved in juvenile
court. Three served a week in the juvenile detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the accused wrestlers were suspended for 10 days and
then expelled from school, and an eighth team member was suspended
for two days.

<HEADLINE> Miller Gets Coverdell's Senate Seat  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia's Democratic former governor Zell Miller
was appointed Monday to the late Republican Paul Coverdell's Senate
seat and said he will run for the remaining four years of the term
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, officially announced the
appointment Monday evening, saying Miller, 68, was the
best-qualified person from either party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one who didn't want it was the one who had to take it,''
he said. ''It used to take seniority to get things done in the
United States Senate. Now it takes stature. And Zell Miller has the
stature it takes to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Miller increases the number of Democrats in
the Senate to 46. There are 54 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, died of a stroke last week. In 1998, he became
the first Georgia Republican since Reconstruction to be re-elected
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I accept this mission with a heavy heart and a profound sense
of duty,'' Miller said. ''The state we love lost one if its finest
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller left office as one of the most popular governors in
Georgia history. The Georgia Constitution prevented Miller from
running for a third term in 1998. His approval rating soared above
85 percent, thanks mostly to his lottery-funded program that gave
college scholarships to any high school students with a ''B''
average or better. Some Democrats had suggested he run against
Coverdell for Senate, but Miller instead retired and began teaching
college courses.
</P>
<P>
   Miller praised Coverdell for his ability to build consensus
between the two parties and said he would do the same when he gets
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, any candidate who pays the $4,101 qualifying fee can
take part in a nonpartisan election for the remaining four years of
the term. If no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two
will meet in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's popularity with voters is expected to scare off any
other serious Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited,'' Georgia Democratic Sen. Max Cleland said.
''Georgians are fortunate to have someone of the quality and
caliber of Zell Miller to step in. I can't wait to help Gov. Miller
gain a foot hold up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials were attempting to unite behind one
candidate, probably one of Georgia's eight Republican congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (Miller's appointment) probably sends the strongest
signal I know that we need to be focused and united behind a
candidate in this race,'' state Republican Party Chairman Chuck
Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was elected lieutenant governor -- the No. 2 office in the
state -- in 1974 and served for 16 years. He was elected governor in
1990 -- beating Andrew Young and Barnes, among others, in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Miller gave Georgians a chance to vote on a state
lottery, which passed. The lottery funds several popular education
programs, including HOPE Scholarships, a plan copied by several
other governors and President Clinton, a longtime friend of Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller campaigned for Clinton in 1992 and pushed up the Georgia
presidential primary in 1992 to help his fellow Democratic
governor. Miller also introduced Clinton to campaign strategist
James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll be an excellent candidate and an excellent
senator,'' said state Rep. Larry Walker, the House Democratic
leader. ''He'll be in the Sam Nunn, Richard Russell mold.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Costs Much in Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- States and localities will lose between $300
million and $3.8 billion in tax revenue this year because of
purchases over the Internet, the General Accounting Office said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said the wide disparity
was due to the difficulty of documenting Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic retailers are not compelled to collect sales taxes
from customers unless goods are being sent to a state where the
retailer has a store or other physical presence. That makes much of
the Internet a tax-free zone, although buyers are supposed to pay
applicable taxes voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   James R. White, the GAO's director of tax policy, said auditors
constructed computer models and used their own estimates because
getting any hard data was almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were few reliable data sources on which to base the
calculations,'' White wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said it reviewed studies already done for interest
groups; consulted trade publications such as ''eMarketeer''; and
examined data from industry experts like Marketing Logistics Inc.,
Forrester Research Inc. and Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors also collected state estimates of sales tax compliance.
That is an important component in the debate, since states rely on
merchants to collect the money and relay it to their revenue
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Then the GAO experts constructed formulas, plugged in both rosy
and gloomy scenarios and came up with a wide-ranging result.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers, under the GAO's estimates, are Texas,
forfeiting between $26 million and $342 million this year; and
California, $23 million to $533 million.
</P>
<P>
   States that do not have applicable sales or use taxes --
Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon -- lose no money.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was done at the request of Sen. George Voinovich,
R-Ohio, who favors taxing Internet commerce.

<HEADLINE> Ark-Monticello Losing Streak Widens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, Ark. (AP) -- It may be the middle of summer, but
Arkansas-Monticello's football losing streak just got 11 games
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The streak reached 33 games Monday when the school forfeited its
four victories from last season for eligibility and financial-aid
violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Boll Weevils had a 22-game losing streak entering the 1999
season -- the nation's longest losing streak at the time -- and beat
Stillman College 30-7 last Sept. 4. Stillman was playing its first
game in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus three other victories, were wiped out and instead of
a 4-7 season, the school listed its record as 0-11.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's 21-game losing streak still will be listed as
the longest current string in the nation, the NCAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Campbell, a statistician at the association's headquarters
in Indianapolis, said the NCAA will not count the additional losses
for Arkansas-Monticello because the forfeits were on the school's
initiative and not the result of NCAA sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   School spokesman Jim Brewer said three players took only 11
hours during the spring semester of 1999. NCAA regulations require
that student-athletes take 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Brewer said, work-study funds for two of the athletes were
paid for out of athletic department funds in violation of Gulf
South Conference and NCAA violations. The payments -- $247.20 for
each athlete -- would have been OK if they had come from any other
university account, Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said that while the school was ''technically'' 0-11 last
season, it still would note in its records that it was 4-7 on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas-Monticello Chancellor Fred Taylor said that, in
addition to the forfeits, the Boll Weevils imposed additional
sanctions. They include excluding UAM from a conference television
package, paying the league double the amount of money paid to the
athletes and limiting recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply regret these violations and have taken steps to
ensure that these types of infractions do not occur again,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The school said it would be eligible to compete for the Gulf
South Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Stillman game, the Boll Weevils forfeited
victories over Southern Arkansas (23-20), Valdosta State (35-31)
and West Alabama (23-17).
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the NCAA was still reviewing the players'
eligibility status for the 2000 season. The Boll Weevils open the
season Sept. 2 at Tusculum College in Greeneville, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apologizes for S.Korea Dumping  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The U.S. military issued a public
apology Monday for dumping formaldehyde into the Han River, a main
source of drinking water for Seoul's 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I officially express to you my deepest apology for the
incident,'' Lt. Gen. Daniel J. Petrosky, commander of the 8th U.S.
Army, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first public apology issued by the U.S. military in
South Korea since its deployment here in the 1950-53 Korean War.
Earlier this month, the military admitted releasing 20 gallons of
formaldehyde into the Han River in February.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Samuel Taylor, Petrosky's spokesman, read the statement to
television cameras. In it, Petrosky said the U.S. military will
take ''appropriate corrective action'' after an inquiry is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will be led by Maj. Gen. Barry Bates, who is
responsible for all U.S. Army installations in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Outside South Korea's Defense Ministry, where the apology was
issued, about a dozen South Korean activists demonstrated Monday,
unfurling a U.S. flag with ''Ugly U.S. Army!'' scrawled on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We demand that the 8th Army commander apologize in person and
punish those responsible for the chemical dumping,'' said the Rev.
Moon Jung-hyun, a Roman Catholic priest who led the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Petrosky could not issue the apology in person
because he was traveling to the United States to see his daughter,
who was seriously injured in a traffic accident last week.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military command said it believes the formaldehyde
caused no harm to public health, since it was treated in the sewage
system and diluted with waste water.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean activists say formaldehyde can cause cancer over
long exposures. In water, it can kill fish and other aquatic
creatures, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Han River is a major source of drinking water for Seoul's 12
million people.

<HEADLINE> Donovan McNabb Leads Eagles  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Donovan McNabb was nearly booed out of
Philadelphia just seconds into his Eagles' career. A year later,
he's won over the fans and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, the No. 2 pick in the 1999 NFL draft, has a strong arm
and tremendous athletic ability. But it's his confidence and
maturity that's made him the team leader in just his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's taken that responsibility on his shoulders to be the
leader,'' said Koy Detmer, the starting quarterback before McNabb
and Doug Pederson arrived in Philadelphia. ''It's not something he
works hard to do. He's a natural. He's not a rah-rah guy. He enjoys
having fun and guys follow his lead, his example.''
</P>
<P>
   In a football-crazed town starved for a winning team and a true
hero, McNabb is ready for the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   While troubled stars Eric Lindros of the Flyers and Allen
Iverson of the 76ers must overcome conflicts with the management of
their respective teams, McNabb is on the verge of making
Philadelphia his city. He's already made the Eagles his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''He comes from a program where he was asked to be the leader of
the Syracuse football team. We've done the same thing,'' Eagles
coach Andy Reid said. ''I don't think that's a part that he
struggles with. He handles that in a humble manner, yet a forceful
manner in the huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 23-year-old seems to thrive in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I was the leader from last year,'' McNabb said. ''Being
in the quarterback position, that comes with the tag. Knowing that,
you have to be prepared for everything you may be faced with, be
ready to suffer through adversity. When you do that, guys know
you're prepared, you're ready to go and they'll follow.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb sat patiently while Pederson began last season as the
starting quarterback. He stepped in during Week 10, and finished
with eight touchdowns, seven interceptions and a 60.1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are irrelevant compared to the intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb was the first to arrive at the stadium and last to leave,
often taking films home to study. He showed a willingness to play
hurt, returning early from a knee injury to play a meaningless
season finale.
</P>
<P>
   And from Day One, he demonstrated remarkable character,
especially the way he handled the infamous Philly boo-birds on
draft day.
</P>
<P>
   ''You begin to win, people will begin to jump on the
bandwagon,'' McNabb said after getting a rude welcome from about 30
Eagles fans who went to New York to urge the team to draft running
back Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   After the season, McNabb continued to work hard. He spent most
of the offseason practicing with wideout Charles Johnson in
Phoenix. He attended all of the team's minicamps and showed up
early for training camp. His entire vacation consisted of only one
week -- a trip to Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   The extra work is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of full practices, McNabb connected with
Johnson on a broken play that appeared to have been designed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were on the same page. We free-lanced it and made something
happen,'' Johnson said. ''It seemed like an actual play. It looks
like a relationship is building.''
</P>
<P>
   As the relationships continue to build and the team continues to
improve, expectations in Philadelphia will only become greater.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans will be disappointed if the Eagles don't win eight
games this season. They won a total of eight games the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just worry about what I need to do and that's play
quarterback,'' McNabb said. ''I don't worry about how people feel,
where they think we may end up or what our record will be. Anytime
you get involved in that, you begin to lose focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, McNabb has greater expectations than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has very high expectations for himself,'' Reid said. ''I
don't think anybody's expectations are higher than what he expects
for himself. He won't downplay that. He expects to go out and play
good football and, from a coach's standpoint, you don't want it any
other way than that.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' RT Leon Searcy Injured  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jacksonville Jaguars right tackle Leon
Searcy could be out for the season after tearing a tendon above his
right knee during practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The injury came during one-on-one drills at the start of morning
practice at training camp. Searcy rode off the field on a cart,
clutching his right knee, wincing in pain. He'll need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars said Searcy suffered a ''significant tear'' of the
quadriceps tendon. The team didn't say how long the ninth-year Pro
Bowl tackle will be out, but bad tears of the quadriceps can take
up to nine months to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line is the last place the Jaguars can afford an
injury, and Searcy is the last guy the team expected to go down. He
has missed only two games since 1992 and only one since he joined
the Jaguars in 1996. The one game he missed in Jacksonville was due
to an infected thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a freak incident,'' said defensive lineman Renaldo
Wynn, who was working opposite Searcy when the injury occurred.
''You don't expect something like that to happen, especially with
the caliber player Leon is. You've just got to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville came into camp without left tackle Tony Boselli,
who is finishing rehabilitation on the knee ligament he tore last
season. Last year's left guard, Ben Coleman, is now playing for San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   If the season were to start tomorrow, Coughlin said, the Jaguars
probably would start second-year player Anthony Cesario and rookie
Brad Meester -- neither of whom has taken an NFL snap -- and Steve
Ingram, a journeyman who has played in eight NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   Another inexperienced lineman, Todd Fordham, is coming off a
knee injury suffered last preseason. Rookie Joe Chustz, a
fourth-round draft pick, also pulled up lame Monday, with an aching
lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've got two guys who can't work at a position, that's
where the injuries are going to come,'' Coughlin said. ''It's
inevitable, but that's what happens. You don't feel sorry for
yourself. You just keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult without Searcy, who protects
left-handed quarterback Mark Brunell's blind side and is widely
considered one of the best blockers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Many people feel if Boselli were not on the line with him, it
wouldn't have taken Searcy nine years to be voted to his first Pro
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's pretty darn important,'' Coughlin said. ''But hopefully,
it's not something we can't overcome.''

<HEADLINE> 2000 Seahawks Have Youthful Look  </HEADLINE>
By MARK JEWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- One of coach Mike Holmgren's big tasks this
year is to temper the Seattle Seahawks' youthful exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   After going 9-7 in the regular season and making the playoffs in
Holmgren's first year in Seattle, the Seahawks lost or got rid of
several veterans and restocked with younger players, including nine
rookies from the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just seven players on the team's 88-man training camp
roster are 30 or older. Nearly all the rest were born in the decade
of disco and leisure suits.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the team's four-week training camp Monday,
Holmgren said he will enlist the few experienced hands he has left
to help guide the youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm asking of the older guys is to play better than they
played last year. That's the first thing they have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if they have time, yeah, that's part of their
responsibility, too, is take the young guys along and teach them
how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift toward youth is most evident on the offensive line,
where veterans Kevin Glover, Brian Habib and Grant Williams were
all cut in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Competing to fill those vacancies will be first-round draft pick
Chris McIntosh, second-year player Floyd Wedderburn and third-year
man Todd Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks also are youthful at wide receiver, thanks in part
to Holmgren's trade of veteran Joey Galloway to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The team's new receiving corps includes veterans Sean Dawkins
and Derrick Mayes, along with second-year-player Karsten Bailey and
Darrell Jackson, a rookie out of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren is impressed with Bailey and Jackson early in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to stop calling them young guys,'' he said. ''They
are going to get their chance to play a lot in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they got off to a great start.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Jon Kitna hopes he and his teammates can
avoid mixing up Bailey and Jackson, both of whom boast good hands
and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two clones out there with Karsten Bailey and Darrell
Jackson,'' Kitna said. ''I told Karsten not to get offended if
someone calls you Darrell or vice versa, because they look exactly
alike out there and their jersey numbers are only one number apart
(Jackson 82, Bailey 83).''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna hopes Holmgren can work the same kind of magic he did at
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   From 1992-98, the Holmgren-coached Packers built young talent
into a team that made two Super Bowl appearances -- winning once --
and compiled a 75-37 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at Green Bay and how they built their team, it's
similar'' to the Seahawks,'' said Kitna, a fourth-year quarterback.
''They built it with young talent and surrounded it with a few
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''They sustained greatness for a long period of time, whereas if
you try to fill every need in one year, you kind of fade in and
fade out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think coach Holmgren is building a program.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Appointed to Senate Seat  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia's Democratic former governor Zell Miller
was appointed Monday to the late Republican Paul Coverdell's Senate
seat and said he will run for the remaining four years of the term
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, officially announced the
appointment Monday evening, saying Miller, 68, was the
best-qualified person from either party.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one who didn't want it was the one who had to take it,''
he said. ''It used to take seniority to get things done in the
United States Senate. Now it takes stature. And Zell Miller has the
stature it takes to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he accepted the job ''with a heavy heart and a
profound sense of duty,'' adding, ''The state we love lost one if
its finest citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Miller increases the number of Democrats in
the Senate to 46. There are 54 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, died of a stroke last week. In 1998, he became
the first Georgia Republican since Reconstruction to be re-elected
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller left office as one of the most popular governors in
Georgia history. The Georgia Constitution prevented Miller from
running for a third term in 1998. His approval rating soared above
85 percent, thanks mostly to his lottery-funded program that gave
college scholarships to any high school students with a ''B''
average or better. Some Democrats had suggested he run against
Coverdell for Senate, but Miller instead retired and began teaching
college courses.
</P>
<P>
   Miller praised Coverdell for his ability to build consensus
between the two parties and said he would do the same when he gets
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 7, any candidate who pays the $4,101 qualifying fee can
take part in a nonpartisan election for the remaining four years of
the term. If no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two
will meet in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's popularity with voters is expected to scare off any
other serious Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited,'' Georgia Democratic Sen. Max Cleland said.
''Georgians are fortunate to have someone of the quality and
caliber of Zell Miller to step in. I can't wait to help Gov. Miller
gain a foot hold up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials were attempting to unite behind one
candidate, probably one of Georgia's eight Republican congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think (Miller's appointment) probably sends the strongest
signal I know that we need to be focused and united behind a
candidate in this race,'' state Republican Party Chairman Chuck
Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was elected lieutenant governor -- the No. 2 office in the
state -- in 1974 and served for 16 years. He was elected governor in
1990 -- beating Andrew Young and Barnes, among others, in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Miller gave Georgians a chance to vote on a state
lottery, which passed. The lottery funds several popular education
programs, including HOPE Scholarships, a plan copied by several
other governors and President Clinton, a longtime friend of Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Miller campaigned for Clinton in 1992 and pushed up the Georgia
presidential primary in 1992 to help his fellow Democratic
governor. Miller also introduced Clinton to campaign strategist
James Carville.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Miller's accomplishments in education, economic
development and crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every job he has ever held -- as a U.S. Marine, college
professor, lieutenant governor and governor -- Zell Miller has put
the interest of hardworking families first,'' Clinton said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Barnes missed an opportunity to make
history by appointing a black. Several black Democrats, including
Attorney General Thurbert Baker, had been mentioned as contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the state's most powerful blacks, state Sen. Charles
Walker of Augusta, said he ''concurs 100 percent'' with the
decision.

<HEADLINE> Woods Eyes Golf's Triple Crown  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Only four players had won the
career Grand Slam until Tiger Woods completed the cycle with an
unprecedented romp around the Old Course to win the British Open.
Next up is a chance to join some really exclusive company.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan was the only player who won three major championships
in one year, in 1953. That's what awaits Woods next month, when he
makes his first visit to Valhalla Golf Club for the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always said you would like to have your game peak at four
different times a year,'' Woods said. ''That's something you always
hope for and plan for. To actually have it happen is a different
story. Hopefully, my game will be ready for the PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else better hope he gets lost on his way to Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Winning major championships is not an issue with Woods. Lately,
the only drama is what kind of record will fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, he became the first player to
finish in double digits below par (12 under), broke a 138-year-old
record with his 15-stroke victory and tied the U.S. Open scoring
record at 282.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Woods arrived at the home of golf and made even
more history.
</P>
<P>
   He won the British Open with a 19-under 269, a record score at
St. Andrews and the lowest score in relation to par ever in a major
championship. His eight-stroke victory over Ernie Els and Thomas
Bjorn was the widest in 87 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two majors -- one the toughest test in golf, the other the
oldest. Woods won them by a combined 23 strokes, playing 31 strokes
below par.
</P>
<P>
   ''In one way, it is incredible to watch a guy play so much
better than the rest of the world,'' said Els, a runner-up in all
three majors this year. ''In another way, it's tough to sit down
here and talk about him every time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might have to get used to it, but I guess that's the way it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's gone for just about everybody this year.
Aside from two bad holes in the first round of the Masters -- a
double bogey and triple bogey -- Woods might very well be going for
the Grand Slam in one year.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have anything that remotely resembled trouble in the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course has 112 pot bunkers, but the only time Woods even
glimpsed any of them was when he watched chief challenger David
Duval flail away four times to get out of the Road Hole bunker on
No. 17 in the final round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in a bunker every day,'' Woods said. ''But it was on the
practice green.''
</P>
<P>
   He made only three bogeys all week, two of them on three-putts.
The British Open is regarded as the one major where luck is the
best club in the bag, only Woods never needed a fortuitous hop over
four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   He knew exactly where he was going -- into the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ''To win a major championship, it is a different thought process
and a different understanding of the game,'' he said. ''Most
majors, you're going to have to go out there and understand that
par is a wonderful score. It brings out the best in players, guys
who can strike the ball the best, keep their emotions in check and
make the big putts.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all that.
</P>
<P>
   If par is a good score in majors, Woods has been simply great.
Including his 4-under 284 at Augusta National, where he finished
fifth behind Vijay Singh, Woods is now 35 under in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a spectacular performance, to say the least,'' said
Duval, whose triple bogey on No. 17 dropped him out of the top 10
in the British Open, and caused him to lose his No. 2 spot in the
world ranking to Els.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has been that way for over a year now.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was his 23rd consecutive round under par. He has six
victories in 14 events this year, and 15 out of his last 27 over
the last 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is something supernatural,'' said Tom Watson, who had been
the last player to win the British Open and U.S. Open in the same
year. ''He has raised the bar to a level that only he can jump.
Someone is going to have to use some Flubber in the bottom of their
shoes to be able to jump over that bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is the only player to win the British Open at five
courses, none at St. Andrews, the old, gray town where golf has
been played for more than 500 years -- but never like this.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other champions had won a British Open with four rounds
in the 60s -- Greg Norman at Royal St. George in 1993, and Nick
Price in 1994. The Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club tried to toughen the
Old Course by moving five tee boxes back and making the walls of
the bunkers nearly vertical.
</P>
<P>
   Look for a new rule next year that says anyone still in their
20s who already has won the Grand Slam must play with one hand tied
behind the back.
</P>
<P>
   Or use the gutta-percha ball.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woods did that on the 342-yard ninth hole during a
practice round. He still made par.
</P>
<P>
   ''What really stinks about it is the fact you can't control
him,'' Paul Azinger said. ''In every other sport, you can control
your opponent. Except for this sport. You can only focus on your
own game.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Woods is focusing on the record books.

<HEADLINE> Denver's Schlereth Has 27th Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- As surgical patients go, Denver Broncos
lineman Mark Schlereth deserves more than a medical chart. His
history reads more like a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Schlereth is a scientific marvel, visiting the surgeon as
often as most people visit the dentist. He latest trip came Monday
when he had arthroscopic surgery to remove a bone chip in his left
knee.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure at the Steadman-Hawkins Clinic in Vail marked the
27th time Schlereth has undergone some type of surgery in his
12-year career with the Broncos and Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The left knee has received the most attention, surgically
repaired 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a great pain threshold, and most guys probably would
have been retired a number of years ago,'' Denver coach Mike
Shanahan said. ''I think the doctors said that it was the worst
knee that they've every seen. That gives you an idea of what kind
of pain he plays with.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlereth, one of Denver's most dependable -- if not durable --
offensive linemen, hyperextended his knee Friday and has not
practiced since. He is expected to be out at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With three Super Bowl rings, it would be understandable if
Schlereth decided to call it a career, but he seemed determined to
play out the final year of his contract despite operations on his
knees, elbows, eyes and back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all think about whether we want to come back or not,''
Broncos lineman David Diaz-Infante said. ''It's not easy to do,
especially with what he's been through. Mark has made a commitment
to people and he likes to honor those.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlereth deserves a Medal of Honor for his dedication and
perseverance. In 1998, he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee
and was back in the starting lineup 13 days later. Because the
Broncos had a bye week, he did not miss a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the big question mark is, 'Can he keep on coming back
and play at the same level?' We're hoping he can,'' Shanahan said.
''But if he can't, someone will have to step up and play in his
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   With Schlereth sidelined, second-year lineman Lennie Friedman
has filled his spot at left guard. Friedman is returning from a
torn anterior cruciate ligament his left knee, leaving him 26
surgeries behind Schlereth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there are many warriors like Mark Schlereth,''
Friedman said. ''I think he's a unique man and that's why he's as
good as he has been in the NFL. He's just an unbelievable
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Friedman's injury came during the first week of training
camp last July, he was able to gain some experience in the
offseason by playing for the Barcelona Dragons in NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, Denver's second-round draft pick in 1999, also spent
his spare time learning the Broncos' offense and watching veteran
linemen Schlereth, Dan Neil and Tony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing was to go to meetings last year and pick up
as much of the offense as I can,'' Friedman said, ''so when I came
here it wasn't like learning everything all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Schlereth's experience and knowledge, missing two
weeks should not be a problem. Shanahan said staying in shape is
the biggest concern, and he joked that the latest surgery was
preordained.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of two-a-days for him,'' Shanahan said. ''I
honestly think he did it on purpose to be with his family for a
couple days.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Larkin Drained After Weekend  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- First baseman Sean Casey was sitting at home
watching television Sunday night when a stunning announcement
scrolled across the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The small, moving type said that the Cincinnati Reds had agreed
to a three-year contract extension with shortstop Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a typo,'' Casey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. One of the weirdest days in the Reds' recent history
began with Larkin blocking a trade to the New York Mets and ended
with him getting a stunning extension -- three years at $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   After a topsy-turvy five days of the Reds butting heads with
their team captain, they gave in and gave the 36-year-old Larkin
what he had asked for -- a chance to stay in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little shocked, just because of the way everything was
drawn out,'' outfielder Dmitri Young said before Monday night's
game against Houston. ''Evidently the powers that be saw the
reaction from the players, the front office and most importantly
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he came to bat and got all those standing ovations and
all, I believe that took a toll right there. Barry got what he
wanted, the team got what it wanted and everybody's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy and harried, too. When Larkin walked into the clubhouse
Monday, he still had the look of someone who had been through an
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm drained,'' he said, sitting in his dressing cubicle.
''It's been emotional, man. This has been a tough three, four, five
days for me. I'm a little more at ease, but it's been draining.
It's been taxing. And yesterday came as a total shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five days earlier, the Reds had told Larkin they couldn't
give him a three-year contract for $27.9 million. General manager
Jim Bowden arranged a trade with the New York Mets that Larkin
blocked. Hours later, owner Carl Lindner did an about-face and
offered the three-year, $27 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin agreed that the fans' reaction over the weekend had
something to do with it. He got extended standing ovations before
each at-bat and pro-Larkin banners flapped around the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again I'll say I appreciate the support I've received
over the last couple of days,'' Larkin said.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were relieved that the ordeal was over. Despite
losing starter Denny Neagle in a trade to the Yankees and having
their team captain shopped in a trade, the Reds chopped their
10-game deficit in half in the NL Central the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having that whole thing behind us is huge,'' Casey said. ''We
were looking over our shoulders because we weren't sure what was
going on with Larkin.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one loose end: How the Reds will pay for it. Larkin
deferred nearly a third of the $27 million over 15 years, but the
Reds still have budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chief operating officer John Allen said Monday the club is still
studying raising ticket prices this season. The Reds have Larkin
and Ken Griffey Jr. under contract, have to invest $30 million in
their new ballpark and will lose 14,000 seats in the current one
when the season ends. The outfield stands at Cinergy Field will be
razed to make room for the new ballpark, scheduled to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not just looking at it because of Barry,'' Allen said.
''It's something we've been talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the club's payroll won't change substantially next
season, which will make for a tight squeeze because some of their
young players will be eligible for arbitration -- Danny Graves,
Casey, Pokey Reese among them.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds opened this season with a $44 million payroll, ranking
21st in the majors. Allen said next year's payroll will be about
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see it tremendously more than that, and I don't see it
dramatically below that, either,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> Larry Ellison Finishes Yacht Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Larry Ellison and his Maxi 78
Sayonara completed the Chicago-to-Mackinac yacht race Monday in 41
hours and 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough to take the Mac Race's First-to-Finish
honors in the Performance Handicapped Racing Federation. Last year,
Ellison was two minutes and four seconds short of the race's
fastest time of 25 hours, 50 minutes and 44 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Others finishing Monday in the PHRF division were the Zephyrus
IV and Magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Mongoose won First-To-Finish honors in the One Design division.
The yacht, skippered by Robert Sailelli, arrived at Mackinac Island
at 1:58 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Penny Beatty of the Chicago Yacht Club said a
calm wind turned racing yachts into ''bobbing corks'' a few short
miles from the finish line of the 330-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no wind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., race officials hadn't heard from Sayonara, she said,
but Ellison and Sayonara rolled past the finish line at 8:17 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Race officials also had a tough time tracking the boats Sunday
night because the island lost power, she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 sailors set out Saturday in more than 300 boats
in the 93rd running of the race. The course runs from the shores of
Chicago northward through Lake Michigan, under the Mackinac Bridge
and into Lake Huron, ending at Mackinac Island.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more prominent racers include singer Bob Seger and
millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett, a catamaran racer.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett holds the race's multihull race record -- 18 hours, 50
minutes, 32 seconds -- set in 1998. Fossett is also known for
intercontinental hot-air balloon journeys.

<HEADLINE> Advocates Urge Constitution Change  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Claiming the Constitution makes them
second-class citizens, foreign-born Americans and their advocates
urged a congressional subcommittee to allow them to run for
president after being U.S. citizens for 20 years instead of banning
them completely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise, millions of naturalized Americans will continue to
be victims of discrimination,'' said Raimundo Delgado, a teacher
from New Bedford, Mass., who became an American citizen after
leaving Sao Miguel in the Azores. ''All naturalized Americans
should have full civil rights under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires presidential candidates to be
''natural-born.'' Naturalized Americans are disqualified from the
nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   However, at least one foreign-born American told the House
Judiciary constitutional subcommittee that a change would be a bad
idea. ''To be able to run for president is not a right,'' said
Balint Vazsonyi, director of the Center for the American Founding.
</P>
<P>
   Vazsonyi, who became an American citizen after leaving Hungary,
said he believes that Americans have ''a unique brand of tolerance,
a balanced temperament and a natural goodwill toward the world''
that takes immigrants at least a generation to develop. He also
said he thought it unreasonable to expect immigrants to fully
understand the American ''Rule of Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Again, it is a miracle that so many immigrants are able to
operate within the American system of laws, contracts and
agreements on a handshake,'' he said. ''On the other hand, to
expect that someone who did not grow up with any of that could be
the guardian of our legal system is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment to change the presidential
requirement from a ''natural-born'' American to a person who has
been an American citizen for 20 years is unlikely to pass this
year, given the limited time left in the congressional session,
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Indictments filed against 15 in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Manhattan prosecutors filed indictments Monday
against 15 men who have been accused of attacking - and in some
cases sexually abusing - women in Central Park after last month's
Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury charged the 15 defendants variously with riot,
sex abuse, assault and robbery. Most are accused of dousing women
with water and groping their buttocks and breasts on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried scheduled Sept. 6 as
the next court date for 12 of the defendants, and next Monday as
the date for three others.
</P>
<P>
   Several defense lawyers told Fried they needed time to review
more than 40 videotapes of the park attacks being turned over by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Five jailed defendants asked for reduced bail Monday and Fried
lowered bail for four of them with the prosecutors' consent.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 27 defendants have been charged and are being
prosecuted as adults. Of those 27, 15 have been indicted. Felony
complaints have been filed against 10 others and misdemeanor
charges are pending against two more.
</P>
<P>
   At least 17 other ''John Doe'' defendants are being sought, the
district attorney's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Second-degree assault and first-degree sex abuse are punishable
by up to seven years in prison; first-degree riot is punishable by
up to four years. The few who were charged with second-degree
robbery for allegedly snatching purses during the attacks face up
to 15 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspects in the case were released without bail after
preliminary investigations failed to show definitely that the
defendants were involved in the attacks on the women.

   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Three Trumbull High School wrestlers
accused in a brutal hazing ritual were granted a special form of
probation Monday that may clear their criminal records in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old victim, who was hogtied, sodomized with a
plastic knife and slammed against a wall in several incidents
between December and February, did not contest the probation for
his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Gerard Esposito ordered the three teen-age
boys each to pay $2,500 toward the victim's medical expenses. He
also sentenced them to 300 hours of community service apiece and
ordered them to undergo psychiatric evaluations and counseling as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   If the boys follow the terms of their probation and stay out of
trouble for two years, their records could be wiped clean.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what was going through your heads, but you've got
two years to earn yourselves a dismissal. Take advantage of that,''
Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Former wrestling team co-captains Daniel Rocco Scinto, 19, and
Jeremy Maxwell Dommu, 18, and teammate Christopher Ricci, 16,
apologized in court to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry this ever happened,'' Scinto told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who has not been identified publicly, is a special
education student who suffers from attention deficit disorder and a
hyperactivity condition.
</P>
<P>
   The victim did not appear in court, but his lawyer, Howard
Klebanoff, said he expects to file civil lawsuits, possibly against
the Trumbull public schools and the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a family that is seeking vengeance. It's a family
that seeks justice,'' Klebanoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the wrestlers said their clients also endured hazing
to get on to the wrestling team, such as having their heads shaved
or being hung on towel hooks by their underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of activity has been going on at Trumbull High
School for years,'' said Andrew Bowman, the lawyer for Dommu.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci's lawyer, Salvatore DePiano, said such hazing went on with
the acquiescence of school authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wanted to be on the wrestling team, you had to go
through the hazing,'' DePiano said.
</P>
<P>
   School leaders have said such activity is prohibited in the
student conduct policy, which forbids intimidation, harassment or
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Peggy Kelley opposed the probation,
saying the charges were much too serious to warrant probation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley described the case as ''one of the most offensive cases I
have ever prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Scinto was charged with unlawful restraint and third-degree
assault. Dommu was charged with unlawful restraint and reckless
endangerment, and Ricci was charged with unlawful restraint and
attempted assault.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight members of the wrestling team were charged in the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of five wrestlers have been resolved in juvenile
court. Three of them served a week in the juvenile detention
center.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the accused wrestlers were suspended for 10 days and
then expelled from school, and an eighth team member was suspended
for two days.

<HEADLINE> Whitman creates new traffic offense to help municipal prosecutors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law
Monday a measure that creates a new traffic offense and clarifies
the rules that allow municipal prosecutors to accept plea bargain
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the state's Administrative Office of the Courts said
municipal court judges should no longer accept plea deals when the
facts don't fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Many claimed that would end plea bargains and clog dockets at
local courts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill signed by Whitman creates a new traffic violation for
drivers who operate vehicles ''in an unsafe manner likely to
endanger person or property.'' Guilty drivers are not charged
penalty points in first or second offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who supported the bill said it will allow municipal
prosecutors and courts the flexibility to allow plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The municipal courts should not be placed in administrative
straitjackets that restrict rationality and compromise,''
Assemblyman Christopher Bateman, R-Somerset said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Plea bargains are a ''workable and successful practice,'' said
Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union.
</P>
<P>
   The law is designed to help prosecutors and ''speed the flow of
traffic cases through the system,'' state Sen. Anthony Bucco,
R-Morris, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will also benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation gives drivers who have made a mistake a
second chance. It gives them the opportunity to plead to this
violation, thus avoiding points, as long as they aren't habitual
offenders,'' Bucco said.

<HEADLINE> Cuomo settlement with Puerto Rican authority under scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - To settle a lawsuit over housing funds, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development agreed to pay $130
million to the Puerto Rican Housing Authority, even though the
agency faces corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Now some Republicans are questioning why money is going to an
agency under federal investigation and hinted HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo may be cozying up to New York state's large Puerto Rican
constituency in advance of a possible run for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is just a whole raft of questions about alleged criminal
activity (in the housing authority) that I find very troubling and
make me wonder why HUD would do this,'' Sen. Christopher Bond,
R-Mo., said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican housing officials alleged HUD's allocation formula
has consistently shortchanged their administration. They first
filed a complaint in 1975, then a lawsuit in 1996 seeking $500
million.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials denied Cuomo's political aspirations were a factor
in settling the case. HUD spokesman Leland Jones said Cuomo agreed
the funding formula was unfair and wanted a settlement that was
fair to taxpayers and the Puerto Rican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a landlord violates the law, do tenants get evicted? Of
course not. Then why should the people of Puerto Rico be denied
their fair share of funding because of the wrongdoing of others?''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo traveled to San Juan to announce the settlement on June 6,
four days before the Puerto Rican Parade in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement disturbed HUD Inspector General Susan Gaffney,
who sent a rare ''seven-day letter'' to Cuomo blasting the deal.
Such a letter requires a response to Congress within seven working
days.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, an appointee of President Clinton who spars frequently
with Cuomo, criticized HUD's ''failure to stop flagrant fraud,
waste and abuse'' in the Puerto Rican housing administration. She
said HUD should have appointed an independent third party to handle
the authority's checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   In HUD's response, Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez chastised
Gaffney, saying she had never made such a recommendation before and
that her use of a seven-day letter was inappropriate
</P>
<P>
   Bond, chairman of the committee that oversees HUD and a frequent
critic of Cuomo, fired off another letter to Cuomo on July 18
asking for additional documents on the housing authority and proof
that the Department of Justice had signed off on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials say they received Justice approval and Justice
spokeswoman Kris Watney confirmed that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption probe at the Puerto Rican authority is being
conducted by the HUD Inspector General's Office and the FBI.
According to a June 9 internal memo by Emil Schuster of the HUD
Inspector General's Office, the probes so far have resulted in 10
indictments and nine guilty pleas. Additional indictments are
expected, according to Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican Public Housing Administration is HUD's second
largest, trailing only New York City.

<HEADLINE> Lazio takes in prescription drug money in days following crucial vote </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio raked in thousands of dollars
for his U.S. Senate bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton from the
pharmaceutical industry in the days surrounding his vote for a GOP
prescription plan favored by the drug industry, according to
campaign finance records.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Republican took in a total of $29,250 from
pharmaceutical companies and their executives in the two weeks
before and the day after the prescription drug vote June 29,
financial filings show.
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees for pharmaceutical giants Pfizer,
Glaxo Wellcome and Schering Plough each chipped in $5,000 apiece.
The GOP prescription measure passed by a close and mostly
party-line vote, 217-214.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio voted with the drug industry and then took their
cash. Once again Rick Lazio has sided with the special interests
over the needs of New York's seniors,'' Clinton spokesman Howard
Wolfson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lazio camp scoffed at that and noted the pharmaceutical
contributions were a tiny percentage of the $4.96 million he has
raised since entering the race in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only special interest that Rick listens to are the
interests of individual New Yorkers,'' Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Cooperstown Monday Lazio said the plan he
supported ''is going to be best for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has threatened to veto the GOP prescription
plan, which is opposed by most Democrats and some consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would extend drug coverage through
government-subsidized policies sold by private insurers who would
participate voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Democrats are advocating a costlier alternative: a
uniform, government-run prescription drug benefit, offered to all
39 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry is worried that if the government
runs the prescription program it will limit what they can charge
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the pharmaceutical industry said they were
opposed to the government's ''one-size fits all approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We much prefer the plan that passed the House,'' Jeff Trewhitt
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Glaxo Wellcome, also said the money was not
given to Lazio to influence his position on the prescription vote.
Tom Fuldner said the money was based on an overall assessment of
the New York race and Lazio's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''We gave him money because we thought he would represent our
interests and would be like-minded,'' Fuldner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio missed a recent vote on another measure opposed by the
drug industry. On July 10, the House voted to prevent the
government from discouraging the purchase of drugs in Canada or
other countries where they are cheaper than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure 363-12 as an amendment to the
Food and Drug Administration appropriations bill. It prevents the
agency from enforcing an importation ban on drugs, so long as they
are for personal use. Lazio was one of 66 members who missed the
House vote.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, the first lady has called for the
importation of cheaper drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Monday, the moderate Republican Leadership Council,
which counts Gov. George Pataki among its leadership, released a
television advertisement that used the words of President Clinton
to link Lazio and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat Lazio
and the first lady are battling to replace. The 30-second spot
relies on footage of the president thanking Moynihan, Lazio and
others at a December ceremony for their work on legislation to help
disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her husband said it first ... We're following his lead,'' said
Mark Miller, executive director of the RLC.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is the second trotted out by the RLC to help boost
Lazio's candidacy. Miller said the group expects to spend $1
million between now and Labor Day on such advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan spokesman Tony Bullock criticized the spot, stressing
that Moynihan knew nothing of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly their intent is to deceive the viewer into believing
that the senator worked closely with Congressman Lazio on this
legislation and that he supports him for the Senate, neither of
which is true,'' Bullock said.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Butler Fights For Job  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- LeRoy Butler is fighting for his job for
the first time in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is the longest-tenured member of the Green Bay Packers
and a fixture in their defensive secondary for a decade. The
three-time All-Pro was a team leader on Green Bay's Super Bowl
teams and was considered the league's best blitzing safety for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But a subpar 1999 season has Butler hearing footsteps downfield.
In particular, brash second-year pro Antuan Edwards has declared
his intention to take either Butler's starting spot or that of
safety Darren Sharper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm putting more pressure on myself than anyone else can put
on me,'' Butler said. ''I'm just looking forward to mixing it up
out there. May the best man win, that's my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, there was no question Butler was the best
man. He said his performance last year -- two interceptions and just
one sack, both his lowest totals since 1992 -- was more due to his
role in former defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas' scheme than to
a dropoff in his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the Packers' first-round pick a year ago, doesn't want
to wait for Butler's decline. He entered training camp determined
to become a starter, and has upped his physical play during the
first week of workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Even Butler's Pro Bowl resume and four-year contract extension
last season, which pays him $3.165 million this year, don't scare
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in here with a good attitude right now, and hopefully by
the end of this camp, I'll be No. 1,'' Edwards said. ''I'm going to
come out here and work as hard as I can. I'll be sitting on top by
the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' progress as a rookie was slowed by a foot injury that
didn't heal until shortly before the preseason. Though he played
extensively at cornerback and as an extra defensive back in passing
situations, he struggled to find his stride.
</P>
<P>
   He was also overshadowed by third-round pick Mike McKenzie, who
wowed coaches and unseated Craig Newsome as one of the Packers'
starting cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   With Tyrone Williams and McKenzie now entrenched at the
cornerback spots, the Packers moved Edwards back to safety -- his
position at Clemson -- during minicamps. Edwards said he doesn't
care where he plays -- as long as he plays a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, really. I know I'm athletic enough and good
enough and smart enough to come out here and play,'' Edwards said.
''I just have to come out here and do what I have to do and
hopefully by the end of this camp I'll be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharper was the Packers' leading tackler last year, but was
criticized for a lack of physical play. He reported to camp in top
shape and has looked good in the first week of workouts, leading to
speculation that the starting battle will be between Edwards and
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Ed Donatell's scheme requires one safety --
usually Sharper in early workouts -- to play up on the eight-man
front, while the other remains in the secondary. The defense also
frequently uses five and six defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   With so much responsibility being placed on the safeties in
Donatell's defense, neither Butler nor Edwards is likely to spend
much time on the sidelines. Coach Mike Sherman said a decision
won't be made on his starting safeties until the regular season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can feel a real sense of urgency around this position this
year,'' Sharper said. ''Everybody wants to learn the defense and
improve. I think it's making us a hungry team.''

<HEADLINE> Report: West Nile should be ''wake up call'' to medical community  </HEADLINE>
By PAT EATON-ROBB
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Citing a congressional report critical of
the handling of a mosquito virus, U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman on
Monday called for an improved federal response to outbreaks of
infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which concludes an eight-month investigation by the
Democratic staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said last
summer's outbreak of the West Nile-like strain of encephalitis
exposed the nation's vulnerability to emerging infectious disease.
The outbreak should serve as a ''wake up call,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is serious and we ought to take it seriously,'' said
Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking minority
member on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes a unified federal West Nile Virus response
plan, closer cooperation between experts in the fields of human and
animal health and an assessment of state's preparedness to deal
with the mosquito-borne disease. It also urges accelerated research
into a West Nile virus vaccine and a national web site to keep the
public and media informed.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the way the Centers for Disease Control
responded to the outbreak that resulted in the deaths of seven
people in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it faults the CDC for having ''tunnel vision''
after an initial diagnosis in humans blamed their illness on the
St. Louis version of the encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   Indicators, including a massive die-off of birds in the area,
should have alerted health officials that something else was going
on, the report says. But a diagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis
''colored CDC's thinking for several weeks,'' and delayed a correct
diagnosis, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two diseases require the same prevention and control
measures, no harm was done, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ''CDC failed to expect the unexpected,'' the report states.
''West Nile provided the wake up call. The next outbreak of an
infectious disease, whether naturally occurring or deliberately
inflicted, may not be so forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement Monday, the CDC said the report
emphasizes the critical challenges the country faces regarding
emerging infectious diseases and said the recommendations in the
report can help clarify the importance of strong partnerships among
local, state and federal health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''As noted in the report, CDC has made significant progress in
addresing many of the recommendations. CDC takes seriously its
leadership role in preparing for emerging infectious disease
outbreaks and continues to work to keep Americans safe and
healthy,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that while the CDC and others were
investigating human illness, animal health experts were doing a
separate investigation into the deaths of birds and horses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cultural and communication divides between the worlds of
human disease and animal disease exacerbated the situation, a state
of affairs that must be righted,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   But the main emphasis of the report is on the improvement of the
public health infrastructure, and the establishment of disease
surveillance and reporting networks to better respond to any future
infectious disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That would include any bioterrorist attack, to which the report
says the West Nile outbreak shows the U.S. may be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is widespread agreement that the next emerging or
re-emerging disease that lands on our shores may be even more
challenging than West Nile has proved to be, especially if it can
readily be spread from person to person, as diseases like flu and
small pox are,'' the report concludes. ''When - not if - such an
event occurs, there will be little margin for error in identifying
and responding to the disease.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers agreed to terms Monday with
goalies Johan Holmqvist and Vitali Yeremeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Holmqvist, 22, played in 41 games with Brynas Gavle of the
Swedish Elite League last season. He had a 2.57 goals against
average and four shutouts. He was the Rangers' ninth selection,
175th overall, in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Yeremeyev, 24, appeared in 26 regular season games with Dynamo
Moscow of the Russian Hockey League, posting a league-leading 1.23
goals against average. Yeremeyev also tied for the league-lead with
seven shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 150 career games, Yeremeyev has a 1.82 GAA and 15 shutouts.
He was also in seven games at the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano,

<HEADLINE> Regional review sought for truck lane to Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. - The board that makes long-range
transportation plans for Western New York has been asked to review
plans for a new truck lane to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Paul A. Dyster says he wants the Greater
Buffalo-Niagara Regional Transportation Council's take on a plan to
add two trucks-only lanes to the existing railroad track on the
upper deck of the Whirlpool Bridge. The plan was proposed on June
16 by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission as a way with dealing
with increasingly crowded border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Dyster said the City Council, which has passed a resolution
expressing concern about the proposal, is being rushed by claims
the project can be implemented in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has put the Council under considerable pressure,'' Dyster
complained in a letter to state Transportation Commissioner Joseph
H. Boardman. ''We are, in short, being asked to make a decision
with very important long-term consequences in a pressure-cooker
atmosphere, with the implication that it is only our approval that
is holding up the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border traffic is expected to double within the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things aren't done, we're going to have problems the
likes of which we've never seen on this frontier,'' Bridge
Commission General Manager Allen Gandell said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency and
the Niagara County Legislature Public Works Committee have approved
a request for $1 million from the Federal Highway Administration
for a study on transportation issues along Niagara County's
international border.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which failed last year due to late submission, is
currently being screened by the state Department of Transportation
in Albany.

<HEADLINE> HMOs To Drop $1M Elderly, Disabled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Close to 1 million elderly and disabled
Americans will be jettisoned by HMOs as they pull out of the
Medicare program this year, the Clinton administration said Monday.
The figure is more than 220,000 higher than the HMO industry
estimated just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs participating in Medicare had until July 3 to inform the
government of intentions to quit the program.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier estimate in an informal survey by an industry group
said at least 711,000 Medicare recipients would lose HMO coverage.
The Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, put
that number at 934,000 in Monday's announcement, based on figures
compiled after the July 3 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped Medicare recipients will have to switch to another HMO
by the end of this year, if possible, and the HCFA said 83 percent
of them have other Medicare-friendly HMOs in their area. The rest
will have to use the original fee-for-service Medicare, which lacks
many benefits of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans, which administered the
original survey, said Medicare is ''overregulated and underpaid,''
which it said is why so many HMOs are abandoning the program. More
than 700,000 recipients were dropped during a rash of HMO pullouts
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said reimbursements are not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The volatility of the Medicare managed-care market underscores
the need for Congress to enact the president's legislative proposal
to modernize and strengthen Medicare,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, the
Medicare administrator.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HMOs To Drop 1 Million Elderly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Close to 1 million elderly and disabled
Americans will be jettisoned by HMOs as they pull out of the
Medicare program this year, the Clinton administration said Monday.
The figure is more than 220,000 higher than the HMO industry
estimated just two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs participating in Medicare had until July 3 to inform the
government of intentions to quit the program.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier estimate in an informal survey by an industry group
said at least 711,000 Medicare recipients would lose HMO coverage.
The Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, put
that number at 934,000 in Monday's announcement, based on figures
compiled after the July 3 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped Medicare recipients will have to switch to another HMO
by the end of this year, if possible, and the HCFA said 83 percent
of them have other Medicare-friendly HMOs in their area. The rest
will have to use the original fee-for-service Medicare, which lacks
many benefits of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Health Plans, which administered the
original survey, said Medicare is ''overregulated and underpaid,''
which it said is why so many HMOs are abandoning the program. More
than 700,000 recipients were dropped during a rash of HMO pullouts
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said reimbursements are not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The volatility of the Medicare managed-care market underscores
the need for Congress to enact the president's legislative proposal
to modernize and strengthen Medicare,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, the
Medicare administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare says that of its 39 million beneficiaries, 27 million
have at least one HMO open to them, and 6.5 million are enrolled in
one.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Signs DL Eric Swann  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Defensive tackle Eric Swann followed
Reggie White to Carolina, signing a one-year deal with the Panthers
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, a 10-year veteran, was released by the Arizona Cardinals
two weeks ago and had been shopping himself around to interested
teams. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Denver Broncos made Swann
guaranteed offers, but he held out for the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Swann Station, N.C., wanted to play in his home
state and with White, who signed with Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very, very happy,'' Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, said.
''Once Reggie went there, he said this is an opportunity to play
with him and he turned down two guaranteed deals that were
considerably larger than what we agreed to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is for one year and worth about the league minimum of
$440,000 for veterans, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Swann was so anxious to join the Panthers, Zucker said, he
turned down the team's offer to send a plane to pick him up on
Tuesday and is instead taking a flight from Phoenix to make it in
time for practice Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't wait to get there,'' Zucker said. ''This is where he
wants to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Swann is just the latest move by Carolina coach
George Seifert to overhaul his defense. The Panthers ranked 26th in
the league last year, but Seifert has since signed Chuck Smith from
Atlanta, Jay Williams from St. Louis and most recently White.
</P>
<P>
   White, the NFL's career sacks leader, came out of retirement to
join Carolina. Once he did that, Swann was sure he wanted to be
with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, 29, played in the 1995 Pro Bowl with White and has been
bugging Zucker to reunite him ever since, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The two players own property adjacent to each other outside of
Charlotte and both are building their permanent homes there.
</P>
<P>
   Like White, Swann will almost surely be used as a situational
player for 25-30 plays a game because of questions about his
durability.
</P>
<P>
   Swann has arthritic knees. He has undergone seven knee
operations over his career and missed 18 of 34 games the last two
seasons with the Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Pataki heads to Maine for vacation  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, one of several
Republicans who was thought to have been under consideration by
George W. Bush as a possible presidential running mate, headed to
Maine on Monday for a few days of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Republican, before word came out Monday evening
that former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was Bush's choice, said
nothing should be read into the decision to spend a few days on the
Maine coast, north of former President Bush's Kennebunkport summer
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had it planned for months,'' Pataki said Monday before
leaving for Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Portland later Monday evening, Pataki refused to
answer any questions.
</P>
<P>
   Most attention in recent days had centered on Cheney as Bush's
possible pick for vice president. Cheney, who had headed up the
Texas governor's search for a running mate, left Washington for
Texas on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was to make the announcement about his choice of Cheney on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has not told me who he's choosing, but certainly
Cheney would be an outstanding choice if that in fact is the
choice,'' Pataki said in a telephone interview early Monday
afternoon before heading to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly there is a strong sense that Secretary Cheney would
be an outstanding choice ... Cheney does have that record of
government service, record of leadership in a very difficult time
during the Gulf War,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York governor refused to say if he had spoken to Bush in
the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have or haven't, I'm not going to tell anybody,'' Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he would be returning to New York on Thursday,
although he said his wife Libby and children would be spending
longer in Maine. The governor is a delegate to next week's
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said the Patakis would be
vacationing in New Harbor with Libby Pataki's sister and her
family. The Maine coastal village is north of Boothbay Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be right where Libby's father grew up,'' Pataki
said. ''It's where we went on our honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said several of his wife's relatives still live in the
area where they will be vacationing, an island that her father once
owned near New Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is Libby's family thing and she's always wanted to show
our kids where her father lived,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki refused to give the name of the island they would be on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to say because some of the more obnoxious press
might track us down,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Two indicted in 1994 New Jersey murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two men were indicted Monday on federal
racketeering charges relating to the 1994 murders of three people
in Jersey City, N.J., and other acts of violence in New York and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan returned the
indictment against Lin Long Qun, 29, and Dong Qi Ming, 31, after
hearing evidence that they committed numerous acts of violence,
including the murders.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused the men of killing Huang Yong Ting, Jiang
Ai Qin and Lin Yu in August 1994 in a basement apartment on Wayne
Street in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   It said the defendants at the time were members of a Chinese
alien-smuggling gang and committed the murders to boost their
standing.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the gang also was responsible for several
kidnappings of Chinese illegal aliens shortly after their arrival
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Qun and Ming also were accused of participating in the robbery
of a restaurant owner in Downingtown, Pa., in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Qun is currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Center
in Bellefonte, Pa., where he was serving a 15-year to 40-year
prison term following his conviction on a robbery charge.
</P>
<P>
   Ming's lawyer did not immediately return a telephone message for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, both defendants face a maximum sentence of life in
prison.

<HEADLINE> Gypsy moth defoliation hits five-year high  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - Kept in check for the past several years, the
voracious gypsy moth caterpillar is making a resurgence in
Maryland's forests, chewing through any foliage that stands in its
way.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves on Maryland's trees are being stripped by gypsy moths
at the highest rate in the last five years. The nefarious invaders
defoliated 22,566 acres of the state's trees this spring, with most
of that acreage concentrated in western Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   And the damage is a sign that things could get worse, said
Robert Tichenor, head of the Forest Pest Management Section of the
Maryland Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a bigger problem next year than we have
had in quite a few years,'' he said. ''This trend has been going on
for the past three or four years. How many more it is going to
continue is anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have seen a growing number of egg masses on tree
trunks over the past several years, Tichenor said, a harbinger of
future infestations.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation wreaked by the gypsy moths on Maryland's forests
ballooned to 133,000 acres in 1990, and hovered around 100,000
annually until 1995. But a combination of environmental controls
such as predators and parasites cut into gypsy moth populations
after 1995, reducing the damage to Maryland's trees.
</P>
<P>
   It was the failure of one of those controls - a fungus that is
lethal to the gypsy moth caterpillar - that contributed to the
population resurgence this year, Tichenor said. The fungus, which
feeds off the bodies of the caterpillars, did not appear this year
until the insects were fully grown and had already done significant
damage.
</P>
<P>
   In aerial surveys of Maryland's forests this spring, researchers
spotted numerous patches of trees with 50 percent or more of their
foliage gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of seeing a nice thick carpet of green, you'll see
brownish areas that look as if it were a threadbare carpet,''
Tichenor said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't limited to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania expects to record over 1 million defoliated acres
this year, and West Virginia already has counted 200,000 acres
affected by gypsy moths. New Jersey, which had 1,380 acres
defoliated last year, has recorded 130,000 acres invaded by
caterpillars this year. And Virginia reported its first defoliation
since 1995, with 71,000 acres affected.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy moths were introduced into North America in the mid-1800s
by a Massachusetts entrepreneur who hoped the cocoon spun by the
larval caterpillar would be an alternative to silk. While the
insect failed as a textile producer, it flourished on the abundant
supply of oak and other North American trees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 150 years, the gypsy moth began a slow march
through New England and the mid-Atlantic region. Since the female
does not fly, the gypsy moth spreads only about 10-15 miles per
year, Tichenor said.
</P>
<P>
   But that immobility also means gypsy moths can reach critical
limits in infested areas, causing often-fatal damage to trees. The
caterpillars destroy leaves in the spring, meaning the tree has to
tap into its energy reserves to grow new foliage. The weakened
trees are then susceptible to disease and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners concerned about backyard trees should knock off egg
patches to curb future damage, Tichenor said. The state also has
been spraying insecticides in selected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew it was coming, but we didn't quite expect it to come
all of a sudden like it did this year,'' Tichenor said.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Makes Debut At Bills Camp  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- Four days late, rookie defensive end Erik
Flowers felt like all eyes were on him Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of reminds you of being a little five-year-old going
to kindergarten class, but being late and everybody's watching you
as you walk through the door,'' Flowers said after making his debut
at Buffalo Bills training camp. ''I was a little nervous during the
beginning of the drills. But things started to fit in a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, selected 26th overall from Arizona State in April's NFL
draft, finally hit the field at St. John Fisher College after
signing a five-year contract Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary terms were not disclosed, but it's believed the deal is
worth between $5.5 million and $6 million, plus a signing bonus of
more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty confident that it was going to get done in the
first week,'' Flowers said. ''My agent knows these guys. (He's)
done tons of contracts with them. I knew it was going to get done
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came when Flowers' agent, Arizona-based Eric
Metz, flew to Rochester over the weekend to personally handle the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal came not a moment too soon for the Bills, who are
relying on Flowers to play an important role in helping fill Bruce
Smith's shoes on the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers will get plenty of playing time in place of Marcellus
Wiley, who needs at least two more weeks to recover from back
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Wade Phillips raised concerns that the holdout could limit
Flowers' development. Now Phillips is expecting to see the player
that impressed him at the Bills' previous minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seeing him in the June camp, I felt like he was going to
play an important role on this team,'' Phillips said. ''He's an
awfully good-looking football player. It didn't matter who was here
or who wasn't here. From what I've seen so far, I think he's going
to be playing on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell said Flowers hasn't
missed much.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing he missed is a lot of pizza and stuff at
night,'' Cottrell said. ''The practices that he missed, I don't
think they're going to hurt him at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a few tries, but Flowers did make a big impact during
the morning session.
</P>
<P>
   In 1-on-1 pass rush drills, rookie offensive tackle Jon Carman
appeared to have the better of Flowers. Then, suddenly, Carman
found himself lying face-first on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Using his highly touted speed and underrated strength, Flowers
got around Carman with a clever half-spin move and, with his right
arm, shoved the tackle over.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the play before that, Jon blocked me. He had me beat,''
Flowers said. ''I went back and asked the guys, 'What am I doing
wrong?' And they said, 'You're not trying to bend the corner,
you're still hesitant.' And I guess I just went out there and
played.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressed Carman said: ''He looks great. Very quick. His
upper body -- he's a very strong guy. You really got to hunker down
to hold on to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers' linemates welcomed his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of this week, he'll be up to speed with the rest of
the team,'' veteran defensive end Phil Hansen said. ''I know he's a
rookie, but he's a smart kid. He's big, strong, he's got all the
tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Added backup lineman Shawn Price: ''He's going to catch up
quickly. ... He knows his plays, it's just a matter of getting his
legs underneath him, enduring the pounding and all that. He'll be
fine.''

<HEADLINE> Rain Slows Brazil Oil Spill Cleanup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Rains complicated the cleanup of a
major oil spill in southern Brazil over the weekend, but workers
prevented oil trapped near a refinery from leaking into a river,
oil company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup crews have removed all but 5,000 gallons of oil from the
Iguacu River, contaminated when more than 1 million gallons spewed
from a burst pipeline last week at the Getulio Vargas refinery,
federal oil giant Petrobras said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 gallons of oil remained on the refinery
grounds, Petrobras said. Over the weekend, workers built four
concrete dikes to prevent rains from washing oil into a tributary
of the Iguacu, which flows across Parana state to world-famous
Iguacu Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Rains hampered cleanup efforts at the river, as muddy roads
prevented the access of crews, trucks and other cleanup equipment,
Petrobras spokesman Luiz Antonio Magnani said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 100 animals coated in oil were found during the cleanup
and taken to a veterinary hospital in nearby Curitiba, the capital
of Parana state 435 miles southwest of Rio. Half of the animals
died, Petrobras said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rain-swollen current did not push the oil beyond
contention barriers, as environmentalists had feared. Samples of
river water taken Sunday at several points below the barriers were
not contaminated by the oil, according to Parana State's
Environmental Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Petrobras said that it would remove the remaining oil from the
polluted 27-mile stretch of the Iguacu River by Wednesday, then
cleanup efforts would turn to the oil still contained within the
refinery.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government on Monday fined Petrobras about $84
million and ordered the company to compensate riverside residents
for damages, local media reported. The Parana state government has
separately fined Petrobras $28 million.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard B. Cheney, widely credited with
helping mastermind the U.S.-led military victory over Iraq, by
reputation is deliberate but decisive, a Washington insider who
honed his skills of persuasion both in Congress and the executive
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sight for most of the past decade, the 59-year-old Cheney
is very much back in the public eye as Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
choice as vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The face is rounder now than when Cheney, former President
Bush's defense secretary, was on the world's TV screens during his
prosecution of the Persian Gulf War. Some of the hair's gone.
</P>
<P>
   But he still has that seemingly permanent half-smile, a friendly
look that comes with a disarming manner that helped him get along
with Democrats even while amassing a deeply conservative voting
record on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when George W. Bush put Cheney in charge of his vice
presidential search team, Bush called him ''a man of enormous
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of Cheney's four years as Pentagon chief, from
1989 to 1993, was the resounding victory in the Persian Gulf War.
During that time he also oversaw the Pentagon's first big wave of
post-Cold War defense cuts -- and characteristically cautioned
Congress against cutting too deeply, too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, several months after the Gulf War ended,
Cheney publicly worried about the future of the Soviet Union --
which dissolved one month later -- and foresaw an instability that
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what the hell's going to happen over there over
the next few years,'' he said then. ''We know they've got somewhere
between 25,000 and 30,000 nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., and his father was a longtime
Agriculture Department worker. He attended elementary school and
high school in Casper, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   He was football co-captain and senior class president, and won a
full scholarship to Yale -- Bush's alma mater. He attended Yale for
one year but had to leave because of failing grades. He moved back
to Wyoming where he worked for the power company stringing and
cutting lines, before enrolling at the University of Wyoming, where
he renewed a relationship with high school sweetheart Lynne Anne
Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1964 and both went to the University of
Wisconsin for doctorates. She earned her doctoral degree, but
politics lured him to Washington in 1968, where he was a
congressional fellow and became a protege of Michigan Republican
Rep. Donald Rumsfeld, a close friend of President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney served under Rumsfeld in the anti-poverty agency of the
Nixon years, on the Nixon White House staff and under Rumsfeld
again as assistant director of the Cost of Living Council, Nixon's
agency to combat inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford tapped Rumsfeld to become his chief of staff, Rumsfeld
made Cheney his deputy. When Rumsfeld left the White House to be
defense secretary, Cheney moved up to become the youngest chief of
staff ever, at age 34. He held the post for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   After Ford left office, Cheney returned to Casper, Wyoming and
ran for the state's single congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his heart attack in the middle of the first campaign --
which he discussed with all of Wyoming's Republicans in a letter
explaining why he would continue to campaign -- Cheney won
decisively. He went on to win five more terms.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Cheney quickly rose within the GOP power chain. He
was one of President Reagan's most ardent supporters, backing him
up on defense issues like the ''Star Wars'' missile defense system.
He also voted against Democrats on almost every social issue,
including abortion rights, gun control and the Equal Rights
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The American Conservative Union gave him nearly perfect ratings
for each of his years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During the Iran-Contra scandal, as vice chairman of the
congressional investigation commission, Cheney became of one
Congress's most stalwart defenders of the Reagan administration.
William Cohen, the current defense secretary and a former member of
Congress, recalled Monday that he served with Cheney on the
Iran-Contra commission and worked with him during Cheney's years at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his view of Cheney's qualifications to be vice president,
Cohen said, ''I think that he brings enormous qualifications to the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was not President Bush's first choice to be defense
secretary. His initial pick, Sen. John Tower, withdrew after it
became clear he could not win Senate confirmation. Cheney quickly
established himself in the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   When the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, talked
to reporters in unusual detail about U.S. war plans in the Persian
Gulf in September 1990, Cheney said he went too far and fired him.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney, the former politician and Washington insider, also
has a deft diplomatic style that was typified during the Gulf War,
again, when he flew to Saudi Arabia to convince King Fahd that
allowing U.S. forces into his kingdom would be wise.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cheney became chairman and chief executive officer of
Dallas-Based Halliburton Corp., one of the world's leading
engineering and construction firms focused on oil companies. Under
Cheney's guidance, the company's stock price and profits have
soared, as has Cheney's personal portfolio. In 1998, he made $2.2
million in salary and controlled another $10 million in Halliburton
stock.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a director of several large corporations, including
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Union Pacific, and Electronic Data Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question about Cheney may be his health. His 1978
heart attack was the first of three and in 1988 he had a quadruple
bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney remains physically active, and his heart problems do not
seem to have slowed him down -- he continues to go on hikes that
last for days and fly-fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   One skeleton that could hurt a Bush-Cheney ticket is the
ever-constant specter of the Vietnam War. Cheney received five
student and marriage deferments of service during the war. He told
The Washington Post in 1989, ''I had other priorities in the '60s
than military service. ... I don't regret the decisions I made. I
complied fully with all the requirements of the statutes,
registered with the draft when I turned 18. Had I been drafted, I
would have been happy to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has been married to Lynne for 36 years. The couple has
two grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan years, Lynne Cheney became as well known in
Washington as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She raised two children, put in a stint as an editor at the
Washingtonian magazine, ran the National Endowment for the
Humanities from 1986 until 1993, wrote a novel, ''Executive
Privilege'' and, with him, wrote ''Kings of the Hill,'' a study of
eight past speakers of the House. She is currently a senior fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Clinton's Ties To Riady  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators looking into alleged
fund-raising abuses by Democrats questioned President Clinton
extensively about his ties to Indonesian businessman James Riady,
dating back to his 1992 White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony released Monday, Clinton said he did not remember a
1992 limousine ride in which Riady purportedly pledged to funnel $1
million in donations to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a specific recollection of what the conversation
was, or this fact of the car ride,'' the president said. He said he
only remembered seeing Riady ''sometime in '92 after I became the
nominee,'' and that Riady pledged to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed as to whether he could specifically recall Riady's
$1 million promise, Clinton replied: ''I don't. I don't. And I
don't know whether he ever gave that much money. ... If he said a
million, I'm surprised I don't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   A 155-page transcript of Clinton's four-hour testimony, taken
April 21, was released late Monday by the White House without
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department task force is looking into whether Riady,
as a foreign national, worked illegally to funnel campaign
contributions to Clinton's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to an FBI summary released last year, Democratic
fund-raiser John Huang, a Riady employee, said Riady ''rode in a
limousine with ... Clinton,'' telling the then-Arkansas governor
''that he would like to raise $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Riady ... told Huang that President Clinton's reaction was one
of surprise when J. Riady said he would like to raise $1 million,''
the summary added.
</P>
<P>
   Huang said that in the following weeks, Riady employees donated
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party. He said
he assumed the donors had been reimbursed by Riady, as he had been.
</P>
<P>
   In the testimony, Clinton flatly denied taking Riady into the
White House Situation Room in 1993, on the day that federal agents
raided the Branch Davidians compound near Waco, Texas. According to
investigators, Riady used such anecdotes to give government
ministers in Indonesia the impression that his family ''had a
direct pipeline to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever taken anybody to the Situation Room,''
The president said. ''I think that's highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said he did not remember anything that happened
that day. ''I did my best to go through the day to do my job, do
what I was supposed to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Vice President Al Gore were questioned by
investigators as part of the government's ongoing investigation
into alleged fund-raising abuses by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, released last month, Gore wrestled with the
definition of ''fund-raiser,'' insisted there was no price tag
placed on White House coffees and denied knowing that the event he
attended at a Buddhist temple in California was actually a
fund-raiser. The questioning focused on the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, was interrogated about his 1992 and 1996
campaigns, his first encounters with Riady and Riady's father,
Mochtar, and his process of deciding whom to tap for administration
jobs and commission posts.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators asked about the size of Riady's pledged
donation -- and the fact that Clinton seems to have forgotten such a
large contribution -- the president said such activities are
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes people give that much money. I know in an election
or two ago that one of the Republicans got that much money from one
source,'' Clinton said. ''So, it happens from time to time and it's
not unlawful. But I, I just don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony contained scant references to Gore, the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee this year, and dealt
mainly with whether he agreed that the coffees were his idea, not
Gore's. ''If he said that, I wouldn't disagree with that,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   He defended the coffees as innocent activity, saying he saw
nothing wrong with them because he also was holding issues-oriented
coffees at that time. ''And I still do some of them, but mostly in
the late afternoon, unrelated to the (Democratic National
Committee),'' Clinton said. ''I liked them and they were easy on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force also questioned the president about a vacation he
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took at Camp David, Md.,
during the July 4th holiday in 1993, approximately a week after
aide Webster Hubbell purportedly accepted $100,000 from a Riady
entity. Clinton denied that Hubbell mentioned anything about
working for Riady.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I remember about that vacation was that I took
a long walk with him (Hubbell) and I asked him if he was in
trouble,'' Clinton said. ''And he said no, he was having a billing
dispute with a law firm and he would resolve it. That's the searing
memory I have about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hotly denied telling Riady of concerns about payments to
Hubbell because Hubbell might end up as a witness in an
investigation. Such a conversation ''would have made Mr.
(independent counsel Kenneth) Starr happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Webb Hubbell was persistently persecuted by the independent
counsel because he would not lie about me or Hillary,'' Clinton
said. ''I never worried about what Webb Hubbell would say. If he
wanted to say something bad about me, he'd have to make it up.''

<HEADLINE> Murder Alleged in Life Jacket Fight  </HEADLINE>
By CAIN BURDEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The story of a shrimp boat worker killing his
captain in a fight for the sinking vessel's only life jacket is
gripping but implausible, says the suspect's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Latham, a landlubbing janitor hired for a weekend shrimp
boat trip, was charged with second-degree murder for the death of
the skipper, Raymond Leiker, who he allegedly killed in a fight
over the one life jacket they had. He was ordered held Monday in
lieu of $200,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Latham's lawyer, Peter Barbee, said his client would plead
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all speculation at this point,'' he said. ''Why would you
kill the captain in the middle of a storm when the boat is going
down and he is the person you're going to rely on to save you?''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Latham confessed that he killed Leiker after
initially saying the captain's feet got tangled in netting.
</P>
<P>
   Latham was arrested after Leiker's body floated up with stab
wounds, a broken right arm and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think things just went way out of hand with the weather so
bad, the boat sinking. They were just fighting for their lives,''
said Capt. Curtis Bowers of the Plaquemine Parish Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what happened could be pieced together by Bowers and the
two men's employers.
</P>
<P>
   Leiker, who had access to a 35-foot shrimper named Bandit, met
Latham at a Laundromat July 15 and offered to pay him $100 a day as
a deck hand.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp season was ending July 17 and he wanted to make the most
of the last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, who lived with his mother and worked as a janitor at
Stumpf's Supervalue Foods in Boothville, wasn't the seafaring sort,
according to the store's owners, brothers Clifford and Wayne
Stumpf. ''We were shocked that he even went out on a boat,'' Wayne
Stumpf said.
</P>
<P>
   When Leiker and Latham pulled away from Sharkco's shrimp docks
in Venice, headed out to Baptiste Collette channel, the Gulf of
Mexico was calm.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Chance, manager of the shrimpery, said there had been
problems with the Bandit, an older boat. The fuel pump had gone out
once. Nets broke. The engine ran hot. Engine belts needed changing.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather turned bad Saturday, Leiker was radioed to get
ashore. Gusts blew, up to 80 mph, the engine got swamped. Waves
broke over and water poured in. The radio went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fight broke out between Latham and Leiker over the life
jacket, police said. Leiker, 34, was a big man, a veteran of oil
rigs -- standing about 6 feet, 200 to 220 pounds. Latham, 46, was
slight, 5 feet, 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Latham told investigators the two were inside the cabin when
Leiker overpowered him and dashed outside with the jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Waves were up to 10 feet, crashing over the deck, and the boat
was breaking apart.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Latham told deputies, the captain was swept
overboard and lost hold of the life preserver.
</P>
<P>
   Latham said Leiker tried to clamber back on board out of the
raging surf.
</P>
<P>
   But Latham allegedly told authorities he thought the captain
wanted to kill him, so he stabbed him five times with a knife and
hit him with an iron pipe, and Leiker fell back into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, Latham, who had been clinging to a plank for 15
hours, was rescued by passing fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Leiker's badly decomposed body turned up Friday.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Conservative in Values  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A look at where Dick Cheney has stood on the
issues, based primarily on his voting record when he was a
congressman from Wyoming from 1978 to 1989 and his tenure as
secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993:
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION:
</P>
<P>
   Opposes abortion rights and has voted against federal funding of
abortions even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is
in danger. But Cheney has said there must be room in the GOP for
contrary views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   GUN CONTROL:
</P>
<P>
   Opposed gun control measures while in Congress and opposed bans
on imports of plastic guns that could be smuggled past metal
detectors and armor piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT:
</P>
<P>
   Opposed funding for the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water
Act and the Endangered Species Act. Cheney voted against spending
more on ''Superfund'' environmental cleanups and supported oil
drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But he
opposed gas and oil leasing in Wyoming wilderness areas and wanted
to designate 650,000 additional acres in Wyoming as wilderness
areas.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY:
</P>
<P>
   Was a staunch supporter of a strong defense and backed President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as ''Star Wars,'' the
deployment of the MX missile, production of new chemical weapons
and military aid to the Nicaraguan contras.
</P>
<P>
   But, as secretary of defense during the Bush administration, he
oversaw defense budget cuts that he described as ''very, very
painful,'' proposed halting production of the Marine Corp's Osprey
aircraft and ordered cutbacks in other military hardware programs.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH PENALTY:
</P>
<P>
   Has supported capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY:
</P>
<P>
   Favored raising the Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67
.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL RIGHTS:
</P>
<P>
   Opposed busing to achieve racial desegregation in public schools
and the Equal Rights Amendment and supported prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN FINANCE:
</P>
<P>
   Opposed limiting contributions by political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE:
</P>
<P>
   Opposed coverage of long-term home care for the chronically ill
under Medicare and voted against a measure that would have shielded
Medicare beneficiaries from bills for catastrophic illnesses and
provided prescription drug coverage under Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Latest ad from Clinton campaign  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the newest ad from Hillary Rodham
Clinton's
Senate campaign, highlighting her interest in health issues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Clinton campaign adviser Mandy Grunwald and ''Team
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Downstate.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT: (Announcer) She's talking about health care, because
it's always been her cause.
</P>
<P>
   When her health care plan was defeated, she kept on fighting
step by step and made a difference. Mammograms covered by Medicare.
Longer hospital coverage for new mothers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Hillary will fight to provide health care access
to every child, for a real Patients' Bill of Rights and tax credits
to help those without coverage on the job. Who'll be a strong voice
for better health care?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary. Always has been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Clinton is pictured speaking with patients and doctors
in a hospital, and talking with people around the state. Many of
those pictured are elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the screen are the words ''Mammograms covered by
Medicare,'' ''Longer hospital coverage for new mothers,'' ''Health
care access to every child,'' ''A real Patients' Bill of Rights,''
and ''Tax credits to help those without coverage on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This commercial seeks to turn the defeat of the first
lady's health care reform plan into a credential that proves her
long-standing advocacy, and her willingness to keep fighting for a
cause. As in many of the other ads that have sought to recast her
cold, cerebral image, the first lady is portrayed here as friendly
and caring, and her last name is never mentioned. The viewer is on
a permanent first-name basis with ''Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's support for insurance coverage for a 48-hour
hospitalization after childbirth, and for expanded Medicare
coverage for mammograms, is real. The ad may, however, leave some
viewers with the false impression that the first lady was
responsible for these programs rather than having had a limited
role as an advocate, not a legislator.

<HEADLINE> Report: Life Expectancy Hits High  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Firearm deaths among children dropped 10 percent
in 1998 and were down 35 percent from the high reached in 1994, the
government reported Monday. Overall, Americans are managing to
elude death a little bit longer, with life expectancy rising to a
record 76.7 years.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report on death rates, published by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health
Statistics, indicated falling rates for eight of the 15 leading
causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows 3,792 children and adolescents under age 20
died in 1998 from firearms, down from 4,223 in 1997. That is also
down 35 percent from the record high of 5,833 for that age group in
1994, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each day 10 children and teens are killed by firearms, and
that is 10 too many,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna F.
Shalala said. ''However, it is a significant decrease from four
years earlier. This indicates that violence prevention efforts are
showing results.''
</P>
<P>
   Among all ages, firearm deaths dropped 5 percent from 1997 to
'98.
</P>
<P>
   NCHS statistician Sherry Murphy, one of the report's authors,
said the decline stems from a combination of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data doesn't show exactly why, but we think there are a
number of possibilities including heightened awareness, the strong
economy and stronger law enforcement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton used the release of the report to call for
full Congressional funding of his $280 million National Gun
Enforcement Initiative and passage of his gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these figures are encouraging, there is no question that
gun violence is still far too prevalent in our nation,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said administration policies, including
hiring more police officers and strict enforcement of gun laws,
have helped reduce gun deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''The practices the administration has put in place in the last
7&AMP;frac12; years are working,'' said Associate Deputy Attorney General Bea
Witzleben.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Brady Law background checks before weapons
purchases and the assault weapons ban are other policies enacted
during the Clinton administration that have helped reduce the gun
death rate.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Gregory, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle
Association, disagreed, saying education, safety and prevention
programs should be credited for the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans are safer with their lawfully owned firearms than
ever before,'' Gregory said. ''It's fantastic to see these rates
drop and we'll continue to work on these programs and encourage
strict enforcement of existing laws to help reduce the rates even
further,'' Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   The life expectancy for all Americans climbed from 76.5 in 1997
to 76.7, the result of declining death rates for heart disease,
cancer, stroke, suicide, liver disease, Alzheimer's disease and
homicide. The most significant decline was the 9.5 percent drop in
deaths caused by hardening of the arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The national death rate of 8.6 per 1,000 population compares to
9.1 in France, 10.8 in Germany, 7.9 in Japan and 10.7 in England.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths from AIDS fell 21 percent from 1997, prompting the
government to remove it as one of the 15 leading causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics also included some bad news, as the death rate
from drugs went up 5 percent, reaching the highest rate since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The infant mortality rate of 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births
remained steady from 1997 to 1998, after years of decline. The
infant mortality rate for blacks is still more than twice that of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 15 causes of death, those that saw an increase
were blood infections, up 4.8 percent, and high blood pressure, up
4.3 percent. Pneumonia and influenza together were up 2.3 percent.
Diabetes, kidney and lung disease increased less than 1 percent.
Deaths from accidents remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates a continued wide disparity in death rates
by race.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading causes of death, the largest racial difference
was for homicide, which was nearly six times higher for blacks than

nearly four times higher for blacks than for whites.

<HEADLINE> People Will Be Better Fed By 2003  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- People around the world will be better fed by 2030
as food production outpaces population growth, but widespread
hunger will persist, a U.N. food agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a study, the Rome-based Food and Agricultural Organization
said cereals will remain the world's staple food.
</P>
<P>
   Cereal production -- half of which is for human consumption -- is
projected to increase by almost one billion tons by 2030 from the
current level of 1.84 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
   Crop production in developing countries is expected to be 70
percent higher in 2030, thanks in part to higher yields per acre as
well as the availability of more arable land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these advances, as many as 580 million people will still
be chronically undernourished 15 years from now and 400 million in
2030.
</P>
<P>
   The FAO says the number now is around 800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The study said agricultural production, which over the last two
decades has grown annually by 2.1 percent, will slow to 1.6 percent
between now and 2015 and then to 1.3 percent by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   But food supplies will still outstrip population growth, which
is estimated to increase annually by 1.2 percent up to 2015, then
drop 0.8 percent in the subsequent 15 years, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAO also warned that increased agriculture and livestock
production in developing countries could hurt the environment if
deforestation, the use of pesticides and overgrazing are
uncontrolled.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Sign First-Round Pick Hovan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- First-round draft choice Chris Hovan
signed with Minnesota on Monday, giving the Vikings all of their
players in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The All-American defensive lineman from Boston College, the 25th
overall pick in April, was expected to report to camp Monday night.
Hovan missed both practices Monday while his agents finished
negotiating his contract with Vikings officials.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of Hovan's contract were not announced, but the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press reported the deal was worth about $5 million over
five years, including a $3 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   With the retirement of Jerry Ball last week, Hovan -- who can
play end or tackle -- is expected to compete for a starting position
on the defensive line, which also lost Chris Doleman to retirement
and Duane Clemons to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ball, Doleman and Clemons combined for 19 sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' first three picks in the draft were defensive
linemen. Wake Forest's Fred Robbins and Miami's Michael Boireau
were taken in the second round.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Case Moves To Federal Court  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In a surprise move, the tobacco industry switched a
landmark Florida smokers' case and its record-breaking $145 billion
verdict to federal court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco attorneys filed a notice moving the case to federal
court based on a motion filed by a union health care plan seeking
to intervene on the day of the punitive damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how the filing would affect the
case, which was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ursula
Ungaro-Benages. Smokers' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt will probably
file a motion to send the case back to state court.
</P>
<P>
   ''They try everything and they stop at nothing to achieve their
devious ends. They don't play fair,'' Rosenblatt said. ''We've got
to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the federal court filing was obtained after business
hours, and there was no immediate comment from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's five biggest cigarette makers transferred the case
based on federal questions raised in the motion filed by the
Southeastern Iron Workers health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   The union argued some of its members were part of the class and
it should be allowed to join the case. Similar motions filed this
year with the trial judge, Circuit Judge Robert Kaye, were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also filed a motion challenging the July 14 verdict
and laying the ground work for an appeal in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco lawyers want Kaye to cut the punitive award, erase the
three verdicts in the case, order a new trial or kill the case
entirely by decertifying it as a class-action covering 300,000 to
700,000 sick Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The motion covering nearly 200 pages cites trial errors ranging
from alternate jurors interacting with the six-member jury to
inflammatory and improper questions and comments by Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the size of the verdict, industry-leading Philip
Morris Inc. said in a statement that the award was
unconstitutionally excessive, the result of ''passion and
prejudice,'' based on ''speculation and conjecture'' and ''beyond
what was necessary to effectuate any punishment or deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry had asked Kaye to order jurors to return an award
no greater than the companies' audited net worth of $15.3 billion,
but the judge refused to impose any limit.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided in July 1999 that the industry makes a deadly
product, ordered the industry in April to pay $12.7 million in
compensatory damages to the three smokers representing the class
and deliberated five hours before setting an all-time record for a
civil trial award.
</P>
<P>
   The industry immediately expressed confidence that the case
would be thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials worry that the verdict could endanger an
industry commitment to pay them about $10 billion a year under
tobacco lawsuit settlements reached in 1997 and 1998 with all 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   The other defendants are R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson,
Lorillard, Liggett and the industry's defunct Council for Tobacco
Research and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Congress Probes FBI's E-Mail Use  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers of both parties grilled FBI
officials Monday over the bureau's use of ''Carnivore,'' a device
designed to monitor and capture e-mail messages in a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., called the hearings amid concerns
from privacy groups about an ordinary computer filled with special
software that the FBI calls a ''reasonable balance'' between
privacy and law enforcement in an age where crime has gone online.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carnivore raises the question as to whether existing statutes
protecting citizens from 'unreasonable searches and seizures' under
the Fourth Amendment appropriately balance the concerns of law
enforcement and privacy,'' said Canady, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee's Constitution panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to me to be a growing level of generalized concern
about Big Brotherism that I suspect is being fed by the increasing
electronic world,'' said Rep. Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials defended Carnivore and the bureau's use of the
tool to Canady's panel, saying it is used only with proper legal
authorization -- in many cases coming from both a senior Justice
Department official and a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI likened Carnivore to a traditional telephone tap, saying
both need probable cause to be undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore is the term used for the entire system, a computer
running the Microsoft Windows NT operating system and software that
scans and captures packets, the standard unit of Internet traffic,
as they travel through an Internet Service Provider's network. The
FBI can install a Carnivore unit at an ISP's network station and
configure it to capture only e-mail going to or from the person
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said Carnivore has been used 25 times, including
16 times this year. None of those cases has yet gone to trial, so
the FBI would not disclose detailed information about them.
</P>
<P>
   Donald M. Kerr, director of the FBI's laboratory division, said
Carnivore searches only the sender and recipient lines of e-mail,
not the subject line, as was previously reported. It does not
search through the message content for keywords, nor does it
monitor Web browsing -- except for Web-based e-mail -- or Instant
Messaging, just e-mail traffic, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates and some lawmakers voiced concern that only
the FBI truly knows what Carnivore does, since after it is
installed it is neither supervised nor checked by an ISP's
technicians; there isn't even a mouse or keyboard attached for
someone to access the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you see some things that have happened here in
Washington, it gives one reason to worry,'' said Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom
of Information Act request last week for Carnivore's source code,
the inner workings of how the device functions.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI gave a preview of its objections to the FOIA request,
explaining why the bureau wouldn't want Carnivore's innermost
details to be public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have a problem with full open disclosure, because
that, in fact, would allow anyone who chose to develop techniques
to spoof what we do an easy opportunity to figure out how to do
that,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials reiterated an earlier plan to show an independent
panel of academic and industry experts exactly how Carnivore works,
and opened the door to regular checks.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Associate Attorney General Kevin V. DiGregory said that
for a ''rogue FBI agent'' to circumvent the law, ''he would need to
engage the aid of technical people, perhaps even technical people
at the Internet service provider, and he would also have to find
some way to cover up or change the audit trail that is left by the
system so that it doesn't expose his going beyond the court
order.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators seemed unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if we have any way of verifying that the
technological part of the response to my question that you've given
me, and I know that unfortunately in the past, we've had many
agencies, including law enforcement, that have gone beyond the
scope of their responsibility,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat. ''There's hardly anything
new about that.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks Complete David Justice Trade  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jake Westbrook, hit hard in two starts for the
New York Yankees this season, and minor league pitcher Zach Day
were sent to the Cleveland Indians to complete the trade for David
Justice, one of the players said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to a very good organization. It gives me a new
opportunity,'' Day said at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kind of shocked. But the way things have been going,
nothing surprises me. The Yankees are going after it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Day spoke with the Indians on Monday, and said he and Westbrook
were going to the Cleveland organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent outfielder Ricky Ledee and two players to be
named to Cleveland for Justice on June 29. Westbrook, on the
disabled list for Triple-A Columbus, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Two team sources familiar with the trade said Westbrook and Day
were sent to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would not confirm the deal. The Indians, who played
in the Hall of Fame exhibition game at Cooperstown, N.Y., were
traveling to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook, a 22-year-old right-hander, was 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA
in three games, one of them in relief, for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook lasted only 1 2-3 innings against the Chicago White
Sox in his major league debut June 17. Boston chased him after 2
2-3 innings in his other start June 22.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbus, he was 5-7 with a 4.87 ERA. He was recently put on
the disabled list with a strained left side.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees acquired Westbrook from Montreal last December in
the deal for pitcher Hideki Irabu. New York had hopes that he could
someday be part of the rotation -- he started the exhibition opener
for the two-time World Series champions.
</P>
<P>
   Day, also a 22-year-old right-hander, was 2-4 with a 4.19 ERA at
Class A Tampa. He began the season at Class A Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Day was the Yankees' fifth-round pick in the 1996 draft. This is
his fifth season in pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were expected to assign Day to Double-A Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough. I've played here four years. I know everybody in
the organization. It probably won't sink in for a couple days,''
Day said.

normal length of life. If he has a current physical examination,
which shows him in good health and his overall cardiac function is
good, I have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever''
</P>
<P>
   --Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, a heart-lung surgeon on Cheney's
history of heart disease. Frist was on the list of possible running

be a good counsel to candidate Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   --Tom Sansonetti, a longtime Cheney associate in Wyoming GOP
politics.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bush To Offer Job to Cheney  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Monday selected
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be his running mate,
rounding out the GOP ticket with a Washington insider who played a
pivotal role in his father's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Two highly placed GOP sources said Bush planned to make the
offer Tuesday morning. Cheney has told associates he will accept
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes confirmed that Bush had made his
selection, but said, ''He has not yet notified that individual or
told anyone else about his choice.'' Republicans open their
presidential convention, where Bush will be officially nominated,
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney brings the ticket a wealth of foreign policy experience
and political stature -- traits that Bush, a two-term Texas
governor, lacks himself. He is a bridge between Bush and his
father, former President Bush, who put Cheney in his Cabinet and
promoted him for his son's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After promising an ''electrifying'' choice, Bush settled to take
the safe route: Cheney is a rock-solid conservative who poses
little or no political risk. Bolder choices were available,
including abortion-rights Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and
George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioning an impressive resume in two decades of public
service, Cheney served as President Ford's chief of staff, six
terms in Congress from Wyoming and four years as Pentagon chief,
where he successfully executed the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, suffered three heart attacks by age 48, but a doctor
commissioned by the Bush campaign issued a statement saying his
health ''should not interfere with a strenuous political
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 54, plucked the former Pentagon chief from the private
sector to head up his selection process, a three-month search that
ended with Cheney's name atop the short list.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home from his office at Halliburton Co. of Dallas, an
energy company he heads, Cheney was greeted by reporters. ''Have a
nice evening,'' he said, waving the journalists away.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged as the leading candidate Friday, and was the only
prospect under serious consideration after Bush emerged from
seclusion from a weekend at his Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the deal was sealed, Republican officials welcomed
the prospect of a Bush-Cheney ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, a contender for the job until the
end, called Cheney ''a man with substance (with) serious broad
experience in the public as well as private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, another contender, said Cheney
''represents the quality, character and experience that America is
searching for in national leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, whose convention begins Aug. 14 in Los
Angeles, is considering a number of candidates, including former
Senate George Mitchell of Maine, Florida Sen. Bob Graham and
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had hoped to keep his selection a secret until his
announcement, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''No news today. No news today. No news today,'' Bush told
reporters jostling for word of his choice outside the governor's
mansion Monday afternoon. ''I will let you know soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth lingered until the end on
Bush's short list, but his prospects faded throughout the weekend
as Bush mulled his options.
</P>
<P>
   Among the GOP stalwarts who had been under consideration: Gov.
Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Ridge and Pataki; former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee; Sens. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Fred
Thompson and Frist of Tennessee; and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   With so much at stake, rumors and speculation buzzed throughout
the GOP community here and in Washington. The hottest gossip:
Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who has frustrated Bush with his refusal
to serve on the ticket, had reportedly entered negotiations with
the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sources deep inside the Powell and Bush camps quickly denied the
report.
</P>
<P>
   All signs had pointed to Cheney for days. He changed his voter
registration from Texas to Wyoming to avoid a hitch in the
Constitution; he told business associates he had a good chance of
getting the job and leaving his company, Halliburton Co. of Dallas;
and he forwarded an all-clear health report from his doctors to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney sold nearly half his interest in Halliburton stock -- some
100,000 shares -- last month, raising an estimated $5.1 million.
Before the sale, Cheney held options on 229,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The health report came at the behest of Bush and his father,
former President Bush, both of whom wanted to know whether Cheney's
history of heart trouble would pose a problem in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to suggestions that the elder Bush is a quiet power
behind his son's White House bid, campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes
said the call to Cheney's doctor was the only action taken by the
former president in the review process.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney served as defense secretary under President Bush, helping
the president forge an international coalition in the Persian Gulf
War. Before that, he served six terms in Congress from Wyoming and
as chief of staff for President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has faced questions about whether he is ready to be
president, and advisers believe a running mate who knows his way
around the White House -- and around the world -- would fill in the
so-called gravitas gap.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Cheney appealed to moderates, but racked up a
conservative voting record and was a solid Ronald Reagan supporter.
He was mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for
Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is anti-abortion but says the party must accommodate
Republicans on both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney suffered three mild heart attacks more than 10 years ago,
including one while campaigning for the Wyoming House seat in the
primaries. He has undergone coronary bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A rare black mark on his record: He admitted writing 21 bad
checks while serving in the House, but told the Ethics Committee
that investigated the House banking scandal that he always had a
positive balance and no checks were returned for insufficient
funds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he gave Pentagon briefings to GOP supporters who
donated $5,000 to the Republican National Committee.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Fla. Hostage Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A three-day standoff inside a suburban home
ended Monday with the death of a hostage and the suicide of the
murder suspect who began the ordeal, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the captor, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, killed
himself with a shot to the chest and was found dead in the master
bedroom. The hostage, Andrea Hall, 40, had been dead for several
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 40, might have been shot Sunday by police sharpshooters
who fired into the home, said Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Steve
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible she was hit when Petron fired at a police
robot that entered the home Monday morning, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to leave out the possibility that a bullet
came from law enforcement,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and four other people were taken hostage Saturday, when
Petron burst in through the home's garage after shooting and
wounding a sheriff's deputy. He apparently did not know the family.
</P>
<P>
   Two children were released Sunday, and two others, including a
9-month-old baby, were freed Monday by police, shaken but unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a very scary and intense situation,'' Orange County
Sheriff Kevin Beary said.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team first entered the house around noon and discovered
Hall's body in the kitchen, said Sheriff's Capt. Michael Foreman.
The SWAT team quietly secured the house for three hours while
Petron barricaded himself in the master bedroom, Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Petron eventually shot himself in the chest and was found dead
at 3:15 p.m., police said. When Petron killed himself, hostage
Althea Mills, 16, was hiding in the bedroom's walk-in closet,
holding the 9-month-old baby and talking with police on the phone,
Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through most of this ordeal, the 16-year-old was taking care
of the baby. The family should be proud of her,'' said Orange
County Sheriff's Lt. Al Rodrigues, a hostage negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Petron, suspected in Friday's shooting death of a Pompano Beach
convenience store clerk, allegedly fled to the house Saturday after
shooting a sheriff's deputy in the leg as the deputy tried to
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The home, in the Meadow Woods subdivision south of Orlando,
belongs to Hall's sister, Thelma Mills, who escaped shortly after
the standoff began. Mills' son, Norman West, 28, was shot but
escaped Saturday, and he was in good condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 homes in the subdivision were evacuated during the
crisis. Nearly 100 federal, state and local law enforcement
officers were stationed around the home, which is located less than
10 miles east of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Petron spoke with negotiators, but police had said they were
concerned because of his broken promises and lack of demands.
Police negotiators tried blaring sirens to keep him awake Monday
and intermittently cut the power to the home.
</P>
<P>
   After two children, Nicholas Hall, 8, and his 11-month-old
sister, Nicolette, were released Sunday, Petron had said he would
free the remaining hostages after the tape of a statement he made
was aired on television. But Hall, Althea and 9-month-old Daniquea
Akoon remained in the house until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Petron said he didn't mean to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is deep in my heart I am really apologetic.
Don't think I'm the devil. I'm not the devil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Petron stopped answering the phone early Monday, police
used a robot with a built-in speaker and microphone to try to
communicate with him.
</P>
<P>
   Petron became agitated and opened fire on the robot but missed,
Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said. Solomons said
the robot recorded some of the hostages crying and one of the
hostages screaming, ''He's going to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Petron warned negotiators several times over the
51-hour standoff that it would be coming to an end. He told police
everything would be over in 20 minutes then shot himself 15 minutes
later, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't call it, whether he was going to take his life or
come out and surrender,'' said Rodrigues, a 15-year veteran hostage
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Petron was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 1986
for attempted first-degree murder, forgery and battery on a law
enforcement officer. He was released from prison in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Firearms Trigger Locks Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Master Lock Co. has voluntarily recalled about
752,000 gun locks, offering free replacements to customers, the
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two halves of some locks can be manually separated without a
key, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee company, the statement said, reports no consumer
complaints of disabled locks because of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled items are described as key-operated, tigger locks
for some Smith &AMP; Wesson and Walther firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The locks were sold since June 20, 1999, with ''Master Lock
tough under fire'' imprinted on the items' black rubber pads.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging carries the words: ''Made to exclusive Master Lock
specifications in China.''
</P>
<P>
   A yellow sticker on the items reads: ''Warning, do not use on a
loaded gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Model numbers on instruction sheets or packaging are 90, 90DSPT,
90KADSPT, 90TSPT, 90DS&AMP;W, 90KADS&AMP;W and 90TS&AMP;W, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact the company's Milwaukee headquarters Monday
evening were intercepted by recorded messages.

Joe Clark To Seek House of Commons Seat
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Tory Leader Joe Clark will seek a seat in a Nova
Scotia byelection, joining rival Canadian Alliance Leader Stockwell
Day in an attempt to reach the House of Commons by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   MP Scott Brison will announce Tuesday that he is stepping aside
in the riding of Kings-Hants to allow Clark to run. The seat has
been a safe one for the Tories, held by the party in all but one
election since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are times when an opportunity arises to do something
that makes a big difference and this is one of those occasions,''
Brison said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe very strongly that ... Joe Clark belongs in the
House of Commons and I cannot apply pressure and demonstrate that
support without offering my seat -- to do otherwise would be
hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark became leader of the Progressive Conservatives in November
1998, but said he preferred to devote himself to fundraising and
policy development in the party rather than heading straight into
the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure began to mount for him to find a way into Parliament
early this year when the Reform party merged into the Canadian
Alliance.

Alberta Gov't Releases Health-Care Clinic Draft Regulations
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The Alberta government moved Monday to
put flesh on the bare bones of its private health-care legislation,
releasing draft regulations to govern how private clinics operate
within the publicly funded system.
</P>
<P>
   Several key elements of the law have been turned over to the
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, which sets the rules
for the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Gary Mar said the doctors' group will determine
what procedures will be carried out in private clinics and whether
patients can be kept overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the college says there cannot be any overnight stays
because they cannot safely be done in such facilities, that will
end the question,'' Mar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   During the fractious debate on the bill this spring, Premier
Ralph Klein said Alberta's health-care system would allow private
clinics to do some surgeries requiring overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   That shifted as widespread opposition to the bill -- both in
Alberta and across Canada -- mounted. Mar confirmed Monday overnight
stays are only a possibility that could be ruled out by the
college.

Victoria Bank Robbery Driver Found Guilty on Seven Charges
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The driver of a getaway car in
a spectacular bank robbery in Victoria a year ago has been found
guilty of seven of nine charges, including attempted murder of a
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Allan McCallum was arrested along with notorious bank robber
Stephen Reid last June.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is serving 18 years in prison for his part in the heist,
which was followed by a car chase and shots fired at police.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum, who was sporting curly hair reaching midway down his
back, stood motionless as he was found guilty of the attempted
murder of Victoria police officer Cpl. Bill Trudeau.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau was forced to run his motorcycle off the road while in
pursuit of the pair after he came around a blind corner to find the
getaway car stopped and Reid leveling a rifle at his head.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said there was no doubt McCallum was aware of Reid's
intentions when he stopped the car, allowing his partner to get out
and aim the weapon at the approaching officer.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum was convicted of dangerous driving, having his face
masked, using a firearm to commit robbery and three counts of
discharging a firearm to prevent arrest. then out to sea.

Air Canada and Pilots Can't Agree on Mediator
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- After considering several possible mediators,
Air Canada and its pilots failed to agree Monday on who should help
settle their contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said Monday that travelers' vacation plans shouldn't
be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw is now expected to
appoint a mediator to resolve the impasse, which has left
passengers fearing for weeks that pilots could walk off the job
after giving 72 hours notice.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Foster, a spokesman for the Air Canada Pilots
Association, said passengers will not immediately be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association have
agreed not to exercise their right to a strike or lockout while the
mediation process is ongoing,'' said Foster.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Canada spokeswoman echoed those reassurances.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the traveling public, it means that they can move forward
with their travel plans without any worries,'' said Nicole
Couture-Simard.

<HEADLINE> Henry Winkler Loses Emmy Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Who would have thought a tough guy like the
Fonz could let an Emmy nomination get away?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Winkler, who played Fonzie on ''Happy Days,'' was ruled
ineligible for a comedy guest actor bid for ''Battery Park''
because the episode didn't air within the Emmy eligibility period.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler might yet be a winner: He's nominated in the drama guest
actor category for an appearance on ''The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away,'' Winkler said. ''I
am thrilled to be nominated for 'The Practice' and 'Battery Park,'
even though it did not qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   His ''Battery Park'' episode was set to air in April, but the
low-rated sitcom was pulled by NBC. The half-hour featuring Winkler
didn't air until June, and the nomination cutoff date set by the
Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences was May 31.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Macy will step into Winkler's spot with a nomination
for his work on ABC's ''Sports Night.'' He will compete with Bruce
Willis, Tom Selleck, Carl Reiner and Anthony LaPaglia. The
primetime Emmys are Sept. 10.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Family OK's Princess' Stay  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- The family of a Bahrain princess who
eloped with a U.S. Marine is willing to accept the teen-ager's wish
to remain in the United States and even facilitate her stay there,
the family's spokesman and lawyer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family is still eager for her return home but is willing
to accept her stay in the United States if that's her desire,''
said Qays Hatim Zu'bi of the princess, 19-year-old Meriam Al
Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their main concern is her health and happiness. They want
assurances that she will be well looked after,'' Zu'bi told The
Associated Press in an interview. ''Should she require assistance,
the family is willing to help her in every way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she could face deportation over charges she used false
documents to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa met Jason Johnson last year at a mall in the Bahraini
capital of Manama, where the 25-year-old Marine was assigned to a
security unit. As his deployment was ending late last year on the
Gulf island nation, he forged U.S. military documents used by Al
Khalifa to fly to the United States. Immigration officials in
Chicago discovered the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration judge on July 17 ruled that she must face charges
of illegally entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa plans to apply for political asylum on the grounds
that she faces persecution for marrying a non-Muslim if she returns
to Bahrain, according to her attorney, Jan Joseph Bejar.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa and her husband, who married in Las Vegas, live on
Camp Pendleton, a Marine base 40 miles north of San Diego, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her family is concerned about her and hope that everything
will be resolved smoothly,'' said Zu'bi of the immigration charges.
</P>
<P>
   The family has been in touch with the princess on the telephone
and by electronic mail. ''In every e-mail and phone call, Meriam
has been apologizing to her family,'' said Zu'bi of the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa, who is one of four daughters, had spoken with her
father Sheik Abdullah bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa, a distant relative of
Bahrain's ruler Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. But asked if the
family was willing to accept her non-Muslim husband, Zu'bi said:
''At present, he is not welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain's royalty rarely marry outside the family circle. Islam
forbids Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men, though Muslim
men can marry outside their faith.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Mark Brunell might have to start scrambling again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Searcy, the Jacksonville Jaguars' Pro Bowl right tackle,
could be out for the season after tearing a tendon above his right
knee in practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Searcy, who protects the left-handed Brunell's blind side, was
hurt during 1-on-1 drills at the start of morning practice. Searcy
rode off the field on a cart, clutching his right knee, wincing in
pain. He'll need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars said Searcy had a ''significant tear'' of the
quadriceps tendon. The team didn't say how long the ninth-year
tackle will be out, but bad tears of the quadriceps can take up to
nine months to heal.
</P>
<P>
   He has missed only two games since 1992 and only one since
joining the Jaguars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a freak incident,'' said defensive lineman Renaldo
Wynn, who was working opposite Searcy when the injury occurred.
''You don't expect something like that to happen, especially with
the caliber player Leon is. You've just got to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Searcy is widely considered one of the best blockers in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's pretty darn important,'' coach Tom Coughlin said. ''But
hopefully, it's not something we can't overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell has rushed for 400 yards the last two seasons, after
totaling 1,133 his first three years with the Jaguars.
Panthers:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Eric Swann followed Reggie White to Carolina,
signing a one-year deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, a 10-year veteran released by Arizona two weeks ago,
turned down guaranteed offers from the Jacksonville Jaguars and
Denver Broncos. He held out for the Panthers, who play in his home
state, and for White, who signed with Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is for one year and worth about the league minimum of
$440,000 for veterans, Swann's agent Steve Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, 29, played in the 1995 Pro Bowl with White and has been
bugging Zucker to reunite the players ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Swann has arthritic knees and has undergone seven knee
operations over his career. He missed 18 of 34 games the last two
seasons with the Cardinals.
Vikings:
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft choice Chris Hovan signed Monday, giving
Minnesota all of its players in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The All-American defensive lineman from Boston College, the 25th
overall pick in April, was expected to report to camp Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of Hovan's contract were not announced, but the Saint Paul
Pioneer Press reported the deal was worth about $5 million over
five years, including a $3 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   With the retirement of Jerry Ball last week, Hovan -- who can
play end or tackle -- is expected to compete for a starting position
on the defensive line, which also lost Chris Doleman to retirement
and Duane Clemons to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ball, Doleman and Clemons combined for 19 sacks last season.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   It seems a change of mind is working well for Mike Martz, the
new coach of St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   When Martz took over the Super Bowl championship team from Dick
Vermeil, he was not going to hire an offensive coordinator.
Instead, he was going to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before training camp, however, Martz elevated
running backs coach Bobby Jackson to offensive coordinator. He also
made receivers coach Al Saunders an associate head coach to take
care of administrative details that might have bogged him down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want my learning curve as a head coach to affect this
team,'' Martz said. ''I just didn't feel like I was doing an
adequate job in some areas, and I think this has really helped me.
I know it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agent for quarterback Kurt Warner said a
long-term deal for the MVP does not appear imminent. Warner signed
an interim deal for the veteran's minimum on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big issue is structure,'' Mark Bartelstein said. ''I don't
think we're miles apart, but I wouldn't say we're close.''
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Chad Clifton, a second-round draft pick,
signed a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton held out of the first week of training camp while his
agent and the Packers worked out a deal. The negotiations were
difficult because so few second-round picks have signed contracts,
said Andrew Brandt, Green Bay's chief contract negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton, who played on a national champion at Tennessee as a
junior and was a second-team All-American as a senior, can play all
five line positions, he but is expected to start on the Packers'
left side, offensive line coach Larry Beightol said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers also waived center Grant Garrett and offensive
tackle Tony Berti. Both players were signed to provide protection

Saints:

<P>
   Offensive guard Chris Naeole has a sprained ligament in his left
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Naeole injured the knee in a hard fall late in the Black &AMP; Gold
scrimmage Saturday and had to be helped off the field. Tests
conducted Sunday indicated the ligament was not torn and there is
no word on how long he will be out of practice. Naeole injured the
same knee during his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Saints officials say Naeole will begin rehabbing the knee
immediately.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond made his first appearance at training camp, but it
will be a while before the former Arizona State running back makes
it to the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, the Patriots' third-round draft choice, signed a
four-year, $1.7 million contract Saturday after missing the first
week of the Patriots' camp. He is still recovering from minor
surgery on a groin muscle tear in June.

<HEADLINE> 3 Wounded in Mexico Police Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Attackers fired assault rifles at a police
station, wounding a police captain and two members of a family with
a barrage of bullets, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Rafael Hernandez Gutierrez was shot in the back during the
attack Sunday night, while Juan Carlos Garcia and his son were
grazed by bullets, police spokesman Victor Manuel Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Mexico City newspaper and a radio station reported
receiving anonymous calls saying the People's Revolutionary Armed
Forces, or FARP, was responsible for the attack, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, an air force captain, and his family were in a car in
front of the station, 15 miles outside Mexico City. His wife and
three other young children were cut from flying glass when the
bullets hit their car, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez was hospitalized in stable condition, authorities
said. The others were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe six gunmen shot at the station from a nearby
hill. More than 120 police were scouring the area Monday but had
made no arrests by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The government has identified the FARP as one of five splinter
groups of the Popular Revolutionary Army, a Marxist guerrilla group
based in Guerrero state.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a small explosive went off at another federal police
station in the city, causing minor damage but no injuries. Shortly
afterward, a child was injured after he found another small
explosive planted outside that same station.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez was activated
from the 15-day disabled list by the Seattle Mariners before Monday
night's game against the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle said Rodriguez would not not start the game, but was
available to pinch-hit. Rodriguez fielded ground balls, ran the
bases and took batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   He twisted his right knee July 8, when he fell after colliding
with Dodgers' shortstop Alex Cora while trying to break up a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Rodriguez on the roster, the Mariners optioned
Charles Gipson to Triple-A Tacoma.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A three-day standoff inside a suburban home ended today
with the death of a hostage and the suicide of the murder suspect who began the
ordeal, police said. Authorities said the captor, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, killed
himself with a shot to the chest and was found dead in the master bedroom. The
hostage, Andrea Hall, 40, had been dead for several hours. Hall, 40, might have
been shot Sunday by police sharpshooters who fired into the home, said Orange
County Sheriff's Capt. Steve Jones. It's also possible she was hit when Petron
fired at a police robot that entered the home Monday morning, Jones said.

Boston's Everett Drops Appeal

   BOSTON (AP) -- Carl Everett dropped his appeal of a 10-game suspension and
began serving it tonight as the Boston Red Sox opened a three-game series with
Minnesota. The All-Star outfielder, who took batting practice before the Red Sox
faced the Twins, apparently elected to start serving the penalty because of
soreness in his right hand. Everett hurt himself while punching a bat rack
following the ejection that led to his suspension. He is batting .316 and leads
Boston with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Eric Milton allowed four hits in eight shutout
innings as the Minnesota Twins beat the Boston Red Sox for the
first time in eight games this season, 4-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which lost just for the fourth time in 12 games since
the All-Star break, outscored the Twins 68-37 in the previous seven
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Red Sox center fielder Carl Everett
unexpectedly dropped his appeal of a 10-game suspension for bumping
plate umpire Ronald Kulpa twice during a July 15 game. He will be
eligible to return when Kansas City comes to Boston on August 4.
</P>
<P>
   Everett withdrew his appeal because of a sore right hand,
incurred when he punched a bat rack after he was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer hit a two-run homer for Minnesota, which won for the
fourth time in five games. Corey Koskie and Chad Moeller each drove
in runs.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (9-6), who gave up seven runs in three innings during a
14-4 loss to the Red Sox on July 4, allowed just one runner to
reach second, when Jeff Frye doubled leading off the fourth. He
walked one and struck out eight in posting his first win in four
July starts after going 0-4 with an 8.02 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells got one out in the ninth before allowing Nomar
Garciaparra's double. Eddie Guardado relieved and got another out
before Israel Alcantara hit his second career home run to cut it to
4-2. Guardado then struck out Sean Berry to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tomo Ohka (0-1), making his first major league start this season
after being recalled from Pawtucket on July 21, gave up four runs
and 11 hits in five-plus innings. He was 9-6 with a 3.08 ERA in
Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which was swept and outscored 44-27 in a four-game
series at the Metrodome earlier this month, went ahead 1-0 in the
first when Koskie doubled home David Ortiz, who singled.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer made it 3-0 with his 13th homer in the third following
Denny Hocking's single. Moeller's RBI double made it 4-0 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ohka was 1-2 with a 6.23 ERA with the Red Sox last season.
... Berry, recalled from Pawtucket on Sunday, started his first
game at third base for the Red Sox. Berry signed a minor league
contract June 27. ... Ortiz singled in his first at-bat, giving him
16 hits in 24 at-bats, before going hitless his next three trips.
... Minnesota 3B Koskie fell into his own dugout after catching a
foul pop in the first. ... Boston right-hander Bret Saberhagen,
recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, threw 52 pitches for
Pawtucket in his second rehab start, throwing four scoreless
innings. He allowed two hits, walked two and struck out two. ...
Red Sox OF Bernard Gilkey is in a 2-for-20 slump.

<HEADLINE> Mesa Verde Fire Burns 20,000 Acres  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- A furious wildfire grew
dangerously out of control Monday as it roared through canyons and
moved toward the heart of the nation's largest archaeological
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews fought the 20,000-acre blaze at Mesa Verde National
Park in southwestern Colorado with the help of archaeologists who
walked along in front to pinpoint ancient sites that need special
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 500 firefighters toiled in 90-degree temperatures
against a blaze that sent flames 200 feet in the air and created
plumes of smoke that were visible for miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That smoke plume that you see there is not just a plume going
up into the sky. It is extreme energy. This is awesome power that
we're looking at,'' said fire management team spokesman Justin
Dombrowski. ''If you put somebody in front of those 200-foot
flames, they are going to die. If you dump slurry on it, you've
just wasted your retardant because there's nothing you can do to
slow the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire started Thursday after an apparent lightning strike and
has since cut a swath 8 miles long and 4 miles wide, fueled by
tinder-dry trees and shrubs. No injuries or major structural damage
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was moving quickly toward the nation's largest
archaeological preserve, just 4.5 miles from the ruins known as
Cliff Palace, a major park attraction that was built by Pueblo
Indians between 600 and 1300 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire has uncovered several previously unknown sites,
stripping away covering vegetation. But the blaze poses
considerable danger as it threatens the ancient ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists are marking the sites with color-coded flags that
denote new and previously identified sites. After the fire is out,
they will survey and research the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting together the pieces of the puzzle of how people
who have been gone for hundreds of years live,'' said National Park
Service archaeologist Jane Anderson. ''You make your best guess on
what you can find and we're finding a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A fire in the 52,000-acre park in 1996 damaged a petroglyph
carved into a rock wall by cliff dwellers more than 1,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, dozens of other wildfires burned out of
control. Fires in southern California, Washington, Montana and New
Mexico wiped out more than 20,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Fires have burned nearly 3 million acres nationwide this season,
the largest acreage total since 1996, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.

<HEADLINE> The Seven Seas Wins at Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Seven Seas rallied from far off the
pace to win Monday's $136,375 Estrapade Stakes by 1&AMP;frac34; lengths over
Keemoon on the closing day of Hollywood Park's 65-day Spring/Summer
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Seven Seas, ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 121 pounds,
covered 1&AMP;frac12; miles on turf in 2:27 1-5 and, as the 3-2 favorite, paid
$5, $3 and $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the fourth in nine lifetime starts for The Seven
Seas and was worth $81,825, raising the career earnings of the
4-year-old Kentucky-bred daughter of El Gran Senor to $229,972.
</P>
<P>
   ''They key with her is to wait until the last eighth of a mile
to make her run,'' Solis said. ''It's amazing, the turn of foot she
has. She just explodes the last part.''
</P>
<P>
   Keemoon, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carrying 117 pounds,
crossed the finish line 2&AMP;frac12; lengths in front of Country Garden and
returned $6 and $4.
</P>
<P>
   Country Garden, ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr. and carrying 117
pounds, was 1&AMP;frac12; lengths ahead of Bienandanza at the wire and paid $3
to show.
</P>
<P>
   Following Bienandanza across the finish line in the fifth
running of the race for fillies and mares were Sweet Eternity,
Marie De Bayeux and Undressed. Gleefully was scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Eternity, the 7-2 second-favorite, led most of the way
before fading.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Espinoza won the Hollywood Park jockey title -- his first
major championship -- with 62 victories, including one on closing
day. Corey Nakatani finished with 51 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing in Southern California now shifts to the San
Diego area, where Del Mar begins its 61st racing season Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting opening day of the 43-day meeting will be the
Oceanside Stakes for 3-year-olds, which will be run in split
divisions for the 13th straight year.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Gov't Pledges Voting Rights  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Top advisers to Mexico's president-elect said
Monday that one of their first priorities will be giving the vote
to Mexicans living abroad.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million Mexicans live abroad, the vast majority in the
United States. They constitute about 14 percent of all Mexicans of
voting age, according to Mexico's independent Federal Electoral
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   All major political parties have long professed their desire to
let those Mexicans vote, and in 1996 Mexico's Congress unanimously
approved a law giving them the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress failed to approve a mechanism for such voting -- a
failure that opposition parties blamed on the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Vicente Fox won the presidency, ending the PRI's
71-year rule. Both Fox's National Action Party and the main leftist
opposition, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, repeatedly have
pledged to enable the vote abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties together now will have a collective majority in
both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it will happen. There will be voting abroad in the next
elections,'' one of Fox's top political advisers, Santiago Creel,
said Monday. ''We are in agreement (with Democratic Revolution)
that Mexicans be allowed to vote in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists in the United States are still cautious about that
pledge. Many worry that the problems that have held up the voting
so far could continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''They promised it several years ago, but in politics promises
can be betrayed,'' said Felipe Aguirre, a voting-rights activist in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 million Mexicans in the United States, only an
estimated 1.5 million are registered voters. A voter-registration
drive in a foreign country with a widely dispersed population would
be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who would be allowed to vote; the law is unclear,
for example, on whether Mexicans who become foreign citizens would
be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should people be able to vote if they've never been to Mexico?
If they don't have ties to Mexico? If they don't speak Spanish?''
asked Jorge Santibanez, president of the College of the Northern
Border in Tijuana. ''Maybe now there's a political will, but the
operational reality is not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems feasible that those 1&AMP;frac12; million with voting
credentials could vote,'' Santibanez said. ''But I see it as very
improbable that all 10 million Mexicans in the United States will
be voting in Mexican elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about financing and organizing the vote beyond Mexican
borders also complicated the debate in Mexico's Congress. Mexican
election laws demand elaborate safeguards which would be
complicated to enforce elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 2 elections, Mexicans abroad were almost
disenfranchised. Only a few special polling places were set up
along the border -- which is a long way from Chicago or New York --
and almost all quickly ran out of their legally allotted 750
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Many PRI officials had been reluctant to see Mexicans abroad
voting because they overwhelmingly supported other parties. Many
fled Mexico because of the economic conditions they blamed on the
long-ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the PRI that elected the first U.S. resident to
Mexico's Congress. Eddie Varon of Los Angeles won a
proportional-representation seat for the ruling party and will join
the lower house in September.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Halts Deployment in Congo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations said Monday it has
postponed deployment of its first armed units to the Congo after
the government said it didn't wanted gun-toting U.N. forces in
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that by refusing to allow in an armed
contingent of Tunisian troops, Congo President Laurent Kabila was
reneging on the deal for deployment of the 5,537-strong U.N.
observer mission throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deployment of the Tunisian unit cannot take place unless
the government provides the necessary guarantees of cooperation
with it,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila said Friday that the U.N. Mission in Congo, or MONUC,
shouldn't insist on deploying armed troops to the capital,
Kinshasa, and another government-held city, Mbandaka.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the government has saved Mbandaka, we don't need to
be defended by the MONUC any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council authorized the peacekeeper mission to
oversee a shaky cease-fire signed by Kabila and his allies,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, and the rebels, who are backed by
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials noted that Kabila's comments followed another
refusal by his government to allow a South African specialized unit
to deploy and beef up the U.N. presence in the northern city of
Kisangani, which was the site of clashes between Rwandan and
Ugandan forces last month.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was to have moved more troops into the city
after Rwanda and Uganda agreed to demilitarize and move their
forces out.

<HEADLINE> Dems attack VP selection  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York Democrats were quick to attack
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's widely reported running mate choice as
a look back - to the days of George Bush Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a return to the failed policies of his father,'' state
Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope said Monday after hearing
news reports Bush had picked former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
as candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like his advisers wanted him to have an adult around
to help him,'' Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, 59, is seen as a bridge between Bush and his father, who
as president put Cheney in his Cabinet and promoted him for his
son's ticket. He was mentioned as a possible running mate for the
elder Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The six-term senator from Wyoming also served as chief of staff
for President Ford and was Pentagon chief during the Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, he voted against Democrats on almost every social
issue, including abortion rights and gun control, earning a nearly
perfect rating from the American Conservative Union.
</P>
<P>
   He was likewise an ardent supporter of President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   With the news Monday night coming from everywhere but Bush
himself, Committee officials said they were reluctant to predict
how that choice would play with voters.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman Bill Powers hailed Cheney, and
his record.
</P>
<P>
   ''A wise man and a wise choice,'' Powers said. ''He's been
tested. He's come through very well as chief of staff, congressman,
as secretary of defense in the Persian Gulf War. I think he'll do
very well in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who was himself on the short list of
possible running mates, likewise called Cheney an ''outstanding
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney does have that record of government service, record of
leadership in a very difficult time during the Gulf War,'' Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two highly placed GOP sources said Bush planned to make the
offer Tuesday morning. Cheney has told associates he will accept
it.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pleads Innocent in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The 13-year-old boy accused of firing a gun in a
middle-school cafeteria pleaded innocent Monday to eight felony
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Warnock, who remains in juvenile detention, is suspected of
firing a .22-caliber pistol at the ceiling July 17 during summer
classes at Dimmitt Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, and he allegedly fled when other students ran
away rather than obey his order to herd themselves on a stage. He
turned himself in the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock was charged Friday with three counts of assault, three
counts of kidnapping, one count of unlawful possession of a firearm
by a minor and one count of possession of a stolen firearm. If
convicted, he could be held until age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the King County prosecutor's office said that a
12-year-old boy arrested in the case would be released pending a
closer look at his role, if any, in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Mesa Verde Fire Burns 22,000 Acres  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- A furious wildfire grew
dangerously out of control Monday as it roared through canyons and
moved toward the heart of the nation's largest archaeological
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews fought the 22,000-acre blaze at Mesa Verde National
Park in southwestern Colorado with the help of archaeologists who
walked along in front to pinpoint ancient sites that need special
protection.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 firefighters toiled in 90-degree temperatures
against a blaze that sent flames 200 feet in the air and created
plumes of smoke that were visible for miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That smoke plume that you see there is not just a plume going
up into the sky. It is extreme energy. This is awesome power that
we're looking at,'' said fire management team spokesman Justin
Dombrowski. ''If you put somebody in front of those 200-foot
flames, they are going to die. If you dump slurry on it, you've
just wasted your retardant because there's nothing you can do to
slow the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire's advance was slowed, however, when it ran into two
areas denuded by earlier wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, a break. This is something we've been looking for for
days,'' Dombrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started Thursday after an apparent lightning strike and
has since cut a swath 8 miles long and 4 miles wide, fueled by
tinder-dry trees and shrubs. No injuries or major structural damage
have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was moving quickly toward the nation's largest
archaeological preserve, just 4.5 miles from the ruins known as
Cliff Palace, a major park attraction that was built by Pueblo
Indians between 600 and 1300 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire has uncovered several previously unknown sites,
stripping away covering vegetation. But the blaze poses
considerable danger as it threatens the ancient ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists are marking the sites with color-coded flags that
denote new and previously identified sites. After the fire is out,
they will survey and research the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting together the pieces of the puzzle of how people
who have been gone for hundreds of years live,'' said National Park
Service archaeologist Jane Anderson. ''You make your best guess on
what you can find and we're finding a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A fire in the 52,000-acre park in 1996 damaged a petroglyph
carved into a rock wall by cliff dwellers more than 1,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, dozens of other wildfires burned out of
control. Fires in Southern California, Washington, Montana and New
Mexico wiped out tens of thousands of acres.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of lightning-strike wildfires in northeastern Washington
had blackened 13,000 acres by Monday, destroying 30 homes and
forcing evacuation of dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   Near Helena, Mont., a pair of wildfires straddling Canyon Ferry
Lake and pushed by gusty, hot winds were burning out of control
Monday, charring at least 10,000 acres and threatening as many as
100 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Additional manpower poured onto the lines of a 44,000-acre fire
burning in the central Idaho backcountry near the Montana state
line.
</P>
<P>
   Fires have burned nearly 3 million acres nationwide this season,
the largest acreage total since 1996, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Roger Clemens won his fifth straight start as
the New York Yankees ruined an impressive major league debut by
Baltimore Orioles left-hander John Parrish with a 4-3 victory
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill homered in his initial at-bat with the Yankees,
who have won seven of 10. Hill was acquired Friday in a trade with
the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (9-6) gave up three runs, six hits and a season-high
tying five walks in six innings. He struck out six and had only one
perfect inning, stranding eight to remain unbeaten in six starts
since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton retired five straight batters and Mariano Rivera
got four outs for his 23rd save in 26 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore went 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was nearly outdone by Parrish, a 22-year-old who never
pitched above the Double-A level before this year. Parrish (0-1)
struck out nine, including Jorge Posada three times, and allowed
only three earned runs, four hits and two walks in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie retired 11 straight at one point, efficiently mixing
a sweeping curve with a 93 mph fastball. His nine strikeouts tied a
team record by an Oriole in his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   After Parrish struck out the side on 12 pitches in the first,
the Orioles took a 1-0 lead in their half on singles by Brady
Anderson and Mike Bordick and a run-scoring grounder by Delino
DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Hill led off the second with a 394-shot to left, but Baltimore
regained the lead in the bottom half on an RBI double by Charles
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   New York went up 4-2 in the third. After Chuck Knoblauch hit a
sacrifice fly and Derek Jeter singled in a run, an error by Orioles
rookie third baseman Ivanon Coffie allowed Jeter to score.
</P>
<P>
   Again Baltimore responded, closing to 4-3 in its half when
DeShields singled, stole second and scored on a two-out single by
Will Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth against
Clemens, who struck out Bordick to escape the jam.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rivera moved past Goose Gossage into sole possession of
second place on the Yankees' save list (152). Dave Righetti has
224. ... Jeter has hit in 12 straight games and is on a 13-for-26
streak. ... DeShields stole two bases for the seventh time this
year. He has a team-high 26 steals, 15 ahead of Anderson, who has
led Baltimore for eight straight seasons. ... Parrish tied the
Orioles strikeout mark held by Sammy Stewart, who struck out nine
in his Baltimore debut in 1978. ... New York's Ryan Thompson
snapped an 0-for-13 skid with a seventh-inning single. ... Hill's
homer was his first in the AL since 1993. ... Albert Belle went
0-for-3 against Clemens and is .185 lifetime against him.

Cheney Said To Be GOP VP Pick
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush has chosen Former Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney as his GOP vice presidential running mate, rounding out the GOP ticket
with a Washington insider who played a pivotal role in his father's presidency.
Two highly placed GOP sources said Bush planned to make the offer tomorrow
morning. Cheney, who played a key role in the presidency of the Texas governor's
father, has indicated he would accept the offer to join the ticket. A Bush
spokeswoman confirmed he had made his pick, but added, ''He has not yet notified

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore

poll, though Bush holds persistent underlying advantages on voters' perception
of several important personal qualities. A majority of voters saw Bush, the
Republican governor of Texas, as unlikely to keep the budget balanced while
cutting income taxes; more thought Vice President Gore had a better knowledge of
world affairs, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released tonight.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A three-day standoff inside a suburban home ended today
with the death of a hostage and the suicide of the murder suspect who began the
ordeal, police said. Authorities said the captor, Jamie Dean Petron, 41, killed
himself with a shot to the chest and was found dead in the master bedroom. The
hostage, Andrea Hall, 40, had been dead for several hours. Hall, 40, might have
been shot Sunday by police sharpshooters who fired into the home, said Orange
County Sheriff's Capt. Steve Jones. It's also possible she was hit when Petron
fired at a police robot that entered the home Monday morning, Jones said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Close to 1 million elderly and disabled Americans will be
jettisoned by HMOs as they pull out of the Medicare program this year, the
Clinton administration said today. The figure is more than 220,000 higher than
the HMO industry estimated just two weeks ago. HMOs participating in Medicare
had until July 3 to inform the government of intentions to quit the program. The
earlier estimate in an informal survey by an industry group said at least
711,000 Medicare recipients would lose HMO coverage. The Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare, put that number at 934,000 in today's
announcement, based on figures compiled after the July 3 deadline.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Reigning AL MVP Ivan Rodriguez will miss the rest of
the season for the Texas Rangers after breaking his right thumb in tonight's

Rodriguez was hurt when his thumb hit Mo Vaughn's bat on a swinging third strike
as he threw to second base on a steal attempt by Kevin Stocker.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Sign Top Pick DiPietro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders signed Rick
DiPietro, the first goalie selected No. 1 in the NHL entry draft,
to a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The team scheduled a news conference for Tuesday to announce the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations began shortly after the Islanders used the first
pick in last month's draft on the 18-year-old goalie from Boston
University. The team announced that a deal was completed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, from Winthrop, Mass., was the top-ranked North
American goalie by NHL Central Scouting. He went 17-3-5 with a 2.50
goals-against average and a .909 save percentage last season. He
also set an NCAA record with 77 saves in one game.
</P>
<P>
   After just one year of college, DiPietro made himself available
for the draft and voided his remaining three years of eligibility.
The decision was made to avoid going into a goalie-heavy draft next
year.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day, New York made room for DiPietro by trading both of
their goalies from last season. Kevin Weekes was sent to the Tampa
Bay Lightning and Roberto Luongo went to the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo held the distinction of being the highest selected goalie
ever when New York picked him No. 4 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro will conduct a private clinic for more than 20 young
goalies on Tuesday morning and then join Islanders co-owner Charles
Wang and general manager Mike Milbury to announce the deal.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' C Rodriguez Out For Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Reigning AL MVP Ivan Rodriguez will miss
the rest of the season for the Texas Rangers after breaking his
right thumb in Monday night's game against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, regarded by many as the best all-around catcher in
the majors, began the day batting .347 with 27 home runs and 83
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what happens when the team isn't going good,''
Rodriguez said. ''What can I do? But I have a strong mind and I'll
be ready for spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was hurt when his thumb hit Mo Vaughn's bat on a
swinging third strike as he threw to second base on Kevin Stocker's
steal attempt. Stocker was called out by home plate umpire Gerry
Davis on batter's interference.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Vaughn did nothing wrong, and added the Angels
first baseman left a message in the Rangers clubhouse expressing
his sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was on purpose,'' Rodriguez said. ''Mo is a
very clean player.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 28, played earlier this month in his ninth straight
All-Star game. He has won eight consecutive Gold Glove awards, an
AL record.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the Rangers' career hits leader, will have surgery
Tuesday afternoon at a Fort Worth hospital to repair the break at
the base of his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Team director of medical services Dr. John Conway said Rodriguez
will need 6-10 weeks for the fracture to heal. Rodriguez will be
able to resume sports-related activities in 2-4 months.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said there were no guarantees that Rodriguez would be
able to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime there's an injury like this, there's a possibility for
a loss of performance,'' Conway said. ''But we think he'll make a
full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Rangers said Rodriguez would spend time
in the offseason learning a new position, possibly second base, in
hopes of reducing the rigors of catching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers purchased the contract of catcher B.J. Waszgis from
Triple-A Oklahoma. Rodriguez will be placed on the 15-day disabled
list Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was taken to a hospital for X-rays, which revealed the
fracture. The Rangers said he would have surgery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as it happened, my thumb went numb. There was swelling
and I knew it was broken and I'd be out for the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, the AL West champion the last two seasons, began
the night 10&AMP;frac12; games behind division-leading Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he had thrown out 16 of 33 (48.5 percent) would-be
basestealers. Last year, he caught 54.2 percent, the fifth straight
season he led the AL in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez won the MVP last year when he hit .332 with an
AL-record 35 home runs by a catcher. He had 113 RBIs and scored 116
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was having a strong season so it's disappointing for it to
end two months before it was supposed to,'' Rodriguez said. ''But
there's always next season. I'll just go out and put up better
numbers next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said Rodriguez's
season-ending injury, coupled with the loss of highly touted rookie
center fielder Ruben Mateo to a broken right leg on June 2, seemed
to sum up his team's season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad day,'' Melvin said. ''We always take Pudge for
granted that he's always going to be out there. But you have to
realize it can happen to anybody. You wonder which player your team
can least afford to lose. He falls into that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin was unsure whether the loss of Rodriguez would mean his
team would be more willing to trade impending free agents like
David Segui and John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clock is still running on our players who are going to be
free agents,'' Melvin said. ''But that doesn't change our thinking.
We're still going to try and win every game that we can. This does
give a chance to some of our young players.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit in High Gear  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Enmeshed in the tough details, President
Clinton will extend the Mideast summit talks as long as there is
''a realistic chance'' he can hammer out a peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians, his spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the two sides had been able to find some areas of
agreement in the first two weeks of talks, spokesman Joe Lockhart
said, ''They are trying to find areas of agreement. They have
probably found some.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman indicated, at the same time, that the summit was
likely to continue at least through Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton intended to go to Arkansas during the day to
attend a memorial service for Diane Blair, a University of Arkansas
political science professor and close friend, and return Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Lockhart said, ''there is no way of predicting
how long this will go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Israeli camp, negotiator Ammon Lipkin-Shahak said he
could not give odds on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's either zero or 100 ... One can't know.'' he said. ''The
argument is not over decisions, but positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Duplicating the hands-on mediation of President Jimmy Carter at
Camp David 22 years ago, Clinton met with a mixed group of Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. negotiators until after 5 a.m. and then got
together with them again for four hours after a few hours' sleep.
</P>
<P>
   At late afternoon, during a brief break in the talks, Lockhart
said the White House believed ''it's still constructive to continue
these sessions.'' Additional talks were scheduled Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   He described the talks as ''exhaustive and exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the talks might collide with the Republican
convention, which next week will nominate George W. Bush as the GOP
presidential candidate, Lockhart said, ''I don't think there's a
sense that those two things were going to collide. ... Governor
Bush has been properly supportive of the president so I don't think
on either side there's an attempt to play politics with this.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said the talks were at a critical juncture. Top
negotiator Shlomo Ben-Ami told Israel's army radio Monday that
''the outcome ... will become finally or almost finally clear
during the next two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Back Sunday evening from economic talks in Japan, Clinton was
briefed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her weekend in
charge, met separately with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, had dinner with them and their
delegations and then began ''trying to work through the details''
with an array of negotiators, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held another round of detailed talks Monday with
negotiators -- not including Arafat and Barak -- making a ''rolling
assessment'' of whether the substance and atmosphere of the
discussions ''have the potential to lead to an agreement,'' his
spokesman said. Arafat and Clinton met for an hour in early
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Carter in 1978 took on much of the heavy detail work
at a 13-day summit with the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
the late Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin that produced a
peace treaty the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's summit was in its 14th day Monday with no indication
Clinton was ready to call a halt. Guardedly upbeat, Lockhart said,
''As long as we are sitting here there is a prospect of
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Implying Clinton was going for broke -- an overall agreement
instead of a partial accord -- Lockhart said, ''To reach an
agreement, they need to work through each of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   None is more difficult than Jerusalem, which Arafat wants split
into Jewish and Palestinian parts, hoping to establish his capital
in the older part of the ancient and historically contested city.
Pope John Paul II proposed Sunday that it be made an international
city, a suggestion from which the White House kept its distance.
</P>
<P>
   Other core issues, all fraught with emotion and security
implications, include how much of the West Bank will be
relinquished by Israel, how many Palestinian refugees will be taken
in by the Jewish state, and how many Israeli Jews will remain on
the West Bank and in Gaza after Arafat turns the territories into a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the issue of Jonathan Pollard, an American
convicted and jailed for spying for Israel, was on the table,
Lockhart said, ''I'm not aware that it's come up in the context of
the discussions.'' He noted, however, that he knows of no time that
Clinton and Barak talked that Israel's request for his release was
not raised.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's willingness to make concessions far exceeding those of
his predecessors has weakened his political support at home. Three
political parties have quit his government and his foreign
minister, David Levy, declined to participate in the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''No prime minister has the right to make concessions over
Jerusalem,'' Ariel Sharon, the tough-minded former Likud foreign
minister, told Israel radio. ''Jerusalem is the birthright of the
Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, top Arafat aide Tayib Abdel Rahim said
Arafat stood ready to provide all faiths with access to Jerusalem's
holy sites -- as long as that was part of a sovereignty pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The solution is very simple -- give full sovereignty of East
Jerusalem to a Palestinian state,'' Abdel Rahim, who is in frequent
contact with Arafat, told reporters in Gaza. ''We are ready to have
Jerusalem as an open city for all religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel took over east Jerusalem from Jordanian occupation
in the 1967 Mideast war, all faiths have had access to their holy
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, meanwhile, is sensitive to other Arab leaders as the
negotiations proceed.
</P>
<P>
   After Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak traveled to Saudi Arabia
on Sunday for talks with King Fahd, Saudi officials said the two
leaders were anxious to ensure that at least part of Jerusalem
would come under Palestinian sovereignty. Mubarak also was expected
to talk in coming days with Syria's new President Bashar Assad and
Jordan's King Abdullah II, in their capitals or his.

<HEADLINE> Sting 82, Fever 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Andrea Stinson scored 21 of her game-high
24 points in the second half and overtime Monday night as the
Charlotte Sting rallied to beat the Indiana Fever 82-78 for their
third victory in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte tied a franchise record by connecting on nine
3-pointers, including Stinson's with 4.9 seconds remaining in
regulation to send the game into overtime. Indiana's Rita Williams
then missed a shot in the lane that would have won the game at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Staley opened the scoring in overtime with a 3-pointer for
Charlotte. Indiana tied the game at 75-75 on two Danielle McCulley
free throws before Stinson gave Charlotte the lead for good with
another 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams scored seven straight points midway through the second
half to help Indiana build a 62-53 lead with 7:51 left. But the
Sting (6-18) came back behind the play of Stinson, an All-Star, and
rookie forward Tiffany Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Travis, a reserve, recorded career-highs of 16 points and seven
rebounds in 27 minutes for Charlotte, which opened the season with
a 3-17 record.
</P>
<P>
   Williams led the Fever (6-17) with a season-high 21 points,
including making 11 of 12 attempts on free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Grubin added 13 points for Indiana, but Kara Wolters was
held to nine points and two rebounds. She played just 14 minutes
because of foul trouble.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Raid Parliament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Two hundred protesters threw bottles and
eggs and toppled automobiles then stormed into the Turkish
parliament on Cyrpus Monday, demanding government reimbursement for
money lost in the collapse of six banks.
</P>
<P>
   Police quickly pushed the demonstrators from the building,
arresting 10, Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament canceled its meeting after the protesters stormed in
and Prime Minister Dervis Eroglu met with representatives of the
demonstrators, Anatolia reported.
</P>
<P>
   The protest started when about 1,000 people gathered in a
Nicosia park to protest the government's failure to reimburse
depositors who lost their saving when six Turkish Cypriot banks
collapsed earlier this year amid allegations of bad management.
</P>
<P>
   The government had drawn up a plan to give depositors a total of
about $16 million, but the plan has not yet been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations are rare in Turkish Cyprus, a small community
estimated at about 200,000 whose administration is recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish-occupied north and a
Greek-controlled south since Turkey invaded the island in 1974
after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Mosquitoes carrying the West Nile Virus have
been found in Central Park and on Staten Island, prompting city
officials to order the park closed Monday night and canceling a
concert that had been expected to draw 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The city began spraying the park with insecticide at 10 p.m.
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, on Wednesday, the ground spraying will expand
to Manhattan between 23rd and 110th streets. Spraying previously
scheduled for Staten Island on Monday night and parts of Queens and
Brooklyn on Tuesday also was to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said residents should not be alarmed by
the discovery of infected mosquitoes or the ground spraying of the
synthetic pesticides Sumithrin and Resmethrin, which could cause
breathing problems for the elderly and people with respiratory
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public should not have a great deal of apprehension,''
Giuliani told a City Hall press conference. ''Go about your lives
normally, but for one night, stay out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The park closed at 9:30 p.m., postponing a free performance by
the New York Philharmonic and a road race for children. Giuliani
said the concert likely would be held Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of infected mosquitoes marks the first time that
the potentially deadly West Nile virus has been found in mosquitoes
in the city this year. Earlier this summer, the virus was found in
birds and mosquitoes in the suburbs that ring the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people and infected
62 others in the New York metropolitan area, prompting the city and
neighboring areas to undertake a massive campaign of aerial and
ground spraying.
</P>
<P>
   To staunch a new outbreak this year, the city embarked on a
program of trapping and testing mosquitoes, placing flocks of
sentinel chickens around the city to detect the presence of the
virus early and placing mosquito larvae-eating fish in water
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious cases, the West Nile virus causes infection
resulting in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Elderly
individuals or those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The infected mosquitoes were found in Central Park near 63rd
Street on the east side of the park and in Staten Island in the
Fresh Kills landfill and Pond Park.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protests about the insecticides' potential risk to human
health and animal life, Giuliani said he was primarily concerned
with human life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to wait until it (the virus) shows up in human
beings like it did last year,'' Giuliani said. ''And I'm sorry, but
if it (the insecticide) kills animals, it kills animals. My job as
mayor of New York City is to help protect human life as much as
possible.''

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez hit a three-run go-ahead home run
and Carlos Lee drove in three runs, leading the Chicago White Sox
to a 7-6 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez homered off Mac Suzuki (5-5) with two outs in the
seventh, while Lee had a two-run homer in the second and an RBI
single in the sixth for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon had three hits and three RBIs and rookie Mark Quinn
had a career-high four hits for the Royals, who dropped their third
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wunsch (4-3) picked up the win with two-thirds of an
inning in relief. Keith Foulke pitched two perfect innings for his
18th save in 20 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki gave up seven runs -- six earned -- on eight hits and three
walks in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-4 in the seventh, Brook Fordyce doubled and Ray
Durham walked. After Jose Valentin's sacrifice, Suzuki got Frank
Thomas to pop up. But Ordonez followed with his 24th homer on a 2-2
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Damon hit a two-out RBI single in the second off starter Mark
Buehrle for a 1-0 Kansas City lead.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the bottom half, Paul Konerko doubled and scored
an out later on Lee's 19th home run for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Ortiz doubled to lead off the Royals' fourth and scored
on Carlos Febles' triple to tie the game at 2. Damon then singled
for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the fourth, Lee reached on an infield single,
stole second, advanced to third on Ortiz's throwing error and
scored on Suzuki's wild pitch to tie it at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Febles and Damon each singled in the sixth off Bill Simas. After
Rey Sanchez's sacrifice, Mike Sweeney singled and Jermaine Dye hit
a sacrifice fly to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Damon had a run-scoring groundout with the bases loaded in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrle, making his second major league start in place of the
injured Cal Eldred, gave up three runs on nine hits and three walks
in five innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals are 5-2 in games Febles started since his return
from the DL. ... Lee hit 16 homers in 127 games last season. ...
The White Sox and Royals rank second and fourth in the AL in
batting. ... Eldred, 10-2 in 19 starts, is sidelined indefinitely
because of an irritated nerve in his right elbow. He was placed on
the 15-day disabled list July 17.

<HEADLINE> Militant Group To Talk With India  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A pro-Pakistan militant group in Kashmir
on Monday declared a cease-fire for three months, saying it was
ready to hold peace talks with the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Majid Dar, chief commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen group,
gave the Indian government one week to end what he called the
crackdown on Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is no positive response from the Indian government,
we will resume fighting the Indian forces,'' Dar told reporters in
Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, the Indian government welcomed the militant
outfit's decision. ''Any move which points toward peace is welcome.
The government, however, will be watching the situation closely and
make its assessment later,'' said Swagat Ghosh, the home ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Dar's unilateral cease-fire announcement came as a surprise
since the Hizbul Mujahideen group has been in the forefront of
fighting the Indian security forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir
since the outbreak of insurgency in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen groups are fighting the secessionist war in
Kashmir, most seeking independence or union with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other insurgency group, the Ul-Umar Mujahideen,
indicated reservations about the initiative, saying it will not
allow any one to nullify the sacrifices made by the Kashmiri people
fighting for an independent Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, New Delhi has offered to hold talks with the
militants in Kashmir within the framework of the Indian
Constitution, implying that it would not accept any demand for
secession from India.
</P>
<P>
   Dar said the Indian government should lift its ban on the
assembly of more than five people in Kashmir and give people
freedom to express their views openly.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of training and army militants in
Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over control of Kashmir
since they won independence from Britain in 1947. India governs
two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the remaining one-third. Both
claim Kashmir in its entirety.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush, Gore Race Remains Close  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race between George W. Bush
and Al Gore remains close in the days before the Republican
National Convention, says a new poll, though Bush holds persistent
underlying advantages on voters' perception of several key personal
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters saw Bush, the Republican governor of Texas,
as unlikely to keep the budget balanced while cutting income taxes;
more thought Vice President Gore had a better knowledge of world
affairs, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush is maintaining a lead on internal measures on many issues
and personal qualities and is in a strong position,'' said ABC
pollster Gary Langer. ''But now is when voters really start paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had 48 percent to 45 percent for Democrat Gore in the
ABC-Post poll, not a significant change from the 49-45 edge Bush
had in June. A four-way matchup also showed little change from
June, with Bush at 44 percent, Gore at 39 percent, Ralph Nader at 7
percent and Pat Buchanan at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll out Monday night, from CBS and The New York Times,
gave Bush 46 percent to 40 percent for Gore, compared with 43
percent for Bush and 41 percent for Gore earlier this month. Bush
also had a slim lead in that poll's 4-way matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls, the CBS-Times survey of 953 adults and the ABC-Post
poll of 1,228 adults, were taken Friday through Sunday and had
error margins of 3 percentage points, slightly higher for
registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   On personal qualities, Bush held a double-digit lead in five
areas -- personality, leadership, trustworthiness, speaking his mind
and bringing change to Washington, according to the ABC-Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led on the issues of holding taxes down, handling the
national economy, handling the budget surplus and handling crime.
Gore led on health care, protecting the environment and addressing
women's issues. They were about even on education, Social Security
and handling the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS-Times poll found that health care was at the top of
campaign issues and Gore had an advantage on that issue as well as
protecting the environment and appointing justices to keep abortion
legal. Bush had the edge on reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in that poll saw Bush more favorably, 44 percent to 26
percent unfavorable, than Gore, 36 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls found Bush with an advantage on leadership qualities
and trust, while Gore had the advantage on caring about people like
them.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Langer noted that the nation's ambivalence over continuing
the direction set by the Clinton administration or changing could
help keep the race close.
</P>
<P>
   In both surveys, those polled were about evenly split on whether
the president should take the country in a new direction or keep it
moving along the path President Clinton has been taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Langer said one issue where Bush has a liability is the public
perception of his attitudes about the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans were twice as likely to think Bush was inclined to
favor the wealthy,'' he said. ''It was not as bad as it was for his
father (former President Bush), but it is a point of
vulnerability.''

<HEADLINE> Astros 7, Reds 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Larkin got another ovation Monday night
for his contract extension, but the fans were booing at the end as
the Houston Astros rallied against All-Star closer Danny Graves for
a 7-5, 10-inning victory over the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got their first three-game winning streak of the
season by taking advantage of an off-night by Graves (9-2), who
blew a 5-4 lead in the ninth and then lost it in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman tied it with a bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the
ninth, giving Graves only his second blown save of the season. The
Astros then put it away in the 10th on RBI singles by Glen Barker
and Bill Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel (2-5), the fifth Astros pitcher, got the victory
with two hitless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Able to relax for the first time in a topsy-turvy week, Larkin
basked in a half-minute standing ovation before his first at-bat --
he stepped out and waved to the crowd of 28,741.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin rejected a trade to the Mets on Sunday and then got a
three-year, $27 million extension from owner Carl Lindner. Two
banners said, ''Thank You Uncle Carl.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old shortstop emerged from a 3-for-17 slump, going
2-for-5. He scored from first on Ken Griffey's bases-loaded triple
that put the Reds ahead 5-2 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mieske's pinch-hit single off reliever Dennys Reyes cut it
to 5-4 in the sixth and started Houston's comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio had a solo homer, a double and a single off Reds
starter Pete Harnisch. Richard Hidalgo also hit a solo homer, his
29th, in the fourth inning as Houston went up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey tied it with a two-run double in the fourth off Chris
Holt, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin singled to load the bases in the fifth and Griffey put
the Reds up 5-2 with his second triple of the season, a slicing
liner to left-center that Hidalgo appeared to lose in the lights.
The center fielder closed in on the ball, then turned his head away
at the last second.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin was only a stride behind Chris Stynes, who held up at
second base initially, as they rounded third and crossed the plate
in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch twisted his ankle running the bases in the fifth and
came out of the game with the bases loaded in the sixth. Reyes
relieved and gave up Mieske's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astros reliever Wayne Franklin made his major league debut
in the seventh, facing Griffey with the bases empty. Franklin
covered first for the putout on Griffey's grounder to the right
side. ... Dmitri Young doubled in his first at-bat, extending his
hitting streak to 11 games. ... Dante Bichette was 0-for-4, ending
his hitting streak at a season-high 17 games. ... The Reds had
converted their last nine save chances since Scott Williamson blew
one on June 21 at Colorado. Graves is 17-for-19 in save situations.

<HEADLINE> Virginia-based BWX Technologies ousts Mason &AMP; Hanger Corp. at Texas nuclear weapons plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMARILLO, Texas (AP) - The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded
BWX Technologies Inc. a five-year contract to run the Pantex
nuclear plant, ousting Mason &AMP; Hanger Corp., which has managed the
weapons assembly and disassembly operation for more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mason &AMP; Hanger's parent company told the
Amarillo Globe-News in a story for Tuesday's editions that Energy
Department officials informed company officials of the switch
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department was expected to make the announcement on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we were very disappointed that the Department of
Energy didn't select Day &AMP; Zimmermann. We're very proud of our work
and our achievements at Pantex,'' said David Fridling of Day &AMP;
Zimmermann Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Lynchburg, Va.-based BWX could not immediately be
reached for comment by The Associated Press Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mason &AMP; Hanger has held the Pantex contract since 1956, when it
took over weapons work from Procter &AMP; Gamble. The contract ends
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department also turned down bids by Lockheed-Martin
and EG&AMP;G Inc.
</P>
<P>
   BWX Technologies supplies nuclear fuel and reactor components to
the U.S. Navy and has contracts for Energy Department operations at
the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The company collaborated with Morris Township, N.J.-based
aerospace firm Honeywell Inc. and Frederick, M.D.-based Bechtel
National Inc., which has operations at more than 12 major Energy
Department facilities and labs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pantex is the nation's primary nuclear weapons disassembly site
and serves as the interim storage site for more than 8,000 pits
from dismantled warheads.

<HEADLINE> Tractor trailer rollover in Buffalo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A tractor trailer carrying 27,000 pounds of
grease rolled over in Buffalo Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews say the truck driver couldn't maneuver a windy exit
ramp and ended up flipping the rig over, spilling pools of
Lithium-bearing grease on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The driver escaped the wreck unharmed and was found hunched over
the wall of the overpass.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency Medical Technician Rob Zimmerman was on his way to
work when he and another driver stopped to help the crash victim.
He said the truck was teetering on the bridge's edge when they
brought the victim to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were able to right the truck.
</P>
<P>
   The roads were blocked while cleanup crews worked, causing hours
of delays.

<HEADLINE> Cops Arrest 80 in Minn. Protest  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK HOWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Police skirmished with protesters Monday near
a downtown hotel where an international conference of scientists
had convened to discuss the latest advances in animal genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty people were arrested, Police Chief Robert Olson said. One
police officer suffered a minor injury; no major injuries were
reported among protesters, though dozens were sprayed with pepper
spray and others were struck with police batons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to be as gentle as we could,'' Olson said. ''They
want to shut down our city. We were not going to let them do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishes were the first significant disruption since the
International Society for Animal Genetics conference opened Friday
under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said Monday night that canisters left by activists
at a McDonald's restaurant and at least one other location
contained traces of cyanide. FBI tests revealed the presence of the
poison, which is lethal when inhaled or digested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't wanna be starting any panic thing, but this is clearly
ratcheted up, at least on the side of the protests. And this is
clearly connected to that,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police, determined to avoid violence on the scale of the WTO
protests in Seattle last year, erected concrete barriers and steel
fencing around the hotel, where about 650 scientists are meeting
through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's scuffles broke out after more than 200 protesters had
gathered in a downtown park. About 1 p.m., a group of about 25
tested a line of about 12 officers in riot gear about three blocks
from the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   When the protesters tried to break through, they and at least
two news photographers were wrestled to the ground by police.
</P>
<P>
   A gas canister apparently containing a chemical irritant was
deployed by protesters, who also threw rocks at officers, said
Roseann Campagnoli, a spokeswoman for the Hennepin County Sheriff's
Department and Deputy Police Chief G.S. Hestness.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired what Hestness described as rubber batons --
beanbag-like projectiles -- into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, protesters did break through a police line into a
second park, which has served as a staging area for demonstrators
since the meeting opening Friday evening. Officers fired pepper
spray into the crowd, Campagnoli said.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, she said, activities had ''cooled down
considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   ISAG is one of the world's most prominent groups that shares
information on the gene mapping of livestock and companion animals,
used to enhance their health and resistance to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say genetic engineering threatens biodiversity and
could pollute delicate ecosystems, or create a society in which
corporations and the government control what kinds of animals and
humans are born.

<HEADLINE> Schulters Arrives at 49ers Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) -- Safety Lance Schulters showed up at the
San Francisco 49ers' training camp Monday after missing the first
six days and amassing $30,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Schulters, a Pro Bowl starter last season, blamed his absence on
''bad timing and miscommunication'' -- and a change of agents.
</P>
<P>
   He fired agent Alan Herman and hired Steve Weinberg last week.
There is a league-mandated transition time of several days in
switching agents, and the 49ers said they wouldn't negotiate with
anyone until Schulters came to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wasn't holding out,'' Schulters said. ''I was waiting
for them to talk to my agent. I couldn't officially hire him until
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulters is in the final year of a three-year contract that
will pay him the league minimum, $358,000, and he wanted Herman to
work on an extension. But Schulters is due to be a restricted free
agent after the season, which means the 49ers can match any other
team's offer and get compensation if he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't getting too much feedback from my other agent,''
Schulters said. ''I switched agents and was looking for a call back
from (49ers vice president) John McVay. I was waiting to talk to
him before I came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulters, a fourth-round pick out of Hofstra in 1998, replaced
Merton Hanks last season at free safety and tied for third in the
NFC with six interceptions. He will switch to strong safety this
year to replace Tim McDonald, who was waived and then retired.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lance is a big, strong, powerful guy and we're really glad to
have him back,'' general manager Bill Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have also agreed to a contract with first-round pick
Julian Peterson. Walsh said the Michigan State linebacker could be
in camp Wednesday.
